The second agenda item, which is a district needs statement- I see we have most all of our speakers here today, the it's going to be divided into two parts. The first part will be about education and I guess the child care issues and that the speaker will be allen van cappell and he's the ceo and president of the educational alliance, then the second and then we'll have questions and answers, and then the second part will be all about the health needs in our community and today we have three speakers. So it's perry, pong who's, the chief medical officer of the chelsea wing, community health center, there's les chong who's a physician at gouverneer hospital, and then then we have two people from batons: health clinic health center, so that is daniel, ramirez and julia chin. Thank you. So we'll start off first with alan he'll, give his presentation and then we'll have discussion and questions and answers on what he is talking about. Alan hi, thank you and it's nice to see so many of you here and thank you may for inviting me to come and speak, I'm actually coming and speaking from one of our early childhood classrooms in our district. Today, educational alliance is one of the longest early childhood providers in our neighborhood we're one of the first to offer kindergarten in the city of new york. We were among the first pilots of head start ever in the country in the 1960s. The first early head start pilot in the 1990s during the clinton administration, and it is something that we have taken enormous pride in. We offer our early childhood sites across our community, both in community based sites and also at educational alliance. This is flagship building the manny canner center at 197 east broadway. Over the last several years, we have noticed specific changes to run programs early to run head start programs in the community-based sites, and that has led us, as many of you know, to make the decision back in the spring to close our community-based head start program sites. Those community-based sites serve 212, kids and I can run through with you how we are working to place all of those kids in programs, but I want to talk just briefly about our decision making going into it, because I think each one of them are sort of systemic issues that many of our community-based organizations are dealing with, and they may have to think through very similar decision points, as we thought about earlier this year. The first reason: the first big issue that week that led to us making this decision was the fact that early childhood has just changed in new york. I've been at educational alliance for six and a half years. The city was never a direct competitor to early to head start community-based organization programs, and what we notice now is that there is an abundance of these seats in our district, which is why so many of our programs have under enrollment, including educational alliance at the community-based site. But the three specific issues are one or about facilities. We operate our community-based sites in nycha buildings and in new york city public schools in new york city. Public schools are no longer going to allow new head start programs to start operating ps 188. We we struck a deal with ps, 188 and the principal swanny ramos in this past year to open up several classrooms at ps, 188 on houston and fdr drive, and the city said: we're no longer allowing people to open up new classrooms in public schools, and we said why, and they said, because you are now a direct competitor to the city's head start program and as we expand our head start footprint, we're going to use those spaces in public schools. So we're going to put out a competitive rfp in order for community-based programs to get into those sites and by the way, we're never putting out a competitive rfp and so you're not going back into those schools. You're, not you cannot go into a new school, so that makes it very hard for programs like ours to expand when we operate in nycha buildings and we can't get nycha to basically fix the sites that we're currently operating in, and I know that this is a problem that many community-based organizations are facing, but I just want to give you a window of what that means. For us. We operate a program at 18 avenue, d and 34 avenue d. We love avenue d. We love the people who live there. We are the organization that built a brand new community center for recovery and wellness on avenue d. In the last several years, at the height of the opioid epidemic, we run a food pantry. Out of that program, we run a high school for kids. Who've been kicked out of school out of that program. We run parenting classes out of that program, veterans classes, we love avenue d. We operate more programs in after school for more than two thousand kids living in that neighborhood, but we also love our head start programs, but at lillian walled specifically, we have dealt with mosquito infestations which have rendered us to close the sites until they're repaired by nature rodents, an abundance right, cockroaches, rats, nests needles that we have all tried to fix and we've done it at our own expense, but mostly sewage and raw sewage dripping from the ceilings into the classrooms and the alliance. Even though it's not legal to do, it has made repairs in nycha facilities, even though we have to legally wait for niger to do it, and we have spent thousands and thousands and thousands of our own dollars on exterminators repairs to try to get that site to look wonderful. But we can't keep it that way if water keeps running down on us and we can't move out of that site into a new site into a public school. If the city doesn't allow us to go into public schools without an rfp process now, so the facilities is becoming a large issue for us or became a very large and substantial issue for us. The second issue is that fewer people today are qualifying for head start programming head start: has a 24 000 a year threshold in order to make it for a family in order to make it into head start. We did the right thing in new york, we increased the minimum wage to 15 an hour, but what that did was it knocked people above the head start threshold of 24 000 a year, so there are families that are still working poor, who should be in the head start program, but they make more than the 24 000 that would qualify for them to to enter into that program. The other issue in regard to that is that we're allowed to accept 10 of our students above the economic threshold, but we fill those seats up in a second and really. What we need is advocacy on the federal level to increase the head start: income eligibility right to 30, 000 or 35 000 for families who still need it in new york and should qualify that'll get people in there. The second another issue that we're having is around pay parity. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find early childhood teachers and supervisors, as the city gets into that space. The city now has upk classrooms challenging our four-year-old program. They also have they're also going to bring 3k for all they're looking for those teachers, they're looking for those supervisors and they pay anywhere between 20 to thirty five thousand dollars more than head start pays us to pay those same individuals. So it's not surprising to us that a teacher we hire who can get an offer from the city leaves us immediately or henry street or grants or any other community-based organization in order to get that job. So for us, the confluence of poor facilities in space and by the way when we operate in the public schools, they give us the worst possible classrooms in their schools right and it's not entirely clear. In a time of covid, whether or not those schools are going to reclaim those classrooms as they seek more space to operate, so facilities was an issue trying to find qualified teachers and keep them, because the city is paying way more and is out bidding us for those teachers and fewer people qualifying financially for a head start rendered us to make the decision to get out of the community-based site. So we are give. We have two head start contracts, we're relinquishing one of our head start contracts. We will continue to operate head start at the manny canner center. We have 212 students who we serve in the community-based programs. 160 of those students are three-year-olds, who will now be eligible for city upk program. 20 of those kids are four-year-olds, who will now be going into kindergarten at new york, city, public schools, and there are 32 two-year-olds, all of whom have been offered a seat at the manny canner center this september, and with the exception of six families, all of them have accepted their seats at the manny canner center, with the exception of six families. We are working with head start, who are bringing in an interim organization, called cdi that they work with nationally to come in and try to run our community-based programs. But we've made it clear to cdi that we're not sure that they will be able to operate programs in the elementary schools, and they certainly could not walk into lillian wald, 34, avenue, d or 18th avenue d today and begin operating programs, because the facility suffered so much flooding during covid from leaky apartments up above and nycha has refused to fix it until covet is over. They are not putting a priority on fixing those classrooms until kovit is over and we have worked with lots of people within the nycha program, but we're not able to get those sites running so today. I was really pleased when susan spoke to me about coming today about talking about the issues around prevailing wage and lifting the cap on head start programming, trying to fight for teacher parity, so that community-based organizations are given the money they need by government agencies to compete with the city and hire the qualified teachers and supervisors that we need to run these programs and to also demand that knight should do what they're supposed to do for all of their tenants, whether or not their residential tenants or community-based organizations trying to serve their residents, which is to provide us with the same level of maintenance or quality that we would expect of any landlord in this building. We simply cannot continue anymore to to protest private landlords and demand that they give us good service when we're not demanding the same from nycha, and I think it would be an important statement for this community board to make on those three issues and I'm happy to answer any questions that any of you may have, and I thank you again for giving me the time this evening. Okay, okay, thank you. Alan! Do we have any questions? Please raise your hand. Susan. Are you raising your hand? Oh she's, on you're on mute, susan? I I wasn't. I was waiting for other people to go first, you know after after I thought alan described the issues so extremely well, but it made me so extremely sad. You know I I think I think those are essential for our district needs statement, as several of us has talked about before these go across other areas. We've heard certainly the facilities problem with senior centers in night shift. I know you probably better, no better, remember better than me, but I know we've talked about pay parity. The committee has taken positions on pay parity in the past, so you know I. I don't really have any specific questions, but I would like to be able to follow up with alan to get some documentation so that when we write our our needs that we're able to document some of this be delighted to work with the with the committee in any way to document this yeah, I think the the nycha I mean all the other cbo's have the same complaints about the niger facilities, whether it's the senior centers or the youth programs. So I think we always need to. Oh you mentioned something on the federal level about upping the income requirements for admission into the the child. What was it the the early childhood program, the head start program, the head start right: yes, is there like a some kind of like an action or petitioning that's going on or like a change? There isn't right now may, but I really think that we should sort of spearhead an effort to increase the wage, particularly if we get a favorable congress and a favorable administration fingers crossed. It would be a great opportunity to get hh to get hhs to give head start. What they need, which is increasing. The wage cities across the country have increased their minimum wage to a living wage. If or go close to it. You know by doing 15 an hour and but that really does have these negative consequences for so many families, particularly in our community, where people live on the margins, and we know that even with fifteen dollars an hour, people are struggling every single day and they can benefit from these programs. So if we raise that to thirty five thousand dollars a year, that at least would make a lot of families eligible for our programs, and maybe we wouldn't be suffering under enrollment for years, which is what we've been suffering okay, so it looks like for now we'll follow up with the nycha facilities and oh one more thing: is there a a lot, a net, a loss of child? I mean there's always seems like a lot of shuffling around in terms of the child care seats. So is there a loss or is it the same amount? Or is it just being shuffled around yeah? It's a great it's a great question and there is not, and we will our community will not lose those seats that we're relinquishing head start will put out for bid to another community organization, those 212 seats, so those seats will stay in our neighborhood, but but I just want us to think about. I try to shop those seats and contracts around to other community based organizations and for the same reason why we're getting out of those programs. Other organizations didn't want to take it on, and I would be nervous about anybody wanting to take on those programs that didn't have a way to address those facilities, issues, the pay parity issue and the issue around under enrollment and just one more thing. We gave it a very good try. For the last three years we have pumped one million private dollars each year into that particular program to try to fix those sites and whatnot- and I understand, look people think it's a big organization, I'm the one who has to raise that million dollars every year. I know how hard it is to raise that million dollars we have tried, but even with that extra million dollars a year into those sites, we were not able to do what we needed to do in order to turn them around, and so, unless there is real systemic change, I think whoever takes over those seats are going to suffer the same issues as we're suffering. So you're saying those contracts are not for spaces in doe, where you'd get better facilities. Look, I think I think some of the doe sites are going in the school in the schools. I think some a new organization could not go in right now and say I want to start offering sites at ps 188, for example, because they would only be able to go in there if the city put out an rfp for those classrooms and given what's happening now with covid space is at a premium, and it's hard to imagine that that the doe is ever going to allow organizations to take over their classrooms. Okay. So if I could follow up on that, I you said the city is trying to get other non-profits to take over some of your seats. Head start head start one, but I'm sure that you've already spoken to all of I can say our nonprofits, our local ones and they're, not taking it. So it's gonna. If someone does take that it's gonna be someone from outside the community who may not know the situation and has no history here. It just sounds very concerning to me potentially, but I mean I mean susan potentially that that may be what ends up happening, but but again it's hard for me to imagine where they'll be able to offer those sites, they can't go into lillian wald right now and they're gonna face the same facilities, issues that we have and they couldn't go into the public schools. So the question then becomes: maybe they get operate in a public site when we were trying to solve the facilities issue in january before covid, which still wouldn't have ameliorated the the under enrollment because of income eligibility? I went with cushman and wakefield and walked our district twice, trying to identify potential commercial space for us to be offering those programs and it didn't exist if that's going to be different now, because there's going to be so many more empty spaces, potentially potentially okay, so we need to follow up any other, any other questions seeing none. We can move on to the next item on health. So thank you, alan thank you. Thank you. You're you're welcome, you're free to go you're welcome to stay, but you know with my kids. Thank you. Okay, all right! Thank you! Okay, wonderful! So our next section is about health needs. We have three speakers. Well, three groups gouverniere charles b wang community health center and a beethoven's health clinic you so the three of you will speak one right after the other. You know for about 10 minutes each and then, after all, that we will take questions and answers and discussion about what you've talked about. Do we have a volunteer who would like to go? First, I want to call on you if you don't I'll, be happy to go first. If nobody else wants to okay, julia yeah, you have a you, have a slideshow right. Yeah, you show us okay, so julia and and danny are with the betanclus health center. Do you have my slides or yeah? We have your slides. Did you want to show them yourself? I think larissa. You gave her co-host privilege right yeah. Oh, let's see, I'm I'm not sure how to do that. Yeah. You have co-host privileges. If you want to share your screen or I can scare myself sounds like she preferred, it sounds like she can put it up. Okay, so let me make sure I'm going to share my screen. Just let me know julie. If this is the correct one, there were two sure slideshows and I just want to make sure I'm sharing the right one bear with me just for a moment- and I did I just wanted to start by thanking eric and may for inviting us to this meeting, and I am joined here, as may mentioned, with one of my leadership staff, danny ramirez. So thank you again for having us to this important district needs statement. Great okay, so is this the correct presentation? Yes, yeah: okay, great, that's, okay, okay, sorry screen sharing yeah one is a pdf and the other one is a. Is the powerpoint? It's whatever you like to show larissa sorry, my screen share stopped. Let's see if we can get it back up. Okay, nope, there's a problem: there something's wrong! There, you go, I'm getting okay, all right! Good! You have to make it big though yeah I gotta go to go to the slide view hold on a second there. You go okay, good, got it! Okay! Great! Thank you. So much sure. Just let me know when to switch to the next slide, all right, so just going to the next slide. We've basically just wanted to share a little about what batons this is, and the tonsils health center was named after ramon and material batons. Next slide, he was actually a physician in puerto rico and was really dubbed the george washington of puerto rico, because his mission was to to help liberate the island under the spanish rule and our founders of the tanzas health center. Paul ramos thought that dr batan's exemplified the values of our health center next slide, so the times mission is to provide affordable, comprehensive and culturally responsive community health care to all the residents of the lower east side and our recently established bushwick brooklyn health center. So our values really is that health care is a human right and people have that right and, in addition, should be empowered to direct their own care next slide. We are happy to say that we are celebrating our 50th anniversary this year, 2020 and unfortunately, covet prevented us from having our big gala, but we plan to do one next year, so batonsis has three sites. Two of them are on the lower east side. Our flagship is at 280 henry street and we have a site which we had acquired from henry street settlement, which is at 40 montgomery street. It used to be called hull, and now we call it batanzas health center at henry street settlement, and as mentioned, we have a site- that's opened two years in bushwick brooklyn, so the majority of our patients are 95 percent minority with over 60 percent. Of that being hispanic latino last year we served close to 5400 patients, making up close to 29 000 visits and again you'll see all the services we offer of node. In particular, we have hiv services over 400 hiv patients, in addition to providing on-site oral health and on-site behavioral health, which is a nice combination to be able to be doing one-stop shopping and our podiatry program is done with acupuncture, so I'm so proud to say that we try to strive to have east meet the west whenever possible at our health center next slide. So that's just a picture of one of our health affairs that we have in front of 280 henry street next slide so batons is it feels that the top four priorities are really behavioral health, chronic care management, addressing the health disparities through something which many of you may have heard: social determinants of health and really managing our new normal, which is telehealth. So next slide. Behavioral health- and I know this- has been something that has been espoused in your district needs statement. We all know that behavioral health is essential to to our well-being and that's how we kill our batons. A good portion of hospitalizations and re-emits are due to behavioral health conditions. We also know that there is a huge growing issue with substance use disorder and that mental health stigma is still live and, and unfortunately, with us- and I know being chinese myself- you know saving faces. One thing that still plagues the asian community and it's often hard to have the asian population go and seek help next slide. So we have a commitment to behavioral health and we see behavioral health as not that something is wrong with you, but that, but that it's part of your overall care, so covet 19 pandemic has added undue stress, fear and anxiety, even for the average normal person. So the center for cdc has mentioned. People who are at the highest risk for for severe illness from covet are the elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions next slide. So what we have found often is with the children and teens the health care providers and first responders, as as we have and many of our patients present with existing mental health problems and, as alan had mentioned earlier, we have many patients who live in the nycha buildings and are part of the north environment and those socially isolated. Patients are the ones who are at the most risk and, of course, people of color many of our racial and ethnic groups that the tanza serves are the ones that have a high risk and have mental health problems next slide. So what do we think that needs to get done? We must collectively engage and educate. Can you go back to the earlier one? Yes that one thank you, so we really have to do a better job at educating and raising awareness that mental health is also just part of our total well-being. So apptonsis, you know when we schedule someone for a physical, that physical includes a mental health assessment. So what what do we do as well? We screen specifically for depression for substance, use and alcohol abuse. We provide the short-term counseling and referral for specialized treatment, and what cova pandemic has done for us was to have the ability to do telehealth services, both telephonic and telehealth, which would include the video visits next slide. So the number two priority that we feel is care coordination and management, so the majority of our population have multiple chronicities and the top number one illness which you have identified as well is diabetes with particularly high blood pressure. I would say: 80 percent of our diabetics also have high blood pressure and that's only one of a multiple multitude of chronicities, those chronic conditions place, patients at significantly higher risk of death and other functional declines. We think care for nation and management really is the means to help us create better health and that's to provide ongoing support to patients so that they can keep engaged in their care and to empower them to be part of their own care. So that means having care coordinators, patient navigators, social workers help them with scheduling their their appointments, identifying all the services and screenings that they need, and that includes cancer screenings. You know routine blood work for chronic disease management and providing an annual dental and behavioral health checkup next slide. So that brings us to this third priority, which is addressing health disparities. We know that health indicators, such as expectancy and infamous mortality, have improved for americans. Yet what has gone, not only not improved but has worsened, is the people of color's experience with the disproportionate burden of those preventable diseases, so health disparities. One definition is that the differences in health outcomes between socially disadvantaged and advantaged groups and health equity is what we believe in, and that is that everybody has the opportunity to be as healthy as possible. So at batons we live and see these health disparities. All the time and the social determinants of health have historically prevented people of color from having those equal opportunities for financial, physical and emotional health and covet 19 brought this so much more to the forefront, because what we have found is that the majority of those who are getting covet 19 are the black, the indigenous, the latino and other people of color next slide. So what we think is needed. We need to advance health equity, we need the communities and all the cbo's and all of us to work together across the sectors. We have to seek sustainable money, to promote these community programs and to address the social determinants of health. These are all things such as housing, transportation, language barriers that are impacting people's ability to get health care and the one big thing is educate, educate and educate. I always say what you don't know you don't know, and many of our residents and many of our patients really don't understand health disparities. They don't understand the importance of screenings and and just having preventative care. So we have to help out community members to raise this awareness and we have to continue to engage our our constituents and those that are in power, the policy makers and the large charities and foundations and the media to listen more and come into our trenches and to really see what's going on. I know that hospitals often get the limelight and particularly during the covet 19, but I can assure you we have over 1400 federally qualified health centers, and we have made a tremendous amount of impact in terms of trying to address the covenanting and keeping our patients out of the hospitals and that's the kind of thing that we really need to have an awareness of next slide. So our last priority that we feel is how to really address the new normal and that's the telehealth. The tonsils went into crisis on march 16th when the pandemic was declared. We implemented telehealth in two weeks, which is something that generally would take six to nine months. So now, telehealth is really a modality. That's part of our new normal next slide. What we think have been the major advantages of having tele health access to care is no longer restricted at, and some of the social determinants of health that have been various are no longer barriers, such as transportation and communication and language. We often have tele helpers. I call them that are on the call with our providers to talk with the patients so that we can eliminate many of the fears and and the barriers that have been there in the past. Our health care hours can be more flexible and we're not restricted to certain extended hours of the day or evening. It also frees up space now that we can potentially utilize for other community type functions, and I, I am very happy to say, behavioral health service is a champion for us in terms of the telehealth modality next slide. So the challenges we see for telehealth really is access to internet and wi-fi our patients want to be seen in a virtual environment, but we were just as surprised to know that many of them do not have the capability in terms of the technology to do so, we still need to have face-to-face visits for the chronically ill and we don't want all our patients to become telehealth patients and the biggest challenge for health. Centers really is the reimbursement, because tele health and telephonic services were allowed to be reimbursed at our enhanced rates. Only during this public health emergency, we don't know what's going to happen after that, extended emergency expires and again, as I mentioned care coordination, what I call the glue to keeping patients engaged is not a reimbursable service next slide. So in summary, our four priorities- behavioral health making sure to inter integrate emotional well-being into primary care, two chronic care management trying to sustain our good health requires ongoing engagement with our patients next slide. Third, we need to address those health disparities through social health determinants and focus primarily on the people of color and improving the health outcomes for minorities and fourth, we need to really now manage the new normal and telehealth is here to stay for all of us in health care, and we need to continue to educate, raise awareness and find ways to sustain this next slide. Really. The last two slides are just to show you this little. What our health center looks like and we encourage everyone you do have the powerpoint. The last slide is to really join us and we have our scan there that we wanted just to share the last line so follow us on social media, and I wanted to thank you again for the opportunity to present okay. Thank you, julia okay. We will take our next presentation perry, dr perry pong. Would you like to speak next? Lizzy sure I'd be happy to yeah, so you want me to okay, I emailed the letter out that you sent to the members. Do you want it to be shown or can does everyone just want to read it on their own, or what do you want to do? Are you just gonna talk I'll talk, but you can show it too. That's fine! You can follow along I'll. Be brief because I think julia who I really respect, has really outlined what community health centers are and federally qualified health centers is our rubric and that's what we are disney as a federal government. So thank you for inviting me and I'm happy to represent the charles b wong community health center and, if you remember before we were called the chinatown health clinic and we're also are nearing our 50th anniversary. So we serve both the chinatown and lower east side communities. We also have sites in chinatown and flushing, okay, so okay, okay and oh, can you make that bigger? If, if it's the whole screen, then I need it bigger? Ah, that's it wow, okay or let me can I get out of the whole screen. Oh oh you're, having problems? Okay, I don't have to share this. You can just talk okay. Maybe then we can go back to it, yeah, okay! So we we have served over 60 000 patients per year and 90 are asian americans, so we're significant provider to asian americans and for federally qualified health centers community health centers for new york state. We serve over 40 of all asian american patients who go to community health. Centers 83 of our patients are best served in a language other than english and 84 percent are at or below the 200 percent poverty level. So we have approximately 10 000 of the 60 000 patients residing in manhattan and we're also significant community employer. So, prior to the covey 19 pandemic, we had over 640 employees, including full and part-time staff. I think we also pride ourselves that we're a training center for students who want to come by medical students. We also have people who are interning to fulfill the requirements as nurse practitioners or social workers, and so we also see our health center as a community function to build up future leaders build up future health careers, empower staff to rise up in their status and get higher level jobs. So a couple of a couple things I want to raise so thanks for scrolling down okay, so number one is just the keep scrolling help me kovid's effect on social supports. So this is I'm already preaching to the to the choir here. So you guys well know the effects that covey have just compounded all the inequities that julia and alan have talked about housing, nycha's, big housing in in the area crowding safe transportation. Can people get to work? Many of our many of our patients are service workers if they still have their job. Child care was talked about. Elder care, who's, taking care of the seniors education is has talked about recreation. Where can people go? Can they go out which leads to social isolation, so not just seniors who are afraid to go out, but I'm talking to some of our staff and the pediatricians say that parents and grandparents are even afraid to let their children out because of fears of contracting virus. So on one hand, these fears have decreased the rate of covet infections as increased isolation. Health insurance benefits will more people lose their benefits, lose their health insurance, I'm healthset, community health, centers, health and hospitals. Take anybody insurance, no insurance status, immigration status, no status, you know, we don't ask, and we don't tell- and we take anybody. We are part of the safety net. All those things are going to have detrimental effects on the community and our residents I'll, throw in some things about pediatricians, because les is also an internist internal medicine, as I am, and what our pediatricians are saying are that you know they're. Seeing that children are being left behind because of this socially educationally emotional development, you know parents may be there, may not be there they're having a hard time as well. They're under stress, are they employed? Are they at risk of losing employment? So at early ages, are the kids getting what they need? Are they getting into head start? Are child is child care? Open is pre-k going to be open. This is really compounded for our patients, who have special needs, such as autism as key services have been disrupted. So we have a developmental pediatrician at our site. She sees many patients need extra services and they know that these services are much harder to develop or to deliver via telehealth children do not cannot engage as well. So that's going to be very difficult going forward. All additional resources that needed for special populations are at risk and you know, is they needed even more at this time, so that leads to number two mental health which julie also mentions. You know we're gonna. Everyone's gonna need increased mental health services in the coming year to cope with all the stresses and disruption, as the kova 19 crisis continues, these stresses will only magnify and get larger and even as the economy recovers or fails to recover for the community and for the patients at highest risk. It's going to get even worse. Mental health providers are already in short supply we're grateful for the settlement, houses, the community health centers for health and hospitals, but that's not even enough. That's not even enough in normal times. So how is it going to be enough in times like this? So you know a plea to continue support. You know from the city level, the state level, the federal level for all our service agencies, health, centers settlement houses, everyone's provide who's, providing services. You know you don't have to be in direct health to provide services. All those services affect people's health, so education housing. That's all! That's all what julia talks about social determinants of health next maintaining community institutions, so everyone's going to have to have needs. You know I'm selfish as a health center. We have needs too. We are too large to get paycheck protection money. We've had to furlough over 200 of our own staff, and these are people who are not the high priced people. These are people who you know need to feed their families as well. So we are have been in the red for the last six months, but it's significant at its init significant pace, we're not able to sustain those losses. We did get some money from the federal government, but we and we did our own fundraiser, but there's significant losses that we cannot sustain. I'm sure every institution is is facing that and you know our communities. Lower east side needs these safety net institutions, health, education, arts, everything because that's life of the community last a plea to maintain the programs that existed prior to covet, for example, I'll, give you some from our own health center. We have a smoking cessation program, asians, have the males have the highest rate of smoking in the city? The city council has funded these some of these services before we have a family planning program since title 10, I will I won't use these choice words, but it no longer exists in new york state. Now new york state has has stepped in to provide funds to for those services, but in the state budget, how? How can they can sustain that? What will happen? New york state also supplies new york city supplies, money for cancer, skiing programs for pa for people, patients who do not have insurance, so they can get free screenings, such as mammograms, pap smears, colonoscopies stool tests for blood preventive services. So that's another lobby to maintain those services to maintain people's health. It's hard enough as it is already so. You know we really need to continue to address health inequities and do what we can to support the institutions that exist, so they can remain. You know part of the safety net. So thank you for inviting me and I'll. Let les take over less hi sure. So thank you to you guys for having me. So I I I'm here because I know perry. I do an advisory role that I have with his health center, but he asked me kind of also to speak also as as somebody who is my main job as a adult medicine primary care provider. So I work at gouverneur which actually is not a hospital. It's also kind of a community health center, but under the umbrella of the new york city held in hospitals corporations. So I'm certainly not speaking on behalf of that of new york city held in hospitals, but I'm speaking, chime in with a couple observations that I've had as a direct patient provider. So I most of my population is chinese, but also certainly have a lot of latinx caucasian patients as well, and so I think you know in terms of actual direct covet infection, there's been a wide variety, I think, especially with the asian population. A lot of my patients seem to have isolated very early, and so we're spared actual infection, other populations not as lucky, but I think what happened with kovid, especially in our population, was even if you weren't infected. What happened was because there's such disruption and focus on covid as it should have been a lot of other things, got pushed back elective surgery, specialty care, so we're kind of playing catch up now. You know in terms of everyone's kind of brought up isolation- and I think rightly so, and I think it's showing up now when people are finally coming back a lot of people with diabetes. Now their sugars have gone way up kind of as a function of just staying inside mental health, as they've mentioned. Also, the one thing I'll say about goofiness also is that it is a kobe testing site, and so people can come in without an appointment. They don't have to be a patient of health and hospital corporation. They can get both the nasal test, the pcr and also the antibody test for free. You know whether or not you know how useful the test is on a kind of concrete day-to-day basis. Is you know something needs to be discussed with the patient? It's debatable, but I think it's important. As we've said in terms of like health disparities, I think it's important to collect the data, especially from a public health point of view, represent these minority communities that often aren't studied enough. So I think it is important for people to know that the governor does have that testing available kind of. Similarly, as people have mentioned, I think the big impact will be economic. A lot of my patients are undocumented, and so we're not eligible for any of these federal aid programs and whether you're undocumented or not. A lot of our patients are in these industries, like restaurants, salon which have been really severely hit. So I think we're going to see the fallout in the coming months and years, just in terms of people, not you know, being able to keep up economically, whether it shows up as housing or through their health, so things that can help support that in the community would be necessary. So I think you know julian perry did a great job. I think the one other thing I was thinking like looking ahead, is you know if and hopefully, when the vaccine a vaccine is available? You know, I think it's important to think ahead about how we can you know, disseminate that and get people to get the vaccine. You know I'm assuming that it will be done in due diligence in terms of safety, because just from experience right every year we have a flu shot and every year there's a pretty sizable percent people who resist, who don't want the flu shot for various reasons, a lot of which are you know, are not not valid, and so looking ahead. If there's this vaccine that comes out, you know, how can we effectively? You know, hopefully right if we want to kind of close these disparities. If we have a vaccine that's available, we do want to try to get it out to the community involved. So thinking about how we can do that, you know you know in a way that people will be more. You know likely to get a vaccine and not resist it like they haven't with flu vaccines in years past. So that's it for me. Okay, thank you very much. Do we have any questions? Oh okay, there was susan and larissa. You go first, larissa! Okay, this question is for julie, julie, have you had any issues with reimbursement and reimbursement rates for the telehealth visits, knowing that most of your patients are probably medicaid and undocumented aliens? Well, we we clearly do not get reimbursed for the immigrants who are undocumented, but a tele health telephonic visits, the ones that are only telephone. You know and danny has joined me as well, can chime in we. We still struggle with that now. Medicare has clearly given a little more reimbursement for telephonic visits, but we are not getting what we feel should be gotten for that and again, because many of our patients and and our constituents don't have access to be able to vidi to have video visual kind of conferences. So that's penalizing patients who actually you know, really could benefit from it and don't so do you have? Is it the rate of reimbursement for the medicaid or versus the rate of reimbursement for medicare? Is that one of the reasons that you're having issues with the collection medicare does not pay at the same rates as the medicaid? I know our primary state association ducanes fought very hard with the new york state department of health to allow federally qualified health, centers and perinosis very well as well to actually get reimbursed at the enhanced rates. We were getting four visits face-to-face if we did not have that, we would be in a much more dire, similar boat as even charles b wang, because we would have gotten basically 10 cents on the dollar in terms of reimbursement, but at least medicaid allowed us to to be able to get reimbursed at our current rates. It's medicare that is really falling behind and again 20 of our patients are elderly and many of our patients are in the north, complex and in nycha buildings. You know, as as perry also has, and I'm sure lee experience in gouverne as well. So carrie did, you want to say something yeah, so one big there's a big disparaging video and phone visit reimbursement. So we try to do video with everybody, but as julia and leslie know, the elderly have particularly hard time trying to do it and they just often cannot without unless there's a you know, a child or caretaker there with them, because they just the art of that generation, so that that is very difficult as that's less reimbursement and, if you're a therapist at the current time. If you do a phone visit, that's not reimbursed at all. It has to be a video visit, so the mental health that's delivered by our therapists. You know if it's not a video, we still do it, but we're not going to get real we're, not really getting reimbursed for those I just wanted to higher reimbursements for the video than the phone is. What you're saying yeah? Yes, okay, yes, yeah, okay and I know at batanjes, as I mentioned, we literally had to just jumpstart our telehealth program. Danny was instrumental and danny can share some of what we had to go through to get our telehealth program up and running yeah. I know it was. It was clearly a team effort and and really unprecedented from from equipment to training staff, as well as training patients, and even to this day we have special teams that communicate with patients and help them on a day-to-day basis kind of hold their hands. But you know, as julia and both perry were saying you know, a lot of our experience has been with the elderly and some of the other individuals within the community. They don't have access to internet, they don't have resources, they have, they don't have unlimited phones, they have limited data plans, you name it. You know we've even hand held patients to create an email with them and just share with them. What is the internet? You know we went that far and sometimes the path of least resistance is the phone as well as training some of our staff, who may not be as comfortable with technology. Also, the path of least resistance is also formed, so you were battling both worlds, but always trying to deliver that the needs of the patient and take care of it to the best of our ability. Okay, great susan yeah, I'd like to at first ask about substance abuse since we're seeing so much substance abuse on the street. Now. Are you finding an increase in your patients with substance abuse and also are? Are some of them are? Were they in programs that are now closed, which means they're basically on the street during the day I was going to let some of our provider. Colleagues speak. First, if you have any comments, I know we do have a substance use disorder program at batonsis. You know what we're finding is what what we're finding is that the substance abuse is not just heroin. It really is pain, medications and tobacco. As perry had mentioned, tobacco, especially with the asian population, is huge. So we have those struggles with them, and the problem with substance use disorder is that if the patients are not ready, they're just not willing to be in the program so our program, you know we have certainly struggled with it. People aren't in denial. People want to feel that the substance use disorder is strictly. You know, crack users heroin addicts, but it's not it's it's. We don't even know who these patients are when they present, because they're your normal patients- and some of them are not even people of color it does affect. Sud is one of those things that has affected more people that are non-people of color. But yes, we we have not seen the kind of success that we would like to see for that program. I could say that goofineer has like a box zone program, but I don't want to speak to what they've found the past few months, since I I'm not involved with it. But you know it's not a day program. It was it's people coming in to actually get the suboxone, so you know it wouldn't be. You know it would be probably more what they wouldn't if they haven't been able to keep up with in person. You know because we were forced to do telephone business for so long anyway. So I would imagine, there's been a lot of kind of drop off in terms of care, but I can you know I can ask more about with the people who run it. Thank you. Okay. Okay, I was wondering also do. Are any of you seeing your patients becoming homeless during this period? We we have. We have some homeless patients, we don't have a whole lot. I think, along with the substance, abuse the marginalized communities. They they just don't show up. You know they're uncounted, you know, so that's a tragedy right if they're not coming in or they don't get services or they're uncounted or you know, we are around the corner from the alcohol mission right on la on lafayette street. So you know if, if they don't come in or if they don't come in for services, it's hard to give them the services. So I think the lower east side service center is one of their bigger services that that cater for substance use and, I hope, they're doing all right. Okay, thank you. Any other questions. How about some of the other committee members who haven't talked ricky. I have my hand up. Oh I'm just oh, I didn't see I'm sorry david yeah, okay, so about suboxone. So people understand that this is a it's to it's a it's a medical treatment just to reduce cravings for opioids. I heard you say that there was a I'm sure that there is a challenge for it, but I believe that the state modified the regulations as this started. The federal people did it anyway, so that it could be done for telehealth, but I'm sure that it's still a challenge for people who were who were on treatment to you know continue through telehealth. Anyway, I don't know if you could expand on what troubles that you actually encountered. Your client yeah. Sorry so, like I said, I'm not directly involved with that program, and so I don't so you know I'm kind of speculating, because I know that we all were just forced to go to telephone health, but you're right I mean they. Can you know they could? Obviously, we could all prescribe suboxone remotely through you know through our computers at home right so, but a lot of it was also you know, people would come in and also you know, get social work and you know support just in person when they came in also so so that's I think you know part of what may have been lost during this yeah. So, like I said, I need to you know, find out more to see what happens with my colleagues who actually run the program, and I I think our providers epitonzas would be the first to say there is nothing like a face-to-face visit, particularly when you're dealing with a substance use disorder issues, because that social support and, as you know, as les said, it's critical to get that what I had termed the care, coordination and and case management- that's what they need. They can't do it alone, and especially many of them are involuntary. You know maybe they're forced to be in the program, but they cannot do it alone. You know so so to have that support system. You can't do it as well as as you can in a group environment and with people who know how to maneuver the system. It's also when they're done. You know many of the substance use. Patients know how to to skin the cat know how to to work it so that they look like they're taking the drugs and they're, really not taking the drugs so being in in the in the center really helps to support what we know they need go ahead. He also makes you amplify one last thing that les dr chong said you know in terms of getting tested. You know that is a disparity too. We want to be able to offer that, for everybody, give them the right advice and then the second part is when a vaccine comes out, making sure that you know the the poor, the the people that we serve. The working class you know are able to get the vaccine. You know not just the people who have you know better insurance or have access. You know that will be critical part, two to make sure that that gets distributed where it needs it. You know if you actually think about where it needs the most. It would be for the elderly and for the front line service workers, which you know a lot of the community. Are you know so that is also an important thing to advocate for in the future too, to make sure that they're not left behind in these allocations and susan, one of the things that you had asked before we, we at batons is have seen a major drop in vaccines, especially for the children. So that is, one of our focuses is to really get the children in I mean they're they're, not bringing the families in the children and and we need them to get vaccinated and less hit it on the nose that all vaccinations, and especially the flu we've always been challenged because the the minorities have have gotten these gossip and the social media saying that the flu causes the flu, and you can't shake that from their from their mind that they're not getting these shots because it'll give them what they're trying not to get no matter how you try. So we have a lot of patients who refuse the flu shot because they said we don't want to get the flu. So anyone else ricky did you have made an appearance. Would you like to say something? No, you called my name, so I mean one for everybody's knowledge here you know I used to work at the health department up until five months ago, so right at right. I got out right before the the pandemic hit. I you know echo all you know the concerns here that are brought up, especially health disparities, and I mean, coupled with that, you know it was easily predictable to see that it was gonna. The the pandemic's gonna impact communities of color, because historically they've been marginalized and had less access to services already. So you could tell that the mortality rate was going to be high among those communities and for folks that don't know you know public health and I'm not a public health expert. I'm not a clinician or I just worked. You know several years at the health department, and you kind of just you know picked this up, but you know growing up as a kid in chinatown, where I had to you know, take my mom to the gynecologist and as a ten-year-old had to translate for her. These are the kind of things that you know. We didn't you know. Now things are better. They can obviously improve more. But it's great that you know we can. You know we're hearing it from you know, and you know you know some of the things that it kind of brought up, and don't quote me on this, but I have some insider information because I still keep in contact with my health colleagues. There's definitely going to be a mass prophylaxis program once a vaccine is in place, they're already kind of like kind of drilling internally at the health department and also with h, starting some of the mass nations about that as well too. They have programs in place where, if there was like an emergent issue that they would actually set up, you know mass vaccination sites, usually at doe schools to basically just get people in and out and get them. You know vaccinated and then of course, they're gonna have to go on the ground to reach people the elderly. They can't cut out folks that just don't want to come out to kind of administer these things as well too. I heard- and don't quote me on this as well too, the new commissioner of health. You know, obviously we had a cha. They had a change over in the administration for city health department. Is that the new commissioner still planning to see patients, because he is a clinician which is kind of unusual for a health commissioner to to do because it's a pretty big job at the health department, but he's very committed to that, and you know this is just kind of a direction that they've kind of taken, so there are going to be a lot of big changes coming at the city level regarding public health. Okay, thank you. Can I make a comment about? Well, I don't know if it's a health department or health and hospitals, but right now I find a real lack of transparency on information. For instance, there are at least three age groups that are increasing in number of diagnosis in new york city, and it's very hard to get this information. They have the statistics of how much the increase is. I have not been able to get that yet. You know I keep trying different areas, but I don't understand. I just don't understand the opaqueness right now and giving out and giving this information at one point a couple weeks ago, the mayor announced that there was an eight percent increase in the 20 to 29 year olds, but now you can't get an update on that and I know there's an increase in the 10 to 19 year olds and there's an increase in the 50 to 59, but I can't get an even idea of how much of an increase- and you know I- I don't think it helps the situation at all, because we don't really know what's happening in our community. I could probably give you a some internal insight to that too, and it's unfortunate it's obviously political, but you, you mentioned the kind of hierarchy, there's a city's health department which gathers data that's being reported, but it has to you know, coalesce with the state health department's data that they're collecting as well too, and it's also being reported out to the cdc, and that's generally, you know shared with the who those numbers all have to kind of line up and if there's anything disparate, they have to be able to kind of explain things. That's what I've always been told when I was internally there. So it doesn't surprise me that if there's a delay in reporting something out publicly because they just want to make sure that the numbers kind of line up and if there's something off, they want to know exactly what's going on rather than having misinformation out there. I know it's not helpful. You know in a sense when it you know kind of you know when people want to know in the middle of a pandemic what's kind of going on and where we're seeing the increases and where we should kind of focus our attention to. But that's my you know my take on it. I could be something else as well too, but you know just having been there for several years, just knowing how they kind of like track certain things. Thank you. Anybody any other questions from the committee or comments. Okay, so we're saying that, in terms of you know, I'm just thinking of our district needs statement. What we're saying is that you know mental health telehealth. You know social determinants of health. You know some of the substance abuse or the tobacco use are the issues that we should be watching for and may I I think, alan who really started off the conversation. I would urge the community board and all those concerned to continue to stress nycha's, inactiveness and unengagement with all the community organizations. We have the same issues. One of our smaller health centers is within henry street settlement. There. They are in the nycha buildings. It is extremely hard to access care there and you know again. We only have our small health center, but social distancing when you have two exam rooms in a small center is impossible and we've had to close that center. Because of of those spatial issues and to we would need nature to get involved to help with some of this. So it did. It clearly impacted education, as alan said, but also severely in healthcare. You know they we're surrounded by the nycha buildings and those are north communities for us. So that is such a a major problem for us and danny. I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that, but that would surely should be one of the top priorities as we see it, yeah. No, I agree 100 and one other thing I would just add, especially with the being that there's a 20 20 20 21 needs is, you know the whole flu season's coming with kovitzel around, and you know that also being very, very important and how we address that as a community together yeah. I think I think all the presentations were amazing, they're, so informative, but also so well organized. I think we can basically take the presentations and just have bullet points from them for the for the need statement. Okay, all right. Okay, then, okay, great okay, so I think we are done with the presentations. We have a little bit more to talk about just ourselves in terms of district needs statement to the speakers. If you wish to stay around for that, you can but you're free to go, and if we have, I mean you know we, the materials you gave us were very good and it was very well organized and if we have any additional questions we can ask, and if you have any additional materials or information you want to give us, you know, feel free to send man, susan, an email, okay! Thank you so very much for inviting us. Okay! Thank you bye-bye. Thank you bye-bye. Yes, thank you. Okay, thank you all right, so we need to put some insert some information. How should we do that? This somebody take a stab? Yes, susan, what's the best one, I would suggest, and I was serious. I was very sincere when I said I thought it was so well organized. I think any one of us I mean the office, can do it too. I really think between, like now and next month. We could just take those presentations and you know almost transfer the the needs to paper very easily, I'm offering the office to do that if you'd like, unless someone else wants to do it, oh only because I think it'll be so easy. Okay, if you're offering the office to do it, we'll take up the offer yeah I'll, take it down. I had my hand up. I wasn't volunteering, oh! No! I also want to say I know, may gave a lot of preparation to the presenters on what we're looking for, and I think these presentations showed how much it pays off to do that. Okay, great okay, yeah, so so so so we're supposed to have. We should have have the final so review the timeline by the next meeting. We should be looking at the final thing right because in october, we'll be working on priorities which, for this committee is always pretty intense, so we should finalize everything next month. I want to say, for I don't remember what I offered to do, but I did just start working on looking at the homeless section and I started reaching out for statistics for information from our outreach and from dhs, and maybe heidi can help me figure out more of what we need and I want to look at coalition for the homeless. So I will definitely have that something for the committee next month. Hey heidi, can you help her with that? Absolutely okay, we're putting you down for it's going to be in the minutes. Okay, also david has his hand up yes, david yeah, so one of those presentations kind of scared me when I got the strong sense that the community health centers are going to go under. I kind of feel like, although I don't know, statistics about it, I kind of feel like that's the beginning of a descent into hell. I mean I don't know if there's a source of how much of the population relies on it and what is likely to happen if we rip health care out from under that segment of the population. I it's scary. You were talking about charles b wang community healthcare, yeah yeah, when he yeah when he said that it was written up on the screen too yeah it was. It was dr perry, I believe. Whoever was saying I was just something like. Oh my goodness, you know that would be really bad and- and I have no doubt that things are getting that bad and we're just I'm just not aware of it. I didn't know they should talk about this. I think they're gonna get money, I don't I don't think they'll go under. I really don't. I think it'll be difficult and I think it'll they'll work under a lot of difficulties, but I can't imagine losing those yeah they I mean, I didn't know they weren't eligible for ppp, but they're too big. Oh okay, yeah I mean yeah, they're they're, not they're. They have a site in queens as well, and so and they do are the the major provider for the asian population. I mean everyone in chinatown either goes to bouvenir or charles b wang. I do know yeah. I do know on the telehealth I know from in in new york state from my son being in this situation, where they're treating patients with telehealth, in particular in the insurance companies, were saying. Well, we'll pay you, but we have no idea what we're going to be paying you. So how do you? How do you even plan a payroll that way there's all kinds of problems this this thing about? You have to ask me video call to be covered, that's just horrible, anyway. Okay. I hope that the funding structures are not at risk because there's a whole lot of funding that is at risk. I do know that the human service- I knew that this committee's budget priorities have got to be the top this year, but we don't know so one of the things we don't know I was going to ask, but then I figured we could ask later is there's federal money, state money and city money for the city money I don't know, maybe ricky might know. I don't know where that city money comes from through what agency for the for these clinics. You know that's something we can always follow up with. I think most of the funding is state and federal. I don't know if there's any city funds that I'm aware of, I can check with somebody and I can circle back. I can ask they meant they mentioned that they had some city money. I suspected, I expect suspect it's a very small portion, yeah yeah. I think it's really really small, but I could double check. Okay, that would be great yeah yeah, charles b wang, I mean perry. He mentioned city money city council money for their smoking program. Well, then, that's administered through the health department. So it's something that they. It's probably a city agency comes in agreement with the city council and they are able to you know, pool like the council is able to get some money together and then they'll work with specific council members in targeted neighborhoods. Where would they see high instances of like you know, smoking incidences so like in chinatown or flushing, and then they'll kind of direct some funds to there that they get, but usually those funds? If it's not coming directly from the council, if the city happens to get it, they may have gotten it from the state or the feds for a cessation program or something like that as well too. So generally, most of those that's the kind of pipeline that it works through, but that would be just a tiny, tiny, tiny bit out there yeah programming money. Yeah, it's not effective yeah, it's not some scale, it's not something we can really affect with our budget, but the facilities thing. I think it's something they talked about. Remember at the panel that we had. They all talked about the facility- everybody, including yeah, and then so huge, it's huge, and I would suggest that we have it sort of an introductory for the all the services, because it's also so important for senior centers. Also. Can I make a suggestion too, about the issues that they had as far as like, if they're running their facilities out of a nycha and they're, you know obviously nycha's being nycha, they have their own issues already, but it kind of spills over to like child care services that operate out of there and also these healthcare facilities, and we saw at the health department when I was there. I don't want to you know I don't want to say it's a confirmed workaround, but if they had issues where there's a sewage leak or there's like rodents present or something like that, the health department actually can't get involved, because it's a public health issue. Now I don't know if it's going to end up spurring them to go beyond their current protocols. Now, because they're just saying we don't want to be in a situation where we have our workers exposed potentially exposed to covet because they have to go in there to fix something or something like that. But I can basically say you know, I'm fairly certain that if somebody was to you know bring these issues up for a specific location to the health department, they would contact their colleagues there. Now. Another city agency is not going to write a violation, for you know a nycha facility having a sewage leak if it, unless you know it's a private facility, but if it's a sister agency they're not going to do that, but I can guarantee you that they will call their counterparts at the other agencies. Like hey we're hearing about these issues, we're going to have to go and take a look, and if we find something you're going to hear back about it and I think that'll kind of give him a kick in the butt. If anything so ricky you know for how many years compost plaza community center has had sewage how many years have they had sewage leaking into the classrooms? I'm just I I've dealt with similar issues and we've gone when the health department has gotten involved yeah, and then I think you heard about there was a. I think there was a child care facility out. I think I forget I forgot it was in the lower east side of brooklyn that had rats present and they had to vacate the child care facility because they had rats present and of course you know, nycha has their own pest control, but we ended up, like you know, helping out sort of intervening, but that's that's during like a regular case scenario, not a pandemic. I understand you know nycha trying to protect their staff and workers, but there could be potential work around even having to deal with the nitro bureaucracies and stuff. So we'll try, hey ricky, hey. I just want to ask if so susan has offered the office's help to write up this health section, but if they need more help or because you know things are coming up, okay, can you consult? Can they consult with you and will you help them? Yes, that's my reason for being a committee member. So, okay, great okay, I'm very careful in who I recruit. Okay, I was okay, okay, okay, wonderful! What else do we have well? Okay? Is that the end of our discussion for district needs? Do we need to talk about anything else? Susan. I mean there's leftover, things that that jim had like questioned about. I sent emails to the various members yeah. Those were very just very specific things right. I I will just tell you they're, just sort of general. This is what we're hearing in the office as it relates to your committee. So many more calls about homelessness. More than I've ever seen, huge encampments in many areas. Ninth precinct in response actually had a meeting yesterday that included people from the residents and merchants who have been complaining and goddard riverside was there. Ironically, this was in the building and it turns out the police, don't social distance or wear masks, so I'm never going back there again. I I don't know how they get exempt from all the guidelines, but there's just tremendous amount of a mixture of homeless homelessness, drug abuse. You know people lying on the street with needles in their arms crime associated and of course, these are three different things that very much overlap that the city seems to have absolutely no plan to be able to deal with. They keep hearing these complaints at all these different meetings and there's there's never a resolution other than we're. You know we're going to send people out to engage it's it's it's just sort of hopeless, hopeless and very bad, and then the people there used to be all these I mean, and then there were people who used to go to programs right, but the programs aren't running so well, that's what I'm told they're not chronically street homeless, but they just don't have a program to go into anymore as well. This may may not be homeless. It may be people who are doing drugs on the street. You know those are people who might have been in programs during the day. I that's why I asked whether people were becoming homeless. You know with any of their patients because I'm wondering if that is increasing, you know, as people are dealing with so many issues like rent and jobs and mental health issues. You know I'm wondering if that's why you know contributing to the number of homeless, but, like I say you you're looking at people on the street, but then you have to kind of go back and say well how many of them are sleeping there at night, but there are huge encampments. I know some of our members live near them they're, just absolutely it's just huge and also the subways are empty tonight, so you're seeing people on the street that used to be in the subways right so yeah, I don't know you were asking leilani for some stupid. I I did ask her for some and I've asked goddard for some and we'll see I'll get together with heidi, and I thought I'd also go to a coalition for the homeless. There might be more open to giving information. Okay, okay, great, so that's a whole other segment that we have to add in yeah. But you know it's also mentioning it for what not just the district needs for next year, but for what we're actually dealing with right now, don't just talk about another topic, a little bit just to update everyone. You know alicia at about five o'clock today she sent an email because she got it from the manhattan borough president and it was from the eoe. You know just running around looking for spaces to have their classrooms in so you know she gets this email like on tuesday, and it's due on thursday, like we're supposed to give them a list of spaces in cb3 where people can just have classes. You know they're not asking us requirements, they're, just saying it's a blast, email they're, not particularly asking for anything from us. It's a blast, email. I've already forwarded it to like allen and people like that who are already working with them. But you know: there's there's no! No owners on us. Okay, no, it seemed like it was for a class for regular classroom space even yeah, but you have places like manny canner that now have empty classrooms all right right now. No, I'm not saying it's an onus on us, but it just shows how there's a lot of last minute stuff going on not not well planned. Yes, okay, all right! So, okay, we are done with this portion and then okay. The next thing we have is any updates on cab, meeting cab meetings or cec meetings. Has anyone ever been to one gone to any of those meetings in the past month since the last meeting marissa any governor cabs, the governor cab did not meet this month. Okay- and I don't think, there's any other member here, okay, okay, so we can have the any new business all business updates. Before we take the final vote. Okay, there seems to be none. No! Oh, are you raising your hand, david, okay, okay, thomas rosa? Would you like so we're on the final vote to adjourn? Can you take the attendance [Applause]? Oh maybe not? Oh may I can look at the screen and jot everyone's name down or call on them from the screen how's that we'll call yeah call on everyone, okay, so david crane. So this is a vote to adjourn.
