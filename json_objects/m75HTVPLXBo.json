Now, I'm going to ask you to unmute, but would you just tell me your name just so that I can Joel reese Joel, Reese and you're for the first application? No, which application? Are you another three? I think this chat who's, Jack, W, okay, thank you! 16 26, second, give you my edition address we'll get started in a few minutes whenever we have more of our board members here, but if it's your first time at one of our community board aid zoom meetings, we just want to let you know how the meeting works. They you may notice that you are muted and you're not able to unmute yourself right now. You'll have to participate in the meeting through using the raise hand, feature right now. If you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll see a button that says: participants, click on the word participants. It has a little icon that has two people standing next to each other with the number 18 next to it. That number will go up and down as the meeting gets more people or people leave. But if you click on participants, a box will pop up pop up on your screen with all the names of the people who are here in the meeting. But at the bottom of that box, you'll see a button that says raise hand you'll just need to click that once and your hand will pop up on that list and our chair. Whenever he gets here, he will be able to see your name and he'll call on you whenever the time comes, just like Kaz just raised his hand and then you'll be able to be unmuted at that time. If you're on the phone, it's star nine to raise your hand and again I asked you just only raise it once and because, if you click it again, it'll lower your hand again, and we wo not be able to see you. The other thing that I'll say is. As you raise your hand, the likelihood will be that you'll need to click a button to confirm, be being unmuted, so just be watching for a pop- up on your screen after we call your name to actually unmute yourself at that point, but only after your name has been called. I do see Abraham our committee chairs here I will thank you. So thank you. Everyone for being here welcome to the street life meeting for October of Community board, eight for the record Tuesday October 6th, 6 30. As a reminder about any and all actions that this committee takes we'll go to the School board meeting on Wednesday October 21st, a few rules of the road I will be calling each applicant to in order to speak on their application. Give us your name, a free synopsis of the application. At that point, I will take questions from the public as well, followed by questions from members and then we'll or not so without further Ado. Do we have the applicant for item 1a, Bondi 1140, Third Avenue? If you will go ahead and raise your hand, it looks like Mike. Hudson is going to be presenting on item one max. You may have to confirm Mike Sorry, not Max. I apologize hi correct. I am the director of operations. My name, however, is not on the application. I was expecting my CEO, oh yeah, my CEO David Hess is here as well. Hey guys, sorry, I'm a minute late on this. I was trying to figure out how to log into the zoom okay, not a problem. Well, so why do not you give us a rundown of your application with the details? So we own bandai Sushi, which is a fast casual sushi chain. Our first location is in nomad 6 West 28th street. We opened another location at 75, Kenmer Street in Nolita. We have a couple: smaller express delivery locations, one in Brooklyn, one in Tribeca, and we just signed this lease at 1140, Third Avenue for the corner space, that's 67th and and third, if you guys have the floor plan up in front of you, essentially there it's a little more than around a thousand square feet about 200 square feet is used for an express area which is for delivery, catering and take out, and then the rest of the space is a 20-seat sushi bar where we will be serving beer and wine at the space and so wow. Okay, thank you and if you've been given the current conditions, are you also planning for the sidewalk space as well? Sorry, I'm having trouble hearing requests just confirming. Are you also looking at the outdoor space? Sorry, are you asking if we're going to have a sidewalk cafe? Yes, yeah, we would potentially have a sidewalk okay! Thank you. Do I have well. Do we have anyone from the public not yet I'll. Just remind everybody who came in late that we will call on you by using the raised hand, feature at the bottom of your hand at the bottom of your screen in the participants menu, so just open the participants menu raise your hand through that feature or, if you're on the phone, it's star nine. I do not see anybody with their hands up now. We have marco from the board. Okay, marco, ah thank you. I think I had to make understatement first, that the community will indeed myself. We are now against business. We support business, especially in but right now the new regulations from the governor Cuomo. He said that it is possible to use the inside of the space with a 25 of the capacity. I checked this restaurant. Yes, it has a CEO, but have one problem. There is no number of occupants, so the issue will be for this. Restaurant is how he is going to determine the 25 inside of the play of the venue. So the only way is he has to obtain a co or he has to figure out something, because otherwise the Department of Health will be against this restaurant to demonstrate that actually, the capacity that they established is, according with the co or the letter of no objection, but in this case the co does not describe so it's no fault from the applicant. It probably I should say this falls from DOV that they should be put the number of our people for that facility. So my point of view is this applicant issued a start working hard or working with somebody else, work with SBS or any other institution to help them to establish the number of occupants inside of the of the venue, and that is not only the problem for him is for everybody else. I'm happy that I speak at the beginning, so everybody has to be aware of that regulation and the revelation is: how are you going to determine the 25 of the capacity if the co or the letter of no objection does not mention, and that is a serious problem for them. Can you guys? Can you guys Unmute Aiden Carty, he said he's in the chat and he ca not speak. Is he a part of this presentation? Correct, okay, aiden, hey did not we say something, so we can make sure you're here he he's saying something, but it's still seems muted, that's correct, he's unmuted, but his microphone's not on no now you're, muted, there's mutes. Both sides so make sure he's unmuted himself. He has. He has his microphone dial back in on that. That's. Why he's like dialing on your phone he's going to he's going to call back guys? Okay, so I guess this question that should be followed by Aidan is how you're going to every time you're unmuted, it's a racket. I have a couple of questions number one: how did you get the name of bondi the applicant there yeah, he muted himself, David just confirmed my meeting. Oh sorry, yeah! No, our third partner, Justin Hauser his family is from Australia from Sydney Bondo. Okay. Now, as far as what marco said, the latest and I think Max is on the call- were Max Bookman. If there is no number on the co or the lno, a maximum of 74 people is assumed, so you take 25 of the 74, but you still have to have the six foot maintenance. So this is a you know, a for. You know a fold in the in the co or lno, but the what they're saying is you take 74 as the number, regardless of what it actually is? If there is no number on the co or lno yeah, I mean so Aidan's not on right now, but in terms of the six feet rule we're operating in 75, cadmium, it's a 21 seed, Sushi bar and we're operating with six feet, so we actually only do five to six customers at at one time in the space. But you know everyone says you're, not what are you this is at the Sushi bar correct. It's separated! It's like a sushi counter. Okay, yeah! Is that legal? Yes, yeah! That's a sushi counter! Okay! Yeah! Thank you right because anything above that you would need a Pa, correct. Okay, are there any other hands up? Well, just marco? Now? Okay! Ah, thank you, marco. Yes, my point is I'm going to try to establish a rule right here? The only thing is, they will face the Department of Health and the Department of Health they're, going to make a health for all of the restaurants. Now the what Cole said is 75 people 74 people 75, you put the 25 percent as is wrong. First of all, the 74 people has included their staff, so all the stuff that is over there. Usually, if you have 74 people 75, you at least have at least 12 people for the staff. So in reality you have just only 64. and from the 64. The only thing that you have in reality is eight tables and 16 chairs, and that's it so hold on marco. The latest rule was that staff is not included. 25.. No, of course, I'm telling you what is what I did, what the building code says, and that is that what the DOB is stand always if you want to establish another rule. Does this fight for you, but in the building code established this way that I'm saying to you? So it has to be that way. But my point is: I do not care in some way if you want to put more than 25 percent the problem. Is these places it will the people from the Department of Health. They will visit them and they're going to get into trouble one and two right now. My understanding is the Department of Health. They asking right now to all the restaurants to present the capacity or the 25 percent capacity, so the owners in this case they are unable to establish and there I kind of blame them most likely. I'm going to blame DOV right to blame the in this case the owners of their of their restaurants. So this is the rules and that's what I'm recommending, but I'm going to try to establish anything myself right here and advise them that that's going to happen to all of you and if we need to approve yes, I will approve that. I do not have no problem with this application. We need business. The only problem is business. What way I'm doing right now is I'm helping them to be ready to face the Department of Health, otherwise you're going to get in trouble and they wo not be able to operate properly. Thank you. Thank you. I think I see Barbara's hand up. First of all, first of all, just it's very hard to hear. I do not know who has the background noise it's a little better, but whoever does can it be quieted because it's impossible to hear, but I think what we're discussing now is mood. These gentlemen said that they have 25 seats for 22 people or something like that and they'll do four or five at a time. So I ca not imagine, there's any problem and I think the discussion sounds moot. I would I would like to propose to accepting application Abraham. I see that Russell yeah. That sounds like a move to approve, and I see a second barry. Are you also seconding, or did you have a separate comment? Nope he lowered his hand. Okay, then, in that case I would say it sounds like we have a motion to approve second. So if anyone is voting, no abstaining or not voting for pause raise your hand. Otherwise this will go as an improvement. I do not see any, but Abraham do you want to quickly read off the board members who are here or I can do it so I'm seeing myself cause Elita, Barbara, Barry, Marco and Russell. I do not see anybody else, but if there is somebody else, let us know otherwise. I think you're good to go on to the next item. Okay, so we have item 1b, that's paulo's. Restaurant grew. Thank you, everybody! Okay, do we have the representative for Paulo's restaurant group? I see Max, just unmute, yes, just got muted. Could everybody hear me? Yes, okay, great thank you will good evening cba, it's nice to see everybody's faces again remotely as it might be. For those who do not know me, I do see a few new faces. My name is Max Bookman, I'm an attorney. I regularly appear before your committee representing liquor, license applicants and I'm also your neighbor, my wife and I and our one- year- old daughter, live on 84th and 2nd, where I am sitting right now, looking out my window, seeing a vacant restaurant on second avenue and there's many of them. So we have to do what we can to keep our restaurants in business, keep them alive, and I applaud the efforts that this board has made in trying to support this very vital industry for our neighborhood. So with me, tonight is chef paular she's, not the most technologically savvy she's managed to make it onto the zoom call, I'm not sure if she'll be able to unmute herself, but she is here, but this is an easy application. Paula she's had a restaurant named powwows named after her over on Madison and 92nd for over 10 years. That's over next to Sarah baths and hotel whales. Very nice, restaurant folks in the neighborhood know her no issues with the way she runs her business, but she does have to move. There are developments happening in the building that is going to result in her? Not being able to operate her business there anymore, so she has found a space two blocks over and one block down over on lex between 90th and 91st. So that's one block south of the y. It's a restaurant that it used to be a restaurant. I never went there. Maybe that's one of the reasons why it went out of business, but there's no restaurant there anymore, but it was previously a restaurant she's moving her business, there nothing's changing about her business. So you know early hours, closing at 10 pm every night same menu, same staff, same people, same name, same everything, it's just same neighborhood, it's just. She had to find a new location, so she is here tonight. I see that she is unmuted. If you have any questions for her or for me, that's great Max. Thank you very much yeah. So I see it's 10 P.M, closing 80 20 food. So if you have any hands public or otherwise, anyone from the public star nine or raise your hand through the participants menu, otherwise Elita's got her hand up Abraham I'll go to Elita. Then thanks will thanks Abraham and Abraham and Max. Please forgive me. I have to ask you this, because the owner of the building where the restaurant is now situated came before the Landmarks Committee and said that it was not going to move the restaurants Sarah bets and Paula's. So could you just tell me and again I'm sorry because this is not part of street life, but I've got you here what is going on and why they are moving, and is it just because of construction, or were they asked to vacate this space I'll? Let paola speak to that because you know that's a little beyond what I've been helping her with, which is just the moving of the liquor license but Powell. If you could hear us- and you heard the question if you'd like to answer it and hear me, can you hear me? Yes, we could hear you, okay. What I was told by the owner of the building is that our lease is up at the end of the year and he's not going to renew it because he's making the building condominiums and we can talk about things after the finishes construction, but at the moment this is up and he wants us out, and when did he say that to you the beginning of the year we've been trying to negotiate with him for a long time? How can every is another of in early 2020? It's been a few months, I think, starting from the summer the summer, maybe a little bit earlier than the summer, I'm not quite sure, because I have not been well. I've been ill and I've been home, I'm so sorry, I hope you're better, all right now, yeah much better, still kind of, but so that's the situation right now. Okay, if the bill allows us to come back, we would love to be able to be back in the neighborhood. Okay, if you've got different information. If you want to kind of connect with me offline about it, you know I can maybe bring paula in on it as well and any other attorneys. That might be helpful. Thank you will has your contact information right? Yes, okay, maybe we'll set up a conversation thanks so much and thank you paula and Fortuna. Please, thank you. I see Marco has his hand up. Thank you Max. This is a question for you. I know that what you described is correct. I know that this that place is commercial too. I know that, but I check no co no later than no objection how you going to deal that how you will submit an application with that is your responsibility max, of course, so nice to hear you again, marco. We check two, no co, no lno we're going to have to get an lno and like we always do we'll, submit the application telling the liquor authority that we're going to have we're applying for an lno and we're going to give you one liquor authority before you hand us the license and that's a routine thing that we do and we'll have to do that here as well. But you should do before to come right here, one and two: that's fine! When you apply for the letter or no objection try to see if they, if they put the number of occupants. That will be very helpful, even though that DOV, I do not think it's going to allow to do that, but try it because sooner or later, you're going to face the same problem as the other application. Well, I mean I heard what you said about the other application, and you know you know we're dealing we're in a crazy time right now, where we're being regulated by you know, guidance posted on websites. That gets changed all the time and they do not really think through all of the consequences when they say you know maximum occupancy. They do not know what that means in every single scenario. So I do agree with you that the situation we have restaurants operating on Lnos that do not state the maximum occupancy is an issue. Okay. Thank you. Russell squire has his hand up motion to approve. Second, I'm trying to track down Abraham. No, that was I was. I was just saying yeah, so we have a motion improvement a second, so this is going to go down. Do we have if anyone's voting? No, not voting for pause, raise your hands. Otherwise this will go down. Looks like nobody has their hand up, and I will note that Mrs Brown has joined okay, great so Mrs Brown. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone good night and as I sign off just I just want to note, you have an application for Simon Oren later in your agenda. Do not give him too much trouble he's a longtime member of our community and he's opening up another nice restaurant, which he'll tell you about later thanks Max. So do we have the representative for 1626 restaurant Gda, who's, Jack Robert? You just have to confirm there you go. What do you think we also have Joel reese with us. Welcome yeah, I'm here, okay, so good evening, my name is Bob Callahan from Michael Kelly Inc with me is Joel operating in the establishment. This is an on- premise: liquor license application for 1626 llc, doing business as who's Jack W we're located 1626, 2nd Avenue between 84th and 85th street, we'll be a full- service, restaurant serving American cuisine. Our hours of operation will be Sunday to Thursday until 11 P.M, Friday and Saturday 11 A.M to 2 A.M, we'll have light background music from an ipod or an ipad. We will be doing deliveries, we're not sure if we're going to use totally outside services or have our own bikes, but we do abide by all the bike rules. Joel's been in this business for over 20 years. He can tell you about his experience. If you have any questions, I will go to the public, but I actually have one quick question, and can you tell us about the transition from the prior establishment to this application? I'm sorry said that again, is there any connection between the prior establishment in this application? I do not believe no there's, not okay, then I will go to the hands I have Mrs Brown just have to meet yourself. This is brown right, I'm unmuted now! Thank you. Is there a backyard outside patio? Another is not okay. Thank you. You have Marcos Marco. Thank you with the same observation, as did before motion to approve okay. I will second that I'm assuming Barry had his hand at the second. So we have approval second, so this will go down as a motion to approve, unless someone raise their hand to say no, not voting for cause or abstaining. Seeing none. I think we can move to item 1D. This is the entity to be porn by Simon. Horn deviate the writing room so I'll, be very thankful to hear the synopsis. So please go ahead. Sorry Abraham! I lost you. No. I was just saying that I was ready for the applicant for 1d. Okay, would that person raise their hand through the participants, menu or just wave at us or something? I believe that Simon Oren is that time? One d is there, you go, try speaking again Simon. Can you hear me now? Yes yeah? I was asking for you to I'm on you yeah good evening, so I have. I have lived in the neighborhood for the last 25 years. I live on 79th street, my kids go to wagner and ps6. I own cafe de alsace for the last 15 years, and we had the opportunity, just in the last few weeks, to take over the riding room, which is right next door. So we would like to to create a new american restaurant in there with the same the same chef, Philippe Rousseau. That is the shepherd Cafe alsace. So you know we are a full service restaurant. We do not have tvs by the way. I think we are the only restaurant in on second avenue. That does not have a TV, but we got two stars from the times and we hope to get at least two stars for the new restaurant great. Thank you very much so looking at the hands, if there's anyone on public do your unmute. Otherwise I'm going to go with Mrs Brown. First I saw Judy Schneider yeah Judy's back right, let's go with Judy and then Jordan Hi. There Simon, I just want to say first place: Simon's restaurants, five Napkin burgers that I've been in they've run very well very well kept and he's a real credit to the neighborhood. A couple of questions: will you be keeping the name, the writing room and no in the beginning we thought that we will use it, but no we'll change to still an american name, but maybe the reading room, but not the writing room. Okay, and what about the Interior? It has a very lovely interior. Will you be keeping that we'll keep most of it yeah? I think it's very handsome restaurant, but we'll do some renovations yeah. When they first opened their food was wonderful, but towards the end they really started to go downhill. Will you continue to have they had great brunches on Saturday and Sunday? I love branches. I mean we specialize in branch, so branch will be a big, a big feature for us good. Well, I only support whatever this man does so far. It's been very good for the community. Thank you. Thank you. Judy Jordan, you had your hand up. Yes, I did Cafe Da Sas is a real asset to our community. Thank you. So very much there has been a rumor going around that building is going to come down. Have you do you? Can you comment on that? Do you know anything about it? So yes, so we were told that about a year ago that we have we have to vacate in August of a month ago or two months ago. That was a year ago and very sadly we start looking for for locations. You know we love the without we love the location, we love, we love the neighborhood, we love the community and the community really likes us. I think so only but right about March or April of this year. They postponed the the evictions of all the other tenants at the moment they gave us a year so and they're very vague. I do not I you know I'd like to stay there forever, but and they by the way, promised us that if they take the building down and build a 20-story building, which I think that is what they want to do, they would like us to come back. You know after they finish the construction. That's all I know I know it's vague, but that's what all the information I'm getting from them, which coding was that about? That's the 1695, that's the building! The cafe alsace is located in. Thank you very much. So do we have Jordan? I do not think we started nice. I muted myself. Okay, thank you for confirming the rumor, certainly replacing that lovely building with your fabulous establishment with the 20-story apartment building does not strike me as a real plus for the community. I'm sure somebody will make money from it, but we'll see what real estate prices can justify something. So please do stay in the neighborhood. However, it works out. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so I know Mrs Brown's hand was up and if we can keep kind of comments to the actual application location, that would be very much appreciated: okay, Mrs Brown and then we'll go to Marco. Thank you, Mr Oren. Thank you very much for taking over the writing room site. I've always enjoyed going to that restaurant. For the past six years I had visited Elaine's restaurant a couple of times, but I love the environment of the writing room. So if you could keep that decor or something similar to that, would warm my heart- and I know you'll do a good job and thank you thank you and marco. Yes, I'd like to ask a question how many people, or how many chairs you are planning to have in that Pacific right now. The Cfo of the Pa of the writing room is a hundred and forty. I saw that you do not have Pa. Do it. Oh, I checked, but I did not. I did not see it, but you should put in the application. Thank you. No more questions. Thank you so much the only thing I would, as I say, I will support your application. Thank you. Thank you. You also have Barry Schneider Russell Okay good evening Simon, one quick question: if you get a, when do you plan to open the restaurant, so you know between two months to four months, very good godspeed. Thank you very much and then russell squire motion to approve. I will. I will second that so again we have a motion to approve every second. So if you are voting, no, not voting for cause or abstaining raise your hand. Otherwise you could go as an approval and I'll remark that Laurie Boris has joined for this vote. Okay, then we will go to item 2A. This is oh sorry, do we have the applicant for item 2A? Yes, Lisa is here hi good evening. Do you hear me yes, hi good evening, I'm the director of human resources for the plaza today and unfortunately, due to the Covid-19. You know that the hotel has been closed and we are still currently closed with, unfortunately, not a reopening date at the time. But that being said, I am going through some changes as far as the corporate structure, so, as you know that David Cohen and Tim Starr are no longer with us at the hotel. So I'm looking to add, you know a new president, a new vice president. I will be coming off of the board and the new secretary will be added and I'm hoping that we reopen sometime by second quarter of 2021. Well, thank you very much and we hope the same. Thank you before I go to Marco. Do we have any public members with their hands right? Oh we're on the phone Judy Schneider has okay, I'm a little confused. So do we have the names of the new people? What are we voting? I'm going to be really honest and tell you. I do not have them with me, because I'm in my house, I'm working from home. So is this an information only item? That's what I do not understand: yeah! Oh okay! Thank you. Lisa you're, welcome! Wait! I'm going to clear it. The application showed as a corporate change. So is this a preemptive one, or do you actually have the I d, the individuals that are going to be rolling off? I have the well I'm rolling off and I do have the names, but I do not have them in my house. Okay. So sorry, no okay, so this is an actionable application. You just do not have the names you can, but you are rolling off and there will be replacements, yeah, okay. How? Then we ca not vote on this Abraham? Can you, if you do not know who the people are, who are going to replace that the existing officers they sh that may peruse the actual application they should be listed in the application, even if they are not yeah, even if they are not present on the call if they are listed on the application? That is the and they are oh here we go, so I do not see the names in the actual application Lisa. Ah you do not. Of course I do not have my file here I mean will or someone else feel free to sanity check me, but I'm looking. Oh I'm looking through I'm looking through it as well, and the committee members also have the application as well so right now you saw the name of the references. That's not the right thing, yeah right, correct! Yes, I saw that I'm seeing the application type the license for, but I do not see the replacements to the hold existing. I'm looking bear with me. I'm trying to go through my hold on one second, okay hold on one. Second, I'm just looking for my menace. So while she does that I'm seeing some hands Judy, I'm going to hold on you since you already spoke, I'm going to go to cause first yeah rather than take up tonight. Why do not we approve a conditional on the them sending us the names? It's like you read my mind cause, so I can do that tomorrow. Well, I can send you the names tomorrow because yeah, because ultimately the names are not germaine. It's the fact that there is a change. So if you were able to provide those, I would be in support of approval, but I know, but let me go. Let me go to marco. First and then to Judy and then ah are you? Can you control me? Can you hear me yeah? Yes, okay, I would like to motion to approve okay great well. I had already I had already just agreed to go back to Judy, so Judy. We will go back to you with the motion on the floor yeah. I think that's fine. As long as you have the names before it goes to the Full Board yep. I absolutely agree. Thank you. So, marco. I will second it, although even I know Russell raised his hand. So there is a second and with that we will take this as a motion to improve unless there's any hands for no abstention or not voting for cause. Seeing none. Okay, then that is the extent of the agenda, but I know that there was one. So there is not another aob matter, but I know that Jordan, if you're still here, I know that you had asked to have a conversation relating to the third fighter: bicycle delivery operators. So, just for your benefit and knowing that we are taking it seriously, what we have decided to do is that we're going to have a joint session with street life, small business and transportation to take up this issue and identify how we can be supportive of restaurants and figure out a good way to be able to mitigate the issues that were experienced, especially in this time of Covid-19. Thank you very much. I assume will there'll be announcements so I'll know about it. Are you considering asking dio well who's regular? Is there any government entity that should be included in the discussion yeah? So I think I that's why I wanted to include transportation for the DOB. I think I'd also want to include the electives, because this is a multi- party, multi- faceted element and also if we can even get some of the heads of the delivery services, even if they're just there to listen. I think that would also be very a step forward, because I know we've gone about this in many different angles, but it might be worthwhile to get all of the stakeholders in a call. Well, in a hall, they have to be socially separated, but anyhow, yes, thank you very much great idea. Really that's going to be a bit of work, and I appreciate that what no your suggestion is we'll take in so yeah we're going to work on that if within the month, but definitely it's on the on the pot. Thank you Jordan do I have any other. Do I have any other hands for emotion to Adjourn or any other motion russell one second, Russell and Elita said to tell you thank you for that Russell, okay motion to adjourn okay. I will second that and if there's none opposed- and we will conclude and thank you, everyone for your time, bye all right.",
