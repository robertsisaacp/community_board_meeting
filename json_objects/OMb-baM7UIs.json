            "fullTranscript": "Miss Daniel, whenever you're ready to start the recording is in process and the meeting is being live, streamed to YouTube, Miss, Daniel, you're, muted right now, I didn't realize that was me. Thank you. I was going on and on I ignored, Daniel, I'm acting for Sharon Wetterburn, while she's away it's good to see everybody who I can I see just kick it off by giving an update from our last meeting in a little bit. So we chair, tyus, yes, we know. Obviously it's epidemic is going on and a lot of kids are doing remote learning, but we know that there's been an issue with internet access, particularly within NYCHA developments, and so chair tires wrote to some elected officials, as well as to NYCHA and to a couple of providers recommending that they get together to figure out how to provide universal internet access at NYCHA houses, in particular for kids, who are remote learning there. So that is one update. That's happened recently and, as we know, as we've all seen, the mayor announced that elementary school kids will be going to going back to in-person learning on December 7th, but I wanted to find out. If the rest of the group has any additional updates. You're muted, was there a question. No I thought you were speaking. I saw your mouth moving. I thought you were I asked if there were, if anybody needed any updates from I'm sorry, you saw this movie, so I thought you were trying to say something. I'm sorry, okay, yeah, I'm talking to you Marva who was speaking okay, I. Can't we can't hear you. We can't hear you no now. So while we wait for Marvada to figure out the audio situation, I know she's trying to say something: I want to. Does anybody else? Have any updates or anything they'd like to share with the group or to discuss? Well, yes, this is Miss Kenzie hi. How are you good? Thank you. I miss seeing you guys in person. Oh my thing with the school is it's like a big divide. You have half of the parents who want the school open and the other half still want the schools closed so and then there's also the issue of there's a lot of students at home that don't have the needed computers or what have you to even complete the work that's been given to them remotely. So I'm hoping on this platform or this meeting that those topics will be addressed in and that we come up with some solutions, but I mean with Covid-19 supposedly on the rise again. How long will schools be out if they do reopen? I mean you know it's a tough thing, because you know they haven't already and now those the guidelines are completely different and they've completely changed it and they're now going to be learning. You know. The kids who have already signed up will now be learning in person, but then the kids who didn't sign up before won't be learning in person. So I mean it is a big divide and so I think it is worth us talking about what we see as the major issue, as opposed to I mean in particular, kids not being able to get the kind of education that they need because of everything that's going on. So what are you? What kind of do you have suggestions, thoughts? Well being that we have this committee, or is our focus supposed to really be on the students within the confines of community board aid and seeing that they are receiving the much needed tools that they need at home? I. Think that's a good place to start worth us trying to reach out to I was thinking that maybe we could attend some of our local cc meetings and see what they're talking about and see what it seems like the students within the confines of community board. 8 need and go from there in terms of figuring out how we might be helpful. I'm thinking a lot of the students, a lot of the students that a lot of students that don't have the computers or not able to access the classroom platform I had suggested on one of the local meetings that you just mentioned, that what happened to sending home the homework packets that they used to send home over the summer. So you know especially some of the students live with caregivers or older adults, especially the younger children, and they may not be internet savvy. It seems to me that there wasn't an option in terms of how the students would be learning, especially for the younger children that them have older caregivers. What have you there's always pen and paper so now, instead of students sitting home for weeks and months with a gadget that don't work or with a gadget not having a gadget at all? Why wasn't work assignments or classwork assignments sent home that they may could have returned on a weekly basis or a bi-weekly basis, maybe email them somewhere or even mailed. It back to the teacher I understand that students need interaction, but unfortunately they can't interact with each other. Right now, Pers in person and then even on the computer, if they don't have a computer, what are they going to do? They still have to learn, but I don't have enough talk about sending home the assignments via paper. If you don't have a computer, then now you're just sitting there it, but if we're able to talk to them and see if we might be able to help some type of solution, I know that they were doing meals at school. So maybe that might be a point where kids might be able to get enrichment work that they can or even assignments that they can turn back in I mean yeah, that's what they don't have any problems over the summer I mean my child is graduating college I. Don't really have any kids in school right now, but throughout all of his years they made sure that they sent home enough work to keep them busy over the summer and prior Covey children were still over to over the went to recess or the holiday breaks, or in the summer recess they would get packets assignment packs at home. But now everything is swirling around this computer or you know the virtual, the learning, but it has to be some substitute if the device isn't working. I was just gonna say that am I echoing badly or something okay. I was just gonna say that I mean I have a child that goes to new bridges and for like the last three days that they were in school. He was carrying home every single book, all of his packets and like kind of just waiting until they officially closed the school. So he was coming home with a book bag full of stuff. You know not even a device, and then he left his math book so the first day they were back to remote learning. We had to run to the school, get the math book and there were people. You know teachers at the school waiting to hand out devices to people who didn't have devices at home, so, like I know he does have paper packets and things like that. One thing that I heard at the Cec meeting for 17 was that you know parents, even if they don't feel safe with their kids going into the school. They want to make sure that the kids are involved in the school activities. I think that's always more. The concern, like I'm choosing not to send my kid to in-person school, but I still want him to feel like he's part of the school community, and so how did they make that happen and that's providing times for school pictures, even though they're not physically in the classroom, they can come to the school at a set time to take pictures with the other remote learners. You know there is like a latino heritage month event where everyone was invited, remote learners and in-person students, and things like that. So and you know prior to the holiday there was questions about. Can we still do food drives? Can we still do warm coat exchanges, and things like that, so the community does want to still have the schools, as an access point, for you know, needs to be met within the community and I know Nora. You were saying, like the meals they're still giving out the meals like there was a turkey lunch that was given out at the school prior to Thanksgiving, but for myself and just feeling like how can we make sure the kids are safe and healthy? I do like that they're saying they're going to be doing more Covid-19 testing in the school, because that was always the argument you know in the city itself was above three percent for infection rates, so they made the decision to close the schools, but infection rates within the schools themselves were very low in comparison and so I think the idea that you know they're going to bring the kids back next week and just test more often in the schools, the teachers and the students should hopefully add some level of comfort to families. What about because I know that previously, the mayor had said that if parents had not already opted into in-person learning that they would not be able to do so now, it seems like given the new safety measures and all the things that they're trying to do. If parents would like to opt for in-person learning, it seems like they should still be able to do so. I mean the issue of the window, for when you could ask for in-person learning and whether it was going to be extended is a good question. I mean, but it just seems to me that people who didn't want their kids in school, they probably haven't changed their mind at this point. Right I mean if anything the numbers going up across the city mean that they probably don't want their kids in school. That may be true. It's just I did read somewhere that some parents wanted him to expand the window or to offer the window up again. I mean you know. We have more information now about you know the numbers are going up around the city, but we do have more information now about how it's going to be cool, because the infection rate is so low. Some people might change, but you know people may not have maybe rocky right I mean and then one thing that I don't think they talk about enough. Are these Learning Bridges sites which I didn't know about? But you know it's like in the neighborhood community, centers and stuff and like if you're, a working parent and you need to get a place for your child to go if school is not open. This is available where they're not in a school, but it's providing a safe space for your child to go and do remote learning and I feel like that. Wasn't advertised enough because it could be an option for working families or even if you know grandma's at home, doesn't know how to work an iPad. Maybe you could send the child to this Learning Bridges site, which you know supposedly is allowed to have social distancing. Everyone keeps their masks on the kids, are getting meals and hopefully again not bringing something home to grandma, just because she can't work the iPad, so I feel like they didn't advertise those Learning Bridges sites enough right. So that's when the like. When they went all remote, they would have the Learning Bridges signs open for people who get the kids of essential workers. Basically right, not even all remote. It was open. I! Think, even when the school opened yeah because I was referred because I was asking about after school- and this was the issue there was. If your school doesn't have DOE employees doing after school, they were not allowed to have after-school programs run by outside organizations and things like that. Limiting the number of people, the kids are exposed to and limiting the number of people in the schools, and so they said, oh, do the Learning, Bridges site and I was like well that doesn't really help because he's going to school anyway, it's just you know, being forced to pick him up by 2:30. That was our issue just the fact that after school was not available, but the Learning Bridges sites were operating while the kids were in person any other issues that we've noted with the in person learning or with any with the remote learning. Anything at all. Any other concerns that we have well there's a lot of talk about the home school. So a lot of those parents who don't send me back into the classroom setting they are opting for homeschooling, I'm not really sure where the city stands on that. Well, if these parents do in fact really begin to do the homeschooling is this something where they would get paid or is it any kind of incentive on homeschooling the children? I am not sure about that. Not too many people want to pull out the system, but they might given how crazy things are. But I am not I'm not aware of any incentives or anything like that around or any subsidies around homeschooling right Henry. What about you? Have you heard any kind of incentives involving the homeschooling or have you heard anything about that being an option? I, never even heard of it. Anyone speaking about withdrawing you mean like withdrawing your kids from DOE all together and just creating your own curriculum or doing like one of these online curriculums for home school. No I've never even heard of that in New, York City yeah, that's a lot of parents are opting for because there's too much back and forth and then we don't even know where we stand with Covid-19 is here this month is going so you don't know, that's true. There's a lot of confusion. I see her talking hearing oh I was asking my husband because he has a lot of people in education that he knows and stuff like that, and so I was asking he said. Yeah he's heard of people homeschooling their kids during the pandemic, and I'm like. Oh that's news to me yeah. So you know I'm like wondering what eight the children within the compliance, the schools within the confines of board eight. What can we offer or parents are reaching out to the board what type of solutions or what are offering to them with their complaints? So the one thing I thought that we might be able to do. There's a couple of things about me to be able to do. We might if we get a little more information about the things that we I have questions about. It might make sense to figure out what problems that you know that the parents themselves are seeing or the problems that Rcz's are seeing and see how, if we either might be another voice in the room to push whatever they need along or if there's something that they you know physically need that we might be able to help with like volunteering or anything like that. So those are my two thoughts, either through advocacy or through volunteering. Those are my thoughts of how we might be able to help. What are your thoughts? Oh, we were hopefully not sure who from Dv8 Senate it was it Julia. Did you send it the we she sent us in? Yes, thank you. I appreciate that that's very helpful, yeah, that's very helpful, so that is one of the that is one of the ways that we could help. At least we have the information about homeschooling. Maybe it's something that could go out in the newsletter, I'm not sure, but that is one of the ways you know for those parents who are in fear of sending me a children back home schooling is highly regulated in New. York state has one of the most strictest and stringent home schooling laws. Students that are home, schooled in New York state have to still pass. You know: state certification, exams, math and English. It does not change. I mean it seems, like I, don't know, Julia said easier for people to use the actual remote learning that they're, providing because either way it seems like the issues would remain like if you're having a hard time doing remote learning it doesn't seem like homeschooling would necessarily be easier if you know if we're talking about the same problems that we're talking about here. But you know what are your thoughts I would just think like. If you know, you're gonna have a child at home with someone who may not be internet savvy from my understanding of homeschooling, because I had a cousin when she was like in Ohio. She homeschooled her son, but it was like all internet based learning as well, so I don't know that would really solve the problem of people who need home school or would think homeschooling would be a better option for them, and then you know, as Julia said, like still meeting the benchmarks that are required and things like that because in New York like you mess around and don't send your kids to school, you'll have ACS knocking at your door and stuff, and it's and just like even the I remember it was an issue registering how many hours your child is learning and making sure all the documents are filed, because the state is still keeping track of the child and making sure that they're learning so I don't know, and we just there was an email that was just sent out right, saying that there's going to be enrichment classes offered to families. Now that was sent out to the community board. There's a meeting that we're supposed to I don't know. Are you going to this meeting? I know I registered for the meeting I think it's next week, one of the Education Committee Council meetings to see more of what the needs are, because even just sitting at this in at the Cec 17 meeting, I really didn't hear people complaining so much about the school honestly I didn't as far as like I feel like in these meetings a lot of times it's school officials and not necessarily parents who are coming to these meetings. It's principles like we're, safe, we're ready. This is how we prepared for remote learning. This is how we prepared for in-person learning, but from you know my recollection other than like, how can my child stay a part of the community? How are we going to do a coat drive? How are we going to do a food drive? You know, I, don't necessarily hear complaints about the learning either you want your kid in school and the school closed or you don't want your kid in school and you want like a good home learning environment, but lack of devices I, don't know or lack of ability to use a device. I, don't know that I've heard complaints about that, but maybe I'm just not talking to the right people well, I mean I, think that people who are probably having any activity of probably not attending cc meetings. They tend to be attended by people who, like have more ability to like get connected to the things that they need in my experience anyway. But it's still but folks who are parents there may have or may have some information that they've heard around about people who had issues with getting connected to internet or with defenses I mean we see in the newspaper we read in the newspaper. People are having issues with obtaining the devices, particularly when DOE was then reporting. Kids reporting parents to the state register to report to ACS about not participating in remote learning when they had a device that didn't even work or didn't have a device at all. So we do know. That is how you know. We've heard that, through you know, like legal aid and stuff, like that, the people who defend parents and kind of issues- so they do have some insight as to parents who need things so I, don't know and I know that there are some non-profit groups who are raising money to give kids devices that don't have right. So maybe we should try and reach out to the organizations and see where there's a need or a way of connecting to families who might have a need so that we can say: okay, it shouldn't all just rely on non-profit organizations. If there's a need that the DOE or you know the government should be providing or city council members should be providing, then let us you know advocate on your behalf. In that way, I agree with us sending a letter about Wi-Fi being free and accessible to all. Did anything come of that? Do you know that letter was mailed for NYCHA? Yes, unfortunately, the one of the is that echo okay. Is there still an echo okay yeah there? It is okay, y' all go ahead: I'll come back, I gotta, get rid of the psycho I. Think well, can I chime in again I think yeah, we're going to be I want to be fair when it comes to those households that may not have internet service or that they have a guardian or an elder as the child's guardian of what happened. What you're saying is exactly what the district's office criticism was about the NYCHA letter, because that was the assumption that it's only Nycha's students and residents that don't have access to internet and Wi-Fi. But you know that was the letter that went out for the most part. The public Service agencies Verizon optimum spectrum. They did and they still do provide free internet connection and free Wi-Fi for niche residents. But as you're saying like it, the need extends beyond just nitrate. There are people in regular private housing that needs these services. They don't have it. So we totally understand. That's definitely something that needs to be addressed, but the position is how to do it, and this echo is driving me man. It's true now is this something where that this should be something that the council person gets involved with and make sure that students within their district have everything that they need, so that they can get the proper education or continue continuing education where they left off prior to Kovitz I mean unless the city comes with its own Wi-Fi program. It's going to be up to the individual public service agencies that actually, you know, serve those areas of need. Optimum needs to just be like all right. You know what you don't have to be an optimum customer to jump on our free Wi-Fi same with spectrum same with Verizon staying with Rca, all the other things. I'm sorry I was just thinking what were basically when you use universal broadband access, which we don't have yeah. So you know it's. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi is not like electricity. People just can't go outside and tap hole, so I could tap and you could tap Brooklyn children's museum Wi-Fi, but you have to be on that same block, though so you know, this is definitely something that the public service agencies will have to actually step in and fill the void for they're going to be all asking the same thing: what's their incentive, that's the form of 2017 didn't give enough, but that's going to be their thing. So you do understand your point. Echoes driving me bad I, I've closed everything, I, don't know where it's coming from right. So now you know back to my point in terms of being feared, fair to those families in regard to okay. If they have Wi-Fi, we they need to at least be getting the packets home. They need to impact if they don't have Wi-Fi. They should not just be sitting there with nothing because they don't have Wi-Fi and even in the homes that may have it, and we have to take into consideration that if this is not a one size fit all they're, not all under 30 or under 40. It's unfair to put certain amount of pressure on them as well, so if they could improvise, I'm not going to criticize them if solution for them I agree. One way, I think that they could look into expanding Wi-Fi is to expand the number of link NYC kiosks. That could be a way to do it as well, but it sounds like we kind of need to get a little bit more or maybe we need to reach out to kind of see if people are having trouble. We do know the phone. Some people are having issues with their access to Wi-Fi, as well as access to actual devices. So I do think that the packets that you're mentioning could be helpful for people who don't have that access. So maybe we should reach out to see if we might be able to encourage them to provide those things. Let's see if they are actually doing that, because I think Marvin kids in some instances are receiving packets at the start of the pause. I know that apple had donated like 100,000, iPads and stuff were those all distributed. I know that there was an issue with students actually claiming them were they distributed. That is the question. There are resources out there. Maybe it's just an issue of getting the information to the people in greatest need. Everything is pretty much all digital right now. Maybe that's why they don't know, but there is there are resources so I guess. Maybe we can discuss how best to disseminate the information. Do we need to send letters to homes is, does sending letters to homes I feel like you're, saying yeah, it's all digital. So if they don't know how to access, don't get the device that's problematic as well. That would be up to the individual school parent coordinators. I do know that Miss Weber had a list at one point in time. I don't know if that is still current I think if the board of education, if you have the choice between remote and in class or in school, it should be the option when they started talking about these devices, it should have been a choice. Well, you know we're not. We don't know what, if you have Wi-Fi certain things in your home, but you have an option of the device or the assignment package, which one would be more convenient for you. They never had the option of getting that's. What's bothering me that they never had the option of getting a homework packet or an assignment packet when Covid-19 first started well, Miss Kinsey is getting the packet is that if the parents and students don't understand what's in the packet, they still need online services and learning to engage in their lessons right. That's what I was thinking all of my friends, literally every single one of my friends is a current DOE teacher and they all have the exact same criticism that they are not themselves given the tools and resources to navigate this learning thing. So, instead of just contemplating hey, maybe it's just a Wi-fi thing or an internet thing. Maybe we need to get some teachers on board in these discussions and start understanding what their actual needs are because ultimately they're the ones that's going to be blamed, for you know the gigantic learning curve and the disparity of what you know. Many students are going to experience when testing does resume in 2021 or 2020. You know so we need to you need to think broader than it's just a resource issue. For some people it is a resource issue for others. It's you know it's a combination of different things. It you know it's, we have to think hard and just not be one issued find it. This is not something that's going to continue in the next two months, so we really do need to consider being more proactive and not just isolate one area. True I mean I, think we've gone far beyond I. Think with two tech dependent I mean it was a time we didn't have computers and we just used the book. What happened to the book that explains the work so we're in a crisis like this. We have to refer back to what we used to do. I. Don't think students should be sitting home because they don't have a device and that's a wrap now they're, not learning so the same books that they would have in the classroom. Aren't those books being sent home with the assignment and lawyer with a teacher's phone number if they should need have what or the parents you have any questions, okay and they actually really do spend a lot of their time on the phone with their students I text, my son's teacher every day, so their personal information is out there so right. That's it I think what we're seeing is that there's a what this situation has shown is the just discrepancy and quality of education right. It's. What we're talking about is very school specific because my son's in a public school here, my other doc, my daughter's in an independent school, but my son I think is in one of the better public schools and they were prepared. Like I said he was coming home with a book bag full of stuff every single day, and it's not just what he's learning on a laptop. He has actual books, he has printouts. He has packets, but if an other school is shitty and didn't prepare- or you know- and the teacher won't give out a cell phone number or you know- they're- not tech, savvy, that's very specific to individual schools and I. Think it's showing like the diversity and quality of education in this city and across the nation right they're, saying like this pandemic is showing how poorly schools are doing for the students and I, don't necessarily and the solution. I, don't know what the solution is, but yeah everyone should go home with a packet. Everyone should have an electronic device right like they were offering us a device, but I'm like we have three laptops here. We don't need a device. Why would we take it from a kid who doesn't need it or who needs it right? So I think. If you know, parents and the schools have to be communicating and if they're not to let them know like what resources are available to them. I think we need to like figure out how we can bridge this communication divide, because it's showing some kids are getting good education. Some are getting decent education. Some are getting bad at education and I. Don't know that it's as simple as sending home a packet, because if a grandma doesn't know how to do this math. What good is it going to do, because somebody still has to teach the child how to do that math, and so there has to be some kind of learning in place with right, a certified teacher or something, and so that's why they should have the devices so that they can learn from their teachers, whether it's at home or at school or at one of these Learning Bridges sites. Yeah. When I didn't know the map I had to look in the book. Miss Neil you'd brought up an interesting and aspect that was missing from what we were talking about before, which is the teacher's voices, and it does seem like they would be probably the best and easiest people to connect with who would have the best information about what's missing and the issues that they're having you know connecting with students or connecting parents? Do you have any connections with teachers within Cda who might be able to talk to us about what they need? I can try to get some like the teachers that I know they range from kindergarten, all the way through high school and they usually for the most part they're in the periphery of CBA and Board, two board three Board six board. Sixteen, but I will definitely reach out to them. It is not appropriate. I, honestly, don't think that it's going to be much of a difference. You know where their school is located so long as it's a Dmv school, and you know that I can tell you that a lot of issues are like the DOB brass. Is they change the platforms all the time the teachers are like this one works and then the DOE changes, something that doesn't work necessarily, so you know there's a lot of variables that need to be considered. Where is this echo coming from one of my son's teachers or the administrator just texted me like literally right, while I'm sitting here so I, can ask I'm on the community board? Is there any concerns that you have about? You know what resources or supplies you need, as the teacher and you know the needs of your students, because I know sometimes there's like eight kids on zoom and then other days there's only three or four. So some kids are not logging in they were there, they did have devices, and you know why aren't they coming to even virtual school? If that's available, so I can ask the teachers at new bridges, I. Think one of the easiest ways would be for me to reach out to Shannon and even quasi, because I know they found the list together. Just to give a list of the parent coordinators and the Pca presidents, they would have the direct contact information for teachers in the schools. They would be able to reach out abroad to see which teachers would be interested in meeting with us in the coming months and to just or just emailing us the you know the issues that they're having in the meantime. If the committee wants to discuss some questions for a very quick two minutes or less survey, that would be ideal, we could send it to the parent coordinators and the Pca presidents. That way, we don't have to rely on someone actually remembering to come and log into a meeting. When you know teachers are already working well beyond their normal education day. So if you guys want to spend the next couple minutes crafting some very simple questions, but that him home the point of what you're trying to accomplish I, don't I do not have a problem contacting Sharon Quasi tomorrow and seeing if they have any type of updated list or even if the list is outdated, we still do have a list of all the schools. We can email it to them or mail it to them and just get something going. You know for the January meeting or the February meeting depending on when you want to meet next. Okay, I think one thing we want to know is: what are the? What is the biggest challenge that they're having right now that they've seen with their students I think is then is one question I had the same question that was the question I was gonna: ask do they feel they need to better do their job, because is there anything that they need like tangible items, right I? Think: okay, Miss Kenzie? You were mentioning stuff about like the package and get the older parents. If you could formulate all the many different intricacies of that particular issue into a solid question. That would be really helpful for right now, because it is a very important issue and it's definitely one that needs to be addressed and immediate in some way. Yeah. What assignment would assignment packages be more convenient for those who don't have internet service? Would assignment packages be more convenient for those who have older, caregivers or grandparents that be their guardians? Or is it possible for students to have both this isn't an option? That's all I'm or what books provided. What I want to know too prior to Covid-19 and everything that happened surrounding it? I I've heard a lot about the students receiving devices, but in receiving devices I know. Miss Henry said that Durgen her children school was pretty much on top of it, but how many schools actually send home books as well? It's being provided to those that have, or are they just jumping on remotely and just listening to lectures from the teachers I. Don't necessarily think books are used that much I, don't know I mean my kids. Are young kindergarten and first grade so I. Think oh I, don't know a high schooler, but I think they photocopy a lot and make packets. You know so maybe they're copying it from some book or they're, printing worksheets and they're stapling them together, so they're using those. So it's not necessarily books in the traditional sense of like what we had when we were children, but I don't feel like it's many books these days right. The photocopy is good from the book right also I do know that charters operate a little differently from the DOE in terms of books and photocopies. During my experience with the DOE I can honestly say that, aside from the english books, he didn't have books, it wasn't a math book. It wasn't a history book that wasn't a science book. It was all photo copies. That's definitely something that we can bring. Do you think a book would help you say. I was also at some meetings and there's like classes that parents can take so that they can learn math. You know like so it's like you need to help your child with this assignment. Come take this class I forgot about that. So these are things I mean if, but if you're, not in the meeting, you're not going to know about that, but these are things that the DOE is providing like. Even still, although the new math right, like new math, my nephew was 15, and so when he was like 8 and ten and I was like what is this just do multiplication? Why are we making boxes and all this yeah like so teaching parents, the new math and stuff, like that they do provide those kind of classes and but again, if you're not aware and you're, not at those meetings to know about them? Is it really advertised I, don't know but I think in respect to I? Don't know if you want to say non-traditional parents or tech savvy parents like if we're thinking of a survey like what complaints have you heard from non-traditional parents that might be helpful for you to assist them in assisting their children in learning or something like that. Yeah I mean I hate to think about some of the households where you had parents. Unfortunately, that really wasn't good I could only imagine what's going on in those households and if the gadget isn't working, hey no big deal, I mean it's just really a mess. When you really think about this, that's because you do have those students that didn't have the support in the home from the get-go and I wonder. What's going on with them at least they had school, it's a few. You know what I mean and even people who are speaking and that that's actually another very significant concern, that's something that has been communicated to the district office, the last couple of months prior to the summer break. You know they're teachers that they know that their chil, their students are in unsafe environments, but at this point in time they have no way of contacting authorities, prove it first of all we're assuming that every teacher is tech. Savvy, that's number one. Every teacher is not tech savvy. Just like there are parents that can't navigate this. You know remote learning. There are teachers that are struggling as well, and you know it's they're, just there's just so many different intersections and variables. This point. We can't even say that it's a race thing or an economics thing or a socio-economic thing bordering race. It's just there's just so many different variables that cross every realm of existence. So we really do need to hunker down and think of. As you can see, education is very important to me, yeah so yeah that all have to mute ourselves while we're not talking because you're probably hearing your voice, echoing through everybody else's computer Mr Grossa. That is a very good point about the teaching, aids and manipulatives for younger students. You know with remote learning we have to rely on parents to have that now the question becomes how many parents actually know what a manipulative actually is so I think we have a few questions for the survey. Do you do we have? That is Neil? Yes, I'm actually compiling all the questions right now, so in reverse order. I have this question from Laurel De Grosa about teaching Aids and manipulatives for younger students. Are you know, versus high school students unable to understand assignments on iPads like graphs and essays? That is exactly right in addition to that, just basic math, like addition and subtraction multiplication division through- and you know for the most part when I was teaching I used money because it was just easier. Another question we have is complaints from non-traditional parents that you know what they need to assist them in there and they're, not only learning but assisting their students books. Are they provided, or is everything just digital? What about photocopying assignment packages? Are they even effective, and if so, can they be used? More often work books provided prior to Covid-19? Can we go back to that if they were effective, what tangible items defending would be beneficial for you right now that could assist in education delivery and what is the biggest challenge that you are facing or experiencing right now as an educator? Those are the questions that I have obtained from the last like 10 minutes of conversation. That's what I have to do sounds good yeah and please be advised that before I even send this out to the parent coordinators and the PTA presidents, I will send it out to the Google Group just for your review and you all can just please respond to the email and let me know what you would like to add change or whatever but I say under two minutes to complete, because in my experience with CBA sending out these surveys, people can be very lazy with their responses and even their thought process in trying to respond so the shorter, the better and if we can just keep the questions as closely related to what we believe their experience to be. That would be ideal to get some tangible information that we can utilize for the letter crafting or discussions with the department of education and charter schools. Or you know what have you, but you know, Miss Kinsey does bring home and everyone else a valid point of. We can't allow our you know these kids to be left behind. Unfortunately, miss Henry, not every parent, is like you very true, okay. So thank you. So much Neil, it's really appreciated. I think this would really help us get to next steps. How we could really be try to help the students in Cda or, however, we can be helpful. So thank you so much for offering to do this. Miss Jordan. Did you have anything you want to say: hey, listen, Miss Jordan. Did you have anything you wanted to add? No everything was okay, Mr Rosa. Did you have anything you want us to add anything to add yes, I want to. Thank you, I appreciate your input and any kind of information, or anything that the parent coordinator sends over or voe in reference to the students within our district. You know I, don't mind collecting it. What have you and disseminating I will definitely send it out. Sharon Butterburn actually does a very good job of keeping us aggressive everything that the DOE in the Ufc offers. So we send it out if it's not redundant and it is something new we definitely do send it out. As I said earlier today, the UFT offerings for enrichment services is definitely a time when you know like people that know people with children kind of get on them about their kids education, not that you guys need to be overseers or anything, but you kind of need to be overseers. I just want to ask: is there a specific school Miss Kinsey that you have in mind? That's maybe not doing what they should be doing like that. Maybe we can you know contact directly and say this is a problem in your school. This is what we're hearing or go to the Cec and say we're hearing that this school is having a problem, because if we don't know specific situations, then you know it's all very broad right. So is there a specific situation that you know of that? Maybe we can really advocate for specifically well no different people, no two famous one science fit all and in terms of schools like I said my son is a college graduate, but I do know. Individuals with younger children, that's in school and prior to Covid-19 I did pay close attention to the school. I. Think it's 167 whatever it is on the corner of Schenectady and Eastern Parkway, but in throughout my travels, what I'm saying. Sometimes people start talking about their different issues so that I'm going to be out and about like I was explaining to Julia. If it's any kind of paperwork she want to share to me, I would gladly pick it up and have it with me and disseminate it to the different residents that have school-aged kids that may be having these challenges or difficulties dealing with the devices or other challenges that has been presented since Covid-19, because we want to bridge the gap. As you said earlier, and now I've been on meeting because there's other complaints with similar complaints. So we at the board may have information they may not have on that meeting and then I can share it. I mean it's really about our community and the future of our community, but we have a bunch of kids that didn't learn nothing. Two years went by. They missed out on an important part of their life. That's our community and that's our future. So we all have to take part in doing something to make sure that they stay on track. Okay, if nobody else has anything to add, I think that we are ready to adjourn anything okay, I guess we can adjourn thanks. Everybody have a good night. Everyone thank you for indulging me and my talkativeness I. Just love education. Me too, I love it too good night. Take everyone bye,",
            "summary": "Obviously, it's epidemic is going on and a lot of kids are doing remote learning, but we know that there's been an issue with internet access, particularly within NYCHA, developments, and so chair tires.\nThat's happened recently and, as we know, as we've all seen, The mayor announced that elementary school kids will be going to going back to in-person learning on December 7th, but I wanted to find out.\nI was thinking that maybe we could attend some of our local cc meetings and see what they're talking about and see what it seems like the students within the confines of community board.\nI'm thinking a lot of the students, a lot of the students that a lot of students that don't have the computers or not able to access the classroom platform I had suggested on one of the local meetings that you just mentioned, that what happened to sending home the homework packets that they used to send home over the summer.\nI was just gonna say that I mean I, have a child that goes to new bridges and for like the last three days that they were in school.\nHe was carrying home every single book, all of his packets and like kind of just waiting until they officially closed the school.\nYou know: teachers at the school waiting to hand out devices to people who didn't have devices at home, so, like I know he does have paper packets and things like that.\nOne thing that I heard at the Cec meeting for 17 was that you know parents, even if they don't feel safe with their kids going into the school.\nWe still do warm coat exchanges, and things like that, so the community does want to still have the schools, as an access point, for you.\nI do like that they're saying they're going to be doing more Covid-19 testing in the school, because that was always the argument you know in the city itself was above three percent for infection rates, so they made the decision to close the schools, but infection rates within the schools themselves were very low.\nIn comparison, And, so I think the idea that you know they're going to bring the kids back next week and just test more often in the schools, The teachers and the students should hopefully add some level of comfort to families.\nRight I mean if anything the numbers going up across the city mean that they probably don't want their kids in school.\nAnd like if you're, a working parent and you need to get a place for your child to go if school is not open.\nEveryone keeps their masks on the kids, are getting meals and hopefully again not bringing something home to grandma, Just because she can't work the iPad, so I feel like they didn't advertise those Learning Bridges sites enough right.\nThat was our issue just the fact that after school was not available, but the Learning Bridges sites were operating while the kids were in person.\nOh I was asking my husband because he has a lot of people in education that he knows and stuff like that, and.\nLike I, don't know, Julia said easier for people to use the actual remote learning that they're, providing because either way it seems like the issues would remain like if you're having a hard time doing remote learning it doesn't seem like homeschooling would necessarily be easier.\nDon't know that would really solve the problem of people who need home school or would think homeschooling would be a better option for them, and.\nThen you know, as Julia said, like still meeting the benchmarks that are required and things like that because in New York like you mess around and don't send your kids to school, you'll have ACS knocking at your door and stuff, and it's.\nI. Think it's next week, one of the Education Committee Council meetings to see more of what the needs are, because even just sitting at this in at the Cec 17 meeting, I really didn't hear people complaining so much about the school.\nThis is how we prepared for in-person learning, but from you know my recollection other than like, How can my child stay a part of the community.\nAnd, you want like a good home learning environment, but lack of devices.\nWe've heard that, through you, know, like legal aid and stuff, like that, The people who defend parents and kind of issues.\nI want to be fair when it comes to those households that may not have internet service or that they have a guardian or an elder as the child's guardian of what happened, What you're saying is exactly what the district's office criticism was about the NYCHA letter, because that was the assumption that it's only Nycha's students and residents that don't have access to internet and Wi-Fi. You know that was the letter that went out for the most part.\nI, don't know if that is still current, I think if the board of education, if you have the choice between remote and in class or in school, it should be the option when they started talking about these devices, It should have been a choice.\nLike I said he was coming home with a book bag full of stuff, every single day, and it's not just what he's learning on a laptop.\nRight they're, saying like this pandemic is showing how poorly schools are doing for the students and I, don't necessarily and the solution.\nI think we need to like figure out how we can bridge this communication divide, because it's showing some kids are getting good.\nThat's why they should have the devices so that they can learn from their teachers, whether it's at home or at school, or at one of these Learning Bridges, sites.\nI can try to get some like the teachers that I know they range from kindergarten, all the way through high school.\nYou know the needs of your students, because I know sometimes there's like eight kids.\nThink one thing we want to know is: What are the.\nThese are things I mean if, but, If you're, not in the meeting, you're, not going to know about that, but these are things that the DOE is providing like.\nAnd I wonder, At least they had school, it's a few, You know what I mean, and even people who are speaking."
