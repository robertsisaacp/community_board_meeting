So if you go, if you open up just Joanna, Cardi John is the one who is so you need to bring him to yeah. So let me transfer him over to the front Brenda Brian Wiper Carl, hello, Carl, hello Colleen. So I think we could matt is also here. So I yeah. What we should do is do a formal introduction. So this is the transportation committee of Community Board, four so and we are working on. We are online as you can see, and we have about eight or nine members which is a quorum and we're going to follow that through the way we are doing things this we get. We have the agenda item, we listen from the applicant or the general, you know presentation. We have a discussion and question and answers from the committee members and then we open it to the public and in order to be open to the public, you should raise your hand in in the panel, which is participants on the panel list, and we will call you in the order. We see it so the first question and then we take a vote and our vote is a recommendation that goes to that goes. She says she says, I see too much of you Martin. We wanted to add something to new business at some point: okay agenda, all right, so why do not you tell me that yeah? Thank you, okay. So the first item on the agenda is the turning movement at 36Th Street in Ninth Avenue. We have John Accardi. Who is the person who is asking for it? So John you can explain to us what the problem is Chris. Can you all hear me now? Yes, I'm sorry, do you want to intro the committee members? Yes, I should do that too. Also, it's been noted that your name does not appear on your screen and you might want to change it. So people myself. No I'm sorry John Christine! Your name does not appear yeah. I'm doing that right now, yeah just to make it easier for everyone and John we'll just take one moment to introduce all the committee members right I'll just go since I'm blabbing Dale Corvina Co- chair right, christine Bertie co- chair, then we have janine who is pretentious with our administrative support from and planner from the Community Board David Warren Martin treat Viren Brahmbat Raksha Mutuku Bret Furfer Colleen Wright, Sarah, Pelton, David, Solnick and Rob Walker on the phone. So going back to thank you all for being there and giving us a quorum and participating and John Accardi now is finally going to tell us what his concern is about: 36Th, Street, John, okay. Well, it's an ongoing problem that we've noticed and it's pretty consistent. As a matter of fact, today we had an incident where a cyclist almost got hit by a car. This happens pretty regularly. Sometimes, on more than one occasion per day, I even took a photograph of the the car and the bike today and we, it typically gets our attention because we often hear the cyclists yelling out to the motorists, because they feel that the motors are not seeing them now. It seems to be a problem that in fact, it's a blind spot that, for whatever reason the motorists are not seeing the cyclist right beside them, so John those people who do not know for Jordan those people who do not know the context. The little context here is that this is the bike lane going down: ninth Avenue and at 36Th Street. There is a split phase, I'm sorry a mixing zone and when the cars are turning, obviously pedestrian as well as bicyclists are in danger, and there are a lot of conflicts there and John explain your the position of your establishment. Well, my establishment. I have vetoes slices and isis, it's the Pizzeria right at the corner, I'm at the southeast corner of 9th and 36th. So I have a perfect vantage point as to what's going on at the corner opposite me. Now we had an incident about two months ago, more or less I was working outside on my street eats. I was building my outdoor seating area and a Van actually hit a girl on a on a bike and it broke her foot. It contorted it pretty bad way, and you know it seemed quite frankly. It seems that the motorists just do not see the cyclists right beside them and- and this is an ongoing problem- we see it over and over again and sometimes I'm even afraid to look. I can't see someone get really. You know run over right, but it happens regularly happens regularly. The cyclists think that the motors are just not paying attention or looking, but I think it's more than that they're just not noticing them right and it's a it's a dangerous situation. If it was, you know every now and then, but this is pretty regular, this reoccurrence. So it's concerned it's a good start for people's safety. Essentially so the suggestion was to install a split lpi like there is one at 38 and 9, and that gives you a an exclusive red phase for the cyclist to go through and then after that, blinking yellow, so that the motorists know that they should be really careful before they turn. I would think so. Yeah. I think a traffic signal for the cyclist, whether it's a green, amber or red, whether they should go or not, might help it might give the motorists. You know an indication that perhaps it should not make that turn until their signal turns green. That might be the solution. This corner needs to have something because does anyone have who has anyone has a question on that matter of you know, it seems to me that something that's something we have done before and it has been effective and that we should ask again and put some pressure on that. Okay, all right, can I get a motion of that? Oh David, do you have a question? Oh everybody has I'm sorry yeah. So this is an issue that comes up. It's like a theme that pops up from time to time, just the whole mixing zone did not DOT were not they supposed to be studying the mixing zones and checking the safety, because I mean we've had all kinds of issues with these mixing zones. You know I just right outside where I am here on 25th and 8th avenue. I can just sit and watch that corner. If I you know, I do not have to watch any real movies on netflix or anything. I just watched that corner. We got a mixing zone and it's plenty scary, so I think so I think yes, we should be addressing. This has been identified as a a hot corner where we've had a recent incident, so let's just try to put the fire out, but I think this is just another reason for us to keep D.O.T accountable for these mixing zones that we've long identified as dangerous, dangerous designs for bicyclists yeah, Colin, Colleen, yeah, thanks christine, and also thanks John for coming out. You know on a Wednesday night, because you're concerned about safety of people outside of your business. I think that's really great. I want to I mean my comment is similar to Brett's. Like I I'm curious John. Are you familiar on ninth avenue on nearby streets? Is this also happening? You know in other mixing zones and other nearby streets like? Is this something? That's like more of a problem down, ninth avenue that we could address because I know Christina, I could go on all night about nine avenue yeah. I do not know of the other intersections like I do here, because I'm pretty much here throughout the day- and I see what goes on here and, like I said earlier, there was one incident today and I photographed the motorist and the cyclists they started to argue you know. Luckily, the cyclist did not get hit as far as I could tell so. I kind of looked over after the cyclist went to the other side of the car, but as far as the other intersections, I would not be able to tell you not, from my first- hand, experience. I do not know I'll. Take that, though, because I was very involved into that discussion, so D.O.T did a study and did a pilot and they concluded that there were two ways of, and they have a report online about that by the way and they concluded. There are two ways which are better than that and the other two ways that they do install going forward. One is to put a an extended refuge and the extended refuge forces the cars to turn at an abrupt angle or putting the split phase a split Lpi one of the two, and whenever they install a new bike lane they do that. The problem with the retrofit they plan to retrofit, but they said they would do that only when they were resurfacing of the avenue. So you know that could take 10 years and that's not good. So what we need to do is elevate now, if I do not know if you at the beginning of this year, we sent an email, a letter to DOT, asking them for safety at 31 intersection and all the mixing zones were included in that ladder. But indeed nothing has happened. So now we need to re- elevate, you know and put a priority on some, and this one would be a good one. I know that on 38- 9 this is my street and I had complained about it a lot and they installed the split. You know split npi and it makes a huge difference. Huge difference. I mean you know now you feel comfortable going through it. So you know if we can get a few of them at a time, then I think this is a good way and I think 36 is definitely one we should get but yeah I mean I would have liked. You know D.O.T to retrofit all of them, but and now with the issues of budget, I'm not sure we are going to get there faster. So we really need to pick up the bad ones, and I think this one is a bad one. Unless Colin you have another one that you want to add in the same letter, and we can do that, I'm not aware of him off the top of my head. That's. I was curious if John was aware of any other hot spots over in that area. I would like to add: 30th Street 30Th Street is really bad. 30Th street's, also under significant construction with the water main yeah right. Now, it's really well. We could suggest that when they finish doing it, yes, they do it. They retrofit it, which is which would make sense right, yeah, okay, so colleen you still have one. Oh davey does something David Solnick David yeah I mean I was going to advocate for making this broader than one intersection, but christine you've said: we've already tried that and it's not been successful when the city's broke. So why bother all right so right? Exactly you know, I mean it's just so frustrating I mean the guy who is the guy at D.O.T who's, a bicyclist, a male guy who often comes right? Who comes and presents to us ted Wright? What is it ted right head? Yeah I mean I remember when we first started complaining about the mixing zones. He was. He was completely dismissive and he said well, look I'm a bicyclist, and you know these are okay and you know- and he was a very self- righteous well David does not you know. The duty is here so do not get person with them focus on the issues and not on the people. Well, okay. I think that attitude has gotten better, but it's still, you know it there's still vestiges of it and you know. Obviously the mixing zones are a catastrophe, and you know now and now we're having to grovel to get one of them changed right. Yeah. If I could just second like what I meant to say christine about 97 like I do not need to tell you like 9th avenue between 5th 60Th, Street and 30th street is horrible. The resurfacing there's mixing zones in the 50s, you know I know, and with the open streets now there's a spot there, then I'm always afraid I'm going to hit like a server with a big carrying a big tray of plates or something you should steal some alcohol. As you are on the way wow, it sounds like you might have already picked it clean, but anyway that's what I was like. I think Ninth Avenue definitely needs to be addressed. So why do not we make a resolution where we talk about all of ninth Avenue, where we talk about the construction at you know up there, the resurfacing in between the work, the and but you know. Generally, we are more successful when we do one- off. You know. You know that when we get all excited about one intersection, it works and when we talk about a lot then nothing happens. So I think I think we need to be focusing on this intersection and then adding the rest behind it. Saying, okay and by the way, all these other things also should be addressed really because of that special situation of construction and of which has really created a lot of concerns and it's an opportunity to redo it. The right way, I think, there's a there's phrasing of a letter that can address focus specifically on this intersection. While saying problems are are ubiquitous in these instances, where you have this specific kind of intersection along the stretch of Ninth avenue in our district is colleen there. Could we clean? Can you can you help us a little bit here? I am here, yes, hey David. I love that comment by the way you made my evening so Colleen I mean what other chances we have of retrofitting some of those intersection after the construction is done. You know what I think you might stand a good chance in getting it done, because construction, if you put it in before the construction, is done. I think it. You know you might stand a chance in getting it done. The only way we can do this is if you're right, if we resurface the roadway yeah the only time we can do that, but I would put together. You know. I think the board had sent us a list, I'm not sure. Yes in January in January, we said this. I just read it because we were going to discuss the you know the budget, so I just oh, my god and the fact that construction is happening at a particular location where there's a mixing zone. You know it's worth exploring to see if it can be done at the same time before everything goes back into place, that'd be really good yeah and you know yeah. We can definitely take a look at it. Okay, all right! So that's do I have a resolution. Do I have a motion here? Well I've. I move that we write a letter targeting this intersection, as well as targeting the rest of the intersections in Ninth Avenue sort of reiterating the changing them when the resurfacing happens after the construction is finished right, that's, okay! John! Could you send us? The pictures you have taken is John. Still there John, I think, you're on Mute yeah. I'm sorry would you like me to email yeah? Should I email it yeah? Should you email that to jeanine and that'd be great? Okay, all right! Thank you. So much John. Thanks for my pleasure being concerned. We appreciate it quickly before we move on to the next item. We might want to recognize the representatives of electives that are in the in the at the meeting. You want to do that sure. Let me get into that participants. Okay, we have Carl Wilson here from Corey's office from Cory's office. We have Matt Thai from the crowdfreight's office, Emily Bartos. We have emily from Linda into Rosenthal's office. Am I missing anyone, hello all welcome and, of course, we recognize colleen from the D.O.T, okay, all right, okay. So what was the second? The second item was the complaint we received from individual who lives on 54th street and unfortunately it does not seem to be there. Unless this is the person with the phone number. There is a phone number two one, two and terminating in four one. Four, the person who sent us the initial letter there actually were two people who raised this issue is Stefan. Are you in at the meeting today? If he's not, I can summarize his points. Why do not you do that yeah? So Stefan is a resident of West 54th street, the Midtown north precinct block, and he wrote to us in July 23rd to say that he was asking about the duration of the barricading on that block and he was not provided with any certainty or answers from anyone at the precinct and also he has had he had at the time. He had ongoing issues with being stopped and asked for, like his intentions or whereabouts or I'm sorry hold on sorry or my cat is rubbing a laptop, and so anyway, he he's just. He was just essentially complaining about his treatment at the barricades that he did not sign up to be interrogated by police officers about his whereabouts and his comings and goings as he came and entered his apartment also that it had it caused trouble for him with as far as like getting car services or ride, shares, and also it obviously, it interfered with traffic. And then a committee member also noted at the same time that the business, the restaurant business, that's on the corner of 54th and 9th avenue, which is a mexican restaurant called El Centro, was not able to have the same street presence that other restaurants had in order to keep them in operation because of the barricading that was blake, who wrote to us sometime after Stefan wrote to us, so those were the that's the gist of the complaints from West 54Th street. So there was one other person, Charlie Todd he's here today, who also had some complaints about the barricades. Oh okay, is he hi yeah? I'm here? Can you guys hear me yeah great? I do not know if you can see me and I've got some children near me, so I apologize, but I live on 54th street. I do not live on the Midtown north precinct block. I live acrosss the street between 9th and 10th, but because I live on 54th, I frequently walk down 54th with my stroller with my children, which, by the way and I've, had a chronic problem with the police officers parking there they park on the sidewalk, sometimes they park so close to the police precinct that I can not fit my stroller in between their car and the the community Court or the precinct building itself, because there's a bump out with stairs there and I've worked with my neighborhood community officer several times and pointed this out, and it's gotten better, but it still happens but yeah. I found it to be absurd that they basically turned all of that block into their personal parking lot for months. I understand there were civil unrest. I understand there may have been a credible threat, but I mean they did. This is not our local problem. They did this at every precinct all over the entire city for months, and I do not think there was a credible threat of rioting in the streets two weeks ago by the way they took it down two days ago. It's completely gone now, so I think we're just sort of litigating their past mistakes now, rather than trying to change something, although I think we could advocate for them in general to not park their cars all over the sidewalk. I was particularly upset because there's a CitiBike rack at 54th, just right there in that corner and it's right on the corner, but they were not allowing CitiBike members to dock or retrieve bikes because they were not at one point. They were not allowing anybody onto the block, and I worked, I emailed with the neighborhood community officer and just sort of pleaded my case, why do not you move the barricades back 20 feet and allow people just to get a CitiBike and come and go? The response I got was the next closest CitiBike rack is 8th, Avenue and 52nd street, which I did not find acceptable at all. I will say there was a brief period where they were letting pedestrians and bikers through this through their private parking lot and no cars, and that was probably the best configuration because there were no cars and I could just bike and walk and walk on it without the cars all together. But anyway, if the problem seems like they've solved it, I do not know if that's city- wide or if that's permanent, but I found it to be very disrespectful to commandeer an entire block for your personal parking and not allow to walk or buy so Charlie. I have a question for you, I mean. Obviously this is kind of past. We are all very upset about it, but it's kind of it seems to be somewhat over and it may be the result of the letter we sent by the way. So we're going to take the credit for that, and but I mean how is what is the situation with the parking right now and well I mean, can you access the sidewalk and is it? Is it reasonable or not? I do not find it to be reasonable. I mean it's in front of their there's certain places. You know in front of the MTA building there they have bollards, so they can't park on the sidewalk there I mean, I would just broadly say: police should not park on the sidewalk ever no one should park in the sidewalk. It's a sidewalk, it's for people, it's for strollers! It's for people with wheelchairs, it's social distancing. I do not need to be walking single file and cramming bass when I have somebody during a pandemic, but you know my individual issue of complaining about not being able to get my stroller, which is a single wide stroller through a spot. I've been complaining for about two years with the precinct with the community officers and it's gotten better. It's not it's. You know, I still see it every now and then, but you know, for example, in in on 35th street. We have the same problem, obviously, and for a while we had installed we, the Times Square Alliance, I'm sorry the 34Th Street partnership, but install some flexible boulevard to define where the ultimate you know where the on sidewalk portion could be and limit. It to a certain amount so that the rest would be really passable. Is that something that we could ask yeah, I mean look. I understand that a high percentage of the NYPD does not live in New York City, so they have to drive in I mean by the way I would. I would also extend it to my block and 54th between 9th and 10th. Is nothing but placard parking, the entire block, so it you know just living here. You feel like the entire curb is dedicated to the police force, but I noticed that they have painted lines on the sidewalk white painted lines for parking, and I was kind of rolling my eyes at that when I saw that today, I think they may have painted it during the pandemic during their occupation. But now that you point that out, maybe it's not so bad. At least then we would know the limit. You know if we're, if we're going to agree as a community that they're allowed to park on the sidewalk, which I do not necessarily agree with that. But if we're going to say that's a compromise, then yeah there should be a line and they should not park over the line well and not only a line but vertical bowlers to show them. Where do they go and they can't go any further than that? I think we need to put the Genie back in the bottle. You know they expanded their use and then now we have to tell them politely that this would be a good time to show some to rebuild some trust with the community and to give some, you know, give some thoughts about defining better their use of the sidewalk which we object to, but if they have to, they must imitate with a and live at least four feet or five feet so that you know ADA can go through and the strollers can go through. I think that's well put, I agree right and we could send that to I mean I do not know what are the other location can you? Can you tell me whether on the tense precinct, they have the same problem therein? Yes, I sent you some pictures a few minutes ago. It's opened up, they do not stop people anymore. There are no personnel at the corner right, but the sidewalks are partially blocked. So you have about four feet of a gap that you can walk through right. There's, no problem with the sort of cars being parked on the sidewalk, because the sidewalk is roughly about three foot, four supplied in most places, but you do have sort of a majority of parking taken over by NYPD. So why do not? We send? You know to Midtown north to the tents to meet themselves, because we have a problem enormously. I do not know the 13, we can send it to the 13 anyway, I'm sure that's the same thing and we could send a letter. You know thanking them for reopening you know and then. At the same time saying, however, there are still some difficulties for circulating and you know the sidewalk is a major issue and we need to have a better delineation between the cars and the pedestrians and making sure it's open and making sure that the people with strollers can go through Et, cetera, Et cetera and therefore recommend that they install those vertical ballards which are very inexpensive, but would be a good signal of you know, get back in your in your lane in a sense right. So do we have christine before we do that? I think it's unacceptable that they park on the sidewalk. First of all, they have plaqued parking, which is guaranteed through their union contract. There's no need whatsoever for them to park on the sidewalk and they're setting a bad example for other motorists to do the same thing. If they're parking on the sidewalk, then anyone can park on the sidewalk. I mean you can't you have a different standard, but them they're already getting free parking. So I mean I do not know. If there's any regulation, it might be a regulation where you can't actually park on the side. No, there is a regulation. I read it which says you absolutely can not park on the sidewalk, so then they're violated then they're violating that specific law and they're flaunting that violation. So they're setting a horrible example- and I think that's where we should go. We said you are breaking the law and it's not an emergency. I understand if there's an emergency, but this is on an everyday basis right, so I think we should not even give them any wiggle room. Look. You got your placket parking union contract. You know if somebody wants to re- open that can of runs. That's not our issue at the moment, but right now, our issue is that you are violent in law when you're supposed to be enforcing the law yeah. I agree with you veren. What do you think? Oh David? Okay, now, if you're in? What do you think? No, I think a couple of things and parking on the sidewalk is not permitted in New York City. So I think we should put something in the letter. The second thing is moving forward going back to Dale's point that if there is a need for you to put the barricades back on, are you following the process? Are you informing? You know informing the people on the block because they simply just do it and there's no kind of due diligence. I mean I'm just going to weigh in here and say: there's like. I completely recognize your approach christine, which is like more with honey than with vinegar. However, we have had this like the basis and we just heard testimony from Charlie, and we heard testimony from a couple of other people residents of 54th street. One of the main issues with the police barricading was that they did not do any notification of the public as required by the charter. That's the thrust of our letter. Not only are you doing something and not communicating about it and claiming that it's because of these emergencies, these emergency situations, but you're, not notifying us. You are[ _ _] civilian oversight in this regard, so I you could tie all of the occasions all of the creep that has happened with our the NYPD bucking civilian oversight and flouting laws and tie it to that. Like I get that you want to thank them for removing the barricades, but the barricades we do not have to thank them, I mean that's. The barricade should not have been there after five days unless of the reason and the duration, and they never did that, I'm trying to I'm trying to move on from the barricade. I know that the whole full board is going to be very agitated about that. So I and I totally I totally get that I mean it's like. We should talk about this almost strategically because, like there is so many there are so many reasons I mean we are. We are like a bullied city right. There are so many reasons to like treat the NYPD with this kind of these kid gloves and this tenderness and not confront them and not like call them to task and not ask them to be accountable, and so instead we beg for scraps. So if we're going to beg for scraps tonight- okay- but I you know- I'm at my limit of begging for scraps from the NYPD to me- they're a rogue force and they have not been- they have not been compliant with basic tenants of civilian oversight. Okay, but so what do? We have a resolution here on the table? I I'm not proposing a resolution. I'm just saying like I wanted to. I wanted to elaborate on the gamut of possible approaches to this. We can beg, we can be sweet and we can say please. I propose a resolution that we enforce the rules where you can't park on the sidewalk and let them know that would be my resolution. The barricades are gone, so we do not enforce traffic, I mean they do so. You know I'm saying, but there's a rule on the books put that law in that they're violating and say, look you're supposed to be enforcing it and you're violating and you're setting a bad example. What's to stop a civilian from doing it, why I mean it's unfair to stop us David? I understand that. That's the holding them accountable approach on that particular issue and I would roll it up into other issues as well. I'm just saying, like I'm, asking us as a committee to weigh the possible outcomes like we can tell them they're being bad actors in the civic space of the streets of the precincts, and they will say you know they'll trash can our letter. Okay, so I have two more people here to get in the game. Colin yeah, I mean in terms of the specific remedy. I think that it makes more sense just to say that they can't park on the sidewalk, I'm not really in any mood to like compromise with the NYPD. I think that their actions have been like reprehensible. I do not think that we need to be rude in our letter or like overly. You know agitative, but I think also they're not supposed to park on the sidewalk, and so I do not think they should. We should compromise and let them park on the sidewalk, okay and then Brett for fur yeah. So I mean the whole issue of parking on sidewalks is speaking to something. That's you know again, the you know the longer the longer on the board, the more we find that we have these chronic issues. It's parking on the sidewalk it's taking over a street to park their squad cars on without asking us here, like 29th street, where they just parked up 29Th street overnight one day: it's. How do they do this and I guess their negotiation with who DOT or somebody? So I do not know if a resolution is going to be terribly effective without at least not to not said that NYPD. I think it's got to go through the electeds, because the electeds maybe stand a chance at wielding some kind of power over a policy issue in the streets. You know as we're talking you know, NYPD is going to do what they're going to do. They're going to say, we need the street, we have these squad cars, we're going to put them. You know, give us a garage, we're not they're not going to get a garage they're going to have this quack. So I would like for them to be coming to us to talk about where their squad cars go. Parking on sidewalks happens on other blocks as well. It's not just that block. You know in our district in neighboring districts, same thing used to I used to work on 30Th street in district five, and you know where they have the traffic police there and all of a sudden they started taking over that street too, and that happened you know a decade ago. So it's how they do things. It's a policy issue, so I do not know if we need to get an elect, get the electeds involved. Maybe that's who the letter goes to. Maybe it's a bigger issue. It's a town hall issue. You know. Maybe we need to show up and force to some of the police district meetings to talk about this, but it's a big issue in terms of us being subject to whatever the NYPD is going to do with this podcast. Maybe thank you brett. I think maybe it would be helpful to like hear from some of the reps that are here if they have any like feedback or input, because I know it's, I know it's challenging for all everyone in elected positions to hold the NYPD accountable. It's just there's a lot of there's a lot of dynamics against that happening. So what do you think christine? Should we ask? Well, I do not know I mean you know. I think I think the elected which have been very effective. You know the relationship between De, Blasio and NYPD. What are they going to do? Who is going to do what nobody I mean? You know my view is that they are out. They are not being controlled right now. They are not accountable to anybody, so my view was to try to get to leverage the position where we are, where that we created by asking them to be accountable to us on the closures and say you did not do your job right and now to tag along and to go right behind it and say, oh and by the way, something which is left over from those closures. Is that everybody's parking on the sidewalk? And we can't have that and do not park on the sidewalk, because the pedestrians can't go through yeah? This is not good, and so you know kind of taking. You know leveraging a little bit our position as a follow- up without going back to the rest of it and say you know, this is another. This is a leftover and you are not finished with your job here. You have to really leave the sidewalk and I'm sorry and quickly, just and perhaps trying to like social distancing in the pan down yeah right yeah. I like the idea I mean I, but I also I think we should be quoting the law and emphasizing that they're violated. We'll include the law in a way that does not say violent words right, but will you oh yeah? It's better worrying refer to the law, which says you are not supposed to be on the sidewalk, and this is still an issue even that the fact that the blocks have been reopened. We still have a problem and we are still getting complaints and since they're talking about sort of building the bridges and building back the sort of community, I think we should put that up front and say moving forward if there's better communication in terms of barricades going up coming down or whatever have you us knowing, would make us much more comfortable than simply being imposed upon us exactly. I just want to add also that I'm just taking they're going to see that another thing that they're going to look at is the fact that at least on 20th street, I'm not sure about 45th street. They have actually lost some parking to restaurant outdoor spaces. You know what. If there is no restaurant, there is no tax revenue and there is no salary to the point right. Okay, not only do you want us to give up these spaces, so the restaurant, yeah tables and chairs out, but you do not want us to do what we've already been doing as an established custom to squeezing as many police vehicles as possible on the block, I'm just putting it out there that you know we might even say while we identify you know we or even say like we can. You know we'll support your we'll work with you to find alternative parking locations. I actually disagree with that, like let's not even touch it, let's not bring more problems to their attention. I appreciate you like being like. I appreciate that you're raising something very smart gail, but I think, let's just not even give them reasons to object. Yeah, you're, probably right. Okay, so could someone summarize this make a resolution, so we can vote on it? I mean I can tell you what I've heard now I have heard you know the their job is not finished. We want to build the trust. We still have a problem. They are parking on the sidewalk. People can not go through the sidewalk for distancing and for ADA and for you know, strollers, and it really and it is illegal to park on the sidewalk and therefore we are asking them to not park on the sidewalk and the emphasis on clearance for social distance reasons, also and better communication moving forward if they're unified right so we'll put a language and we'll send it around. So you guys can you know improve on the language, but so that's so somebody puts a motion on that. I make that motion all in favor, yeah. Okay, I opposed present non- eligible abstain, all good. Thank you so much very good discussion. Okay, the next is the dale. You have to take the driver's seat now sure, so I passed well jeanine put the city of Oakland's 2019 bike plan in the dropbox, and I also sent you a link. It's a big file. It's like a it's a it's, not a easy download, but it's a comprehensive bike plan that was developed last year by the City of Oakland and looking at it. It was a joint effort of the mayor's office and Oakland has eight City council members, seven by district and one at large, and they all participated as along with a bunch of other stakeholders like their office of Disabilities area residents, cycling groups and activists and a couple of non- profit organizations, and then the transit stakeholders, such as Caltrans and Bart, were on their advisory committee. So it's a pretty consensus driven document and the mission statement was basically it envisioned in Oakland that was bike friendly and affordable, safe and healthy mobility for all as a vision of cycling- and I you know- I of course encourage you to all look through it, but the some of the things that are kind of key points about it is that it were. That was the methodology that they employed. They did a kind of master survey and they also employed what they described as an equity framework, and they also did very extensive, like in- person and social media outreach on any available channel to get input from the from the resident, and the plan itself has like a kind of built- in framework for focusing on disadvantaged groups who may not always have access to this to cycling as a means of transit, amen and referring back to what we talked about in a prior meeting. With with the social justice meeting, they set clear goals to their to the plan, which was to have, for instance, like a large percentage of the residents of Oakland living within a quarter mile of what they call low stress bikeways. I do not think we have any low stress bikeways in Manhattan increasing ridership and in particular they had a focus on increasing women's ridership as a kind of benchmark of accessibility. So and the plan also included a an economic development strategy component, which was to increase businesses in the bicycle kind of industry owned by people of color, because that was a really important component of the plan. So there's lots of super interesting and detailed recommendations, and I think a lot of them would have great potential here in our district and in the city at large, but I'm not really like advocating. I we're laying this out as a discussion, but it's not to advocate for, like Let's crib their work, it's more like do. We think our city should take on this kind of comprehensive plan, and you know look at the same kind of like engagement of stakeholders, equity framework, business development strategy, and what have you instead of like just cherry-? Picking like? Oh that's, a cool idea. Let's do that so yeah like basically, we could advocate for from our position a unique plan for our city. That has you know the same kind of contours as this plan. So I welcome all of your input on that. We have hands up of David Warren or it's an old ad. I think so. That's an old hand. Oh it's an old hand. Okay, Brett! Is that the brand new hand that's a new hand. Yes, so first I want to thank you know, Dale, you and christine for putting this in the agenda this you know I had it once I saw on the agenda. I went right to it and it's a phenomenal document. I think there are the two biggest things I would point to for value to us. I think one I think for all of us, the transportation committee. There are a lot of good transportation issues. How to explain when we want to advocate for alternatives to the automobiles, there's a lot of really good language and things that we can learn from. So that's the educational thing. The other thing that I think is maybe the most important part of this document. It's survey and research based. So what they present is not a group of people within the city talking to different representatives in different departments, putting their personal and departmental priorities into a document and then finding a way to justify them. They use they use a third party to do surveying to reach out to people, and so they made an open, Oakland plan. So I think from our end, if we want to try to use this document to help make our neighborhoods better. This is probably something bigger than you know. What we could just do, and you know our district does not live in a bubble, but I can see two potential ways to try to help the city get inspired. One is it could be a city- wide kind of thing, timing- wise. It might not be great because we're you know we're about to head into an election year next year, so the administration might have the time to do a full study and get a document out in time for the next administration. Maybe this is more appropriate to bring to Gail Brewer's office's attention, because the Manhattan bicycle plan, I think in some ways, is more realizable and feasible and you could become a city- wide kind of thing, but I think Manhattan is almost kind of a its own transportation zone. So I that's. I would I hope that you know that the Dale's office gets their hands on this and can help maybe find a university. A third party research consultant someone to do appropriate to create something like this for us, which should be amazing. I have a question brett on what you just said. Are you familiar with the RPA bike master plan? Yeah, I'm not like intimately but yeah right. I just it would be interesting to see whether they have used surveys etc. Before we think my understanding is RPA tends to do most of their studies internally in house. I do not think they reach out to third parties. I think the fact that this Oakland plan did use- and now you know I you know- I I'm a consultant- and you know so. I know that sometimes you get pressured from your clients to you know, come up with an answer. Sometimes you know the reputable consultants do not listen to their clients when they're pushed that everything needs to be objective so they're out there and that if someone who's objective can come, can it has findings that happen to align with some? You know with your opinions or goals, that's great, and if it does not that's a opportunity for someone to learn- and you know check where their orientation is, because maybe they need to realign their goals, that they realize that they're, not in alignment with everyone else's. So the group think I think that that's one thing you know galbraith doing part of their finding new community board members where they do that exercise. I'm sure many of you most of you probably done that where you do that whole you're playing crash heading to Seattle thing. I mean that was a that's a powerful thing that she did for all of us before we even joined the board, or you know reapplied. It shows that when you bring more opinions to the table, that makes a more powerful document, Right David, Solnick yeah. I too found the document to be impressive and particularly impressive. As Brett is saying in the in the survey elements of it, you know it was particularly in particularly telling that you know they identified a very large percentage of the population that would like to bike, but is scared to. That was not their phrasing, but it was that's pretty much what it said. I think it was 44 and I suspect we would get similar numbers, maybe even higher you know and again you know it broke it down into subcategories. What were they afraid of? And you know by region- and I mean it's very detailed, but you know so having that kind of information would be valuable, but you know, and now I'm going to sort of argue against myself, which is. Are we too late? I mean in a sense, you know, is the city just going to say? Well, look yeah, I mean look. We know that we know we need protected bike lanes. We know we need to not have mixing lanes anymore. You know so we're getting rid of you know we already. We already kind of know this and you know we're you know and Cory's 50 miles of predicted by whatever I do not remember the numbers were, but the you know the program to add protected bike lanes. You know at a at an accelerated pace, I'm just you know. I would love to know what the results of that survey would be here in New York, whether Manhattan or citywide. I think either would be interesting, but the question then I have, is it going to help and you know, is it worth it? Is it going to make a difference? You know there's no point in studying something if you do not think it's going to matter, because there people are just going to say well, look we're already on we're already we've already gone down that road. You know now you've just confirmed that we should go down that road, so you know, I think one thing that sorry I just want to say quickly. I think one thing that distinguishes this document from like just a data crunch, is that you know the it clearly outlines an equity framework which I do not think is part especially of the RPA plan, for instance, and also that business development component, which you know here we have who runs Motivate now, who runs the CitiBikes lyft? Are they now on by left, I think yeah. So we have a have. We have a very large corporation, engaging in the most you know, important rollout of as opposed to the Oakland model, which was let's bring up small businesses and especially small business POC on small businesses to meet some of our our needs for cycling. So I think I get the resistance to like. Oh a survey like what are we going to learn that we have not already figured out, but a survey tied to an equity framework and to like a social justice, oriented Business, Development model? I think this is more powerful than a survey calling well first, I have a quick question for Dale. What is what is the proposal that you're? I mean? I have some thoughts on the on the document, but what are you proposing that we do as a community board? Well, I'm actually not saying like I want you to do. I I'm not formulating like a next step, I'm just I'm. I think we brought this document to the committee to discuss and to say like if this is something that we would like to see take place in New York, the development of a plan that has all these components as outlined like how can we you know we're not going to, as I think Brett rightly I think was Brett rightly point out: it's not up to us we're this is way bigger than CB4 is Transpo, so I think I think we are not at the decision point of yet doing something with it. It's right, it's it was. The idea was to elevate the debate and to get smarter about it and then say what do we do about it? So Colin finish your start, yeah. I was going to say well, first of all, thanks for bringing the document to our attention, it's a great document. I agree. I you know more and more as I work nationally. I work. I see these documents a lot and I think that what distinguishes they're all good right, they all look good. They all say the right things. This one has milestones which is good. This one is written as an action with action items, but the difference is that Mayor Libby Schaff of Oakland is kicking ass in closing streets and you know taking no prisoners. You know, and I think that, like these plans are only as good as the city- wide leadership pushing them like they're good to like point to and say we agreed as a city, you know that we that equity and transportation is a goal that we need to get to, and so then you go to community boards and you go to businesses and you go to police precincts and actually make it happen, and I think that's where the comment about the mayoral race is so important. I think that we need to make sure that the next mayor is a mayor that is not going. Is this going to be a libby shaft? So yeah I mean that's my thought. I think it's a great document, but it takes it takes action Viren. No, I think Dale made the point that I was about to make. Trying this trying bike infrastructure into equity infrastructure is extremely important. We actually already have bike infrastructure in place so going back to David's point, it actually becomes easier for to tweak the plants as we go, we're not starting from scratch. So that actually is a good opportunity, and this document tries biking and sort of changed sort of concepts for mobility into Demo demography, so looking at demographics is extremely important. We have not done that because we just take street as infrastructure and we overlay by parts on top of it, but we do not connect people, equity and infrastructure together. I think it's a great documentary to sort of look at study from. I do not know exactly what the mechanism we have to sort of bring about similar changes into what we have. That's the question that I do not know. I mean it's a great conversation. That's all I can say: where does this conversation go from here? Is it under the purview of this committee, or is there some sort of letters that we write to like? We do not know yet we do not know yeah Brett's for fur. I think Sarah has her hand up also just fyi, for whatever reason it came up for so sorry. I already spoke to sarakico before okay Sarah next, oh thanks, brett, that's fine yeah! Just like we'll reiterate, I think it's a fantastic document. I think if we want to try to think like more tactically, there could be an opportunity, obviously like the streets, master plan, where you know the first iteration is supposed to be released by DOT next December. If there are elements of this plan that you know we do particularly like, or you know, considerations or metrics they're looking at and we feel like it's appropriate for us to. You know, write a letter about that. The framing of that could be. You know we would love for you to be considering this. As you know, we understand you are going to be working on this plan and just like try to engage in that way with D.O.T. I think. Realistically, I do not think they're going. You know we're going to get. You know an entirely distinct bike plan because there's already been this master streets plan concept, that's you know been passed with legislation and that's already something. Dot is now going to be working on and that's going to include a plan for biking and bike infrastructure, presumably so that was just a tactical thought of how you know what we could keep in mind as we're having more discussions about this content, yeah David so back to Brett for just one other thing I would add I meant to add before if we do want to try to do something locally, as a community board to try to get some kind of study done. I might suggest that we reach out to someone like Nyu's the wagner school since they're kind of our neighbors almost close enough. They it's a kind of way to leverage some academic, third- party research into this with the idea of creating something local using. You know you use some students to help support their education. That might be the one when that's something you know we're or a local laboratory for them to study as well. So that's you know. That's the thing I'd add, there's something if we want to try to tap into the local resources to get this done without going through the city or President's office, or even tying into your earlier suggestion about the borough president's office like hey, borough president, why do not you initiate this kind of and engage some of these academic think tanks to like take on a study of this? We, like this study, like what about a scope like this. Instead of us going to students and saying hey we're from this one district in Manhattan, and we want you to do this. Well, that would be you know it would be Jesse or somebody reaching out, but yeah I mean it's a way to try to get it done. Yeah, maybe you know gail could can talk more wide, so he might have more of an inroad for doing this, but you know touching on the on the idea of you know the equity and things like that. So one thing it's not entirely clear in the report is, if the whole thing about equity and some of the division objectives, it's not entirely clear if those were findings from the survey or if the survey was just measuring, you know the factors influencing people riding bicycles or not so so there is. There is some policy overlap with? What's going on in this report that it's not entirely clear? I, my personal preference for reports like this and studies is before you know the their separate tracks. What is the visioning, which is, which could also be done objectively with the third party, to run these visioning to know what the policies should be and then the data does get you. It can be useful for us for the things we advocate, for I guarantee you. If you did a survey and ask people what are the five worst things about bicycling in our neighborhood, everyone's top five list is going to include double parked cars. You know that you, but someone else could put that survey out there. We can point to that and say: hey look. People are afraid of the double parked cars. We have data that shows that crashes are. You know, experts that involve double parked cars, so that's something that can be sent directly to the mayor's office to say you need to be making this an initiative, a priority to crack down on double parked cars on our district, because this is causing a dangerous situation and it's also discouraging people from abusing bicycles. So that's how there is it's not just about making a plan, so they can. The city can budget where to roll out protected bike lanes. It's other policy issues too, that these kinds of surveys are used for Okay, David Warren at this handover yeah. I agree with everyone. I it's good Dale. Thank you for bringing style attention. I definitely think this. If we do continue this, it should go to the borough- wide committee and then to the city- wide within the community boards. If we're going to do this, I do not know how this how we relate to other boroughs. I was riding in the south Bronx yesterday and it was like the Wild West. You know you go out to Bronzeville East New York, also the big. So that's there's a big economic disparity. You know some of the neighborhoods that do not have people to advocate for them. Also, there's a huge female there's, a gender gap in cycling for females because of the way the infrastructure is set up. I think we'd have more males, also David. What about the report? Because those were the reports? That's what it already said in the report right. I think that the way the reports are getting local groups to get involved, I think if we do, that it has to be local groups within the city, can't just be our area because it has to be like the report said connectivity, so we have to be connected, even though it's not directly to Bronzeville and East New, York or Brighton Beach or Queens. So I would like somehow I do not know if there's a mechanism for that to be honest with you with the community boards out there, oh yeah, may I interject. I think that there are mechanisms in place. We have agencies, we have trt, we have city planning and we have design Commission Design Commission works very closely with city planning. In terms of any kind of innovative ideas that communities put forward, so you know what why take the owners on us put the owners back on the agency and say when you do your studies, please include x, Y and Z, so these plans become very comprehensive. In fact, design commission is very positive and receptive more often than not actually, because if one of those agencies that actually reaches out all the other folks, so I think we should explore the possibilities of kind of establishing a dialogue with them great okay. So I what I heard I did not read the report. I just got the knowledge from all of you, which is wonderful. The thing that absolutely interested me are the a quarter of a mile in from a bike lane. This is what the mayor of Bogota did when he did his first bus network, and you know the issue of creating jobs relating to bikes. I think it's a fantastic issue, so this is all this equity issue and the survey now bringing it all back to our neighborhood. First of all, generally, the community board wants us to write about the Community board and in our community board I think we have a fantastic network of net of Bikes Bike lanes. We have bike lane Crosstown bike lanes. We have North south back lanes on every avenue, except on 10th avenue, which is supposed to happen. So you know, the applicability of this report to our neighborhood is not is not, is a little it's a little too late in a sense, so whatever we would write would be about the other neighborhoods, and we would have to find an angle to say how you know useful to our neighborhood. It would be and then expand it to the rest. I think the angle would be to talk about the you know, equity and really the job developing some jobs. That's something that Veren will tell you was in the recommendation of the equity task force, talking about how to figure jobs, and maybe, if we take that angle, we can say you know this is something we would like to see happening in our neighborhood and we would like D.O.T to take from that report. A number of ideas like that, but especially this idea, because this idea can apply to our neighborhood and it is part of the recommendation of the task of the working group. So that's the way I would go about it to try to bring that and make it fit in our picture and you know have an opportunity to talk about it, because otherwise we do not have an opportunity. I mean it's, not our business, you know it. I yeah you want to depart from the district right as it stands, and then people are going to say none of our business. Why are you writing a letter like that? So the only way is to link it to veren that you know the question from your working group and maybe have you start to look at the report and extract from that, the things that could that fit in the working group and that could be a joint letter. You know I do not know what you think fair and about that. No, I think it is doable. I think I'm going back to what you just said. I see it slightly differently in the sense that, because we already have a very well worked out sort of network of bike parts and my bike infrastructure, it is easier for us to come in and tweak it and some sort of study will we can request for some sort of study that ties equity back into what we already have yeah, but I mean we need to ask for a study of something new, because there is no money, also in the city, so we need. We need to focus more on the economic development aspect of it and say: look we just said we wanted to talk about job and economic and racial opportunity, etc. That's now that we have the bike lanes. How do we, what would be the program to create those jobs around it? And indeed, if there need to be tweaking in the process, we can talk about that, but we need to have something which is really very focused to our neighborhood. This is what I suggest. I think we'll have this conversation in our next meeting with this association. At the same time, you know any thoughts that come in my mind, I'm going to put them together, I'll initially they will sort of I'll send them to you christine and we'll see we'll take it from there. Well Dale. Yes, everybody I can. We can all participate in that. I think it's a great conversation is irrespective of which communities is an accident, but I think there are multiple overlaps that we need to explore, and there are other agencies that we have not thought about. The only reason why I thought about Design Commission is because they actually look at quality of life, much more comprehensively, oh yeah, so you know they even get involved and believe it or not. They actually have a document for affordable housing, though it is not their mandate right, okay! Well, I mean, if you are all kind of in agreement- and you want to send some thoughts to veren- that's something we could do, and then you know regroup together next month and do a vote on it. If we have a letter or recommendation that can be taken and would follow with the guidelines of CB4, you know focus in a sense, but I think this is. This was a great conversation very interesting. This is terrific. Thank you Dale for leading that okay. So the next subject is the budget maintenance. Oh I'm sorry, sidewalk, maintenance, okay, so that's another! Maybe we should put it to next month. Another high- level discussion yeah, another high- level discussion so and how about christine? Why do not we just like encapsulate the argument and then like have everybody and pick it up in October right exactly it's too much otherwise, but the sidewalk maintenance. So up to now we have been working on sidewalk and we have talked a lot about the space you know. Do we have enough space on the sidewalk, let's clean up the sidewalk, etc, and then the safety is it safe? Can we cross the street etc? And now you know inspired by two things: by the issues of equity: there are about 3.6 million people who use the sidewalk and probably more, but I mean we use it in an intensive way to commute to to do the first leg of transit, the last leg of transit, etc and of those 3.6 66 percent. Are you know, non- white? I mean Black, Brown, etc. So the sidewalk is really a place where equity is very, which is really very important, and one thing which is happening in New York City is since 2003 the sidewalk is not maintained by D.O.T, so DOT the budget they have and the taxes we pay are spent on the roadway, and you know the ferries blah, but not the sidewalk and on the sidewalk. This is practically the place where you have the most people walking, and the second thing is that the maintenance is really pushed back to the landlord, who pushed it to the store owners right and all these store owners were all concerned about how the small business is going to survive, etc. Well, they have to do the maintenance of the sidewalk and the maintenance means not only the cleaning but also the repairs, and if they do not do the repairs, the fines can go up to ten thousand dollars and one thousand 000 a day. So that's a big deal and you know from an equity standpoint to me the fact that we are not the money we pay in taxes is not being spent in the location where we have the most, probably the most black and brown. You know non- white people using it is really a shocking discrimination, and what I wanted to bring to you to you is there's a proposal to discuss how to ask for the sidewalk to be maintained by the city, certainly in our neighborhood and in other neighborhood, and so that we get to a level of equity between the people which are walking, of which many are you know again. Non- white and the people who are driving and the people walking are probably less. So that's the general idea and I can send you a document that I started to put together and I think would be great if you could think about it in all the dimension and see whether next month see whether this is something we want to take on and you know push for, that's it. We can also provide a little. I mean you did, encapsulate it, but just a little bit on this like there must be some document or a report, news report. That explains how you know under the Bloomberg administration there was this decision made to privatize yeah of the most public space in Brazil, right kind of give everybody the little history lesson behind that and then also you know outline the parameters for the discussion. Right Viren has raised his hand. No it's a new hand, fresh I've, just yeah, I've just cleaned it. You know I mean I see the angle of I mean. Obviously this is a very important issue and you know really yeah a worthwhile issue. You know, but, as Colleen has said, you know in previous meetings, you know fat chance of getting the deal. Oh, no. I mean, I think the idea would be to ask Corey to introduce legislation to change that and that may not be effective. Now it may be effective in the next. You know in the next mayor. Ah, okay. Well, that was that so I'm talking about a bigger, a big plan here, but do you think yeah? No, I agree with that. Having it in the next mayor is makes a lot of sense. This is another. This is another stretch goal for our committee right no, but I mean it came also from the discussion we had one months ago where, because the sidewalk is not maintained, then we can't do neck down for safety right and we're like what the heck. So first, you can say: okay, we're going to ask them to do neck down to do neck down, and then you say, but why is the sidewalk not maintained right? No, I completely agree, but let me get my let me get my point out, which is that you think this is an angle toward this. Is you know just a strategy to towards implementing this at some point in the near future? Do you think this equity strategy is the best one we've got I mean, I'm not I'm not convinced I mean, maybe it maybe you're right and you know, obviously I hope you're right. But my question is this: using you know ethnicity going to get us. Our is the best path to get to our goal. Well, I do not know, but if we are saying as CB4 which we have said that we were trying to look in every committee and say, let's find some places where there is no equity. I think we found it right and now what are we going to do about it? So I mean, even if we do not win, I think it's worthwhile to raise it and say it's pretty shocking. I mean David. I think. Maybe your question is: do we lead with the equity issue or do we lead with? We can't get these neck downs? Why are the sidewalks privatized? Let's look at you know a that would be the discussion about the letter and how to present it, etc. Right then, and you're right, I have thought about different ways of presenting it. I do not know it seems to me, though, if equity, if everybody is serious about equity and if the mayoral candidate are serious about equity. That could be a very important issue to address, because that's a very big gift. The second angle is, you know the small businesses and everybody is trying to have laws here about how to alleviate taxes, how to alleviate this, and that and right there. You can say: look I'm going to take away from you a big, a big liability and that's a big giveaway to give back to the to yeah that I actually think that's right. I think that's a better, a better approach or not necessarily instead, but yes, I think all of it. You you'll see the draft. I mean there is a lot of you know. I mean it's all of a piece and yeah and we can figure it out, but there is a lot of things too. I mean you can talk about. You can talk about the. What is it called environment? If you really want to do permeable, you know permeable sidewalks yeah, well, that the only way is that if the city does it each of the each of the small shop is not going to do a permeable sidewalk in front of them. You know we. So if this is, there are 50, there are five or six issues linked to that. We are all trying to achieve, and then you have the sidewalk and yeah christine. Just one quick point, I mean you brought up some things, which is a much bigger issue I mean rest of the world is actually it has contact with civilization. Our sidewalks are from 20th century yeah. We have not reinvented them. We have not looked at them again exactly from design point of view. They become part of product design, strategies acrosss the Globe Times Square tried doing something similar in terms of you know having these papers that would generate energy and harvest energy and sort of water harvesting, and whatever have you cities. Scales of I mean New. York City is an amazing scale where you could achieve those results. So you know we are in the second or end of the second decade of I mean to me, that's that and to me that's the first step into looking at the sidewalk and reinventing the sidewalk, where maybe I do not want to sidewalk, but that's beyond that right, but at the beginning, if you do not have the city looking at the sidewalks like they care about it right now, they do not care about it. They do not care about the pedestrian. They do not care about the sidewalk. They do not care about this whole area and I'm paying taxes for it, which really pisses me off really frankly, so anyway, I think we can. We can have tremendous discussion about that yeah, but the big biggest big biggest argument christine, is that sidewalks is a collective resource for the city and for the community and then it's the only one. They do not maintain yeah and I think, there's actually value in actually looking at it as a resource that you can actually draw from. I think that's the kind of argument we can put forward again. The mechanism is something that I'm not playing, so that's another discussion which instead, I thought was matching well with you know the mission of the equity group and saying you know it does. It does relate to that. But there are many arguments why the sidewalk should be maintained, so I'll send around some documents, and then we can have a further discussion next week. Brett. Is that a new hand yeah? So I just just I know we do not want to make this a long discussion for this month. I would just caution about making equity part of the sidewalk maintenance program, because someone, I think, could very easily say that many of the landlords that have the responsibility of building the sidewalk are people that are not in that. You know equity. You know you know these are these. Are you know if you can afford a building in New York City? You probably already have some money so therefore, maybe we should make those people pay for the sidewalks. Absolutely that argument out there yeah that I could the whole thing could unravel. I think you know thinks about like. I think it's really about two things: one, it's about the current system is not working, and if anybody has any disagreements about that, I will point you to 29th, Street and 8th avenue, where we have a pit in the sidewalk that I'm worried. That landmarks is going to come and say you can no longer fix that because it's not a landmark sidewalk dent. So that's one reason: it's the effectiveness. I do not think we can say that the current system is working and, I think is you know the point that you're making christine and others is this is you know we talk about complete streets and a holistic approach to transportation? The sidewalk is currently absent from that equation, and it makes no sense. I think it's just about doing the right thing. You know the equity thing could be a side conversation. While we want to talk about equity and then you know the accessibility on sidewalks again, if we're not doing a good job with the current system for fixing sidewalks and so now, sidewalks are not accessible because we have too much sidewalk furniture. We have too many cracks, Et cetera. That's also an important issue that you know it's equity when it comes to accessibility, too yeah. I agree with Brad. I think equity is part of it, but it's sort of forward into it. I think we need to have a list of priorities that accessibility materiality sustainability. These are the major issues you know if you're looking at comprehensively as complete speed, I think that if you feel like a number I'll, send you the text, because I think you know I'm always looking at what is going to get. You know the elected officials interested right. So we need to find that that part of the equation- Rob Walker, hey yeah- I just wanted to add one or two things. This is a great idea for planting the seeds, so we could get legislation, so the city takes care of the sidewalks. We have issues right now with the sidewalks that different departments will come in. They will tear up a perfectly good sidewalk to do whatever underneath and then they'll fill it with asphalt, and then we wait two or three years for them to replace it with cement and the whole time. Whoever owns that real estate out front's like well, I did not tear it up. They put a band- aid on it, they should fix it. I hope the city does take this over years to come, but the whoever owns that real estate out front needs to be responsible for cleaning that sidewalk for the snow debris and so on. That's it, okay, all right! So he has a question as well who Alan Oster? Oh yes, Alan hi. Can you hear me yeah? Yes, okay, so actually it's a follow- up to the gentleman's comment. Just now try to keep this simple and that snow removal this winter, we struggle to walk down the sidewalks of our city, retail stores, who I assume or landlords, are supposed to clear the sidewalks. By a certain time. We find that especially the retail stores, they'll, throw out assault and consider that their responsibility is over with or they'll put a little trail in the middle of the street. However, coming winter, since a lot of these retail stores unfortunately are not going to be open. I have great concerns for our senior citizens or handicapped people. Parents pushing strollers on the street to get to school or somewhere, where it's just going to be impossible for people to really get around this winter. So I'm thinking, perhaps the committee and maybe through our district manager. If there's some way, the agencies can contact the building owners, especially on the avenues that they're responsible to maintain the sidewalks this winter and insist that will need to be done, that there are going to be inspections on the sidewalks and there will be summonses given out again. This is going to be a tough winter, hopefully not a tough winter snow wise. But if we do get a lot of snow, I'm just concerned that a lot of people are not going to be able to get out of their homes too easily and walking on the sidewalks is going to be a challenge for a lot of people, so I'm assuming either DOB or somebody has a list of every building owner in the city that has commercial space in the in the building. Obviously we're hoping that our homeowners will take care of their own sidewalks and that's something. Maybe the block associations could reach out to other homeowners just to remind them to do that, but I think we need to put something in the works in terms of the city reaching out to property owners to be aware that they need to take care of their sidewalks this winter. Thank you that's a very good idea. So maybe that's maybe that's a short letter. We can send them this month, which kind of start to the ball rolling on the issues of maintenance, because that issue is not going to go away. There are going to be a lot of stores closed for quite for two years for one or two years. Is that a letter to corey to the deal? I think that would be a letter to the DOT and the department of finance. Has I mean D.O.T could go to finance? I mean you see, that's the problem is that then it's sanitation, it's D.O.T. Who is it? You know people are supposed to? Maybe that's to both of them and say look. This is this is an issue upcoming and you should remind people that landlords that they still need to do. The maintenance right- yes, that's a good start. That's like we're opening the door with a very practical issue, yeah exactly it's sort of you know. In a way we we've used the pandemic for open streets. We can use the pandemic for getting clean, sidewalks right. So I would I mean somebody can make a motion on that. This is. We will do a very simple letter and maybe Alan you can give it a shot to take a draft that was a yes right. Yes, so somebody make a motion dale or no, not there David somebody! I make the motion. Okay, do we have a second check it? Okay, all in favor aye, not against present non- eligible all good okay. So this is a letter on that's very good. Thank you, Alan all right. So, finally, not, finally, because I know that there is a new item, but let's take the new item. First Martin. What is the new item? You are in mute you're on okay, good yeah. Can you hear us christine? Yes, I'm speaking for Martin and myself about the proliferation of loud motorcycles on weekends, especially on Ninth Avenue. I do not know how far they I watched them come down from 57th street. They often turn east on an eastbound street like 44th Street, sometimes on 42nd street. They rarely go to Lincoln Tunnel. They seem one. They seem to desire to go to the east side of Manhattan, but anybody who lives in this neighborhood and knows what I'm talking about on Saturday. We did not get to sleep until three o'clock in the morning, even with our windows closed and I'm wondering if the doc could somehow close off, maybe 7th Avenue going downtown at 6Th Avenue going uptown in the evenings on weekends, less residential Martin says it's. The police may be working with D.O.T. That's it! I'm glad you raised this because I was going to raise it if you did not because there seems to be a proliferation of street racing, yeah, it's getting worse yeah and it's there's a there's. A group of bikers and there's also drag race style street racing. That's going on. I heard it last night here on 34th street and yeah. So I do not know. I do not know what the approach is. That would be the most effective, but so Brad Oilman is introducing your legislation right against drag racing, and but that does not address just a noise I mean you know, so I think we need to talk to what's his name Jesse and ask him to talk to the NYPD and see if they can do a special session on was it on Saturday or Sunday. It's disturbing the piece. I guess it's Friday night. What I'm saying is that one day Friday night Saturday night, it was terrible, Friday and Saturday night, okay, yeah. It leads into Sunday, but it's really the weekends. Mostly I heard it Saturday and Sunday on 34Th Street amen. Also, presumably folks should be getting speeding tickets yeah. What could be done? I mean the cops do not enforce really speed, because I think the state gets the money for moving violation. That's the law which is being introduced by Brad Oilman is to would be to put a camera. You know a camera to enforce. The thing is that these street racers they're not new they're, not brand new. They know they know how to get away with this right. They've been doing a lot of street racing in other boroughs. Manhattan is now like wow amazing. These avenues are nearly empty at night and so they're like oh, let's go race on 7th Avenue now, so it's like they're, not they know how to get away with it. Well, maybe we could put up obstructions, so they can't like they'll hit a barricade or something or a can. We could set the avenues on fire at night and he's going to talk to NYPD, because NYPD needs to enforce that. So that's the only that's the only thing we can do. Okay and also just make clear to Jesse that it's not just the usual weekend. These are organized groups that are doing street racing right. Okay, let's talk about the budget for one second, so the budget is we're going to do the same thing we did before. We are going to prioritize the issues and we're going to try to have a very small set of issues that we want to propose because we know there is going to be less money and there is no point in organizing and prioritizing 25 issues if we are going to get money for two right. So we want to identify what are the top three capital and what are the top three expenses that we want to submit to the budget group, which is then going to merge them and extract the top five? Probably so. I just wanted to mention to you that we're going to add four new items that we for which we included letters, and I think the better way to do it is probably I'll. Send you a survey and you can all individually rank those things and figure whether you want them to be number one, two, three four five next year, so we do not have to spend a lot of time and then next month we can discuss further the results or in between we can discuss. The result is that, okay for everybody? Yes, if Dale is okay for you, I like the idea of a survey sure right. Okay, all right, so that's that's it. For today, I'm ready to entertain a motion to adjourn. Yes janine, you have the votes. Okay, great! Are you able to generate a survey like the one we outlined? Yes, I'll talk to katya she's, the one that tends to do the forms and stuff for us and we'll come up with something? Okay, great? Okay! Thank you very much everybody that was very interesting. Thank you. Everyone bye.",
            "summary": "We wanted to add something to new business at some point: okay, Agenda, all right, The first item on the agenda is the turning movement at 36Th Street in Ninth, Avenue.\nThe little context here is that this is the bike lane going down, ninth Avenue and at 36Th Street.\nSo, let's just try to put the fire out, but I think this is just another reason for us to keep D.O.T accountable for these mixing zones that we've long identified as dangerous, dangerous designs for bicyclists You know on a Wednesday night, because you're concerned about safety of people outside of your business.\nI know that on 38- 9, this is my street You know D.O.T to retrofit all of them, But and now with the issues of budget Unless Colin, you have another one that you want to add in the same letter, and we can do that, I'm, not aware of him off the top of my head.\nI, just read it because we were going to discuss The You know the budget, Oh, my god, and the fact that construction is happening at a particular location where there's a mixing zone.\nThe person who sent us the initial letter there actually were two people who raised this issue is Stefan.\nHe was just essentially complaining about his treatment at the barricades that he did not sign up to be interrogated by police officers about his whereabouts and his comings and goings as he came and entered his apartment also that it had it caused trouble for him with as far as like getting car services or ride, shares, and also it obviously, it interfered with traffic.\nI live acrosss the street between 9th and 10th, but because I live on 54th, I, frequently walk down 54th with my stroller, with my children, which, by the way and I've, had a chronic problem with the police officers parking there They park on the sidewalk, sometimes they park so close to the police precinct that I can not fit my stroller in between their car and the the community Court or the precinct building itself, because there's a bump out with stairs there.\nIt's, completely gone now, so I think we're just sort of litigating their past mistakes now, rather than trying to change something, although I think we could advocate for them in general to not park their cars all over the sidewalk.\nThey were not allowing anybody onto the block, and I worked, I emailed with the neighborhood community officer and just sort of pleaded, my case, why do not you move the barricades back 20 feet and allow people just to get a CitiBike and come and go?\nBut I mean how is what is the situation with the parking right now Can you access the sidewalk and is it?\nYou feel like the entire curb is dedicated to the police force, but I noticed that they have painted lines on the sidewalk white painted lines for parking, and I was kind of rolling my eyes at that.\nYou know, if we're, if we're going to agree as a community that they're allowed to park on the sidewalk, which I do not necessarily agree with that.\nYou, know thanking them for reopening you know And, you know the sidewalk is a major issue and we need to have a better delineation between the cars and the pedestrians and making sure it's open and making sure that the people with strollers can go through Et, cetera, Et cetera and therefore recommend that they install those vertical ballards which are very inexpensive, but would be a good signal of you.\nNo, I think a couple of things and parking on the sidewalk is not permitted in New York, City.\nI propose a resolution that we enforce the rules where you can't park on the sidewalk and let them know that would be my resolution.\nI'm, just saying, like I'm, asking us as a committee to weigh the possible outcomes like we can tell them they're being bad actors in the civic space of the streets of the precincts, and they will say you know they'll trash Can, our letter.\nI think that it makes more sense just to say that they can't park on the sidewalk, I'm, not really in any mood to like compromise with the NYPD.\nYou, know agitative, but I think also they're not supposed to park on the sidewalk, and so I do not think they should.\nSo I do not know if a resolution is going to be terribly effective without At least not to not said that NYPD.\nI think it's got to go through the electeds, because the electeds maybe stand a chance at wielding some kind of power over a policy issue in the streets.\nWe need to show up and force to some of the police district meetings to talk about this, but it's a big issue in terms of us being subject to whatever the NYPD is going to do with this podcast.\nWe'll include the law in a way that does not say violent words right, but will you It's better worrying refer to the law, which says you are not supposed to be on the sidewalk, and this is still an issue even that the fact that the blocks have been reopened.\nPeople can not go through the sidewalk for distancing and for ADA and for you know, strollers, and it really It is illegal to park on the sidewalk and therefore we are asking them to not park on the sidewalk and the emphasis on clearance for social distance, reasons, also and better communication moving forward.\nIt was a joint effort of the mayor's office and Oakland has eight City council members, seven by district and one at large, and they all participated as along with a bunch of other stakeholders like their office of Disabilities area, residents, cycling, groups and activists, and a couple of non- profit organizations, and then the transit stakeholders, such as Caltrans and Bart, were on their advisory committee.\nThey did a kind of master survey and they also employed what they described as an equity framework, and they also did very extensive, like in- person and social media outreach on any available channel to get input from the from the resident, and the plan itself has like a kind of built- in framework for focusing on disadvantaged groups who may not always have access to this to cycling as a means of transit, amen and referring back to what we talked about in a prior meeting.\nThere's lots of super interesting and detailed, recommendations, and I think a lot of them would have great potential here in our district and in the city at large, but I'm not really like advocating.\nBut it's not to advocate for, like Let's crib, their work We think our city should take on this kind of comprehensive plan, and you know, look at the same kind of like engagement of stakeholders, equity, framework, business development, strategy.\nI mean in a sense, you know, is the city just going to say?\nYou know, there's no point in studying something if you do not think it's going to matter, because there people are just going to say, well, We've already gone down that road.\nYou've just confirmed that we should go down that road, so I think one thing that distinguishes this document from like just a data crunch, is that you know the it clearly outlines an equity framework which I do not think is part, especially of the RPA plan, for instance, and also that business development component, which you know here We, have a very large corporation, engaging in the most you know, important rollout of, as opposed to the Oakland model, which was let's bring up small businesses and especially small business POC on small businesses to meet some of our our needs for cycling.\nYou know that we that equity and transportation is a goal that we need to get to, So then you go to community boards.\nThink if we want to try to think like more tactically, there could be an opportunity, obviously like the streets, master plan, where you know the first iteration is supposed to be released by DOT next December.\nAs, you know, we understand you are going to be working on this plan and just like try to engage in that way with D.O.T. You know an entirely distinct bike plan.\nI. Think the angle would be to talk about the you know, equity and really the job developing some jobs.\nThe only way is to link it to veren that you know the question from your working group and maybe have you start to look at the report and extract from that, the things that could that fit in the working group and that could be a joint letter.\nUp to now we have been working on sidewalk and we have talked a lot about the space you know.\nBy the issues of equity: There are about 3.6 million people who use the sidewalk and probably more, but I mean we use it in an intensive way to commute to to do the first leg of transit.\nThe sidewalk is really a place where equity is very, which is really very important, and one thing which is happening in New York City is since 2003.\nYou is there's a proposal to discuss how to ask for the sidewalk to be maintained by the city, certainly in our neighborhood and in other neighborhood, and so that we get to a level of equity between the people which are walking, of which many are you know, again.\nWell, I do not know, but if we are saying as CB4, which we have said that we were trying to look in every committee and say, let's find some places where there is no equity.\nThat's, also an important issue that you know it's equity when it comes to accessibility, too I think equity is part of it, but it's sort of forward into it."
