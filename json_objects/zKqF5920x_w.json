You have to mute Pat Moore good evening, the chair of our quality of life committee in Community Board one. Do you hear an extra feedback from someone yeah? I do so. We have an incredible tech team from the borough president's office. So, let's I'm sure they'll fix that I'll. Just leave that at that alrighty we this meeting for community Board one tonight is again with DSS and DHS and project renewal, the topic of 52 Williams Street. We will be running a slight bit different than we ran last time and how that is because we had a large number of questions that were still unanswered. After the last meeting. We still again have from 6 P.M to 8 P.M this evening, so we will be efficient when we call people from panelists to speak. You have two minutes not more. Please know that there is no back and forth simply because it's just not an option of to be able to be very functional, raise your hand, and I will try and recognize you when I can. Let me tell you how the meeting will work this evening, so we're going to start with our elected officials if they have anything that they would like to say, and then we will jump immediately into the Q&A period. We do practice decorum and Robert's rules. A note from the last time. Please do not put anything in the chat you would not be really proud of, or you would not want your mother to hear or your child. I say that respectfully this is a public meeting. Everything is recorded and everything lives on the internet for posterity. So with that, it's a highly charged event, and we all know this and we all are working together on the same page. So with that in mind, let me see if Senator Kavanaugh here yet and if not, we will return for him. So no worries senator cavanaugh. If he is not here, I know that we have our other elected officials on the line. I do not expect them to speak yet. So, if someone does, you know, we will recognize them as they come in, so we're going to jump right into some of the Q&A portions that we have from last week and there were additional questions sent in within the last 48 hours. I know so Pat, let's take it from there. So one of the questions that we had is the move still going to happen. This is for DSS and DHS. Is the move still going to happen during the week of October 19th? If not when, but let me also say that the community has recently heard that the move will actually happen. Beginning on Monday, which is the 12th. Is this true thanks? Pat, this is Jocelyn Carter from Department of Homeland services, the administrator. The move is scheduled to happen the week of October 19th no later than that week we're in the process of getting the building prepared. The move is not happening on Monday the 12th. We are shooting to have the move happen no later in the week of October 19th great. Thank you. Has the city made a commitment for a date that the Lucerne would be empty? If so, what is it, and why is the move being rushed? We will we will exit? Our plan is to exit that person from that hotel during that week, once the last person has exited the hotel will no longer be in use. The contract will end at that time. So that's the commitment. The date was to get out by the week of the 19th. Right and again, we feel like the move is being rushed. Is there an answer you'd like to give us on why it has to happen the week of the 19th and not later, we had initially planned to move probably the week of the 12th and we've pushed it back then give opportunity to make sure that the building is ready at the our Williams Street. Okay, may I ask a follow- up you've had let me ask a follow- up. You said that earlier than the 19th the move be earlier and at what point earlier, if you've said not on Monday, but that you know there's six days left in the week. So are you talking Tuesday? So are you sorry? I apologize Jocelyn, I'm looking for your picture just to make sure I've got you so I can see I can see when you're talking there we go. I've got you! Thank you, okay, so our plan is to not move applies to no later than the week of the 19th. We are working to get the building all ready. So there's no move happening on the 12th. There's no plan to move you know on that week. If the building is ready and empty project manual could start moving the equipment in, but our plan is to move in the week of the 19. no later than that week. Okay, I'm going to continue that. So please comment on the recent news of the closing of NYPD support for security for shelters and how that relates, or does not to the existing plans. Thanks, patricia thanks man. We know that the safety of those we serve is a top priority. Several months ago, when the budget was released during this fiscal year, we are committed to evaluate how we can provide security safely and more holistically. One of the things I talked about since I've been in this seat is making sure that we look at the entire picture of a person, and so we really want to look at a client, centered approach as we move forward. There are times when we know social services. Our response to a mental health crisis may help a client who's experiencing a challenging episode and feel safer. On the other hand, we do know that our DHS police officers are trained in de- escalation and they also train in crisis intervention, and so they are positioned to coordinate our security at our intake sites that have much more higher activity, and so we know there are no easy answers. We have to figure out how to strike a balance between both of those realities, keeping people on hand insecure in all. We do, while listening to their lived experiences and learning from that. So we intend to work closely with our non- profit, social services providers, to discuss our reforms and our goals. I've been in this sea for just over three years, three and a half years actually, and we want to think about how do we move this plan forward? This is one of the things that I've been thinking about and working with my team, I'm on this shared vision, and so you know looking at policing versus client centered, so we want to make sure that we kind of have a balance there, but at this site we did approve additional security staff for project renewal. I know that they are in the process in the hiring process and I believe that clients have been identified project you know. Could you just confirm that I think you would identify candidates? Yes, we are in the process of onboarding engagement specialists who will work external to the building on engaging our clients. If they're seen in the community towards the goal of bringing them back to the hotel for services, we should have these staff onboarded in the next few weeks. Thank you, Julie, okay. So I'm going to go with four when the city cites a shelter. What coordination, if any, is done with NYPD neighborhood community officers, so at all you know of our the temporary hotels. Our providers work with the neighborhood coordination offices to ensure quality of life at our permanent shelters. We invite our NCOS to participate in our Community Board Advisory Board meetings. Once the permanent shelter is set up, we will establish that and that will be led by the provider and the NCOS will be invited to participate there. We have absolutely committed, in all of our touring, to thai shelters, to have a community board established to make information shared between the community and the NCOS participate in those. Can I ask Jocelyn why you would set up a separate community board meeting beyond the existing system of feedback that has the NCOS have a meeting that they do a neighborhood policing meeting that they sus? They collect information from the people in the community and work with the community board. The community board itself has a quality of life committee. Why would you set up a third diluting the process? Further committee meeting? So a community advisory board for the shelter right, so the community board meetings with NCOS that I attended my neighborhood well, you know certainly that continues, but at the shelter itself, in a permanent shelter, we have community advisory boards to really share information. What's happening. We're talking. Does that apply to hold on you're. It's a little cart before the horse. We're talking about a temporary shelter you're talking about permanent shelters. Is that relevant to this as a temporary shelter for a community advisory board, because there has been no fair share review for a permanent shelter yet in lower Manhattan. So please explain if a cab applies where in the process and if it applies for a temporary shelter or permanent or both the Community Advisory board, we established them under our attorney tight plan for permanent shelters. Once there is a the shelter permanent shelter that we intend to have opens, there will be a community advisory board for that shelter. We do not do advisory boards, community writing boards in hotels and how why not? Pat you go: okay, justine! No okay! Is there a reason? Is there a reason that a temporary shelter I mean I'm not really sure what defines us temporary? As you know, we discussed last week in lower Manhattan temporary has been as long as 15 years. So I'm really you know we do not know with Covid-19 how long the restrictions are. If you look at the planning that has been done for the schools, it's a year- long program. So what is the temporariness of this shelter and how often is the quote: Unquote temporary, renewed in that case, so we understand you say you do not do it for temporary hotel shelters. We do not do them for hotels. These the identified hotels we opened because of the pandemic to save lives. During this pandemic we will follow the advice of the health department to establish when we will return to our shelter of origins where our clients are come from. So we have to follow the advice and that guidance. Once we get that guidance and says it's time we can return, we will be able to do that. We do have meetings with stakeholders we'll continue to have meetings with you all for this shelter. As we are there, I guess I want to ask the question so if this is a temporary shelter and it's in a hotel- and you do not do cabs for hotels, if this were to become a permanent location, would it be declassified as a hotel and only classified as a shelter permanent? And so therefore you would have a cab, yes yeah. So what? When our intention is, as I've said since last week, is to open a permanent adult family shelter in this location. Once a proposal comes to us and is related, we will start negotiations and we certainly as we open that site, we'll have a community advisory board. It will not be a hotel, it'd, be an adult family shelter. So I think we should have go through the com, the questions that Pat has about it being temporary. There are far more questions about permanence and the following of fair share and the process and open and procedure documentation. There's so many more questions that come with that. So I'm going to not jump on that now and I'm going to wait for pat okay, so we're just going to continue. So this move is not part of the densifying and overpopulated shelter home as their homes were already subdivided. So what part of the emergency order does this relate to with the move am a little bit confused, because the need to operate this site for single adults is still part of the dedensification process. Our intention, though, that I talked about, is to turn this into a high quality shelter for adult families right. So this would be the first of its kind, this community district jocelyn. That does not john that's long- term. We're talking the short- term answers not the long term for now please. So it continues to be a part of our de- densified efforts, so we continue to need the identification. So this is how this is why we're using that site, but they are already currently densified at the Lucerne. So the question I have is, as the city made a commitment for a date that the Lucerne would be emptied. I yeah the loser will be empty starting the week of the 19th of this month, and why is that being rushed? I think I right so we our commitment, is to not move before that week. Initially, we had planned to move earlier at this point. We've pushed it back to that week, so we are making sure that the building is ready before we start moving the clients into the building. But there is no difference in terms of de- densifying. You are not de- densifying, this group of people from the Lucerne. It's an exact, move, correct. It's an in- kind, move from hotel to hotel right you're, not decreasing the population, you're moving 235 people right so part of what we looked at when we moved initially. You know we looked at really being able to redistribute and use a site that we have, because we have the opportunity to turn it into an adult family shelter. So this was already there so we're able to move the men from you know where they are to your the site, down in fidei, less hotels, they're only two down in the neighborhood, and so we were able to identify using the site and get the ability to turn it into an adult family shelter. So, in other words, there is no reduction, and there is this is not de- densifying, the group that was at the Lucerne. This is a hotel to hotel move with no de- densification of the group itself. One of the things that I will say that we reduced the census now so we're bringing two to 35, which is a less capacity that initially the census was right, but you're still not densifying. The 235 is being moved in kind, so you have 235 at Lucerne and you're moving 235 to 52 William Street. So the second part of the question was what part of the emergency order does this relate to with the move? If it is not about de- densifying, I mean I one of the things that I have to say is that we get the ability to use the space to turn it into a long- term opportunity. We had the opportunity we no longer need it for the use that we were using it for, and so it gives us an opportunity to use this space, remove the numbers where they were where they are now to a site where there are less shelters in that neighborhood that in the fight I neighborhood so really even go ahead. Pat! No, I'm sorry, so it really does not apply to the emergency order. It's it is it is. It is part of saving lives during this pandemic. It is part of you know, really not congregate. Shelters. We moved back in March. April may very quickly we're looking to redistribute where the hotels are at this point jocelyn. At this point, however, you have a group of men who are thriving in the location that they're at and have a potential for jobs that disappears, as the borough president has said, when they come downtown, those jobs are not available in this area. There is nothing here, so why would the city choose to do this to a group of men to destabilize them? You could have just as easily closed down the shelter at the Radisson Hotel, the quarantine, shelter and you could have looked for a more permanent solution for people and gone through a lot appropriate process with fair share and found location. This is not de- densifying. So why explain to me? Move people away from to recreate what they have and which will also be a loss because they are losing jobs they you may be able to recreate all the services with project renewal, but you can not recreate the jobs which is, I would think. Oh, I do not know steps one through five in making successful transitions back to for them. I mean, if you said to me: we found them 50 jobs down here we got them 50 jobs, so they're not losing anything, but so far this is a hotel- to- hotel move. This does not de- densify, so it does not fall under the de- densifier shelter. This is a space to a space. The only people who are losing here are the are the men themselves. I know that in community board one we are. We are a amazingly resilient community that will bounce back from the pandemic and the economic recovery and we will work with the city to find a place that can be a good location for people to get back on their feet, a place where they're not on a tiny sidewalk, a place where your services can go and a place where we can help everybody. This so far from what I'm hearing does not say anything to that pat has another long list, but please, when you're answering, can you try and answer the direct question that she asked where, in the emergency order, does the densifying a shelter for a move that is point a to point b work which is currently at the detriment of the people there? So I yeah multiple, let's unpack what you just talked about. The men that are currently in the Lucerne who we're moving will continue to get the same services when they come down to the Radisson Hotel hotel, they're, also working with other organizations to look at job training project when you actually do have drop training so that there's opportunity to be able to be self- sufficient. That is happening, the god at Riverside- and I know the madame our president talked about this. You know the funding that has been raised. We do have, and this it does not really will be helpful to you, but we do have other shelters up in the upper West side. That would be able to benefit from that our space that was found there, as well as around the money that was raised to help folks in shelter, and so that's part of that, and that we would be able to have other clients utilize that you know we have 17,000 in shelter who can certainly benefit a portion of them could benefit from that in terms of the emergency order. This is a pandemic. I know that you know it seems like it's not, but it is a pandemic. We use hotels to be able to save lives. That is what we're doing. That is what we're continuing to do. We will be able to do the move down to the Radisson Hotel side to continue services. That's happening to keep them safe from not being in congregate settings. We are redistributing where they are now and we have an opportunity to use a site that we can move into a site that will serve our adult families. We also know that down in the in Phi day, there are two hotels and one of the things that we do know and we've said in the tournament of thai plan- is that we do want to have shelters in every community district, and so that's part of our overall planning. It is a safety measure. It continues to be a safe to measure how the pandemic continues. So you know this is where we are all right. I'm going to continue so please define how 52 william is an optimal location. What other locations in CB1 were declined in favor of this location, so it does meet our longer term planning. I talked about alternative type plan. It does meet our borrower- based approach. We do want to have high quality shelters in every district, and so we for us and for DHS and opening shelters that are a high quality. This does meet that for us using it for our quarantine site during Covid-19 created this opportunity. For us, and so for us, we've been using it temporarily since March. This is another, you know continuing to use it temporarily. While we move towards permanent location in this community district, we do not have a permanent location in this district. We want to have one in every district in New, York City, and this gives us that opportunity. So for us this is a short- term plan. We will we're soliciting right now for proposals or plan. Our intention, like I said to you last week and tonight, is that we, our intentions, is to move it towards an adult facility, and this site gives us an opportunity. This, you know, circumstance gives us, and so we should the emergency order, then bifurcate the need for fair share process in sighting of a facility. So are you? Are you citing a facility, a permanent facility under the emergency order, or will the city commit to the proper process that includes fair share evaluation so for the city charter? One of the things I would say to you. First of all, I'm not an attorney, so I'm going to just be very clear around that, and what I am, what I will say to you is that our work in moving towards a higher high quality shelters has not stopped during this pandemic. So part of our job is to really create high quality opportunities for the folks who come to us in this emergency. That process is continuing. We've actually opened a site this week for single men we have announced. This is the 74th site that we announced. So the emergency order continues our work. There continues that has not stopped. Independent processes have been continuing since we started in this pandemic that continues. That has not stopped. The process of fair share requires from city charter, the acknowledgement and inclusion of all shelters regardless if they are run by DHS or not and all services, it requires a list of documents to be included. So what you have said and sent is only referenced and claims there are no shelters other than the ones that DHS has provided. That is patently false. Tell me so I'm asking about fair share in the sighting, because you keep referring to turning this one location into a permanent shelter, and my question is: are: is this being done under the emergency order? So or will it be done through the regular city process? So I am where you know so I am trying to hear the question and in my head trying to figure out kind of you know this there's two tracks right. The process of fair share will happen. You know, as we move towards moving this process towards a permanent show, there will be a fair share done. Yes, that is going to be completed. What needs to happen now is that we need to get a proposal in. We have an open- ended RFP. Once a proposal comes in then that process kicks in and there will be a fair share done. So you know that has not changed. That will continue to happen. Fair share is supposed to be done before the sighting, that is city charter, so correct. Yes, so once we get a proposal right once you get a proposal, we will certainly have a fair share. So once the site, the proposal comes to us exciting. We rate the proposal and then the process starts, and I will you know you know we're going back and forth in this fair share piece. But you know, through the city charter, permanent sites will have a fair share. Yes, I'd like to go back to the other part of that question, so what other locations in CB1 were declined in favor of this one? So what I will say to you is that the commissioner, for the last few years, has sent letters to every community district asking for to bring us buildings right. Those locations that you all think would be a site that can be a shelter right. So we have this opportunity now that we know of this one. If there are other sites that are available that can be brought to us, we will certainly evaluate them. So there's an open- ended letter that comes out. We say hey, you know, commissioner, banks writes this letter goes out that says we're looking for optimal places to open shelters, send it to us. Every community district has an opportunity this one. We know because we've been using it, so we have the space. We have the space right now. We, our intentions, are moving through that other process. So your answer is no. So if you know, if they're buildings you want to bring to us, certainly we will evaluate them and they may, instead of 52 becoming the permanent shelter. If there's another site, that is a better site that might become the permanent shelter right. So we evaluate, if there's another site. So what I'm saying to you is that we want to be able to have shelters at every community district in New, York City. That is part of what we've said. We want to do. That's what we're drawing. We have a shelter already that you do not recognize. We announced 74 our shelters in alternative type plan. We said we'll open, 90. we're at 74.. We have actually opened 40. Right Department of Homeless services plan is to open, 90, new shelters or to really raise the standard. Our expectation is that if a building comes up, we will evaluate it. We get proposals, we evaluate them. So you know the. If there's a building that you believe is meets the standards, we will evaluate it. So 52 is not a done deal as a permanent shelter. So at this point our intention is: we do not have a proposal, okay, so moving along. When is the contract up at the Lucerne, and will the city be paying for the Lucerne after these people are moved out? If so, for how long? Once the last resident of client exits, the story would no longer get any payments from us? Okay, and what is the contract up the once the for the Lucerne once the last client the way the process works with us now that we can end contracts at any time, so we do not have a need for a discern. There will not be any contract ends at that point. So, once a lot once the last gentleman of the 235 moves out the contract's up. Okay, all right so and has a commitment been made to the Lucerne for what date? That will be. What I keep saying and my belief is that the week of the 19th we intend to move the last resident out during that week. Lucerne is aware that we are leaving. The story is the way we're leaving that week. Our intention is to have all the residents out that week, whatever date that happened, 19:20 21,22, whatever date- that is, that will be the last date that we pay for the Lucerne okay moving along what is the city paying for the Lucerne location and how? Oh I'm sorry, it's? What is the city paying for 52 William and how does that compare to the cern and other temporary locations? So we opened just over 60 hotels through the Hotel Association of New York, I'm doing a pandemic. The average nightly rate is about 120 for the room itself, so 120 per night at the Radisson Hotel is what we're talking about correct the average for the hotels. Okay. Is that any hotel, or is that specific to the Radisson Hotel? That's the average for all the corporate 19 hotels that we've been using is the Radisson Hotel more or less expensive than the Lucerne. The contractors through the Hotel Association of New York, I can tell you- I do not know what the number is for the Radisson Hotel, the average is 120. and what role pat you've got hotel association questions there right now, yeah. Okay, so where are we sorry last track? Was there any type of oversight or competitive bid process? Was there any adherence to the regular rules on procurement pursuant to the laws and regulations in New York City? How can this be justified with the comptroller's office, the charter mandated role in approving and registering contracts related to the Covid-19 pandemic? If you need me to break it down, I will let me let me try and answer to the best of my ability and then you could ask for the questions so those new yorkers who experience homelessness, certainly counting our services every single day they're. You know we really want to make sure that we have non- for- profit partners who deliver the services you know and we serve as that safety net. So the city registered the contracts pursuant to the executive order, 101, and that is based between the mayor's office of contract services and the comptroller office regarding contract registration during the Covid-19 crisis, and that is a goal to ensure continuing shelter services and our ability to work with service providers right. So this is through office of contract services and the comptroller's office. Does the office want to comment on that sure? The only comment I would add is that in August we requested of the mayor to return some of those oversight authorities for contracting, which we under usual circumstances have. We totally understand that in the beginning of the pandemic, when it was about procuring PPE and ventilators, that, of course, extreme measures were needed to be taken. But since in August we sent a letter requesting that the usual registration and oversight transparency process for contracts would be resumed per usual. So far we have not received that authority and oversight back, and we continue to request that, given that the pandemic is, of course ongoing, but in a more stable place now that emergency authority be rescinded and the transparency and oversight mechanisms with which the controller's offices can usually use are re- implemented. Have you been given any reason why they have not returned the oversight to the comptroller's office? Not to my knowledge, Tammy. I see you lean. I see an assembly member, you lean, looking fairly stunned and sort of like so elaine feel free. If you would like to unmute yourself at any point and thank you for joining us. Thank you and I also see yeah. I see Manhattan borough president Brewer here. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us. You know we are all very grateful for our elected support. I think Senator Kavanaugh is here somewhere and I do see Council member Chin, so everybody is here. Thank you very much I'll. Let Pat keep going. Is a failure? Do you? Everyone should be rallying to have the oversight put back at the comptroller's office. All right. This is a fairly long question. I'm going to break it down. What is the role of the Hotel Association in sourcing locations on August 24th Dhs's contract with the Hotel Association of New York City was amended to increase the city's liability by the sum of nearly 222 million dollars in connection with the conversion of hotels to house hundreds of people experiencing homelessness during the Covid-19 emergency. What accounts for this unforeseen additional expense and will the office of the comptroller have the authority to review similar increases during the period extending beyond the present contract, expiration date on October 12th? So, let's start with the role of the Hotel Association sourcing, so available hotel locations are identified by a Hotel Association of New York and that is based on our capacity needs and the need to effectively relocate shelters in a way that accommodates our clients needs to provide a need staff services, security, so identification is really driven by necessity and logistics and operational needs to make sure we're quickly and effectively ensuring we're providing the services making sure there's effective social distancing so that we can reduce the risk of infections. The DHS is punch rocks, oh okay, do you need me to read it again? Yes, could you please, on August 24th Dhs's contract with the Hotel Association of New York City was amended to increase the city's liability by the sum of nearly 222 million dollars in connection with the conversion of hotels to house hundreds of peoples experiencing homelessness during the Covid-19 emergency. What accounts for this unforeseen additional expense and will the office of the comptroller have the authority to review similar increases during the period extending beyond the present contract, expiration date on October 12th? So so, at this point we are not in a position to have individuals return to the Congress shelters right. So, yes, a contract on the hotel covered hotel contracts expires next week, so we anticipate extending our contract. So we can continue to provide the services that we are and we want to continue to save lives want to protect our clients. We want to make sure we can social distance. We will need to extend it as we work with the ohmh on when and how it will be safe for us to return to the congregate settings and phase out the use of covered hotels, the extension term right, the the precise terms are not yet finalized. I do know it's been in the papers, it'll be for six months, but we can certainly cancel it whenever we're ready to do so. You know if we're able to be able to to relocate and end the use, we're able to do that and also we're able to let you Lucerne end the contract with any specific hotel if need is no longer there. I hope that answers your question tammy anything digesting not going there keep going. Okay. What is the length of the commitment made to the hotel? I guess that's 52 william, and what is the renewal process? Will those contracts be subject to the regular fixurement process, so at this Radisson Hotel hotel the contract extension the contract extension it is being finalized? Like I talked about, it will be for another six months. I might you know you do know that we can cancel it. So if we, if we need to end the use, we will be able to do that, and so it is really same as any one of our Covid-19 hotels that we're using it's a six- month contract. But if, during that time, any time before that we're able to return to the congregate sites and the city and the Department of Health says it's safe for us to do that, the contract can be ended. So I mean you are so you're saying you're. You can extend the contract for six months. What's the renewal process, how do you go about so what determines six months as opposed to nine months as opposed to a year? I am not so sure I'll tell you that I mean it's through Apple's office, so I can't really speak to this. Is the term of the contract that our echo and Housing Association of New Host Associate, New York, has established I in terms of the of this one? I do not have a specific. Why to this to your question? Okay, let's see, will the contract be renewed until the emergency order is lifted or will another move be planned asking if we're to so you know these are questions that came in from residents in the community. So will the contract be renewed until the emergency order is lifted? I guess you answered that, or will another move be planned so right, so we need to extend it as we work with dhmh really to look at when it will be safe for us to phase out on the use of Kobe hotel. So again it's the same. You know it's the same kind of premise: if we're able to return to the congregants settings, we will do so when it's eight, when we're able to do that, we have the ability to end the contract if the use, if we do not need to use it, so I do not have to stay in this space for six months. If you know we're told we can move back, I can the agency can end the contract. Okay. The next question is pretty much you've pretty much answered it, but I have to ask it once the emergency executive order is lifted. Will this group of people and others be moved back to their original homes once the emergency orders lift and it's lifted? Will they be moved back to their original shelters? Yes, when the emergency key and requirement- or if you turn this into a permanent shelter, would they be offered permanent residence at that location at this location is for an adult family, a shelter? These are single men, so for this cohort that we have that they will not have an ability to be in this site. We will not be ready to have any persons in that site once the the men return to their shelter their home site, because we'll have to go through the process that I talked about earlier, and so we have to go through that process. We won't be able to say you're in this site. You can stay here as a shelter, we're making it if we can get through the process, an adult family shelter. So the plan is, if there's a another move, it'll be back to the home shelters into the into their home shelter. This may sound redundant, but let's see when the emergency order is lifted, what is the timeline and process for the residents and temporary shelters to be moved back to their original shelter? Sorry, we faced the moves in. I will phase the moves back, so it will be a phase- in plan once we get the authorization and that it's safe to do so is we have 60-plus hotels, we removed our transfers, really were based really on health reasons, the most critically people who we believed were the ones that would have been really affected quicker. That's what we based the exits out on and we'll have to figure out. You know kind of how do you put the phase back in but it'll be a phase in overtime? Does a temporary emergency executive order suspend the requirements for fair share in terms of process, so the fair share assessment we want to take in is done for any permanent shelter. We do not have any permanent DHS facilities down in this community district, and so yes, we'll go through a fair share. There are permanent homeless facilities in Community Board one. I would really appreciate if you would stop saying that there are none, because they do exist. We have a variety of shelters just because DHS does not operate, them does not mean they do not exist, and it is unfair and incomplete and inaccurate public information to continue to say that I'm sorry Jocelyn, I understand that it is not your service that operates it, but it is exactly like. I said before: it's like a brand new hotel company coming in and saying there are no hotels in your location because they do not want to recognize the flag of somebody else. They do exist and I would appreciate recognition of that. I actually one of the large concerns it's actually one of the large concerns for us because of the fact that the shelters are so close together and one of them is a Dv shelter. Just now I am I am I specific and being very specific. There are no DHS facilities in this community district and for us we, our intentions, is to have a permanent shelter in every community district in the city of New York. A permanent DHS shelter. However, fair share requires that you, which is city charter, that you consider all facilities every facility before that decision is made. No matter who they're run by operated by it will be a fair share for the permanent site. All right, how does how does the governor's order to reopen shelters relate at all with this move? It does not? No all right. So that's the end of the questions that were based on temporary shelter. Now, there's some questions about permanent shelter. Please define the process of citing of a permanent shelter. How does that relate to the temporary sighting? In this case? Are they related in any way? You may have answered it, but that's: okay, pat so citing a permanent of permanent shoulders is not related to temporary use of hotel rooms. Covid-19 did create an opportunity for sites to be brought to us based on current use, so in terms of citing permanent shelters right. So I talked about the mastering the type plan that we're operationalizing. We report and we know that new yorkers experiencing homelessness come from every community acrosss the five boroughs. We want to make sure that we have opportunities for shelters to be in every neighborhood, not just in the neighborhoods, where they're you know where they've been concentrated in south Bronx in East, New, York and Brownsville, and so we want to make sure that every community come together to address the crisis that we're in New York City, and so that's what our intentions are. So our plan to turn this into a permanent high quality shelter it'll be the first of its kind. I talked about in this community district it'll offer adult families are experiencing homelessness opportunities to get back on their feet. To really get you know, opportunities to be get become stable, get close to the anchors of life. During these unprecedented times, we will pro we will review a proposal. Whatever comes to us from a non- for- profit service provider. We will look at what on that proposal says we will rate it. Our intentions are to be able to open an adult, our family shelters with a provider that can provide the services, but even more in a community district where there's not a DHS operated facility as per alternative tied shelter. You know our plan that we put out in February of 2017.. Let's go, let's go, let's go to the next question because it's just a repeat: Joslyn, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I know you're on a limited time. It's a repeat of the same information without a direct answer. So I apologize. I do not mean to be rude, but we have so many questions and I want to make a maximum and we have people who would like to speak Tammy. Do you have the quote? I just lost the questions. For some reason, do you have well the list I have some of them. Can you pick up while I try to find. I do not know why this happened. It's okay, while you're doing I can take some of the ones that have come off the chat and some of the ones that have been texted email. Thank you! So much everybody. One of this is an opportunity to explain whether or not there was a question that came up last time about the appropriateness of the building and asking if the water cooler, because the we had photos that were sent to the community board, that the water tower on top of the building has been open to the elements and whether or not it is therefore a safe building and how that's been addressed. Yes, I, it was the gravity tank that was damaged, that's the tank for the emergency sprinklers. It gets activated during the fire, so the it has been repaired. There was a remote testing for the cooling system, that's not connected to the gravity tank, so that gravity tank was corrected at the site. Okay, there's a couple of questions in here that definitely revolve around project renewal and the operation of security. There's been a lot of questions that have come up in the chat and I would welcome Eric and Jody to answer them and some of them have to do with. If you can go over curfew, no curfew are, they are shelter residents allowed to remain inside the building during the day if they choose to how many people per room is it and what is the security? Look like there? They have seen articles. You have provided some information and I believe our district manager is going to put an updated link in the or he'll send it to me and I'll. Stick it in the Q&A for people. I either Jody all right. Thank you. I'm the president and CEO of project renewal and I'm also joined by four of four of my colleagues Jody Rudin, who is the executive vice president and chief operating officer, Katie Bauer and Kaydon Grinnell, who are both vice presidents of programs overseeing the shelters that these men come from and Charlie Mullam? Who is our director of security, I'll answer a couple of the questions and I'll have Jody handle the other ones as regards curfew. There's a 10 o'clock curfew. If men come back to the facility after 10 o'clock- and they do not have a pass for work purposes, because some people work after 10 o'clock, they lose their right to have the room in the hotel, but we keep them inside the hotel because we do not want people out on the streets. While we engage with DHS around the process of whether they're going to be reassigned to another shelter location or be allowed to stay and have their bed back, no resident is forced out of the hotel. In fact that has not been a policy for a for a long time, but certainly during Covid-19. We want to encourage people to stay inside the hotel. So no one is no one is forced to leave their room or the hotel. I'm fairly certain I'm right on this, but every person will have their own room at the hotel and someone will have to correct me if I'm wrong on that and I'll turn it over to Jody and probably Charlie to talk about the security arrangements. So thank you, hi everyone, Jody Rudin, here, Eric you're, correct each client will have their own room. I'm going to turn things over to Charlie Mulham, our director for security. He can give an overview of how we approach security, and there was also a question earlier about our relationships with the precincts NCOS that he can speak to as well. Charlie thanks Jody good evening, everyone. Yes, we currently are using arrow security there at the Lucerne and that entire shift will be coming over to the Radisson Hotel. The shift will consist of 26 guards in total 24 guards and two supervisors. One supervisor for the inside one for the outside, we'll have two at our access area. The supervisor and the guard on the outside will be doing a street patrol, usually a block to two further away from the the shelter. That's usually the scope of their of their coverage. The coverage is 24 7.. These guards have worked with these clients since the original days when we were about at the original, the original two shelters that we moved out of in the first place: Third Street and Kenton Hall, so they're very familiar with the clients and arrow has been with this company and has been not only at this hotel but three of our shelters. And what now are the other new hotels that have formed because of Covid-19? Did we answer all of the Charlie? Did you answer about sorry? I'm trying to answer questions in the chat as we're going along. There were you've answered about the people not having to leave during the day. You've answered that people can stay in the rooms. How many people of the 265 are they all one person in a hotel room? Are there multiple people in a hotel room, one person there it's true and there was and not 265 and everyone will have their own room and the part of the question is about the ncs right. Oh I'm, sorry, yeah, I'm sorry! I did not answer that part of the question like I do at every location, I'm prior federal law enforcement. I know these officers I meet with them once we get into these new locations. This case was no exception. I met with the two NCOS officer, Solomon and officer painter, that covered this area. Last week, we've already visited the Pine Street school, the Quad Prep school. I've met with people from 28 liberty, the directors of security there Deutsche bank officials yesterday tomorrow and all of next week, I'll be going to other schools. I understand: there's another school on Cedar Street I'll, be visiting with the officials there exchanging contact information, so this is usually the process. I'm I attend. Build- a- block meetings which are precinct, run NCO meetings that they that they hold to deal with any quality of life issues, usually in the precinct, but obviously I would be there for anything if they have one during our duration at this hotel. I would be there answering any questions regarding the hotel and project Renault. So yeah I've been in touch with the NCOS and you know we talk regularly by the way. Charlie Pat I'll, follow up after you, okay, by the way, there are two high schools on not it's, one is on trinity and cedar, and one is on thames and trinity, so they're, both on trinity, so you'll see when you go over there. Thank you, so Charles there's been obviously because this building is highly situated next to also elementary and pre- k locations. There's been a lot of concern. I understand, and I will say this is something that I will not ask, because it is unfair. These are people, and these are people trying to get back on their feet. I do not need to know, nor does the public have the right to know about their personal health right or anything else. The we have already been confirmed about the concern about sex offenders, because that was a topic that was on the upper West side. It has been confirmed, I'm saying it out here, so I stopped from the sixth time somebody asked. No, they are not. Dhs has confirmed and Charlie can confirm beyond that. They are not part of the Lucerne population. Moving to our neighborhood, have you seen a reduction in security incidents at the Lucerne over the course of time, and are you confident that sort of the sort of good place that they are at the moment is able to be replicated at the Radisson Hotel? Yes, when we, when we originally got to the the Lucerne, we had approximately 287 clients, which has now been whittled down to 235 or 37. I continue here. Mid-230S the people that have left have left over a variety of reasons and showed themselves not to be appropriate for hotel living, and these people that are coming here now are people who have never had any issues, never had any issues with the pd. While we were up, there have shown themselves to be exemplary as far as their behavior have not had any run- ins with the law, and I actually speak to the lieutenant and the NCOS of the 20th precinct, which is the precinct where we were with the Lucerne. As recently as today and he's even told me, I have not had any issues with the clients in the last you know weeks. You know I have not talked to him for about a week and a half two weeks and he goes yeah. Everything is settled down. There has not been any activity at all to discuss with you, so you know we did not raise any indices when it came to any type of crime and any of these none of these clients that are coming today coming this this time around to the Radisson Hotel, were involved in any type of violent behavior. Thank you. Do you know if there's a decision on a plan for smoking that has come up many times, especially because this is next to a pre- k center, and there was a lot of concerns about. Where are the men going to go to be able to smoke and recreate it's not just smoking yeah correct, I'm jumping in there's ample space in the hotel for recreation services. We stopped the agency saying clients had to leave the building since 2016. So that's not on this. There's nothing happening there in terms of finding a different smoking area, we're still at the same place, there's not a defined. This is where the space they're going to go to for smoking. We will continue to monitor the security. Folks will be out there moving people along, but no, I do not have an answer in terms of a different area for these clients to go to and the public spaces. I said last week that they do have writing public spaces, but we are looking at opportunity to find other places. I do not have an answer for that tonight. You know that's an important quality of life issue for the people who are surrounding that building with preschools and elementary schools and residents. That is a plan that needs to be made for the people in the shelter, so they have a comfortable place to go and for the people in the community. This is not just about the community, but it's not fair to the people from the shelter either, and it would be appreciated if you can figure that out much like they have a place on the upper West side. Just saying I'm going to go on your mic is on, but please wait we're looking through the rest of the questions. Pat yeah. Do you want me to go on yep, okay, there's a Covid-19 CDC questions too that had come up. Do you want to take it or you want me to go with what I've got here? I'm going to ask that one, because it is an explanation and how the DHS, based on the deference to the CDC guidelines, if this is not an emergency move because they are safe and the Lucerne. How does DHS justify the move in deference to the CDC guidelines? That's one reality is that the men are not in a congregate. Setting will not be incarnate in a congregate setting project New York, just informed they'll have their own rooms, so the identification continues right. They we moved multiple shelters to the space of town on the West side, and now we're looking to redistribute and being able to use this site, giving us the opportunity for long- term site is where we have landed. So this is not about de- densifying, then the people in the shelter. That's what you just said. It certainly is they. The their original shelters are congregate, so we densified. But yes, I understand the original, but this is the fourth move for these people: the identification project to make sure that folks are safe. Okay, let me look at my clock all right, I'm going to go then. So. Last week there was some discussion about this medical Van that was going to be located on the street. So and you know, we said that the street was not large enough to accommodate it. Has there been other plans made to relocate medical services? I yes, so currently at the Lucerne. We provide primary care through our mobile medical Van on a bi- weekly basis and we're able to do that because of the particularly large corridor that is 79th Street. But we heard loud and clear from you all that Williams street would not be appropriate and we completely concur with that assessment based on our visits to the location, so we're working on an alternative plan to provide primary care health services to our clients at the Lucerne. If sorry at the Radisson Hotel, it may very well be that we bring a provider on site, but we can commit that there that we're not going to bring a mobile medical Van to Williams Street great and last week. We also asked to get a 24:7 contact phone number that might be Charlie. So if peop, if residents see something happening, they can call in real time charlie you're there. I will say I just Charlie I'll hand this to you. In a minute. We have amended and added content to our one-, pager fact sheet we're also in the process of putting this up on our website. We now have an email address that we want to encourage people to reach out to if you have any questions and it that's the Radisson Hotel at project, renewal, DOT, org and again that's on the one pager that we're circulating at this point with Charlie is, and he can talk about this handing out his cell phone to all of the relationships that he establishes in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. We are a little bit reluctant to put a phone number out there because, based on our previous experience at the Lucerne, it got so inundated with phone calls that we were unable to manage it. So I think we'd prefer to start with email and start with a direct cell phone of Charlie's to the immediate neighbors and then continually assess whether we should refine our approach Charlie. I do not know if you have anything to add to that, and how will you get the phone number to the immediate neighbors Harley walks it around to them? Yeah I've, like I said, I've got already gone out and I'm going to go out to all of the residential buildings, giving my card to the you know the doormen. Whatever I mean, I just want to make the distinction, because this was something that needed to be done at the at the Lucerne as well. First of all, you know if people see something that might be, you know a guy's hanging out on a corner too long or a little too loud. You know you know calling Charlie or making that an immediate. You know crime that you need to be a thing that needs to be addressed is different: a quality of life. If you see something a crime, that's ongoing and active, you would call 9- 1- 1. You would do that before Charlie and project renewal arrives at the site and you'll do that after long gone, so a 9- 1- 1 call for anything that you see is a crime is necessary. Other types of things you can call a local precinct or 3- 1- 1 for quality of life stuff. What I'm interested in knowing is, if there is something that you see, that's chronic with our with people who you believe are our clients. This is intelligence that I would like to know, and I would address immediately and people at the Lucerne and people in the upper West side could attest to that I'll. Be there every day I have like, I said, a very large contingent of guards both inside and out, I'm all about sharing intelligence and the officers that have met me already know that I've met. Like I said, officials from the schools. I know pickup time. I know you know. Dismissal time of the schools that I've already been to and I'll have guards out there. I appreciate all of this and you know the only thing that will prove it is. As these days unfold you'll see, you'll see the presence of our people out there, but we are not just the we're, not the sole police force of Fidei or the sole police force of 52 Williams Street the police are, and they will be there to complement us if necessary, but I just want to make that distinction between what is stuff that falls under my purview and what would maybe generate a 9- 1- 1 call, because as soon as a name or a number goes out, all of a sudden, the calls come to me like. Can you fix it? Can you fix it? Can you fix it? Some things are appropriate for that others are not I'd. Also like to all right. I wanna I Wanna Wreck, I Wanna recognize Lucian, who has something to add who's our district manager for Community Board. One solution, thanks tammy. One thing that I found from working with the public and pat through the quality of life committee is that many people still feel like 9- 1- 1 should be treated like the old days where you know there were reports that all the circuits were busy and people could not get real emergencies in because it was tied up. If that's really not the case anymore, really, you should call if you see anything that looks like danger or a crime and let the 9- 1- 1 operators figure out what sorts of services to send, maybe not at all. So it's really one of those things where we'd rather people call 9- 1- 1, regardless of what they're, seeing as long as it's a crime or something dangerous. Please feel free to do that. Do not hold back. Do not self- select, let the operator the professional make that decision, and I wanted to add that if it's a quality of life issue and not a crime to please let Cb1's office know you can call 3- 1- 1, you can lodge a complaint, get the complaint number and call the office and give them the complaint number and we will reach out to Charlie and his staff. Pat and Tammy. Can I jump in for 10 seconds on one last security issue, I've seen in the chat a few times. I think this chat and the previous one the question posed of if everything's, okay, why do you need 25 security guards? And I just want to make clear that this is really our attempt to be proactive rather than reactive. As Charlie mentioned, we had. We ended up transferring about 50 clients out of the Lucerne, because we did not think they were a good fit either clinically or behaviorally, and it was often our security force in the community acting as eyes and ears helping to facilitate those decisions. Another area where security has come in extraordinarily handy in the pandemic is helping to issue reminders to clients around enforcing mass use. So I just I wanted to share that information. Thank you, Johnny. I have one more question here on our list. So are there volunteer opportunities? If the community wants to engage? Absolutely oh, go ahead. I was just going to say absolutely one thing that happened at the Lucerne that was really lovely was that people from the community would bring games. They would bring individually packaged snacks single ride. Metro cards are very useful, so there are small items like that which we can accommodate, which are which are really quite helpful, and and we will make sure that there are opportunities for people to volunteer in ways that allows them to actually get to know the clients themselves, because that really goes a long way to reducing some of the fear and concerns that people have about people. I can. I also I just want to give an enormous shout out to the open hearts initiative who formulated themselves on the upper West side to cultivate relationships with our clients to engage in activities with them. Everything from voter registration drives to helping to run recreational programming, spiritual walks, it's we now and I know I speak for many of our clients and saying have deep admiration for this group will miss them it's. It makes it heartbreaking. One of the reasons why it's heartbreaking to leave the upper West side, but I understand that the leadership of the open hearts initiative is working with a local group in fidei friends of Fidei, and I think they're both represented on this call. So we're hoping some of the fantastic work of the open hearts initiative will be picked up by the friends of Fidei Group and I see shams raising his hand. I know he's going to speak about the impact of open hearts on his life and his experience as well. Great thanks for the answer. Tammy, I'm done with my list of questions, so I mean there's a couple things there's a couple things that I definitely want to we're going to move to panelists, but I have questions and a closing that I'm going to ask because we're talking about temporary, we're talking about permanent and we're talking about process right and, unfortunately, not a lot of it and the arbitrary way that this is one come to Community Board, one in terms of sourcing a location. Everything else is very disconcerting for everyone in the community. The lack of recognition of fair share, no comment on it and no fair share analysis is really sort of stunning to me, but what we need to do is go through some of the statements of the people who have not spoken yet because this is about people. This is not just about the buildings, and so with that I want to recognize Sham who can unmute himself or we will un mute him. He is a resident of the Lucerne sam you're on hello greetings, everybody, it's good to be here, it's great to have a seat at the table. That's what I always ask for. I definitely appreciate you and I appreciate CB1 for holding these forums because, first and foremost, you know what I'm hearing from you is that you really care about what goes on in your community, and you have spoken so much about the impact that such a move is going to have on the residents, which I think is great. Of course, project renewal has been great for me. I always say that they saved my life, so I'm just a testament of their ability to do good for a vulnerable population. Those of us that deal with substance use disorder and mental illness. So let me say this: many of us at the Lucerne do not wish to move. We do not want to move because we've been moved around quite a bit and just up and moving like that, especially with such short notice, is traumatizing, to say the least. The other thing is that the impact that open hearts and the supporters in this in this area of the upper West side has had on us is something that we've never experienced. Many of us have myself have struggled with homelessness, since I was a child. So now you know this is the first time that I've seen a community come to the aid in the way that they have with no funding they're, not a non- profit or anything like that and just say look, you know we care about you and we want to show you some love and some support, and the magnitude of that has gone a long way to eliminate the trauma. We started to feel due to the fact that we believe we were wrongfully depicted in much of the media and stuff like that. You know so I say DHS city. They made a huge mistake in moving us to a new community on such short notice without without working with the community and that had a negative effect on those of us who are residents and under their care. Okay in the middle of Covid-19, things happen mistakes happen. However, due to all of this, we ended up in the great position to be able to look at those mistakes and correct them. We also were able to do some things that have I've never seen done in the shelter system, so here at the Lucerne project, renewal has opened its doors to the community and allow groups like open hearts and programming, even from within with their own recovery center to do services that did not even exist in the shelter and most of us, I do not think, is requiring any outlay of funding or anything like that. It's just people that care that are saying, let's you know, do a spiritual, walk and talk. We have a number. The whole clergy from this area is working with us and, in fact, is making connections in your local area with trinity church to set up other additional things that might benefit us in that community. Open hearts is connected with friends of fitty and also working in that regard. So I think that this does allow for us to have a unique opportunity to create a model of how to properly integrate a community in a homeless population into a community and do some good things that benefit not just the community, but also the homeless population, all stakeholders. The only issue that I really have is, I really believe that to move so quickly. Those is where I, that is where I have my issues moving so quickly. I do not think is the best move. I think that, ultimately, if things like the I.T infrastructure, that needs to be in place is done after the fact is going to have a negative effect on the community, maybe not to the extent that it had in the Lucerne, because we aware of some of the states some of those that need a higher level of care or need to be in other type of facilities. They have been transferred, so they're no longer here, but I think that it's important to give project renewal the time to have their I.T infrastructure in place. Ironically, within the past two or three weeks, project renewal has been moving. People out of the shelter system into permanent housing, and that has been I've. I have not seen that at all. In my time of being in a shelter I every day I walk out in the hotel, somebody else is going to see an apartment someone's on an interview, so people are actually being moved into permanent housing, and my understanding is that, if that has happens in fitting what happens? Is the population won't rise in the shelter? So you know we expect that if they're able to continue that we'll be doing the right thing in terms of getting us from the from the hotel to housing, but I do not think that moving so soon without that infrastructure in place is going to be a good thing. The other thing that I would want you to and I'm going to end it here. The other thing I want you to consider all of you is just really please think about the trauma that we are experiencing right now. The reality- and I can't get away from this- is that moving like this is traumatic for us. The same way the community has fear. We have fear there are many of us, and I have to speak for my fellow residents who are saying they would rather be in the street than go to another hotel. They would rather go to the congregate, shelter and risk coving, because it's the fear of having to have a negative, be in a community where they get a negative backlash. That has been something that we've never really experienced. I know I have not in any type of situation moving throughout the shelter system, so as we make the policies- and we do certain things in store, including adding programs, keep that in mind. We do not. We want to go into a place where we're treated like humans. We wanted to go. We want to go into a place where there's programming and services that respects our humanity. We want to engage with the extra security in such a way that we know that they're there to secure us as well as the community, we're not we. You know we're not homeless, because we committed crimes, you know, so we want to be able to be respected in that regard and, as we start to reimagine how to do things in you know this current climate, let's keep in mind or let's try to work, to make a more humane place for for residents like myself, so that we can be more productive in any society that we go with treatment for substance. Use is very important. Treatment for mental illness is very important. Onsite, that's very important. A healthy and holistic environment is very important. We have this opportunity if we're going to go. I do ask for more time to make sure all these different things are in place so that we can lessen the trauma, but I also ask that the community that the this all of the stakeholders are able to work together to make this thing work the way that it would benefit all of us, especially those of us who are the most vulnerable and have often been voiceless. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you Shams. I just wanted to say you know just to add on. I want the whole community to be listening to exactly what he said. I think that you are spot on. Thank you so much. I wanted to add a thank you also sham. That was that was really great and informative. Thank you and for those who were here beforehand, a short statement was read by open hearts at the last meeting. I did not ask them to come back, because I thought it was more important to hear it from shams than anyone else and to understand, no matter how arbitrary we believe the decision- making has been or and how much the community has not been included. Apprised informed notified all of it it's worse for the men in the fact that they were not notified, informed included, given a vote given a voice and I'm not going to stick up for Jocelyn, no offense intended or project renewal or anybody else. Everyone on the chat who says the mayor, the mayor, the mayor, you know what there's a link call the mayor, because these men need people to speak up for them as well. So on that note I mean I would like to drop one. Yes, just a few and was really enlightening and uplifting to hear from you. I think one of the things that you being here tonight humanizes those experiencing homelessness, you're, not criminals, you're, not here, to really you and you've been moved multiple times. You want to make sure you're stabilized. We are looking to be able to get you to permanent housing, but just seeing you and hearing your voice, I'm understanding the difficulty how you're perceived and the fair people have of you you're a human. You showed us yourself, you have a voice. What you talked about really does resonate with me. We are making sure that the I.T infrastructure and the needs that need to be in place before you are moved are in place. I did hear you in terms of you know not having a voice for this to happen, but thinking about what your needs are and really putting out how your what your fears are when you go into a community really does resonate, and I thank you for doing that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you appreciate you, sorry folks, I got family behind me talking to me. Okay, next we're going to open up the Mic for Chris Marte. I know that Chris had to step out. I do not know if he's back yet Chris are you back if Chris is not back we'll? You know kind of like coming back around the bend, John Frata, who is the president of the board of directors of South Bridge towers? John, you can unmute yourself, Don Prada. I know you're here you were on earlier all right, we'll come back for you as well, and I apologize I'm sure, I'm not going to get this right, the first time around Roshana Shaw from pace. Yes, thank you tammy. Yes, my name is Rajna Shah, I'm the director of government and community relations at Pace University. You heard last week from my colleague, Vanessa Hermann, who is the avp of government community relations. Unfortunately, she was triple booked tonight, but we would like to actually direct your attention to a letter that President Chris Law of Pace University sent to the mayor. My colleague is going to be Lindsey. Owen is going to be putting that link into the chat. What I would also like to do is reiterate vanessa's comments from last week. Unfortunately, we have seen a persistent uptake in complaints by our students about harassment that they are facing from the population of individuals down. There, we've actually received additional complaints in the last week since the last meeting those are coming from residents of in one of our residences of 182 broadway. Again, we are working with the downtown alliance, we're working with BRC we're working with NYPD on these issues. We do hope to establish a dialogue with project renewal to work with you. If you know, should our issues come up, but I thank you for your time. Thank you for coming and we definitely appreciate the work that pace does with the amazing students in the community and the educators who are here. So thank you next would be Chris. Brown Chris has spoken before so Chris goes next and then we will circle back to see if Chris, Marty or John Frater are back. Okay, Chris. Thank you. Everyone thank you again for allowing us to have a platform to voice our concerns. I'm Chris with downtown new Yorkers and I just had a couple questions. First off I I'm still confused because my question last week was concerning you know which was brought up in this meeting tonight. Where will people be able to go to congregate to smoke when they go outside and I'm a little dismayed to hear that there's still no update on that or answer? That's one of our residents major concerns the streets are so narrow and small, which leads me to the fact of. Why was 52 William chosen? You know I just we do not feel like it's a great it's a good location. So with that said, I do not know if anyone you know still has an answer for us on that jocelyn. But two other questions I just wanted to bring up is: does the city have a signed contract for services with the Radisson Hotel, with project renewal and if they're in also is there any other signed contract obligating the city to pay for rooms at the Radisson Hotel, such as from the Hotel Association, and if so, with either one? Could those contracts be made public to the Community board and our elected officials? Thank you. I think part of the question that I wanted to start with is a contract with the hotel is through the Hotel Association of New York and the city, the that's where the contract is at this point, there's no other contract for for the Radisson Hotel separate, and apart from the Hotel Association to have the project renewal residents move there. The borough president does have a copy of the hotel contact and can share that for you to get direct information from them and in terms of why this was chosen, I think, on the same answer: I've given you Thursday of last week and earlier tonight, in terms of we have been using this space and it gives us the ability to have hopefully an adult family, a shelter as part of alternative tide plan. So that is our plan I did say earlier on. If there are other spaces in the neighborhood that you think it's better, you can certainly bring us those buildings. We will evaluate the appropriateness of them and take that into consideration. Well, I just think it was really powerful for our neighbors to hear what shams said I mean I'm so grateful he was on the call tonight. Thank you so much shams, you know something else to say Tammy I just wanted to. I just think it was really powerful for all of our neighbors to hear that, because to hear you know what a successful program you know they have up there at the Lucerne and what and it sounds like the site is doing very well now, and I do not know why Jocelyn 52 William, you think, is a better site than where they are at the Lucerne it just it. Just does not seem like on paper at all that it is, and there's still no answer to our community on why that site is better than where they're located at the Lucerne. I'm going to agree with you that I'm I was so for me to hear Sham directly talk about how he's perceived and the criminalization and the fears that the men have so humanize who we're talking about to really humanize what we're talking about these are humans, and so I will. I will end there: it really is services will continue. The provider has not changed. The services will continue. They're high quality provided they'll continue to provide services, I'm online Chris, so I just want to say Chris Shams yeah go shams. Thank you. Yes, I wanted to answer your question about. Where would we go recreation and stuff, which is a great question, especially the way you speak of the terrain now with me, I'm also known as the homeless hero. So one of the things I do is I advocate for myself. I advocate for my fellow residents and in doing so I sat, I spent considerable amount of time talking to Charlie who's that had a security for project renewal. I recently had a sit- down meeting with a well a phone meeting with Jody. One of my biggest concerns, of course, was: if we go there, will the services discontinue? I also talked to Corinne from open hearts. So what we've been doing behind the scenes is we've been forging relationships with people within the community that have shown interest in helping us navigate or transition to the community in a good way. What we were also doing is identifying places like and making connections with, like trinity church for indoor things you know it's going to get colder, so you know there may be some indoor locations that we could take advantage of in terms of programs, maybe movie night and stuff like that. I have not seen the hotel, so I do not know the layout of the hotel and if the hotel has rooms for that like here, we utilize the penthouse, which has a lot of space for us to do a lot of the programming. So those things are important, but I do know in the area there are outdoor places like, I believe, battery Park, I'm not sure of all of the parks that are there. What we try to do. What I've tried to do here is one of the things we did was the spiritual walking talk. It's called soulful walking talks and one of the reasons why we do is we try to create opportunities for engagement. That may not be heavy- handed a therapeutic program, but it allows us to come together in a positive way with people with other people that can give us some type of inspiration or just be with us. You know here on the project. We knew property renewals, our recovery center, we've done outings like picnics in central park and stuff. So these are like safe ways. We can come together and we can see the community be in the community without you know doing anything that is in violation of the good Neighbor policy. So I think, because we're having these conversations apparent or in advance, we can actually identify these places, identify these support institutions like say trinity, church and then help with Kidan to develop programming that could facilitate that and keep those of us at the Lucerne engage because you know sometimes boredom can get to you want to go outside, but you know it will look kind of weird if you got a hundred people standing on one block, that's just not going to look right, but I know that I engage a lot. I walk around a lot and whenever I see something I'm easy, I'm you know I have a good rapport with most of the residents. It's easy for me to say: hey come on, let's take a walk: let's go to the park and stuff like that. So we're I'm interested in coming down beforehand and meeting somebody that can show me some of the things in the community, and maybe I can work with project renewal staff to try and identify how we could utilize certain spaces to make it a better situation for us as well as the community. We really appreciate your partnership for us and the community, because that kind of outreach and forward thinking is highly appreciated. Thank you. I want to move to Chris Marte and see. If he's back, because I see there, he is Chris your turn. Hey Tammy. I said that they were going to set up a cab for the long term. The potential long- term, shelter, typically cabs, have been used to sidestep community boards. Community input make the trans make the process much less transparent. So my question is: when are they planning to set up this cab who which voices of the community will be able to have a seat at that table? And what is the process of creating that cab once it becomes potentially once it becomes a long- term, shelter? Chris, that's a good question. We typically once we get a provider, the provider has not been identified. If project renewals puts a proposal in could be they, you know, we do not know who the provider is will be at that site once it goes to an adult family shelter we go through the process of you know getting the shelter up and opened, and at that point the shelter provider, whoever that person is whoever that provider is, will then work with our Iga, which the governmental affairs are part of our shop at Department of Social services, as well as the community board leaders to establish the committee Advisory Board we do and Leilani's on the chat and she'll work with you all to help to develop that once we get onto that part of the process it is, it is one of the things that we've done in the 40 shelters we've opened is to establish that and they've gone pretty well. Okay, thank you for the current cabs that you have for your long- term shelter. How regularly do they update the community board? Do they post or record their meetings online? What can you give us a little bit of confidence on the transparency of the ongoing meetings that you have now for some of these shelters they they're run by the provider and our governmental affairs. I will send. I'm have my folks send that to you tammy, so you can give that out. I can't say because there's 40, I do not know how often they they're quarterly. I do not know if they record it. I do not. You know I can't answer that Chris but Melania, and that that staff will give you a general idea we'll send that to you Patricia and Tammy, but we do part of our a process is to establish that, and I believe that quarterly I do not know if they record it. I do not know what the media medium is at this point, especially throughout what we're going through right now, so there'll be more to come in that. Thank you again. I'm beating a dead horse here. I understand that, but any sighting of a shelter is even citing an awarding is arbitrary in terms of a process. If you do not look at everything, as required in fair share, fair share analysis requires you looking at everything in the district every service, that's offered every shelter. That's here everything I do not hear any of that, and that is something that I just have to put it back in here. The exercise on the road I'm going to just jump in really quickly, so we've articulated that for the permanent shelter, a fair share will be conducted in accordance with the obligations under the city. Charter Jocelyn's mentioned that a couple of times this evening, and so the continuation to suggest that that's not going to happen is unfortunate, because it's something that will happen. We are awaiting a proposal from a provider and that proposal includes details that are necessary for the completion of a fair share and the analysis that's required under the city charter, so that will be conducted when a proposal has been received in terms of the cab. I just wanted to jump in, because the cabs are overseen by my team. We have cabs that are established for all of the turning the tide, shelters as well as shelters. Some of the shelters that have long been standing, the community advisory boards are established in partnership with the Community board and our local elected officials and community stakeholders, in terms of who is appointed to those cab groups. When the first group meets, we coordinate the scheduling with the members of the cab when the shelter first opens, they tend to be monthly, and then we establish what an appropriate cadence of the meetings are. There are some times in which there are not issues that need to be addressed by the cabs, and it's made an agreement that a meeting won't happen in a particular month once that regular cadence is established, those meetings are held, there's an agenda and the members of the cab participate in those meetings. If somebody were to no longer be involved in the cab, we work to find a replacement. This is really about community engagement, about the site, specific activities that are occurring in partnership with the provider who, as Jocelyn mentioned, hosts tab meetings, so that will take place in the meantime, as we've done with many of the temporary sites being utilized for our Covid-19 use. We are committed to having regular and ongoing meetings with project renewal about the temporary use of this location. So Aaron who has just jumped in was not on the call publicly. You know speaking last week and Aaron if you do not mind introducing yourself, even though you just muted yourself, my apologies, Aaron drinkwater, Deputy, Commissioner, Department of Social services for intergovernmental and legislative affairs, so people are looking for the chain because I do see comments in the chain of who is Aaron, and how does she fit into this? I believe Jocelyn works for Aaron, so if that gives an information hold on sorry Tammy. No, I am the other way around John Aaron works for Jocelyn Social services. It's a very interesting setup, but DSS department of social services comprised of the Department of Homeless services and Hra Human Resource administration for hra and administrator for DHS, and then Aaron is in the part of the middle DSS that supports both of those agencies. So we all work. We all work for the commissioner of banks, yeah well about that, and you all work for the mayor. There's been lots of conferences. We have asked many times for the mayor's office to join us this evening to join us any evening to explain directly what's been happening. We've had no participation from the mayor's office, no answers from the mayor's office, so I hope that answers the question of that is in the chat of where is the mayor on all this? I think you just see what you see for the last person who asked about our elected officials. Every one of our elected officials has been on this call last week and this week and we are very grateful for their support of the people at the mission itself at the shelter itself and we're so grateful for their support. Here, I'm going to go back and see if John Frata, the President and director the board of directors for South Bridge Tower. We have 15 minutes yep and if he is not we're going directly to our community board members who have hands up and anyone else who is a panelist with hands up okay, so let's see where we go, we're going to start with Mariama James Mariama. Can you unmute yep hi? Thank you Tammy. Thank you again to the electeds that appeared, and my comment is right on time with yours, because I'm going to say that it's really a shame that again the mayor's office is not here. He has not even had the decency or respect to send a deputy or the mayor's Office of Constituent Services Department of Social, Services and department of homeless services is not who made this decision. City hall made. This decision and city hall should come here to represent the institu stand by whatever their decision. They have a responsibility to respond to their constituents, and this is really disgusting. That said, the reason I'd really like to see him and to have an opportunity to have his ear on. This is because the appearance is that he has complete deference for health concerns. With regard to this unnecessary move during a pandemic, it should not be happening if it's not an emergency should not be happening. Not I mean we can go into the fact of whether it's the right location- and I do not- I do not. I personally do not believe it is either, but before we get there, I think we need to address the issue that people are moved into off the streets and into shelters as they're able during a pandemic, that's been the guideline and then they should stay put and people who are in whom similarly should stay. Put that's why there's been a moratorium on evictions? It's not just because the government necessarily want wants to do that. For us and to put you know, landlords potentially in a pinch, it's because people should not be moving around and losing their housing at this point. So if the Lucerne gentlemen are happy and healthy, where they are and there's been accommodations made for them to remain that way, they've been given outdoor space, they've been given spaces within the building to congregate and to do and to be active and to exercise, and the community has at this point, welcome them and become comfortable and settled in with them as well, and they have a potential to have jobs, be learned from the borough president last week and from Kareem, who represented the upper West side, open hearts. They have an opportunity to work and to do other things there, and if project renewal is not going to be impacted, they're going to be safe and fine in either case whether the is moved down here or remains of town. Why on earth during a pandemic, are you putting people's mental and emotional and physical health at risk? It is outrageous, and that's all I want to say thank you Tommy for the opportunity to speak thanks, Miana Mariana, one of the things that we have talked about throughout this I want to have is establishing that the men will be receiving the same services in the space that they will have the opportunity to get training. They'll have the opportunity to continue with the same provider, and so it is. It is hopeful that the way the community was able to find folks to be welcoming that we can repeat this in the Phi Die area, but we learned last week that a space had been built for them specifically to be able to have outdoor space and things and that and the jobs that were being provided to them. They could not take downtown. They would lose if they moved downtown, so it really does not make any sense, but the health of these men and of people in our area during the pandemic, people in our area, many of which have more than one cancer upper and lower respiratory diseases. We are vulnerable here, just as they are vulnerable there. You put these two vulnerable communities together in the midst of a pandemic, when the city, the state of New York, has different districts every day, popping up with the Covid-19 back on the rise. Why are you doing this? Do we have to call upon our federal electives to become involved too just to try to stop this mariama? I think if you any advocacy that can be done for shams and the group of men should be done for everyone, because they are still residents of our city and yes call- I mean there's they are residents, and I do not accept the idea that those 50 jobs so sorry will give them to someone else. That's actually not the way we work in the United States. I think. If you get hired for a job and you move, you lose the job and yes they have to, but having jobs secured for this group of men and saying that it's okay, we'll move it to the next group of men, does not value the group of men for who they are. These jobs were for them. I said I did not say anything about jobs. Move on. I said the money that was raised for the services of town. We have. We have clients up there. If there are jobs up there. Certainly project renewal will continue to work to help them to continue maintaining the employment. So you know, let's differentiate, that Gail Brewer has already said that those jobs would be lost, hold on Tammy the money that was raised in the upper West side. At last week we learned and when we you know, can not come down, because it's got a Riverside in the upper West side. That will continue the upper West side, but all of the folks are experiencing homelessness. Who are up there if there's employment, that opportunities that the men can continue to have we certainly want them to continue to have that and the provider here will continue to make them connections for them to find employment and get training. The providers not is not changing. The provider will continue to provide the services. Every man that is in the shelter every resident has an in the individual living plan that look at what their service needs are and if they're ready for employment, they will help them to make those connections to find employment. So it's not that Joplin. Let's go, let's go to we've. I know you are on a timeline. We have eight minutes and five more hands. Andrew mine may be very quick, tammy and apologies. If it's already been asked and answered- and if it has just say so and I'll find out later, but in terms of the security staffing will that all be in place by the time the 235 residents are relocated to the Radisson Hotel, yes Jody or eric yes, okay, perfect, thank you and I do not see him back. So actually you know what we'll go to Rosa before you. I apologize we're going to do Patrick from the Heidel Neighbors Association Thanks Tammy, and I echo a lot of the frustration and outrage that Mary Alma has expressed. You know during last week's call I feel, like I learned a lot more about what's really going on here when the project renewal folks stayed on with us and answered some questions afterwards. For example, I found out that project renewal was not even made aware of this decision until 5 pm on Friday the 25th. Shortly before the news was announced to the public, which tells me that this decision was both made and announced before you ever even bothered to let your your contractual service provider, your partner, know- and that tells me that this can only be one thing- it was a political calculation and a political decision by the mayor and nothing more. This is not about decla d densification. This is not about redistribution. This is about simply nothing more than a political calculation made by this mayor, and so I think it's unfair that the mayor himself or that someone from the office of the mayor is not here to defend that political decision to explain that political decision and it's outrageous jocelyn for you a question to follow. Up from last week, you referred to a review that was done by the mayor, which we now know is nothing more than a political calculation, but in fairness, you did refer to a review that was done by the mayor. I know vanessa from pace asked for a copy of it. I, on behalf of Neighborhood association and others, asked for a copy of it. I do not believe it's been produced to the Community board. Certainly I have not seen a copy of it in the meantime. Is that available Patrick? What I said last week and I'll repeat here is that the mayor asked the review to be done by the law department, and so the law department on at the request of the mayor did the review along with my boss, and so that is where that's, where the review was done, a copy of it. I do not have it I'll refer you to you, do not have it. You do not have it. It's not been produced. We requested it last week, but it's not being produced right. I'm referring you and Tammy and Patricia to the law department. All right well, because I anticipated that we put it before hopefully that'll be responded to. I think that's completely unfair to try to do that. One more quick question: if I may you know, I also learned that from the project renewal, folks who were thankfully forthcoming with us, it takes them about four weeks or so they said to get themselves up and running, and so, if they did not find out until October the 25th, the earliest they could possibly be ready, would be the end of October or early November. And so I want to come back to a question that was asked earlier and it's why the rush? You know we heard from shams himself, who said the same thing Chan's and his fellow residents. They do not want to be redistributed, they want to stay where they are. So if this political calculation has been made again, why the rush Tammy asked it earlier, and you did not directly answer the question why the rush Joplin you're on mute do not take that personally, patrick one of the things that we one of the things that we in listening to project renewal is, we did push the date back so the week of the 19th. We are working on to get the building ready project renewal is in with us doing that Shem talked about Eit infrastructure and the needs they are learning from what happens? We're working to get those needs met, we're working to get the it infrastructure in place, we're working to have the building ready, and so we did push the date back. You know, I am sure that you know the September 25th a date on the project renewal. You know that's when they found out, but since that date to now we have made multiple strides in getting that building ready the building. Whatever the needs are. We are working to make to meet those needs, and so we are not going to be moving into the hurry. That's the question: what's been done, what's the hurry, why the hurry? I disagree that there's a harvey patrick respectfully, we have been working. We pushed the date back. The opportunity to have the building ready is what we're doing we intended to have the building ready before the men are transferred the week of the 19th. Sorry, that's what he's referring to is. Why did you use the emergency move measures which made it so that there was no? You know there was no actual listening to the community, Et cetera, because I mean what Shams is saying is. Actually you know what we all need to hear now and actually I'm in love with shams now, and I'm like I'm like. Actually thinking like how awesome it would be, but like I do think that I want to just say that you know one of the things that we need to consider is what he's saying and what Patrick is asking is just. Why we're you know why the emergency measures? Why was it so that we circumvented all of the community input like what shams was saying was very true there if you're rushed into a community there's none of the community building that needs to happen before folks can actually provide the services that are needed. So I just wanted to actually put that you know just because I did not want this to be continuous of hold on when you're answering that project renewal found out the 25th. They told us on the call, and the conversation was their first visit to the location was last week when they were on the call on the first. They had just viewed the location. There were people still living there last week as part of quarantine in the beginning. So what you're saying to move them the 19th actually gives they had said it takes three to four weeks to do a move that gives them two to two and a half. So this is part of why the rush in the immediate you're saying it was pushed back, but even to push it back two weeks, because the mayor had announced October 5th, pushing it back, two weeks does still seems a complete rush. So it's about why now? Why October? Why now? Why not a longer term plan to give people the full opportunity, so project renewal is fully staffed. They've figured out all the questions. They have not set a way to establish an open heart, why two weeks plus you're, going to move them again to make an adult shelter. This makes no sense. I sorry that's one of my board members, I'm obviously having a meltdown from not understanding why this makes no sense. Sorry, Jocelyn you're, I was just going to comment and project renewal is on the call. Eric and Jody we've been in regular communication with them. We continue to have the open lines of dialogue. We have gotten from project renewal. What their needs are. We are working to meet those needs. Project renewal has been lockstep, we'll continue to do that. So it's not it's not a we're, not we're doing this without project renewals input. This is you know it's a situation that things happen very quickly and we're working with the provider to make sure that their needs are met and make sure that whatever infrastructure needs to be there. Whatever hiring needs to happen, that happens, it is not. Why is the need happening so quickly? What precipitated the need? I am going to actually say that I disagree with the ideas of rush. We have been talking since the 25th we've been looking at what the need is. We anticipated that we had to change the fifth that was announced. We moved it not to the 12th but the week of the 19th we have that entire week, so it is not a from my perspective and you know I think we can agree to disagree in terms of this is a rush or not. I respectfully disagree with that, and so it is, you know, working with project mural working with community stakeholders, primitive homeless services and certainly the men who I hope would be welcomed into your community. I hope they would not like Sham described, really feel fearful for themselves, and so I am, I am going to really put that out to all of you on this call to really recognize that the folks who are coming are humans and that they are not criminalized. As I said last week, these are folks we know, and I I'm sorry, we have three more questions. That's okay! We have three more hands up from, so we're going to recognize three others. I understand we're trying to go as quickly as we can. This is a hot topic. I know you have another place to go, but I think this is the fastest. I can do it if you can be more succinct in your answer. That would be great rosa. Thank you, tammy you're welcome. Thank you shams. First of all, I want to thank you for taking the time to come and actually meet with us to engage with the community members and discuss something that, as you can tell from the conversation, many people in our community are very fearful of. So thank you for your bravery frankly in facing us, which is especially clear in comparison to the mayor's absolute cowardliness in refusing to meet with Us, Jocelyn and Aaron. Why do you have to needlessly traumatize shams and his neighbors and remove him from a supportive environment, more specifically from the supportive friendships and the human connections that he has developed and that, I think, are very hard fought for on the upper West side and which will be difficult to replicate here, and there will definitely be some trauma in getting to that point. I am hopeful that, if this happens that we will be able to do that, but it's not something that you can guarantee, and you are absolutely removing him from that. This is the definition of destabilizing and triggering for a vulnerable population, which we all agree that shems and his resident fellow residents are. So why are you, as you know, mariama put it very succinctly: why are you putting these men at further risk for both physical and mental safety? I believe I've answered that question Tammy, but really, I really believe you have not rosa that. You said you hope that the men will be respected when they come, but we are, we will provide the same services. We have the opportunity, like I talked about to have a shelter that would be for adult families in this area, and so we're able to you know really move towards that. You are removing the something that's incredibly unique. I have to get in another call, Rosa, I'm going to I'm going to stop you there. Thank you, Rosa Andrew, from the mayor's office. Welcome to the fray. I am not going to call on Justine and Bob yet because I'd like Andrew to speak on behalf of the mayor's office go ahead. You can unmute yourself. I really appreciate it and I appreciate the invitation coming to me this afternoon. I was not able to speak with my agency partners and the mayor himself to have a statement prepared for this meeting in such short time, but we are here and everything that you guys are saying is going to be taken back to our office and shared with our team and will be used to make further policy decisions, but we are here- and we are listening to what the community has to say and all this will be taken back to the administration and be used to help making policy decisions in the future Andrew. I've heard you say that at previous Cb meetings- and I have not seen you come back with any actual answers and it's been incredibly frustrating again, I was going to ask if you could guarantee us that you were going to come back at a specific date with at least an answer to why this process has been so rushed and before the 19th. What I am prepared to do is bring your concerns back to the mayor and have them be used to affect policy changes and decisions going forward Andrew. I appreciate that response. Please do not take it the wrong way when I say repeating the same answer does not satisfy the community. We've learned that, with the dialogue, unfortunately, for Jocelyn and Aaron, repeating the same answers that the community is railing about, does not actually assuage the community does not make the community feel that they have been heard, listened to or considered it just makes them more irate appreciate. Go ahead, Pat, sorry, it's not policy decisions in the future, we're concerned about it's this decision. It is this specific move that we are discussing and even to put a finer point on that with where Pat is going. It is the decisions that are being done during the emergency order that do not seem to be emergency, driven related at all that we would like a definite answer to about this decision and about the DSS planning process being more than arbitrary, because this seems very arbitrary. It's basically more of a hollow exercise on the road to benefiting a political ally of the mayor than anything having to do with the safety and welfare of the men in that shelter or, quite frankly, having anything to do to improve the lives of finding and working with the community to cite a shelter for the people who live on the streets in Community, Board, one so samia. I know that the answers that you talked about that I gave same answers. I think we're getting the same questions, so I am going to really you know, end the meeting and let you know that we have heard your questions do not know best to answer them. I know the answers are not fulfilling. I know the answers are not what you want to hear. I know the answers can be hard. I know the decision that was made is difficult. I thank you all. I have to run to another meeting tonight. I appreciate your time. The move is planned for October 19th, and so it is, you know. My hope is that when the men do come to fidei that they are given some opportunities to be seen as human and that there is some aspect of folks who says you know these are people too, just like you and me so I'm going to end and I think that's unfair, that's an unfair way to end, because we have first and foremost said that we believe the way you are treating these men is unfair, so that is a terrible characterization to end on for community board one, and I can not let that stand. As your last comment a lawyer- and you know I do not. I think we've answered the questions that you've asked us and you have not. You have danced around them. You have not answered the questions, which is why we keep asking them rosa yeah, let's run the meeting please this is leilani. What I also asked just want to jump in that I work with you all on a daily basis. If there's any outstanding questions, please email them, I'm happy to provide responses to you all in the interim as well. I think I think Leilani some of the issue is we're still not getting the answers that we've asked for to start with. There still is not a solid answer as to why this decision was made. This does not fall under De- Densification. In any stance. We appreciate you know the partnership that we have worked with you on and DHS to try and work together. This whole situation is dehumanizing for the people in that shelter, destabilizing unfair. The process is rushed because if it takes three to four weeks making an announcement doing it in two and a half without even having the consideration for better locations- and there are better locations in CB1. We have talked about that before the non- recognition of the private providers is disconcerting to us by all of the quote. Unquote fact sheets that your organization has sent to us does not include any of it and continually saying that we do not have any shelters down here. We do not have anything is annoying Tammy, respectfully administrator. The mayor's office has to the mayor's office will answer, hopefully some questions, but when we look forward, we hope for a different process than this. That is not done under the emergency orders. We look forward to trying to support shems and the people there, and we already have neighbors from the community who are working with open hearts to because we are a compassionate community. It does not mean that we have to agree with everything that's going on. We do not agree with how you're doing it how you're treating them we are still doing what we do as a compassionate community, but this dialogue is never going to be resolved by here, because none of you made the decision. The Hotel Association should have spoken to anybody in the community. They're looking at real estate deals, people are not real estate deals. This is not fair. I know the administrator has to jump off. I recognize that, and that is fine. I think project renewal has updated their information about all of the services that they offer and things like that if they want to hang on for a minute or two for five to ten minutes, any other remaining operational questions or onboarding questions getting set up questions that would be greatly appreciated if those come through and thank you Tammy, and I thank you for your time. I appreciate the time for both you Aaron and Aaron, and the rest of your team yeah. Thank you. Thank you, okay, so I know that if project renewal, I do still see Jody and Eric Bob Schneck, you had a hand up and Dr Betty K had a hand up. I apologize, but Leilani is also still here, who has been a good partner working with us. We've just lost Jocelyn and Erin, which is fine okay, so I'm going to go to Bob and then Betty and then Justine and I'm looking through the chat, see if there's any questions again, we have 10 minutes for this. So please be succinct, okay. What I want! What I wanted to say is that I love and respect chums, and I really want to be one of the people that welcome him and his community to our neighborhood. I think that's really important and I think the important one of the things I learned from him is the idea of homework. If you have a family you'd, never move them into a house without showing the kids. What it is I mean it's unbelievable that you do not. Even there are so many steps here that are not. If you really are humanizing the process, you have to humanize it for for Jocelyn to act as though she's shocked to have shams involved. I think this whole process should begin with the engagement of people like shams and some of his partners. His colleagues I mean the important thing is to is to really, if we're engaging communities, we have to engage communities so why? In Heaven's name can't they come down here and meet us in advance of these things? They can come to a quality of life meeting or a couple of them anyway. They should because they're part of this process, they should be engaged. What engagement means is meeting with the people, and so all of this, when we're talking about how this really is not getting to the heart of anything, what this is Merrell double talk and what these people are have jobs and they have to defend the mayor. But that is not what I have to do. My job is to be a human being and look after other human beings, and I think that there's a lot of homework that we need to do here, lots of engagement- and we really should think about how can the community board, for example, help to welcome the people of this? The people? That's our that's a next step and we will be working on that. Okay and we will be working with project renewal, that is a dialogue with project renewal. The other general point I wanted to make and one of the things I've been working on lately is structural racism, and I think that that's really an important part Bob not tonight before I make the point. What I'm saying is: there's also structural bias against homeless people and that what happens is that often, when I pass these persons, I'm threatened by them, some of them really are dangerous, they're dangerous to me, they're dangerous to other people who I'm with and if I'm with kids they're really frightened of these guys. So we have to really treat that structural racism as something serious as part of the homework. We really have to think about how we can humanize communities in advance of this stuff and how we can of these confrontations, so that they're, not confrontation, so that they're actually emerging together of people Bob eventually in community board. One and acrosss the city homelessness will have a massive variety of faces, because if you take a look and think for every person, who's ever been to a theater who's. Ever been to a broadway show it's every usher. Every person who sold you a took it took. You took your tickets, anyone who plays music, anyone who operates the lights, the sound the actor works in a restaurant works in a restaurant. I mean how many restaurants and stores have we lost down here century 21. Thousands of people who work there, the subsidiary restaurant? Yes, we all know homelessness is not a is. Homelessness is a sad reality of where we are and it has many faces so Bob. I hear you but yeah, but I think that the next step is actually Bob you're getting muting, it's okay, I'm muting your bob, all right, justine! Thank you all right! So, no, first of all, I want to say I'm a nation for project renewal. It's a question. It's a comment and it's a question because I think that what everybody has said previously to this point: Patrick mariama. It's all huge and we're talking about the motives behind the decision. But clearly it's a cynical political move by the mayor and will I just dis respectfully disagree is whether the motives behind this discussion are important. At this point, it really should be the decision that falls or stands on the merits and they're not talking about the merits, because the merits of this decision that argue for keeping the men in where they are at the Lucerne, this the they've got procedures in place to take care of them. They've got jobs up there, they are comfortable there. Sham has been very clear that he wants to stay there and his folks want to stay there. All that said, this is not a perfect world. They're going to be moved here. Well, Jocelyn said clearly the 19th they're here. So that brings me to plan c, basically and kind of goes to where what Bob Schneck was talking about. What are we going to do in our neighborhood to welcome them? And I know you said it's a different conversation or a different time. That's fine, but I want to say right now that I- and I think there are people in this neighborhood justine. That's a dialogue, that's a dialogue. We will do with project renewal as the lead for how to make this work, because we do not operate their building. We have to work with them, they are the managers of the building. I would also like to work with open hearts, because I thought what Corrin said last time was so moving to me. I think that while it infuriated me that Jocelyn that's happening, you know basically, you the community, take care of these people, because it's not our job. It's not our problem. We took we made a bad decision anyway. I know I hear you I'm shutting up, but thank you. It's happening and open hearts is forming in Fidei. I am not a part of open hearts. I am I have. This. Is my community hat that I'm wearing right now and if anybody wants to join open hearts, I talk about it. How they are welcome to do so to move this forward, but we first have to get past this step plot it. Could we share that information on our community board page or someone share with me, and let me know how to do that, because I do not know and I'd like to be involved all of it all of it will go to pat. As the chair of quality life jill, you have to wait. There two hands up: it's 20 after Eddie yep, I'm going as quick as I can trying to cut people off Betty you're. Next, thanks I'm going to talk to project renewal and you shams too, I politics drive me a little crazy and seem very edgy. So I want this to end with. I moved here a few years ago with a disability as an older person, and I know it's like to be treated like a freak and everyone kind of treat you hands at length, and I want you to leave this more with you're very welcome. I hope you feel that, and you can see the statue of liberty as we like to say, community board one because we're number one so do not regret or fear coming here. This tone is not the way it usually is. This is because people are pissed off with the mayor, and I hope the advocacy is seen as a positive by you and by the agency by all means, but welcome and look forward to seeing you, and if I can do it, you can do it and yes welcome. That's the biggest key. Thank you Betty. Thank you betty all right. Let's next is Jill Goodkind Jill go ahead and unmute yourself, please yeah hi. This is hi. This is a question for project renewal. Are this? Is the quality services the overall picture at the Radisson Hotel less than what's currently at the Lucerne? In other words, are they moving to a place where they're getting less I'll start and Jody can finish one way in which the one way in which the Radisson Hotel is actually an improvement for some of the men is that at the Lucerne about half the population are sharing rooms, they're doubled up in the Radisson Hotel, everyone will get their own room. There is more internal space at the Radisson Hotel for programming than we had at the Lucerne, which is why the the external space from goddard Riverside was such a such an important feature. We think the inside of the hotel will function quite well. Our most of our concerns are really about what will happen outside the physical envelope of the hotel jody. Do you have anything where you want to you've virtually said it all I'll just say very briefly: we expect to be able to transfer the full scope of services that project renewal provides to the Radisson Hotel environment, but you've heard, I think, quite eloquently through the course of the evening that there are ancillary supports that the community provides on the upper West side and obviously rebuilding you know. As gail Brewer famously said, I think we've lost the support from goddard Riverside in the day programming and the offer to employ 50 of our clients in a kind of street cleaning capacity. That clearly was very specific to the upper West side. You know, and I think, there's an open question about the extent to which we can rebuild some of these ancillary community supports like the tremendous support from the open hearts initiative, but from a project, renewal, scope of services, we're going to be able to replicate it downtown, but for the quality of life of for the gentlemen who are at the Lucerne, it is not going to be necessarily a better quality of life at the Radisson Hotel. So to speak jams from what I've known and like I said, I sat down with Jody, and so we went over some things and some of those concerns I had because those are my concerns as well. You know to make sure that the transfer would allow for us to still benefit in the way that we did here like Eric said. The fact of us having separate rooms is really a good thing that will lessen a lot and provide a better living ability. So that's a really good thing. Now I'm hearing about the layout providing more space which, with that in place, I'm sure we can set the program now as far as like the other programs outside of what project renewal always also does I'm I deal regularly with open hearts here and they have committed to actually come there and provide a lot of the same services there as they have been doing over here at the Lucerne. In addition to that, I expect that we will increase some of the services. I do not want to support for project renewal, but just based on my conversation, I expect that we will increase some of the services provided by their recovery center, which works very well with us and was one of the initial programs that we brought in. That's the outpatient group that our project renewal has so I think that collectively between open hearts, upper West side and the friends of fitty, along with project renewals already in place services, I think we'll be all right. You know my only real major concern at this point is the amount of time for the infrastructure to be set up. That is the only real thing that could cause a major problem for us in terms of coming into it too soon, but outside of that, if they're given enough time to get their infrastructure and their ice t structure straight and and put together a certain, a good, workable program, I think we'll be fine and I'm talking to people down there infinity and I'm becoming more confident that we'll have a good experience there. A great experience! Well, we well again, we are excited that open hearts. Fidei has started because the working with open hearts for the upper West side will help the transition for you and we're sad that you have to make the transition when it's not one that you want we're even sadder, that what we're talking about is also not options for anybody on the streets that we have in lower Manhattan, which you- and I have talked about that. I think before- and I talked to project renewal about this because we need we've got a lot of people on the streets already in lower Manhattan and it grows every day and none of these options are open for that. So that's another long- term dialogue, okay, I think Sarah casell. I know I cut you off before Sarah. Do you have any other questions for project renewal and I agree with whoever said in the anonymous project. Renewal shall hire shams as an outreach coordinator, because he's pretty awesome advocate so, and I want to read that into the public mem record, because I think that would be really cool, alrighty Sarah earlier uppers, because I'm just so mad and honestly shams. If has anyone said I mean we keep reading about the lawsuit up. There. Has anyone offered you and your cohort pro bono legal services? No not yet, unfortunately, okay, interesting, okay, again something to think about. Thank you and again I apologize on your behalf, I'm so irate the fact that you're moving here and then they're going to move you again drives me nuts. I'm yeah. I think that's the one thing that is most overlooked and is one of the things that makes me frustrated in this process, because it's not for me. It's not only about your move to fidei, it's a everyone's thriving to start with and the losing of potential job opportunities that were garnered for all of you and the knowledge that this will be. I think your fourth move and then you will get moved again. So it's I do not know anybody else. Who's moved five times in under six months, but having moved a couple times, I it's hard it ai, not fun. All right. I do not have any other hands. I apologize to those who are on the attendee zoom who have hands up, but we are not calling on the public in general to speak at this I do have. I have had many questions sent to me by a variety of residents. We've tried to include them all and I think I think, we've gotten almost everything about Jody and the onboarding jody. Can you confirm or eric that you will have all your staff ready to go available for everybody on the 19th? So I'm seeing this question in the chat too, and I may have to turn to my colleagues, Katie and Kaydon Eric, and I just affirmed about 15 minutes ago that we would have our full security staff in place. There is a specific line called engagement specialist. We have several of those people currently in place. The city has allowed us to hire an additional four and I know we're in the process of onboarding some of them, but I do not believe we will have them all on boarded by the 19th, and this is special supplemental staff I katie and Kate on. Do you have any additional insight into the timeline for those four engagement specialists and other than that? The answer is yes, acrosss the board. We will have our staff in place. Katie katon, there's an additional five staff, so this is new staff, that's being hired so they're, not at the Lucerne they'll be coming with us to the Radisson Hotel and they'll be three on board by the 19th and the two. The two additional should be on within the next week: okay, but the people that the people who have been working with the men at the Lucerne are they moving with the group. Yes, okay, chaos nodding: okay, Don's, not okay, that's like so important for relationship building that I can't even you know it pops my brain, that, okay, good! All right! That's fine! Do you know what happens to the hotel staff who is currently employed at the location? Are they there then providing the housekeeping services and at front desk and security or have the entire staff from the hotel needed to be laid off? I'm sorry, the Lucerne hotel both the loose actually no from the Radisson Hotel, because the Radisson Hotel is currently operational. So the rat is it's a quarantine hotel understood the Radisson. Hotel staff will be providing maintenance services for our clients when they, when they transition to the Radisson Hotel. So our maintenance team is the third street shelter has its has an independent maintenance team. As this Canton hall, neither of those maintenance teams will be traveling with us to the Radisson Hotel. The Radisson Hotels maintenance staff will be managing the hotel and the maintenance staff at the Lucerne was the Lucerne maintenance staff, correct, okay and by maintenance. Does that also include housekeeping correct yeah? Yes, but something might include that does not include front office staff because that's a part of hotel guest server correct there were front, there were front desk staff also at the Lucerne that were, and will there be front desk staff that are that. Are I'm just trying to get my head around layoffs. I understand where I'm going, because part of the move process is additional people who are laid off during the move or displaced. I think please surely go I'd go ahead Kaydon, so I think it'd be best to you know, get confirmation from the Radisson Hotel themselves, but my understanding is in as a isolation site. There were fewer staff from the Radisson Hotel than there will be now, as we are occupying the facility as a de- densifying site, and I do not think we know what the impact of our departure will be relative to Lucerne's staff. But I can say that at least one person employed by the Lucerne has come to us off the record anecdotally concerned about the longevity of his role. So I imagine there's some of that going on. We just do not have access to the specifics. Sure specifics, but I do know the friend that connected me to upper West side, open hearts initiative. The friend through whom I met that organization lives on 111Th Street and said that this program and project renewal and what's been going on, there, has kept the Lucerne afloat. So that's one of the concerns of upper West siders that are in support of the gentleman remaining as well exactly and then I have I just want to jump in. I do not think we've ever discussed food services have we at 52 William. So that was going to be my next question, because there is a restaurant with a liquor license in that building as well. That was going to be my next question. Thank you. The restaurant space is being taken over by project renewal to actually use as the entrance and security lobby of the hotel and all of the liquor will be removed. We operate a social purpose, enterprise called city, beef kitchens that actually makes and delivers about 3 million meals a year to homeless, new yorkers throughout the city, I'm in city beach kitchens will be providing the meals to the clients at the Lucerne they'll be delivering individually packaged meals. You know three times a day that will be brought by the residential aides to each client's room. So that's how food service works so there's no communal, dining! No, absolutely not! Okay. Did you say the food is oh, so the food is not prepared on site. The food is brought to deliver to our in our commercial kitchens right. Okay, and do you need to do it? Is there a potential for additional hiring for people in the commercial kitchen? You're? Very funny I mean we. Actually we operate a culinary arts training program. It's a six month program where many of our clients, I give them food handlers. What do I eat? Tiffany yeah Tiffany Mute yourself, I got her she's muted over 50 of our employees at Cdb. Kitchens are actually graduates of our culinary arts training program and there won't be additional hiring for the Radisson Hotel, because it's the same people who are getting food service at the Lucerne, but but we're thrilled to be able to offer continued employment in a sector where thousands of people have been laid off and lost their jobs. I was just going to put in a plug before the pandemic. City B Kitchens actually was also an event catering business that does weddings and bar mitzvahs. So when this is all over there, you go. I love that. Can you confirm which entrance to the hotel you'll be using as a primary entrance and exit? I think well, Charlie and Jody? Are we actually charlie? Yes, it's the it's also the entrance on Williams Street just near nearer to the corner, so it's non- prime street, it's through the restaurant on Williams Street right, not on pine, okay, thank you and then I know this question was not for you Jody. Someone asked how hard it is to obtain and how long it would take to replace the 50 jobs that borough president Brewer had worked with with, I think, was goddard Riverside to offer the programs to the participants. I mean how it seemed like a gift from God, and I do not. I quite frankly do not know how to get that replicated so yeah. I you know goddard was able to secure, I think upwards, of a 200,000 donation to support this programming and it would take us a number of weeks to ramp it up. But if we had those ingredients, we could probably make something happen and those jobs were community beautification it was it was. They were going to be working with the green keepers program at Goddard to actually do street cleaning and beautification around specific blocks. On the upper West side, I see shams yeah. I was told that the amount of money gail Brewer had brought up was 500,000 at this point. What I was going to say is that you know behind the scenes. I was trying to see if we still could make that money available to service us or even a portion of it in what we do at you know the residents and stuff like that, because that was a good idea, but the other thing is that I am speaking to a number of people in the in the 50 district who are saying that they definitely would like to know what it is that we need and what it is that they can do and they're more than willing to help us to secure basically the same type of services and situations that we had. We just have to have more dialogue and bring them into the discussion. I want to jump in for a second also, so is not it possible for the residents of Lucerne now 52 William Street to travel back to the upper West side on a daily basis to pursue those job opportunities. I do not see why not, but I mean you know: we still need jobs and if you know if they wanted to help, because this is about so I would assume the residents of the Lucerne and considering what we've been going through. I think that's why God had stand up stepped up. We could still do that. You know that could be good for some of us that are ready to work. I would definitely love to be a part of that I mean. Maybe we on Tammy. Maybe we can reach out to borough president Brewer and find out yeah. I think that's a great idea and just to clarify with Charlie and others as more questions. The Bailey restaurant has a dual entrance, one on pine and one on South William. That goes. It's also connected. You know a little further down the street from the main entrance to the hotel, which has a revolving door. So if I understand correctly, all entrances will be monitored through Williams Street, not through the pine street side, correct, that's, correct, okay, great and then there are lots of local churches in the area, which would be great shams. You were talking about. You know the walks on things in the comments one of our people has said that Father Murphy is the pastor of our lady of victory catholic church, which is on the corner of William and Pine. So that could be a really nice connection for you. I will tell you that trinity has an incredible resource of that we'd be happy to get you hooked up with as well for people who are looking for those things and Jody and eric. If you need and caden. If you need a connection there, we can connect you directly with those those places in our community. I think everyone else. I've got we've gotten all the quality of life questions. I think that have been asked I'm quickly streaming through to see. If there's any thank you for answering all the onboarding questions. I think that's it. I know that just for everybody who is on the call, we will have a wind- up conversation about this at the Community Board one executive committee meeting, which is the 21st the quality of life meeting this month is the 22nd. It is the same night. Yes as the next debates, so you can choose quality of life, and can you reward one or a debate to watch or maybe both depending on how fast they go, and with that pat, do you have anything else that you want to add? No, I just want to say again Sham we will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as we can for you. You know we will be discussing. Please come to the quality of life meeting.

            "summary": "This meeting for community Board One tonight is again with DSS and DHS and project renewal.\nThis is one of the things that I've been thinking about and working with my team, I'm on this shared vision, and so you know looking at policing versus client centered.\nSo we want to make sure that we kind of have a balance there, but at this site we did approve additional security staff for project renewal.\nOur providers work with the neighborhood coordination offices to ensure quality of life at our permanent shelters.\nSo, a community advisory board for the shelter right, so the community board meetings with NCOS that I attended my neighborhood well You know certainly that continues, but at the shelter itself, in a permanent shelter, we have community advisory boards to really share information.\nOur intention is, as I've said since last week, is to open a permanent adult family shelter in this location.\nIt's an in- kind, move from hotel to hotel You're, not decreasing the population, you're moving 235 people You know we looked at really being able to redistribute and use a site that we have, because we have the opportunity to turn it into an adult family, shelter.\nThis was already there, so we're able to move the men from you They are to your the site, down in fidei, less hotels, they're, only two down in the neighborhood, and so we were able to identify using the site and get the ability to turn it into an adult family, shelter.\nYou could have just as easily closed down the shelter at the Radisson Hotel, the quarantine, shelter, and you could have looked for a more permanent solution for people and gone through a lot appropriate process with fair share and found location.\nWe are a amazingly resilient community that will bounce back from the pandemic and the economic recovery, and we will work with the city to find a place that can be a good location for people to get back on their feet, a place where they're not on a tiny sidewalk, a place where your services can go and a place where we can help everybody.\nThe men that are currently in the Lucerne who we're moving, will continue to get the same services when they come down to the Radisson Hotel hotel, they're, also working with other organizations to look at job training project when you actually do have drop training so that there's opportunity to be able to be self, Our president talked about this.\nThat would be able to benefit from that our space that was found there, as well as around the money that was raised to help folks in shelter, and so that's part of that, and that we would be able to have other clients utilize that you know we have 17,000 in shelter who can certainly benefit a portion of them could benefit from that in terms of the emergency order.\nYou know, circumstance gives us, and so we should the emergency order, then bifurcate the need for fair share process in sighting of a facility.\nThe process of fair share requires from city charter, the acknowledgement and inclusion of all shelters regardless if they are run by DHS or not and all services, it requires a list of documents to be included.\nTell me so I'm asking about fair share in the sighting, because you keep referring to turning this one location into a permanent shelter, and my question: is: are: is this being done under the emergency order?\nWe, say hey, you know, commissioner, banks writes this letter goes out that says we're looking for optimal places to open shelters, send it to us.\nIf you know, if they're buildings you want to bring to us, certainly we will evaluate them and they may, instead of 52 becoming the permanent shelter.\nWhat I'm saying to you is that we want to be able to have shelters at every community district in New, York City.\nSo the city registered the contracts pursuant to the executive order, 101, and that is based between the mayor's office of contract services and the comptroller office regarding contract registration during the Covid-19 crisis, and that is a goal to ensure continuing shelter services and our ability to work with service providers This is through office of contract services and the comptroller's office.\nLet's start with the role of the Hotel Association sourcing, so available, hotel locations are identified by a Hotel Association of New York, and that is based on our capacity needs and the need to effectively relocate shelters in a way that accommodates our clients needs to provide a need: staff, services, security, so We're, providing the services making sure there's effective social distancing so that we can reduce the risk of infections.\nDhs's contract with the Hotel Association of New York City, was amended to increase the city's liability by the sum of nearly 222 million dollars in connection with the conversion of hotels to house hundreds of peoples experiencing homelessness during the Covid-19 emergency.\nIf we need to end the use, we will be able to do that, and so it is really same as any one of our Covid-19 hotels that we're using Any time before that we're able to return to the congregate sites and the city and the Department of Health Says it's safe for us to do.\nI'll tell you that I mean it's through Apple's office, , will the contract be renewed until the emergency order is lifted or will another move be planned asking if we're to You know these are questions that came in from residents in the community.\nDoes, a temporary emergency executive order, suspend the requirements for fair share in terms of process, so the fair share assessment we want to take in is done for any permanent shelter.\nWe have a variety of shelters just because DHS does not operate, them does not mean they do not exist, and it is unfair and incomplete and inaccurate public information to continue to say that I'm sorry, Jocelyn , I understand that it is not your service that operates it, but it is exactly like.\nOur intentions, is to have a permanent shelter in every community district in the city of New, York.\nCovid-19 did create an opportunity for sites to be brought to us based on current use, so in terms of citing permanent shelters, right.\nWe want to make sure that we have opportunities for shelters to be in every neighborhood, not just in the neighborhoods, where they're You know where they've been concentrated in south Bronx in East, New, York and Brownsville, And. So we want to make sure that every community come together to address the crisis that we're in New York City, and so that's what our intentions, are.\nOur intentions are to be able to open an adult, our family shelters with a provider that can provide the services, but even more in a community district where there's not a DHS operated facility.\nOne of this is an opportunity to explain whether or not there was a question that came up last time about the appropriateness of the building and asking if the water cooler, because the we had photos that were sent to the community board, that the water tower on top of the building has been open to the elements and whether or not it is therefore a safe building and how that's been addressed.\nI'm, the president and CEO of project renewal, And I'm, also joined by four of four of my colleagues Jody Rudin, who is the executive vice president and chief operating officer, Katie Bauer and Kaydon Grinnell, who are both vice presidents of programs overseeing the shelters that these men come from and Charlie Mullam?\nYou know that's an important quality of life issue for the people who are surrounding that building.\nThis is not just about the community, but it's not fair to the people from the shelter either, and it would be appreciated if you can figure that out much like they have a place on the upper West side.\nThey, we moved multiple shelters to the space of town on the West side, and now we're looking to redistribute and being able to use this site, giving us the opportunity for Long- term site is where we have landed.\nWe heard loud and clear from you all that Williams street would not be appropriate and we completely concur with that assessment based on our visits to the location, so we're working on an alternative plan to provide primary care health services to our clients at the Lucerne.\nOne thing that I found from working with the public and pat through the quality of life committee is that many people still feel like 9- 1- 1 should be treated like the old days where you know there were reports that all the circuits were busy and people could not get real emergencies in because it was tied, up.\nI was just going to say absolutely one thing that happened at the Lucerne Was that people from the community would bring games.\nMetro cards are very useful, so there are small items like that which we can accommodate, which are which are really quite helpful, and and we will make sure that there are opportunities for people to volunteer in ways that allows them to actually get to know the clients themselves, because that really goes a long way to reducing some of the fear and concerns that people have about people.\nYou know what I'm hearing from you is that you really care about what goes on in your community, and you have spoken so much about the impact that such a move is going to have on the residents, which I think is great.\nNow you know this is the first time that I've seen a community come to the aid in the way that they have with no funding they're, not a non- profit or anything like that and just say look.\nSo here at the Lucerne project, renewal has opened its doors to the community and allow groups like open hearts and programming, even from within, with their own recovery center to do services that did not even exist in the shelter and most of us, I do not think, is requiring any outlay of funding or anything like that.\nIf things like the I.T infrastructure, that needs to be in place is done after the fact is going to have a negative effect on the community, maybe not to the extent that it had in the Lucerne, because we aware of some of the states, some of those that need a higher level of care or need to be in other type of facilities.\nWe expect that if they're able to continue that we'll be doing the right thing in terms of getting us from the from the hotel to housing, but I do not think that moving so soon without that infrastructure in place is going to be a good thing.\nYou know what there's a link call the mayor, because these men need people to speak up for them as well.\nI did hear you in terms of you know not having a voice for this to happen, but thinking about what your needs are and really putting out how your what your fears are when you go into a community really does resonate, and I.\nWill people be able to go to congregate to smoke when they go outside Two other questions I just wanted to bring up is: Does the city have a signed contract for services with the Radisson Hotel, with project renewal and if they're in also is there any other signed contract obligating the city to pay for rooms at the Radisson Hotel, such as from the Hotel Association, and if so, with either one?\nThink part of the question that I wanted to start with is a contract with the hotel is through the Hotel Association of New York and the city, the that's where the contract is at this point , there's no other contract for for the Radisson Hotel separate, and apart from the Hotel Association to have the project renewal residents move there.\nThe borough president does have a copy of the hotel contact and can share that for you to get direct information from them and in terms of why this was chosen, I think, on the same answer: I've, given you Thursday of last week and earlier tonight, in terms of we have been using this space And it gives us the ability to have hopefully an adult family, a shelter as part of alternative tide, plan.\nJust does not seem like on paper at all that it is, and there's still no answer to our community on why that site is better than where they're located at the Lucerne.\nThose things are important, but I do know in the area there are outdoor places like That May not be heavy- handed a therapeutic program, but it allows us to come together in a positive way with people with other people that can give us some type of inspiration or just be with us.\nSo I think, because we're having these conversations apparent or in advance, we can actually identify these places, identify these support institutions like say trinity, church and then help with Kidan to develop programming that could facilitate that and keep those of us at the Lucerne engage because you know sometimes boredom can get to.\nIf you got a hundred people standing on one block, that's just not going to look right, but I know that I engage a lot.\nI'm interested in coming down beforehand and meeting somebody that can show me some of the things in the community, and maybe I can work with project renewal staff to try and identify how we could utilize certain spaces to make it a better situation for us, as well as the community.\nIt goes to an adult family shelter we go through the process of you know getting the shelter up and opened, and at that point the shelter provider, whoever that person is whoever that provider is, will then work with our Iga, which the governmental affairs are part of our shop at Department of Social services, as well as the community board leaders to establish the committee Advisory Board we do and Leilani's on the chat.\nI personally, do not believe it is either, but before we get there, I think we need to address the issue that people are moved into off the streets and into shelters as they're able during a pandemic, that's been the guideline And, then they should stay put and people who are in whom similarly should stay.\nIf the Lucerne gentlemen are happy and healthy, where they are, and there's been accommodations made for them to remain that way, they've been given outdoor space, they've been given spaces within the building to congregate and to do and to be active and to exercise, and the community has at this point, welcome them and become comfortable and settled in with them as well, and they have a potential to have jobs, be learned from the borough president last week and from Kareem, who represented the upper West side, open, hearts.\nThey have an opportunity to work and to do other things there, and if project renewal is not going to be impacted, they're going to be safe and fine in either case whether the is moved down here or remains of town.\nAnd, if it has just say so, and I'll find out later, but in terms of the security staffing will that all be in place by the time the 235 residents are relocated to the Radisson Hotel, yes Jody or eric What's really going on here when the project renewal folks stayed on with us and answered some questions.\nSo I just wanted to actually put that you know just because I did not want this to be continuous of hold on when you're answering that project renewal found out the 25th.\nFirst of all, I want to thank you for taking the time to come and actually meet with us to engage with the community members and discuss something that.\nWe have the opportunity, like I, talked about to have a shelter that would be for adult families in this area, and so we're able to you know, really move towards that.\nMy hope is that when the men do come to fidei that they are given some opportunities to be seen as human and that there is some aspect of folks who says you know, These are people too, just like you and me, that's an unfair way to end, because we have first and foremost Said that we believe the way you are treating these men is unfair, so that is a terrible characterization to end on for community board.\nWe look forward to trying to support shems and the people there, and we already have neighbors from the community who are working with open hearts to because we are a compassionate community.\nI, think project renewal has updated their information about all of the services that they offer and things like that.\nI. Think that while it infuriated me that Jocelyn, that's happening, you know basically, you, the community, take care of these people, because it's not our job.\nI'll just say very briefly: We expect to be able to transfer the full scope of services that project renewal provides to the Radisson Hotel environment, but you've heard, I think, quite eloquently through the course of the evening that there are ancillary supports that the community provides on the upper West side and obviously rebuilding you, know.\nSome of these ancillary community supports, like the tremendous support from the open hearts, initiative, But From a project, renewal, scope of services, we're going to be able to replicate it downtown, but for the quality of life of for the gentlemen who are at the Lucerne, it is not going to be necessarily a better quality of life at the Radisson Hotel.\nAs far as like the other programs outside of what project renewal I deal regularly with open hearts here, and they have committed to actually come there and provide a lot of the same services there as they have been doing over here at the Lucerne.\nAnd I talked to project renewal about this because we need we've got a lot of people on the streets already in lower Manhattan It grows every day and none of these options are open for that.\nTwo additional should be on within the next week: okay, but the people that the people who have been working with the men at the Lucerne are they moving with the group.\nI was trying to see if we still could make that money available to service us or even a portion of it in what we do at But the other thing is that I am speaking to a number of people in the in the 50 district who are saying that they definitely would like to know what it is that we need and what it is that they can do.\nYou know once you've moved down what it's like to live in our community and what we can do to help you Jody and eric, as once again."
