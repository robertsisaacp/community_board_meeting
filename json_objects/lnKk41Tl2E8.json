So if they can do that and they want to speaker- and you know, be introduced being brought into a panel- we can do it that way. But what I'll do right now is just say hello to everybody. Welcome. We have seven board members from the youth and Ed Committee and we have our first, our guest for our first item, which is the expansion of the harbor school on governor's, island and so with us, is Nan Richardson and anybody. Okay, thank you and we they helped like pretty much wrote the resolution that is in front of you today, as you remember everyone they were with us last month and we are doing I wanted to share with you some of the things that have happened between meetings. We have not only resolution in front of you that really pushes the SCA and the DOE to identify a site for a permanent location for their pool gym. Additional classroom space that you see them ask for at this resolution between meetings, we've also been working on the solution, and we have connected with a marine engineer who pretty much knows every of the New York City shoreline. He is one of the directors of the billion oyster project. He is one of the co-owners over at the one Brooklyn marina and we are working with him to help identify that place and develop resources for this temporary barge pool. So that's in process, and what we do want to share is that, while that is one of the asks of this resolution that the primary goal of the resolution to talk to instance, the permanent solution, we have an opportunity in this month or so to make an impact with the other things that are coming in front of the governor's island, trust and the city of New York, to make sure that we have a seat at the table. With this there's some yields. What is a Eu larp happening and there's some discussion about? What's going to happen with certain buildings on the island, and so on this resolution we have identified the buildings that the harbor School feels as though the best fit for them, for this purpose, they've received feedback from the SCA that this is logical, no ask, but there's been some handing back and forth between the governor's island trust and the SCA on. Is it money? Is it the site? Is it money? Is it the site- and we know this because we've been here a hundred times before with our schools, and so our goal for this is to get everybody to focus. At the same time, we have the SCA saying that they're committed, and we have the governor's island trust on a recent call with the city council saying they too are prioritized. So this resolution is a further support of that in a timely manner. They take this as they go to. You know, commit the space on the island in these upcoming months. So if anybody has any questions or Amy, please you know board members speak now, engage in some conversation about it. Has everybody had time with the resolution? It just came today. Sorry, if you happen to take your time, we have it. We don't have many things to do tonight. So if you want to take your time and read through it now, please do. Is this also been emailed to us that I apologize? This is Wendy, I'm on my phone, so it's a little hard to read. Jen did you ever for the meeting I haven't been able to what I can do is I can go ahead and email that out or I can share that as a link in the chat box yeah, the link in the top box works if that's easier, whatever is easier for you and Trisha Quick question. Sorry: if you mentioned this and I missed it, are we asking just for sighting or citing and funding well, because it tends to be a little bit of a bug passing happening. We just covered all the bases and Nan feel free to jump in that mic is open, so please feel free to jump in and I was just going to say, we'd be happy to read it aloud if that helps Wendy or anybody else. That's on the phone: it's not that long. Let's do that! That's a great idea! Go ahead! Sorry, just one quick question before we read it aloud because it might be relevant for reference here. Do we know when governor's island submits its budget to the city? Have they already done that for the upcoming calendar year? Do we know? And if not, do you want to push to have this prioritized on the Gi submission? Well, I mean this mostly I mean at least as far as I know, and you can correct me, I mean this is mostly SCA money and money. You have risked combined correct. Are you expecting anything from governors? Island, I, didn't know the governor's island ever paid out in this fashion? At all sorry, not governor's island, the city so go as I understand. Governors island submits an annual budget to the city, with a request for funding for certain aspects of activity on the island. Yes, like we do as a community board of sorts I, don't know whether this would come over their purpose to really question, because we're going after the typical channels, which right now are the SCA and the nca you know has said to the harbor school that they have to do something that they can't justify a pool straight out for the school given what's happening, Covid-19 and the city budget, so that good faith is just a lot of money and then the rest of is getting an echoing myself. You guys hear that you guys can not yeah. It was the echo oh now you too Jeff hmm settings. It looks like check these settings. It looks like everybody, it's everybody. I've never seen it happen for everyone never seen it happen for everyone. I'm gonna go ahead and meet everybody. That works one moment hello. Can everyone hear me am I? Echoing? Yes, can you guys hear me? Yes, we not for me yeah for a couple of it's fun, but it's for me. Apologies! Everyone! I'm going with these everyone, I'm going to speak second solve this issue. We might have to jump off. We may have to jump on, I'm not sure if that was the first time, I think it's worth the try, whatever okay Tricia since I'm the host, have we tried muting, Jen and giving Trish a host ownership. I didn't hear an echo all of a sudden. It's working yeah, that's interesting, Andrew I think it's I think it was Jen's line. Jen just went on mute, okay Jen. Can you come off mute and speak again and see what happens yeah? Can everyone hear me without an echo? That's strange, okay, see yeah, so she'll be coming back on and Wendy came back in yeah Jeff logged off. So let's see is it me? Is that I feel like when I hit the document to read it? That's just when it happened interesting. We had Jen jump off so I, don't know if they were one of the sources, but we'll see all right. There's Nan, I'm waiting for Josh Nan. Can you try to talk and see what happens? Can you hear me testing three perfect much better? Yes, okay, I'm gonna get my. We haven't restarted. Correct I just want to make sure I didn't jump fall off. Oh, we haven't restarted. We were just waiting for Jeff who's. Now not here. Do you see him chance? That's right, yep! Oh there he is okay. Hi Jeff, here, yeah I hear you I restarted I thought we were all restarting that's what I heard people saying so I left the meeting. I came back. Yes, it's all good! So whatever we did worked so okay, great welcome back everyone and we were just about to have Nan, read the resolution so Nan. If you want to go ahead, okay, great, whereas the New York Harbor School's core mission, has not been fully fulfilled in the last 17 years as a result of not having proper facilities, whereas the harbor school is overcrowded and sees her in high demand as the only maritime marine School in New York City, with a growth area in jobs that need the diversity harbor students represent proudly and well. Whereas the harbor School has been asking for an aquatic training center as a central need in a program that involves daily teaching on the water and in votes, whereas the Harvard School was promised a gym in 12 additional classrooms and that ask was funded by the DOE SCA in 2018. After a previous request in 2012 was funded and rescinded in 2014, whereas the Doe's only proffered option today was to site the harbor school gym in the only small patch of green space. The school has on an island that measures 172 acres in the area, whereas the trust for governors Island and DOE has stated that building 555 12 classrooms has been reserved for New York, Harbor School since 2018, but have yet to deliver the building to the school, whereas at its founding, the Harbor School taught all students how to swim as a graduation requirement, a critical skill for marine jobs, they were forced to drop that skill after moving to governor's island as the school had no way to train the students due to the lack of a pool as the school's only transportation access is by ferry and many aspects of the marine-based curriculum involved in water engagement. This is a safety issue as well as an equity issue. Therefore, given the delays and lack of delivery of additional academic places, gym auditorium or a pool committee recommends, the New York harvest will be awarded by Tgi Building 515, the former hospital or another existing building of adequate space as a part of its campus to enable the facilities needed for it to fulfill its mission and that build out funded by the SCA DOE. Therefore, further the committee recommends that effective immediately the trust for governors name a temporary space for a pool facility to be used by the New York Harbor School that can be occupied for up to seven years until the permanent building becomes available and I'm sorry what this leaked out is Trisha your edit about something about. You know with our consultation space the site is our consultation. I'm reading I think the Pentagon version. Yes, I thought I had put that in there. Oh, no here it's on the website. I couldn't see the website before with the school's directors in consult so consult because oftentimes they're going to cite something you don't want. Anybody have any questions, none at all. It's great! It's a great resolution. Super comprehensive, so I'll give it a few more minutes to see if anybody has any thoughts or ideas, if not we'll take it. The great news here is that everybody seems to be ready to go. It's definitely very reminiscent of that. What we've been through with schools being approved where the seats are funded and they say they can't find a site, and then we find a site and they say why the sites can't work or they can't really commit to the site and then all of a sudden it just happens and we're in this space in between, but there's nobody pushing back saying that this should not happen. So we're hoping the specifics here will help them. You know come together which, of course, we're also working on meetings. Yeah I, don't know if you saw my email this afternoon to you Trisha that Lorraine Gorilla said to me this morning that there was another building that SCA had looked at, but she didn't for some reason, have that information before her. So, even though she was very clear that the hospital thing was her preferred site and has been saying that to me for two years now, I wonder what this other building might be. Yeah, it's a really good question and you know I would imagine Nan you're pretty familiar with the by now, but certainly we can find out what it was. The only concern I would have, assuming that she mentioned that to you today would be that if she's getting pushed back on the hospital, she might eventually turn her attention to that building. So you know we should really strong in the fact that you don't just need a pool. You know you really owe the gym and you need more classroom space and they've funded that, to a large extent already and we've seen several times downtown. You know, most recently with the millennium gym how you can raise it in a half, and then you can lose momentum when they can't find a space. There were plenty of spaces for this gym, they just weren't, incredibly straightforward and they required longer leases than the DOE was comfortable with, but we have an opportunity with the change over and some of the elected officials this coming year with the Euler happening. So I really feel as though this is the time to put a lot of pressure on people to move forward with a space that you really feel will best serve your program. You know: we've turned down places that they've come up with in the past because they just weren't right and vice versa. They would turn down. I sat that we thought were right like where the Trinity place pool is going in there and now they're building there. So we just I really think that's why I think the off you know the directors at the school have to be part of that decision, because it is your mission and the space has to be appropriate and they have admitted that space could work, and so, let's focus on that space. If you think that's your space hear what they have to say about the other space, but, okay, you know you've done a lot of work on the island. You know what you need. Anybody else, any ideas, thoughts, questions concerns, I echo, you Trisha, that I think it timing-wise. This makes there's a lot of things happening so I, I'm crossing fingers for everybody, I mean too sorry. I was interested to hear from Laureen Grillo that she's retiring too and I said: oh, no, you're not retiring until we get this done. This is on her bucket list, but she shared so that made me feel really good. Me too. You know they're referred to that. So all right. Well, if there's no further questions comments, we'll go to a vote Jen. Would you like to do a roll call for us sure someone, a member of the floor, can call the question and someone else. Second, please can I call the question I'll call it I. Second, it okay we'll go ahead and Trisha yes, Jeff! Yes, Sarah Castle! Yes, Wendy! Yes, they're on votes! Yes, Devon's! Not here! Palin! Yes, not here! Judith! I'm sorry! Could you repeat that? Yes, thank you, Andrew Zelter, yes, okay and Sarah E she dropped off. It looks like let's see, I think she thinks you're dead, okay, I, just texted, her, hey guys, hi hello! It's me, Bob, oh hey, Bob I had trouble with the internet. Can I just ask what resolution you're voting on? We are voting on the Harbors school. Sorry, okay, thank you. Have a good chance to read it. I! Don't but I trust that we're in the affirmative on that I'd like to get a copy of the next resolution, I'll try to locate that. But yes, I vote. Yes, okay, if everybody else is voting, yes, I'm voting. Yes, we lost Sarah, but I think we have a quorum right. Chad shut up I showed up right on time. Okay, Sarah dropped off right when you came on, so it was amazing. There's limited internet access in Tribeca. The resolution unanimously passes. That's wonderful! We're really excited to take that to our full board. Man I'll be in touch with you with meetings. Thank you again for your help with this today. You guys are amazing partners. So we really appreciate we. Thank you very much for your help and your support. You got it. Thank you very much. Absolutely we're going to be sticking with it all the way, all right, so we'll move fabulous to our second item. I just got sent yesterday and concerned that the New York city educators were not among the first group, I'm designated by the city to get the vaccine, and so I intend to write resolution within the next week. That is going to be about prioritizing our educators because we're never going to have a momentum in terms of being able to go back to school and stay in school until we can protect our teachers and principals. In my view, so we are here to discuss this if anybody wants to share different points of view or add to this discussion in any way, but it was surprising to me that they weren't right behind healthcare workers, and so you know I felt it was worthy of a resolution Patricia. This is Judy I agree with you. Teachers in particular are essential workers and they should be treated as such yeah, especially seeing the start. Stop thing we're dealing with right now. It's you know it's very hard on our kids Trisha, also the janitors and the custodians and the service workers in the cafeteria and the secretaries, because they all come in contact with the students. All the school employees, that's a good point. Thank you. Sarah guys, I haven't seen the resolution. I'm sure it does not include after school programs which are being not represented by unions but being sent into after-school programs. Our learning labs program serving 276 89,234 is fully enrolled every day. There's no room in it anymore and I would appreciate if someone could say learning labs and after school work is there I had a meeting with DYCD asking him. What's the plan? I don't want my people getting sick and personally, I would I, don't know why we just don't wait eight more weeks, so you know everybody gets vaccinated and you know open the school's up. Middle school programs are still not open, but if they do open them up, we think after school programs, learning labs and should be, and I've been looking into private testing and private vaccines to no avail right. I'm kind of worried about my staff and I'm sure there are countless amounts of other community organizations and schools that are having the same questions we're getting together tomorrow to so. If that could just be inserted in there, too absolutely got it. Anybody else, I can't believe they're, not you know, since I've I can't believe they're not commenting on teachers going in there going home to their families. I do know that some health department workers that are going into the schools are being prioritized, but I, don't know why they would be different than a school person I, don't either because they're talking general population end of April and past the whole school year, so that I think this is an incredibly important thing to be talking about right now. State and city goes to ration these things, I'm sure you're at the forefront of this people are thinking about it. But even though, if we don't get this, the e, if we don't get at the same time as the firemen, we'll at least get or the hospital workers, will at least be getting, you know those teachers will be getting something absolutely okay great, so you can expect the, whereas and therefore it resolves to look like just defining the importance of you know getting our kids back to school. The fact that you know how I will get my data straight on how many teachers have felt fallen ill. This fall mental health aspects of children not being able to be at school and then therefore be resolved that they are within the same papa, as you know, right behind our frontline health care workers. But with that in mind, I would love to move to a vote. I call the question. Thank you Trisha. Yes, Josh S, Sarah Castle, yes, Wendy, yes, Judith, yes, Andrew Zeltry, yes, she's star eating, Sarah! Sorry, thank you. Everyone got two great things tonight and that agenda. So thank you all for coming. It was really important. You were here to vote and I. Think he's really needed. The support so I appreciate it and I wish you all. It's not one of the strangest holiday seasons, full of love and health and everybody stays safe and keeps the morale up and at the full board. Thank you, Trisha! Thank you. As always, all right, everybody. Thank you again.",
