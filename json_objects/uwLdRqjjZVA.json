        "fullTranscript": "All right folks, we're gonna, get things on the road. Thank you for joining us for July, 28, 2020 summer of kovid, murder, hornets and now sharks. So you'll see up on the screen, a information about a town hall that we're having on monday with council members, chin and rivera as well as the commissioner of the department of consumer and worker protection. She is going to be covering basically everything workers need to know, as people start returning to their workplaces and their offices, what protections their employers are responsible for providing in the era of program and what rules and regulations govern their objections and employment. So I know for one I just got an email today saying we're back to work in the office on monday, so I'll be attending this to make sure I know what to expect when I get there, so registration is required. You can submit comments in advance and we will also have a spanish and interpretation so for those of you who need it that will be available, so we are going to I'm gonna, stop sharing this and we're gonna move into our public session. As I mentioned, we have a about a half dozen or so people who signed up to be speakers. As a reminder, speaker forms are normally due or you know. In the era of meeting virtually we ask the speaker forms be submitted the monday before the meeting by noon, but we're gonna grandfather some people into that tonight who didn't get it in time, because virtual meetings are a challenge for all of us, so we're trying to be as fair as possible again you're going to be limited to two minutes and I'm going to be bringing the timer up soon to do that and we're going to start with valentina jones. Who wants to talk about the bncr project? I believe valentina. Okay, the lower east side power partnership sent a letter to the city council in support of the Brooklyn bridge, the montgomery street coastal resiliency project. We are advocating support for this project in every possible way. We emphasize the fact that there are hesco barriers placed at smith and lands in two, which is a constant reminder to the residents of the present protection and that there's a need for more to be done. What our understanding was that the work on this project had been paused as of April, and we advocated utilization of every measure possible on this work to resume. We did this on June 29th. We received a response from received a response from EDC. That said, they will be resuming design work on this project. This week the response was July 13 2020. After a few conversations with the consultants, they will be ready to discuss further with the community and communicate and update his schedule. That's it! Thank you, val, yes, you're welcome next will be tommy, loeb, tommy you're there I'm here. Thank you. First of all, I want to update people after the may a board meeting. Some of you remember. I requested a copy of a document sent by ddc to the board and was initially denying that document. I then applied under the freedom of information act and I'd like to update you that, in fact, the law department agreed with me and overruled the board and forced the board to send me that document and I would hope, in the future, both the board members new board members and staff would familiarize themselves with the freedom of information act, so this doesn't get repeated now. Secondly, I want to raise an issue regarding, in november, we appoint the city council passed the escr. They made provision for a community advisory group to be appointed that had its first meeting and now at the first meeting we were allowed, the public was allowed to attend. We've now asked whether the public would be allowed to attend following meetings and we've been denied. First of all, I believe the open meetings law applies and these meetings have to be public, since they include elected officials, community boards, city agencies, but even in the in the case of transparency. These should be open to the community to observe since important information is going to be related and the community has a right to see both the questions and the answers that ddc surpr supplied. I'm happy to see assemblyman epstein on the on the call right now, so I hope he will weigh in on having transparency obeying the open meetings law and allowing the public to attend the community advisory group meetings not to participate but to observe- and I would like this to be referred to a community board committee so that the community board will take a position on whether they believe the community action group meetings should be open to the public. Thank you right. Next, we have susan morris susan, hey, can you hear me? Yes, thank you great right. I just wanted to talk about the ferry change. That's happened with the corliers hook fairy starting in may. Our route had basically been eliminated. The lower east side route- and we now are on the south Brooklyn route, which means that we can only go southbound. We can't go northbound and my concern is basically that we know we can get to 34th street, which is one of the two hubs where you can transfer to many other routes and for those of us who live all the way east. I feel like we're already in a transportation desert and that this, basically the edcs did not have any kind of community input. They never put this out there if it had been the mta. It obviously would have come to some sort of public comment, and so I actually did. I came up with a variety of different proposals about how either they could extend the route. One more stop to 34th street or, alternatively, put us on routes that literally almost kiss the core leaders of gary as it goes by either the astoria route that comes from the Brooklyn navy yard or the sound view that goes up and down, which is where the only other station that's been affected. The stimulus encode has been added to any right. I had a conversation with people from EDC. It was rodney miranda, franny, cementano and probably most importantly, megan quirk who's. The vice president in charge of this and all they're really concerned about is numbers of basically having a groundswell of people who are actually using it where otherwise, they will not at this point, unless there's a groundswell of sort of voices to basically try to get us more access, particularly now with Covid-19 of people not wanting to be in enclosed spaces of being able to be on the upper decks of the ferries, where you can be outside to actually have transportation to have this affected, and so I was just hoping that we would basically be able to get some community support to basically have some hearings, at least about getting us additional routes, so that we can now go north as well as south. Also on top of that, the way that they've planned it is that you cannot make any kind of transfers from any of the stations that we have going south to go north. They it's you miss it by one or two or three minutes, and so it hasn't been considered at all. Thank you, susan. I would suggest that you reach out to our district manager in the office. The email is on the website to ask to have this put on an agenda for the transportation committee. We can't discuss things at full board meetings that aren't on agendas and they have to start at the committee level. Would that be susan? Yes, that would be soon. Okay, thank you go out all right. So now we've got. I believe we had an influx of people wanting to testify regarding the open streets, specifically avenue b. So we have selected four and we're going to start with these four john blasco good evening community board three. My name is john velasco. I'm a NYCHA, jacob race resident, I'm the district leader of the 74th assembly district part a and I'm a founding member of the loy said the open streets community coalition. I really just wanted to spend a short time thanking the transportation and public safety committee for supporting the open streets initiative and cb3 for supporting it and hearing testimony at the committee's meeting on people's experience with avenue b open streets. Specifically through the coalition we started of resident and community stakeholder volunteers. We have seen some major improvement barricades, get replaced faster, they're, positioned in the correct spot, based on guidelines from the department of transportation and more folks come out to enjoy the streets at the transportation committee meeting. We heard some concerns from fdny, but given the discussion we had and the various recommendations made, I'm fully confident that we can resolve the matter and make sure that fdny can get full access to do the great work that they do and our public health and safety initiative of keeping avenue b in open streets remains in effect and intact. As a NYCHA resident myself, with limited space due to construction and scaffolding, having avenue b as an open street as an option to walk, is exciting and vital, and I thank you all for allowing me time to give this public testimony. Thank you so much. Thank you, john. Now we're going to go to laura seawell hi, I'm laura sewell, I'm speaking today as a long-time neighborhood resident and the executive director of the east village community coalition in support of the transportation committee's resolution on the avenue b. Open street d.o.t gave the loiseda open streets community coalition, stewardship of the avenue be open street just one month ago, and volunteers are now faithfully placing barricades every morning, monitoring them throughout the day and moving them aside in the evening. They use their own funds to paint the barriers and build new legs. I've never seen such a groundswell of support for anything quite like this, so we really appreciate the transportation committee's efforts to identify several creative solutions that would help fdny improve their response times without sacrificing the health and economic benefits of the avenue be open street. It's well used by a diverse group of neighborhood residents, the street, the sidewalks are very narrow, especially with the restaurants that are open there. You really need to walk in the street. We now have an open line of communication with battalion chief spelling and we hope to work with our fighter fighters and the committee on the best solution for all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Laura now we're going to go to andrew gilbert, hello, I'm also a cb3 resident and I'm the volunteer coordinator of the los cc chloe's side open streets. Community coalition- and I'm also here to speak in support of the transportation committee resolution on sending suggestions to the DOT about how to improve the open street so that both the local residents, the local businesses and fdny's concerns can all be addressed, and we can have a more successful, more beneficial public environment for everyone involved. I think you know we appreciate everyone at the committee. We did a lot of work at the committee level, drafting a resolution that takes into account all of the stakeholders needs, and I think we presented a list of four or five really good options for not just you know, it's not even a situation where you know we're giving something up to placate these concerns, but rather we have a number of proposals that will both make the streets safer in terms of emergency access, while also giving more opportunities, for you know outdoor exercise, outdoor transportation, reducing pedestrian congestion and making it a more conducive place for things like the open restaurants and to help businesses that are struggling, and so I hope that the full board will support the resolution. Thank you. Thank you andrew. Our last speaker on this issue is sophie. Meyerwitz, I believe, is how I say the last name. Apologies if it's not no worries merowitz. Thank you so much full board for hearing us out tonight. Thank you to my fellow founders of the louis cida open streets, community coalition. As a co-founder of lask and a former public member of cb3's transportation, public safety and environment committee and an east village resident, I wanted to formally introduce myself to the full board the new york city department of transportation, as you now know, made us an official partner of avenue b's open street in late June, and we are a group of east village and lower east side, community members, business owners and non-profit leaders who formed with the goal of stewarding and maintaining avenue b as a shared street for safe and socially distanced recreation. As laura mentioned, our sidewalks are super narrow and it is a crucial public health safety need for the neighborhood. Since the group was given stewardship. As john mentioned, the barriers have been consistently replaced and maintained and have suffered less damage, and we hope that effort hasn't gone unnoticed by the board and a few examples. I just wanted to kind of paint the picture. I've seen families pushing strollers and spreading out not having to walk single file, less crowding on sidewalks cyclists, joggers and pedestrians, getting exercise and kids playing outside after getting stuck indoors neighbors greeting neighbors and checking in with one another more room for those waiting for emergency food distribution and groceries. This open street is a crucial public health need and no small joy to a community that has suffered greatly as a result of this pandemic. We have won a groundswell of volunteer support of 50 volunteers from local businesses, families and individuals who have been robbed of their rob summer, programming outdoors and are dedicated to managing this open street. We thank the board for supporting the open streets program and the community, the transportation committee who has been working to find the solution that will allow the avenue b open street to succeed moving forward, including their resolution earlier this month. As has been mentioned, proposing traffic flow adjustments and a quick response and working with our fdny partners. Thank you. Thank you sophie. Thank you, everybody. That is basically the end of our main public session, but we do have a special presentation. I'm going to take the timer off for this one. Russell frisch from NYC census is here to give us an update about census and there he is russell. Go ahead. Where's! Yours, hey! Thank you! Thank you so much for having me. I hope I hope everyone has heard of the census. I hope you all particular have done your census form. If you have not, please do that right now and I can give all the resources if anyone needs to call or fill the form out online. Those are the two options to do it. If anyone asks you how to complete the census, there's a phone number which I can put in the chat and a website to go to and folks can do it. They don't have to have gotten a mailing. They don't need a special code. They can just do the census, regardless of any other potential barriers. The census is for every single person, and that is a super important detail that we want to stress on as much as possible. I do want to give us some numbers for your area and for the city, so new york city as a whole right now has a 54 response rate. So that's just over half of new york city residents have completed the census just for some context, the country as a whole, because it's of course a nationwide effort. The nation as a whole is at 62.6 percent, so we're pretty far behind the country as a whole and let's get a little bit more detailed Manhattan as a as a borough, is at 55, so we're doing a little bit better than the than the citywide average, but not by much cb3. So if you cut the data just around your community board you're at about 56 so again a little bit higher, which is great, but still that's still only 656 of of the total people who live in cb3 and if you want to cut it by neighborhood, the lower east side is at 59 response and chinatown is at 53 percent. I can pull up some other numbers if anyone needs that, but thinking about really about half of the city has responded to the census. So if you think like we don't want half of a hospital, we don't want half of a school, we need. We need everybody to complete the census so that we all get the resources. There was a. There was an article in the new york times a couple weeks ago about wealthier new yorkers being out of the city and that's a huge issue, because just because they just because they have the personal resources, doesn't mean that they can just not respond to the census, because they don't think that their neighborhood might need. It actually comes down as to the state level and the city-wide level right. So every single new yorker counts. We are all really in this whole thing together. So I'm happy to answer any questions folks have about the census, and I urge you all to reach out to your friends and family, make sure that everybody you know has completed the census, and the last thing I will say is that we actually are running a week of action this week we're doing a big push during this specific week. We already had a bunch of events yesterday and today. Some are virtual. Some are in person, but I'm I would urge all of you to join us. We have hundreds- and I believe, almost 800 volunteers citywide at this time to participate, whether that's phone banking text, banking. All of that- and I cannot put some links in the chat for folks to sign up. So thank you again, I'm happy to answer any questions. Folks have or or anything else. Thank you thanks russell, so community board members, if you have any questions, please use the raise hand function. May I see you have your hand up go ahead? Yes, so you mentioned, this is the census week of action and, for example, if our community board wanted to gather some volunteers to do some outreach, maybe by phone or for example, by phone. Is there a list of does NYC census? 2020 have a list of residents in our area that we could call that you know, maybe you called before, and they didn't answer the census, so you weren't able to reach them yeah. Absolutely, I'm sorry. Could you cut a list for us, so I could definitely cut the list specifically for cv3 or for your neighborhood. That would be. I would love to. I would love to work with you on that we actually just did. Last night we did a big phone bank specifically for the upper west side with the assembly member danny o'donnell up there, so we can cut lists. However, groups would like to use them and so yeah. I would actually urge you to contact me directly. I'm a Manhattan field associate for the census, and so I can put my email in the chat. Just shoot me an email and we can talk about ways to do a phone bank specifically for your neighborhood, okay, great because some I mean there are many members who are already involved, maybe through their own organization, but some may not be involved. So we just want to do more. You know to fill in the gaps absolutely, and I and I on that note- I'm going to put two two links, also in the chat here to so that, if folks are interested in actually signing up to volunteer with us, we have our weekly schedule. So we have phone banks every day of the week, various times throughout the day that you can sign up and join us anytime. That works for you and that's that first link, nyc.gov census calls and you can sign up for whatever day works best for you in your schedule, and then we have a friends and family outreach plan to help you reach out to folks in your own personal networks, and so those two links are in the chat. If folks are interested, we would love to have more volunteers thanks. So we've got one more question from our board chair, alicia, hi russell, and thank you so much for coming out tonight to talk to us about the census. I am curious. I know that before the census got started, they were expressing how the african-american community was very low and turning out their census forms and I'm curious to find out. If that's still the case, if you know the data on that just yet, so I can look at the data available to me again. So we we're a city agency, we're not the census bureau. Obviously so we don't have, we don't have the actual responses we just can know based on what the public data that the census bureau is putting out and and yeah, so we're basing our information off of that. But what I can look up quickly is a racial breakdown. I don't know if I'm going to be able to give enough information that will be satisfactory. Unfortunately, we would love to see all of that breakdown, but at this time we yeah- I can't so I don't know yeah, so I don't have access, unfortunately, to corrupt the data itself. Yeah russell, if you can, if you can maybe work on that and get it from whoever you need to get it from and then just send it to our district manager's office and share with us absolutely robin you've got the last question: yeah hi russell thanks! So much, I'm actually got a call. Last night from somebody about the center. Great, that's good to know, yeah, it's good to go besides the phone banking is there are. Is there any online tools, because I'm part of a cooperative, there's 850 units- and I can send something out, for example? So is there something like that you could share with us as well? Yeah? Absolutely so, if you go to the census, friends and fam link there, we have. We have dear neighbor letters that we can send you a packet of that you can distribute within your building, and that would be great and the last thing I want to say this is a common question that comes up. The census itself will end on halloween right, so October 31st is the last day to complete the census on your own. The census bureau will be sending out all of their enumerators, so the folks that go and knock on doors. They will start going out in the next couple weeks. So if you have not completed your census, you might get a knock on your door. So that's something you can tell folks if they are wondering about that. But thank you so much and I'm happy to answer any questions. My email is, there feel free to reach out. Thank you. Thank you. Russell appreciate it all right, folks we're going to move on to our reports from elected officials as a reminder, reps we're giving you two minutes. Please try and keep it brief and don't go over those two minutes. I'm gonna not put the timer on because a lot of people find it annoying. But if I find you guys going long, I'm gonna put it on and we have a couple of electeds on we're. Just gonna ask them to keep it to maybe five minutes. Three hot topics I only see harvey and brad on. I think everybody else has reps. So we'll start with our assemblyman harvey epstein, all right, hi. Everyone. Thank you for taking the time I just wanted to talk about a couple quick things. One is a quick albany update. We people may know we were back in session last week and we had you know trying to do a cleanup that we weren't able to do in March. I know you mentioned the department of consumer affairs. We were able to pass a. I was able to pass a consumer affairs bill that gives the department of consumer affairs the ability to get a judgment against employers who steal back wages. Up to now, they've had to go to a hearing, administrative hearing and then to court. We were able to get that bill done our separation of film children, our scar bill that now will be able to have us information about kids, who have been separated by the federal government that are now in new york. We'll have an accounting bill and we'll be able to provide services to those families brad, and I were able to finally get our private equity or predatory equity study bill done, which will be the first in the state and maybe in the nation of figuring out how private equity funding is affecting our real estate market. So we can then actually legislate private equity, obviously that's a great market, so they don't really know. What's going on, we were able to pass a lot of other amazing bills, ice out of court, which is, I was a co-sponsor and brad's bill, so you can talk about that. It's really getting a ice out of our court, so it courts are a safe place for our immigrants and other new yorkers. Our healthy terminals bill really an important bill that allows the terminal workers to have benefits clearly something that is such an important thing. Another bill that I introduced recently around disability rights that people know this past weekend was the 30th anniversary of the americans with disabilities act. We have a bill with a senator scrufus, which is just basically modeling what we did on the federal level, which is saying that we should use our government power to procurement and operationalize hiring people with disabilities. People with disabilities 30 years later have a 70 unemployment rates. The opportunities are still really limited for people with disabilities, even though people with physical disabilities may more have better accessibility ability so we're trying to get real government dollars into dealing with people with disabilities. Quick people around this september, we'll do our virtual office opening. My office has been open on avenue b for the last couple months, but it's really not been operational just because we've been in Covid-19 epidemic. If people want to come by we're in the office now on tuesdays and thursdays, that's on 7th street and avenue b, we'll have an opening with the lori's girls club on september. 17Th people heard a lot about census. Last thing, I'll just mention is this. You know we really need to talk about our small businesses and the struggles that they're having right now brad and I will be having a press conference tomorrow with a local group talking about how small businesses are struggling. You need rent relief and we're working together to push something forward. We really need to do something for our small businesses and the thing we can do best for our small businesses is use them, stop shopping online and stop buying things and spend our money locally and supporting our small businesses is going to be critical, especially our black owned businesses. If you know just go to mikey's ice cream shop on avenue a or go to a barber shop and go going to our local businesses, so they can recover. That's critically important. It's really it's an it's an amazing community. We live in and we should support it as much as possible and on the open streets. I'll just say avenue b has been amazing. The collisions has been coming together, painting every weekend, rebuilding those barricades. People are dedicated to the open streets on avenue b and they are doing such a service to our community. We should applaud their work every single day. I get to see it every day when I'm walking down avenue b and we should be thankful for their work. I'm sorry, I will have one last thing. I'll say the budget is a mess. We need to push our federal representative to put some revenue on the table, but if the senate doesn't do it new york's gonna be a fiscal mess, even if they do it, we're probably going to be a fiscal mess. We need to push for more revenue. This is what we've been pushing for. We had 105 members of the legislature ask for new revenue sources, we'll have a short window in august. To do it, you could be an ally by pushing the governor to say, not cuts revenue. We don't want mta fare hikes. We don't want things that are going to affect low income people. We want real revenue for millionaires and billionaires and people of pieter terre tax or mezzanine debt where people can afford more, should pay more and that's what we're standing for and that's what we hope you stand with us for to do. Thank you all. Thank you harvey. Are there any questions for the assemblyman, all right, senator hoyoman you're up? Thank you michael. You run a tight ship. I appreciate that as a former community board chair I can. I can definitely feel you on that. Yes, to follow up on harvey what a great colleague and what a good week that we had it in albany. You know the July session is very unusual. We passed a lot of bills. I personally passed 13 bills just last week alone. That's great! That's a big change from being in the in the in the senate majority and one of the bills, I'm most proud of, is called the protector courts act which prevents the immigrations and custom enforcement ice from rounding up undocumented immigrants who are on their way to court or leaving court or going to be a witness or testifying in a civil trial. It's been outrageous. That ice has used the sanctity of our courtrooms to try to deport new yorkers and that's going to stop now with our new bill. The protector reports act which passed those houses another bill that I'm particularly proud of regards something called slack lawsuits. Black lawsuits are strategic lawsuits against public participation, they're, basically baseless, meritless, frivolous lawsuits filed by very wealthy people like donald trump, like harvey weinstein, like others who are trying to silence critics, and they do so by suggesting that the critic- let's say it's a tenant leader like mike mckee, who many of us know from tenants. Pac, was dragged into court by the real estate lobby and they claimed defamation and had he and his organization for from for years in court, where they racked up hundreds of hours of legal expenses. No longer will big corporations or powerful people be able to do that. The what the standard for these lawsuits is going to be much higher. That's also going to protect our journalists, the new york times msnbc. Other news outlets have been dragged to the courts by the wealthy and powerful and that's going to stop in new york and we're going to match other states. I also wanted you to know that I passed legislation requiring a public vote by the mta board if they, if they decide to reduce subway service, less than 24 7 after the pandemic is over. We need public accountability on that. They can't just use the pandemic as an excuse to cut off our subways and leave a lot of people stranded, a lot of essential workers stranded from using the subways and off hours. I passed legislation that would finally ban ghost guns. These are the guns that are made in parts through kits that you can purchase online and you use a youtube video to assemble them and they evade new york's, very good gun laws. Those purchases of ghost guns have skyrocketed along with other gun purchases. Since the pandemic began, it's very frightening and we need to address it, I'm glad the senate passed it and then, and then finally- and you know a more light-hearted note, but not inconsequential for many of us, I've heard from a lot of constituents that it's like they're, damned impossible to cancel your gym membership during the pandemic, and it's intentional subscription services like gyms and other companies make it make it purposeful that you have to, like. You know, write a letter, get a notary. You know show up in person to cancel now you're going to be able to do it online. Once the governor signs my bill that I passed. So that's a few of the bills that I that I passed I did want to finish on the issue of budget couldn't agree more with harvey. We have to identify new revenue sources if the feds aren't coming in unemployment, insurance we've been continuing to work. Caroline rexelbound who's on the phone has done an amazing job, and I just wanted to thank her publicly and in helping manage so many cases. Up to date, we had 1 24 unemployment insurance cases that we've assisted with we've closed out 858, so we're making progress, but it's and no one should be without their unemployment, insurance and then, finally, on the census. It is really bad, not just in new york city, but in our senate district, which is only our senate district. The 27th is only responding at 49, so we are below the nation below the state below the city of new york and below Manhattan. So one of the things I just wanted to share with you talk about these rich folks who aren't filling out the census. Talk about free riders, I mean. Is there anything more? You know anger inducing than that they're using our public services, they're, not paying their fare in share in taxes and now they're cutting off our ability to get federal funds. I mean I'm not talking about class warfare, but I will say this: it's my understanding that many of them do not complete the census because they don't want the government to know where their home address is for tax purposes. Now. The truth is the government is not going to know your our colleague here from new york city census. All this information is private, but they've been told by some lawyers that they need to keep their their home addresses private. That's infuriating that they're that they're really going to those links and hurting the rest of us, so we're going to crack down on that with more calls entreaties phone banks, robo calls to get new yorkers and ours, particularly in our district. To answer this to respond to the census, nothing is more important. We could use it we're going to lose out as much as three thousand dollars and in education and job training for every new yorker who doesn't fill out the census couldn't be anything more important. Thank you. So much michael thanks, cb3 see you soon thanks brad. Are there any questions from community board members all right, seeing none? We will move on to our council member margaret chin. You just have to hit the space bar or hit the microphone margaret. Okay, I see your big picture frankie. Thank you, michael just want to say hello to everyone and hope everyone is staying, healthy and safe and well. I know it's not easy working from home and it's we've been so busy and especially, I had to take a little bit time off to recuperate after the budget fight, but I think one thing that is really important in our community. What areas like how we really gonna be able to you know help our small businesses- and you know restaurants, are closing a lot of our favorite stores are closing, but one of the dining out program has been successful, that a lot of restaurants have applied for permit to have outdoor dining and in chinatown we're actually gonna start one with d.o.t, rockwell group and hospitality alliance. To close off, I mean to have a section on mars street that to have outdoor dining and that really nice furniture to make it more attractive- and this is one way hopefully can help some of the small business and the in the restaurant. But we also gotten a lot of complaints from you know. Residents about you know some of the bad actors who don't follow the rules and don't do the social you know, distancing and creating a lot of concern and their enforcement. I think one of the places in the lower east side got their license, legalized and taken away, and I think that we have to punish the bad actors and support the one that are really trying hard to stay in business and support their workers and support the neighborhood. Today, in the city council, we had a stated meeting and I joined with councilmember powers, who is the council member form for the district number four and with borough president on a bill to temporarily repeal the commercial rent tax and that's the tax that the businesses pay on their and, on top of you know, from night south of 96th street to lower Manhattan on murray street, and that includes chinatown on the low east side and you're. Talking about you know, paying close to four percent more tax on your rent so, and this will help businesses who have and your annual rent of up to a million dollars. So that will really help alleviate some more of the burden during this pandemic, and also we just passed a bill last month about supporting small property owner with some property tax relief, because we have a lot of you know: building in the lower east side and chinatown a tenement building and they provide affordable housing and tax bills were due in July and we were able to get the bill passed that to give them the extension to October 15 and one of the things was to lower the penalty of the interest rate. I mean the city still forcing these landlords. If you don't pay your property a tax on time, you got to pay 18 interest, it's ridiculous and we were able to knock it down to 7.5 and that's only the beginning. We still have to continue to find ways to support them because they provide the affordable housing, rent, regulated housing in chinatown in the lower east side, and they need our help. And I know that a lot of you were you know kept on top of what was going with the budget, and it was months of negotiation. A lot of meetings you know, because I'm on the budget, negotiation team and like this was this was so different from the past. I mean we practically have meeting every other days and it's like hours and hours and we were able to pass the budget on July 1st. But you know we actually got the vote on 2 30 midnight. So we could say we passed it on time, but it wasn't an easy row. It was really difficult trying to fight to save safety net programs youth program, because when the preliminary budget came out in the beginning of the year I mean the mayor. The administration did just zero out all the youth program and that was like unconscionable and every social. You know program from our seniors to help program. Every everything was up for cuts and we did manage to save the youth program. At least you know most of it. So there is a summer youth program. We were able to at least put back a hundred. You know almost 115, you know 116 million dollars in our youth program, and I really wanted to thank all the nonprofits in our community that was able to step up and really ready to do this, to provide the services for our young people, and you know providing emergency food, domestic violence, funding all those things that we were able to say, but on the capital budget side, I'm really happy that we were able to provide funding together with councilmember, rivera and speaker to the clemente cultural center, to really put them back on the right track and also we're gonna. You know we also provide a funding for exterior lighting for nature, believe it you know to make it brighter and safer, and we have to provide the funding from the city council to do that, and the rutgers community center is finally going to get a new stow so that they can have hot meal for their youth program. But for our senior it was mainly saving all the north programs that are in our district, and we hope that our senior center will be open soon, because we want to make sure look. It's going to be a new way of serving the seniors, but we just can't you know, keep these centers closed. We have to make sure that they are, you know, participating and providing the good nutritious food that they've been providing all these years and it's got to be a creative way to do that, because you know this emergency food program is not the best and we have you know local nonprofits who are running this center. That can do the job and they should not be left out. So that's one thing that we are you know continue to to advocate for and also you know, making sure that our public schools, you know, have all the resources and whether it's computer whatever so that they can take care of the student and that's still a big question, how school it's going to reopen, but we also got to make sure that they have the resources they need. So I'm happy to answer any questions all right. Thank you. We've got a couple of hands raised. First, michelle cooper smith, hi councilmember, thanks for coming, can you hear me? Yes, okay, great sorry, I've been having trouble with my ipad. Thank you so much for coming tonight and speaking with us, I have a question about the NYPD closing the streets in front of their precincts. I believe that your office has been involved in this. I had asked our DOT representative at our committee meeting a couple of weeks ago about this and didn't get any answers about that. So I was wondering if your office had a chance to follow up on any information requests that you had made about, that are you taught which street closing? Are you talking about? Well, I mean I just walked around the district this weekend. Elizabeth street is closed where the fifth precinct is, and broome is that's not this isn't in your district. This is currently this district, but also broome street, in front of the seventh and on east fifth street in front of the ninth. I think that the only one that I saw in your district was the fifth precinct, though, and the streets very close there, so yeah we'll have to look into it. I don't think that there is no street closing. I mean they actually yesterday, whatever they just closed off part of mod street, to do the setup for a second sorry, I just wanted to drop for a second to clarify so she's, not not asking about the open streets program. What she's talking about is that, since the protest and oh okay, a lot of the precincts have been barricading the blocks that their precinct was on. We've been following up that we, you know, send a letter to the police headquarters and the mayor's office complaining about that, because that's happening all over lower Manhattan. You know with all these the barricades going up we're still waiting for the respond, and I mean this is sort of like some of it. You know they're blaming. You know us for cutting their budget and or passing all these bills reform bill that are so they're not being as cooperative as they should be, but there's something that is something that we are following up on. Okay, thank you. Thank you next question from carl and chan. Yes, hello, hey margaret, I have a question about the lower section of March from moscow to challenge school or nabari. You know with the street seating there is that a closure daily or could yeah. I saw someone with some kind of a sign today. I didn't really. I don't remember it, but it says close. Some certain time is that a daily street closure. It's not a street closure. It's like the outdoor, dining you're, talking about from bay yard yeah, the rock road, the rockwell group thing there. It's not it's not closing the street. It's that they're setting up the outdoor seating so that the restaurant can utilize the space for that and and it's gonna be you know, they're gonna kick off, kick it off tomorrow with a press event, and hopefully that will help. You know the local restaurant to be able to. You know, serve food outside, and you know, with nice furniture with some planting make it more attractive and it's you know we'll try it test it out. It was great. Maybe there are other streets that could do the same thing. So let's try this out and see and see how you know how well it can to help the restaurants in the area. Well, I think I think we can expand that or maybe you can advocate to expand that toward the traditional core of chinatown. Well, let's try. Let's try with this first, you know how china well italians right the outreach you make it you make it successful and then people will want it. So, let's see how this goes. Okay, all right! Our final question for the council members from alicia lewis, coleman, hi, margaret alicia, not a question just saying, thank you again for supporting community board three, and you also and council member rivera for giving us discretionary funds and this very tight budget. So we are so very grateful for everything that you're doing on behalf of community boards. Oh well, the community, but I mean I really appreciate all the community boards and the members. You know you volunteer and you spend so much time you know advocating for the community and you know we have to thank you for all the hard work and you make our work easier. So we love working together with the community boy with susan district manager and all your staff and everyone. So you know that it's a great partnership and we really appreciate that and hope everyone will have a safe and cool summer, stay cool and hopefully, we'll come out of this craziness together, healthier and stronger. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I saw you put your hand up, but I really want to move on. We took three questions for the council member. If you can type it into the chat, maybe she can answer you that way, but I really want to keep the meeting moving. Well wait a minute. I just want to have something very brief. I was very good at my public time. Thank you margaret chin. I just want to thank you for the rutgers community center. I remember during sandy that was a hub. According to my co-workers, I was a nurse I was working, but the social workers came back and said it was great. Thank you for the ruckus community center. Thank you. Thank you pal. Thank you, council member, we'll speak monday at town hall yeah. Thank you all right. I don't think there's any other elected officials on if there are please raise your hand, otherwise we're gonna move on to the reps and the reps. As a reminder, if you can try to keep your reports to two minutes, I'm not gonna put the timer on, but if I feel like you guys are going long, I will put the timer on andrew from mayor bill de blasio's office. Are you on, or is anybody from de blasio's office here how about lyla from public advocates office? All right, then we go to work. Oh lilac, I'm sorry, hi community board, three, I'm life chew. I just recently joined the office of the public africa. I just want to briefly introduce myself. You know to you guys, and maybe, if you have any concerns or issues you can relate them to me and I also work with philip ellison. I don't know if you guys have met him. He's the man, the man borough afghan advocate. He works with that team and if you just have any questions, just please reach out to me I'll, put my stuff into the chat and that's it. Thank you great. Thank you for you replacing lila. I was she the previous first Manhattan liaison. Yes, I I'm assuming so yes, sir okay, so if you can also make sure to email your contact information to our district manager in the office, that would be great. Yes, thank you very much. Luke from the controller's office, hey everyone luke from the comptroller's office. Here I will try to keep this brief in under two minutes. Three quick things I want to touch on from our office. We're really focused on two things right now. First is on the economic side and the reopening the second on schools. On the economic side. This week we came out with an analysis of the paycheck protection program and what we found about new york city's participation is pretty startling. So what we found is that if new york city was a state we'd be 49th out of 50th in terms of the percent of businesses that were able to access the program, specifically in Manhattan, only 52 percent of businesses, which were have employees and were eligible were able to access it. So we need to make sure that we can continue to not only get more federal support, but also that our small businesses can access the programs. What we found was that those numbers were even worse for our mwbe's across the city, which is why today, we are proud that the mayor answered our call to appoint a chief diversity officer in every agency across the city. That's something the comptroller did when he was elected back in 2014 and we've been pushing for ever since. So it's good that the mayor has finally taken that step on the school's front. I know that's something. That's also on everyone's mind, we put out our own set of recommendations around reopening, some of which have been taken up by the DOE, but we still have a number of outstanding complaints and concerns and really want to focus on communication making. Sure students and families know what to expect this fall. So a real four areas of concern are number one around child care. We know this program is not possible if child care is not accessible. So we need some more answers on that number. Two on what are standards for remote learning, specifically making sure there's synchronous live learning options available for children number three. How are we going to make sure we're staffing up our schools and properly training our staff to handle whatever's coming this fall and number four? What are the health protocols specifically around access to nurses and what happens if someone gets sick? So we're continuing to push for answers and to make sure that information gets out sooner rather than later and we'll make sure to keep you all abreast of any updates that we hear. I hope you all have a great august and thank you thank you. Luke appreciate it. Any questions for the comptroller's office, all right, link, shah from newly of blasphemous office, hi, everyone! Well, the congress is back in session and congresswoman velazquez is in dc today and I'll be very brief. Right now you know enough has been said about the hardship the city is. This new york is very hard hit and our local budget there's a huge deficit with our local budget. So we really need more federal funds and then, as we all know, there's a huge battle going on in in dc was was trump the president and the republicans not not wanting to give money to people, but they rather spent money to boost the stock market and and and in new york. Even though we were the, we were the earliest epicenter, but we are not, but we're not the priority for federal coronavirus funding. So that's the you know. That is the main priority the congresswoman is working on is to ensure fighting funding for the home district. So the paycheck protection program that was passed by you know it's people can business can start applying. Now that was passed in the previous coroner's aid package and then the congresswoman's next focus to be to pass the hero act and the extension of the 600 unemployment bonus. Also enough and also on the side of census. New york is doing really bad on the census. We all need to pitch in and remind each other and to to remind people to to register. You know to fill out the census because we could stand to lose a couple of congressional seats after this census. If you know, if the current rate, if a lot of people are not responding to census and at the moment our district office is not yet open, but we can be reached at at 718-539-3650 for any constituent service, and you know we can also be reached by the congresswoman's website, also our emails. Thank you very much any questions all right. Oh carlin, dad, yes, hello, hi, ling. I would like to address something with a congresswoman that last place. Is there any kind of accountability of what you know? The wartime production act was announced by washington of several months ago, but we still have a scarcity of cleaning products, notably my soul and stuff right. What happened to this ramped up production right? It doesn't seem to be hitting consumer shelves. You know it takes for any kind of production. It takes time. But if you have noticed things as a consumer in new york or myself, I have noticed that I mean it's not as good as it was before March, but things are, you know like sanitizers, masks and alcohol. You know wipes they are slowly. Returning to the shelf, I remember back in March there was just no way to buy them, not online, not in the store, then slowly it started, hitting the stores it was rationed and I'm starting to see more and more so it's ongoing. But you know you it it's a it's a time process. We should see more, but should you and where do you see like? Is there any area like that's particularly lacking? Some neighborhoods, like you know some neighborhood stores? That's like you know missing more of it than others. I noticed none of none of my local drug stores, like even a drugstore chains, rite aid, duane reed. I see knock off products on the street. You know on the streets or something, but you know I don't know how safe they are. But you know even ppe's. You know face masks. I don't really see that, as up on tree corners sometimes well face masks have been face, masks, actually I they are sold in the stores now and then. Also this you know, a lot of elected offices are giving them out for free and in fact I was out in sansa park on monday, with volunteers doing census, I mean we gave out free mask to anybody stopping by the table. I think even a lot of also a lot of other census tables. They're. Doing that too I mean, as for I know, some of the brands are different like, for example, I've noticed like costco is, is producing like sanitizing wipes, because I guess you know, because people cannot get enough of the clorox, but but it is just you know, but it works too. I know some of the brands are different these days that it works. We have our final question from our board chair, alicia hi. Thank you ling. My question is for the congresswoman, so hud and section eight developments did not qualify for the Covid-19 19 rental assistance and I was wondering if there was going to be any type of support for affordable housing residents for Covid-19 19. Can you find out for us and get back to our district manager and let us know sure I will yeah I will find out and get back. I see I guess. Maybe the assumption had been that you know in the in NYCHA and the section a when people's income is affected, their rent can be adjusted, but I understand because sometimes the adjustment doesn't happen so fast. Is that what you mean so people need some extra aid yeah, especially when there's households, where only one income was missing. So I don't want to talk individually like excuse me, but I do know that there are residents that have approached me in my own development that have said that. Why don't we qualify for the assistance as well? So I let them know the same thing. You basically just said was that our rents are supposed to be readjusted according to our income, when you lose income, but management doesn't always catch up at the same time, at the rate that it happens, so they end up owing money anyway got it yeah I'll get back to you all right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all right. Thank you. Lane rosie, I'm sorry! I skipped over the borough president's office. Are you here to give a report for gail will be joining us? Okay, so I'll keep going with other people, then? Yes, okay, thank you victor or anybody from kyle and maloney's office siobhani. I see you're on you want to give a report from your lady's office. Please hiya! Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you awesome. So I'll keep it short tonight. It's mostly about legislation, so the biggest one I would say is the introduction of eulene's cancel rent bill. This is a new quote: unquote, cancel rent bill, it's actually called the rent and mortgage cancellation act, and it would provide crucial relief for all residential tenants and small homeowners by canceling rent and mortgage payments. For the due for the duration and thereafter, it would allow for tenants to exercise their right to relief include, including prohibiting fines, fees and termination of tenancy or eviction for non-payment of cancelled rent. This bill also would set up a small relief fund for a relief fund for small property owners and homeowners to ensure that everyone is protected under this bill. So that is new and then the other two things is that eulen's bill, the rivington act was passed in the assembly. As most of you probably know, the rivington house was the country's first nursing home for hiv and aids, people with hiv and aids, and it was shut down due to a backdoor deal and a lot. The community lost that really important resource. So with the rivington act, which was passed through assembly, it strengthens oversight by establishing a transparent process where nursing homes and residential health care facilities are threatened and requires the commissioner of new york state department of health to ensure that, like the local community, has that same resource elsewhere before closing down, so that was passed. An assembly, hopefully it'll, pass in senate soon and then. Finally, the passage of the of a711, which is protection and assistance to debtors, and so it's also passed an assembly and it offers protection and assistance for debtors who have vision, problems such as seniors oftentimes, debt collectors will send debtors. Information, that's intimidating, but also just very small, like text sizes can be up to size, eight, which makes it hard to understand what the next steps are. What needs to be done and it creates this kind of predatory cycle where those people are at risk for getting more in debt, so this would require that debtors who suffer from vision. Impairment would be able to receive clear and conspicuous notice that communications they are receiving can be provided in larger print and request large print formats for further communication. So that's the legislative side of things. Those are our biggest updates. Also, I just want to say we're continuing to do. Ppe distribution work on unemployment cases, so if anyone needs any help with that, please feel free to contact our office. I'll, put my contact in the little sidebar here also, we are still doing our newsletter. We are doing it mondays, wednesdays and fridays. So if you are interested in signing up for that, send me an email at my email that I'll leave in the little chat box- and I can add you onto that list unless there's any questions, I think that's it for me, we have a question for you from jackie wong go ahead, jackie! Yes, I'm just wondering: where can we find out more details of the cancer ram? Build? Is that already online? Or can you email us the details of it yeah? It is online, but I can also definitely send you some more information or get in contact with you. If you want to email. My provided email address that I'll put in a little chat box feel free to do that, and we can talk about it more later. Great. Thank you samani. Thank you. Any other questions. All right, deborah glick's office, I believe, is not with us tonight. If they are just raise your hand, star nine, if you're on the phone raise your hand all right, so we're gonna move on to grier from brian cavanaugh's office, hello, everyone! This is girl from senator brian cavanaugh's office. I have quite a few updates for you guys just a reminder that thursday July 30th is the deadline to apply for the emergency rent relief program. This is a one-time subsidy for folks. Who've demonstrated that they have lost income due to Covid-19 19. It is, there are multi-lingual applications online. So please don't forget to fill that out. The senator believes that this is only the beginning and that he is looking for the next round of federal funding that will help provide more subsidies for folks who are in need also in regards to fair housing. President trump last week rescinded an obama-era hud rule requiring all localities receiving federal funding for housing and community development to do so in a manner that affirmatively further fair housing in the state. Senator brian cavanaugh introduced a state level obligation to affirmatively further for housing to step in where the federal government has not and that's oh, that's it for the alleged part. So some community updates our office has been diligently working on the advisory committee with other elected officials and community stakeholders in regards to 70 mulberry. We're currently working with dcas to select the vendor, who will facilitate the community engagement process. We have been receiving correspondence about different values that are needed to be highlighted in the proposal. We will. We encourage people to let us know about their thoughts on the project, and we will continue to do everything we can to make the process as equitable and accessible as possible. Last week, our office, along with other elected officials, offices and community board, three along with parks and NYPD, were at a meeting regarding pier 35 to discuss growing concerns there in regards to maintenance issues and other listed activities. In regards to that, our office has reached out to city hall regarding the big belly litter baskets that were promised and advocacy regarding the dsny trucks on pier 36 and 42.. In our last correspondence, they said it would be installed in July, but due to Covid-19 it was to be extended, so we're trying to get information on that, and that is all if you would like to contact me. My phone number is 212 298 5565, and you can also email me I'll put my email in the group chat. Thank you career. Are there any questions for senator cavanaugh's office right we've got one more rep and then we're going to move on to our borough president who just joined us so isabel chandler from councilmember rivera's office good evening everyone. I will try to be brief. A few updates for you this evening. First, we council, member carlina rivera she released an op-ed on voting. Many constituents neighbors reached up to our office, who had really difficult experiences in the most recent election, and we are meeting with BOE to make sure november is a better experience for voters and, while we're very happy that albany passed, some items that will be kicking in 2023 carlina believes that BOE needs to take as many steps as possible in the short term as well. We are also still trying to get books around in the neighborhood you can stop by or if you have anyone who's interested can stop by at our office, monday or wednesday, between 12 and 2 p.m, and we'll also be doing giveaways throughout the neighborhood. As long as we have books, they're, really wonderful books, pre-k to high school and michael. Thank you so much for sharing information about the town hall on monday, but we're very excited to be partnering with cd3 and councilmember chin to share more about worker and consumer rights. So we hope to see many of you there. Thank you so much any questions. Any questions for council member revere's office all right, we're going to move on to our borough president gail brewer gayle. Is there an earthquake not working, so I'm just surviving with my cell phone. Thank you very much I'll be a couple of things. First of all, the schools. I know that that's the number one issue for a lot of parents, certainly for me, so I think they should not open I'll, be very clear and maybe for elementary, but custodians aren't ready. Hb ac is not ready, can't open the windows, you can't necessarily change the filter and then air conditioning and it works et cetera, et cetera and teachers aren't coming back. So I would suggest we need to work on figuring out how to improve the schools during this time period virtually and then only be in school, for particular special events, maybe art etc. That's my take on it. I think that's what's going to happen, but what do I know? But please, let's look for other spaces, even though it may not be. You know relevant. We still need to find other spaces for students to meet, and maybe we can get some tents, I'm literally searching for tents, so that you could put an outdoor tent that might even work for elementary schools and other special events number two affordable housing, something that community board three is incredibly expert on. So what we're doing is we're talking to every affordable housing expert I can think of and at least having a listing as to what needs to get done. We did this seven years ago and I just feel like we're falling way behind on this topic, so we will be working with the community boards and others to at least have. This is what needs to get done. I'm swamped and susan stetcher is always helpful with every homeless, hotel and encampment, just like you are, and it's it's almost full time to figure out how to be supportive, but at the same time, businesses and residents are very concerned on all fronts. So I'll leave it at that, but it is not where it should be. Another issue that has come up is just you know that all the litter bag baskets on sunday, cancelled and 65 of the weekday service and sanitation doesn't exist. That's a lot of garbage on the streets and where there's no chamber no garbage, pickup and certainly challenging. So I wish that would be reinstated at the same time no organics pick up so in new york university and a group of solid waste advisory board members and others are going to spend and they have the funding from foundations to do this one year. Looking to see what we can do to make organics profitable, otherwise it's going right to the landfill, which makes no sense. It could all go to composting. So if you want to be involved with that, let us know also on that front. Our waste, as you know, goes to the 14 sewage treatment plants in the city of new york and guess what if we had the lab, and if we had three people to analyze it and a couple of machines which we're working to put in place, then we would know six days in advance, not just when cobit 19 was a hot spot, but any virus. It is almost 100 accurate, so we're working to make that happen. We're also we've always been focused on accessibility, and now we focus on the pedestrian ramps and we look mostly on broadway to see whether they are installed broken in good shape, etc. So a lot of them are not in great shape. We just did a study on that, but, just generally, we need to focus, as you know, more on accessibility, not in your area, but in board one. There is a mural on the floor on the ground from reed street to worth on center along foley square, and I know there's great murals that black lives matter, but three amazing black artists recommended by the department of cultural affairs put it together. It got a new york times, excellent review, it's been in every architectural magazine and I hope you have a chance to go see it. Even though there are cars on it, you can still do the amazing art I wanted to follow up. We are working on 70 mulberry street. I think I know there are many positions on board three, I'm aware of that, and there are many positions in the community, and so we will take them all seriously and have a process but very transparent and everybody's welcome. I hope that we can come up with something quickly, because I know it's a great interest in business, non-profit, community everybody, small business is so challenging. I don't need to tell you, but let us know if there's something we can do. We have walk-arounds today, on the lower east side, we did walk-arounds in chinatown, we've done walk-arounds uptown, downtown midtown, trying to get everybody to have some support. One of the issues is a lot of small businesses are not applying for money, and there is another ppp coming forth from the feds with they need help. Pace university is a great resource. It's almost like you should tell every single small business to work with pace give them the number. You can also work with sbs, but pace is more hands-on and we walked around today. Maybe talking to I don't know, 30 25 businesses and most of them had either applied and didn't hear or had not applied. You all know about the census. I know you're tired of it. We about fortune cookies. I think 32 000 are going to be distributed with food chinese food around the metropolitan area, thanks to a generous contributor, but we're not in great shape, and I think you know that there's a great map, it's called census, hard to count my favorite map in the whole world. You can put your address in it'll. Tell you exactly what the percentage is on your block, it's very exciting, but you won't like the numbers when you see them, it could also tell you what the number of percentage was 10 years ago and then, just as you know, pier 35 we're all working together. Thank you trevor and thank everyone. Who's been focused to try to get it safe. I know we've been working with parks on that, maybe closing it at night. You know better than I know we worked on the avenue b, open street closure issue, and I know that in terms of the park and the scr they don't, they meaning the city doesn't seem to want to do infant blood interim blood protection measures. They don't think it's possible and I don't know what to do about it, because I know that's something. That's really important to the community. The city feels that the NYCHA buildings are 17 and they have their of the area and they have their own resiliency projects, but I'm glad to keep talking about it. If you wish. Thank you very much cb3 for everything. Thank you. Gail we've got a couple of questions for you. First, we'll start with robin chatel: hi robin hi gail nice. To see you thanks for all of your incredible work. I wanted to ask you made a comment about schools, of course, as a parent, I'm interested. If do you think if they were to open, you think would it be? It would have to be either all or nothing if it's city-wide, if one school is prepared to open, oh versus another school, would that be? Do you think that might be a possibility or again? Is it all or nothing? I think I mean I would love Manhattan to do our own thing. I've been talking to the executive superintendent. I do think that we need to be. I think it's all or nothing or all of them will be virtual, but when it's virtual, I'm hoping we can do something innovative. Let me give an example: we have you know pop spaces. We have spaces where there could be art this or using the school for very special projects, so we're not just secluded in our homes. So I think that we have to be innovative and think way outside the box. I am concerned because teachers are not coming back from all the principles I talk to and they have reasons and they're legitimate and we can't do anything about it and then you have you know the custodians are terrific, but if they don't have the right system for the air and the window doesn't open and the filter doesn't change the the challenge of the air in the air conditioner. I don't, I think, that's a problem, so that's where we're at. Thank you. Our next question is from michelle cooper smith, michelle hi gail, thanks for being here tonight. I apologize to everyone. Who's already heard this question, but I'm going to ask it again. I know that you have spoken out against NYPD barricading the streets in front of their precincts and I'm wondering if you've had any update on. What's going on there. I took a little tour of our district over the weekend and every 5th 7th and 9th they're still doing it more or less thanks. I appreciate it. We are going to look at the whole borough because, unfortunately, it's not just in your area, it's pretty much on every precinct and we're going to take pictures and make a little bit of a stink about it. The only way I know how to do it so your info, we may be in touch, but it's everywhere, yeah happy to send you anything that I have. We would love it. Thank you any other questions for our borough. President. All right, thank you! Everyone! So we're going to move on now to our roll call and approval of our minutes from the may 2020 meeting after roll call.

Thank you! Okay! Thank you! So much michelle. Thank you! Everyone! I have to move in the agenda. If michael can be so kind as to pull up the agenda, we have to move up in the agenda because we have a special guest. That's here to talk about avenue, b and street closures. Captain malloy of fdny is here tonight and I really wanted him to speak because I know he had. He has another engagement. He has to leave very soon. So let's go to transportation committee good evening. This is captain malloy good evening, captain malloy. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. It's my pleasure, I'm here to assist in any way. I can okay, so alicia, I don't know okay I'll, just I'm just here to answer questions. So just if you could just approach me with questions I'll, be happy to answer any questions and then I'll also give the fire department's opinion. Thank you paul sure. Thank you, alicia for allowing us to move up today in the agenda. I'm captain malloy, thank you for coming on today. I know on short notice and you have to get out of here. Sooner than later, we understand that the fdny presented the office with a list of potential concerns. Following our committee meeting two weeks ago, with the closure on avenue b, could you answer the about response times? I know there was some stats given to us. Could you talk to us about recent response times and delays in those response times? Yes, I can, and I just want to make a clarity on response times and delayed in response, so we have a gis unit and they track all of our responses. From the moment the alarm comes in until what we call is a 1084.. A 1084 is the first unit who presses his button. That or that says I'm here, I'm at the box or I've arrived and that's when the clock stops ticking. So it's my estimation that response times don't really show the true picture of what happens to a fire service. From the moment the alarm comes in until the fire company is on the fire floor or on the exact spot where the emergency is occurring. But I will tell you this: we have experienced delays in responses and, in particular, is avenue b we're looking at this the whole city, but in particular avenue b, because our company, our fire company, that responds along avenue b, is engine 28 and ladder 11. they're on 2nd street, located between c and b. So what happens is when they respond they'll, head up east and then they'll try to turn north on avenue b when they they're met at sixth street with the barricades. So what happens at that point is one of the firefighters has to get off of the rig move, the barricades the fire truck has to move forward and then the last fire truck passed. What another member gets off. The fire truck puts the barricades back and then they continue their response. So what this is creating is that and I'm gonna have to speak in, and I would be apt to speak environment term, but I can't, but this is what I will tell you. If one company is expected to come in first, they have a list of assignments that they must do because they're coming in as the first fire company now, if this sequence gets reversed, if the first company arrives. Second, there creates this mass confusion and it really makes our operation very difficult. This is what has been happening, particularly in avenue b. We have two fire companies responding to alarms, but they're arriving out of sequence, primarily because of the barricade that exists crossing sixth street along avenue b, so as a whole, the fire department does not like to see streets that are closed. We are understanding and we encourage what's happening due to Covid-19, but we are looking for concessions that will make our responses fluid, meaning that we do not have to get off the fire truck, get back on the fire truck while we're responding. So I hope I'm kind of clear on just preliminary what's happening to the fire department due to closing these streets is that is that kind of a good opening to help you understand where the fire department is with these street closers. That does help alicia, I'm going to ask for your help on this says you're. The chair. Am I just going straight into this? Am I going to go straight into my committee report? Basically with him yeah, you can go right on ahead with your committee report. Thank you so much paul and yeah. I have a question and I can't write with my name because I'm a host, but I did just want to clarify one thing he was speaking. Captain malloy was speaking about the barricades at sixth street more recently starting last week, they're now closing at its second street between second and third, which causes a huge problem, because the fire department could go anywhere north, at least. If it's at six they can go some direction, but when they're closed at second street, they have to go either move the barricades and move people, because there's people crowded in the street now or they have to continue over to avenue a and go the whole way around, which either way is probably adding several minutes to their time. So it's not just 6th street they're, now closing it at 2nd street. Now I could, I could speak on. I could speak on that very briefly, and then you could continue. So we came up with some solutions and I don't know if they've been disseminated or not number one. We requested from DOT if possible, avenue or second street could be reversed. This way, instead of responding west, the fire company could respond east and they won't even have to encounter avenue b or there's another idea where there's d.o.t has flexible delineators. These are these plastic sticks that they put into the ground, which would deter traffic, but our fire apparatus can respond over them and then they would pop back up now over time. D.O.T would have to replace them, so it would take a little maintenance and another idea we had was to have like security people posted at these intersections. So when they do see a fire truck respond, they could get up, move the barricade and move it back. We understand this is all resources. These are money. These are personnels, but these are some of the solutions so mentioning the intersection of second street and b versus sixth street. These are two separate conversations under the same umbrella of a problem, but there are some solutions we came up with. Is there any other questions? You said there was some solutions you came up with. I understand that 2nd street going west is actually kind of impossible due to the construction on avenue, c and 2nd street. Is that correct? Well, I spoke to the battalion commander today and he said no. He said yes, it does get tight over there, but he informed me that if you, if second, was reversed, it would shave off some time and it would help the fdny respond quicker in to that area. So the construction project is a concern, but I think a greater concern is having barricades blocking the intersection of second and b. So I believe, I believe, our resolution that we voted on. That committee asked for the second street reversal, but we this is the first time we heard about the delineators as a potential option. So that's something that you would like to see. Potentially we would like to see it. I don't think d.o.t will be in favor of it only because it requires a lot of maintenance, two or three times over those delineators or I don't know exactly, but a number time over those delineators they're going to be knocked over. I believe there's a lot of maintenance involved with those delineators, but yes it would. It would be a fix for us. Paul. You've got another hand raise from david adams, sure yeah hi. I don't disagree with anything about the resolution, except for the fact. We're not don't have a definite plan yet and I don't whatever they implement be fine. I just hope, but I think that we should revisit the issue six months after to see that it's working out right and that it's not too upsetting. I just a small remember that six months after the plan was implemented, that we give the community an opportunity to respond to what's happened. Well, I would my opinion on that is the delineators. If this continues or if this social streets goes away, then you could remove the delineators pretty easily as far as the reversal. Okay, sorry I mean I I'm just subs. I know we, usually we get public input into what we're planning to do we're not getting any, because we don't know exactly what's going to happen. I just want to be able to make sure the public has a risk time to respond after six months or so to see if it goes away. It goes away then, and really won't be any much of a response. Yeah and you know I see d.o.t doing a lot of street reversals throughout all five boroughs and as far as like fluidity of the grid, I think in Manhattan. You could kind of just forget that idea, because the grit, the grid is, I'm not saying I'm not saying any particular plan whatever is implemented. I just think we may not understand the unten tension consequences of what happens so, and I just hope that you know there aren't any and they'll be continue. The way it's best for you, but I think we should have an opportunity, a planned opportunity for people to respond if there isn't we're happy to evaluate it and we take any feedback- and I mean we're happy to just sit down with anybody and discuss what their, what the effects are of these ideas. I'm just saying give six months with the work and then see what happens. I want to plan it because if people don't know that there's a place to respond, they may not. I just want to have something that said in the on our agenda that we can cover we'll. Have it an opportunity to respond? That's all: okay, paul and alicia. I'm not sure how you want to run this. If you want to take each question- and I can't I can't see- raised hands michael, can you see raised so trevor and david crane both have their hands raised right now? Okay, I think trevor has his hand up. First, oh paul, I can see hands. Okay, thank you captain for attending and explaining the difference in response times. I wasn't aware of that, and I think that's important well. Go ahead, I'm sorry what I did not hear from you and what I think is important, because I did hear four speakers in the beginning talk about the pleasure of having these streets open. But my concern is that we're really talking about lies when you talk about seconds and minutes, maybe five or six minutes. Can you tell us how important these seconds, or these minutes are for saving people's lives, because I'm a little concerned that we're hearing everyone talking about the fact of walking the streets? But if you, if you encounter a crowded street where you have to remove barriers and put them back in that's minutes that could be someone's life yeah now there are. There are fire models right about growth of fire and how a fire expands, how rapidly a fire can expand. This is science, but I would tell you that 15 seconds of a fire, it will go from one room on fire and then in 15 in 15 seconds that one room of fire could extend to two rooms of fire and that's how quickly it will go depending on what contents are inside burning. So that's just to give you a rough idea, yes mere seconds matter and as far as lives. If somebody is breathing in poisonous noxious fumes, they have a matter of we have seconds to get if you're breathing in noxious fumes for 30 seconds. That's the threshold where your life is in jeopardy, past 30 seconds. So if we get to somebody at 22 seconds as opposed to 32 seconds you're talking about somebody surviving or somebody expiring, so that's how critical seconds are for us, and I mean I could talk all day and I could go into you have to reece houses and I think they're called the lillian walt houses in the area which are NYCHA houses, and we respond quite frequently to these houses. Anytime. You respond to these fire proof buildings. This is what's known as a fire proof building. What happens is they're built so well that the fire is contained inside of them there's nowhere for the fire to exit there's nowhere for the superheated gases to go. These buildings become like ovens. When there's fires we run into multiple problems such as elevators, not working. All sorts of hazards occur. So, just to sum it up, 10 seconds could be life or death in the fire service. Thank you. Okay, david crane, no david. I thought I saw his hand up michelle thanks paul. Thank you, captain moye for coming, and I just wanted to ask you, because I'm not sure if you had a chance or you saw the resolution that we passed in our committee, because we had a couple of proposed solutions that we developed in conjunction with with with another rep from fdmy. So I just wanted to make sure that if you thought that any of these were unworkable, one was reversing second street, which paul already mentioned. One was creating a dedicated first responder northbound lane. I think paul everything about removing the east 4th street because of problems there and then the other one would be to create some sort of solution where there would be no barriers on avenue b so that there wouldn't be impediments. So I'm just hoping that you could give us some guidance there. If you think that those would be workable solutions. Thank you know. I apologize. I did not review this. The resolutions my office is much more than just these social streets, but I am technically the expert here, but we have an incredible workload and we are short staffed. As everybody knows, in the city, resources are at a pre premium, so I I've heard what you said of I don't know how many resolutions were put forth. I I've heard what you said. I like the imp you're talking about making some type of obstruction along avenue b instead of barricades. That sounds like a good idea and if that's what you are proposing, we would just talk about what type of widths we would need to say in front of police blocks. Maybe that's something you're talking about and that's something we would definitely be open to yeah we're talking about. Maybe leaving one lane closed for pedestrians and one lane open for first responders, like the northbound lanes, you could just make that right onto b and go straight up and make the same right onto tenth that they used to before. All of this, that was one of our proposed solutions. Yeah. That would be great. We could talk with. I would just say off: the t on the table: 15 feet sounds like a good width. If you could provide that- and I would just say how would you do, how would you deter civilian vehicles? Are you talking? Fines are because anywhere there's an opening for large enough for a car in this city. In my experience, the car is going to go down there. So how are you deterring the civilian vehicles from that right? I would suggest confront you, could post signs about fines or or have somebody posted there or, if you think, just keeping 15 feet wide, open and bright signs saying this is emergency response only maybe that'll be effective. Also well in my ideal world we'd paint the street, but I doubt DOT would go for that, so they might. They might we've done that before in the past with them, I see robin oh yeah, hi thanks. I just want to follow up on what michelle just said. You know the fire lane idea, which I know most street festivals- have to keep on. So that seems like the simplest solution and but I also had a question about the trap: the parked cars on avenue b- and I don't know if this could be added some friendly resolution to add that those stretch of blocks don't have any parked cars, which would also create more room for both pedestrians if you're going to do a pedestrian and an emergency access lane. So that would be something well. We like this. The fire department likes the sound of that, but I know in my experience that's going to be a heavy lift for in the community to get rid of parking, as we know it's at a premium, so anything that you could give us drivable real estate for we'll agree to so I mean I may be. Are there any other further resolutions that maybe I should be made aware of right now? I mean, I think we pretty much covered everything that is possible as far as you know, simultaneously keeping this thing open and providing proper access for the fire department. Well, I think that's why we wanted to ask you what was your potential ideas of what you would like to see happen for that firehouse on avenue b, like that's where we like? What are the things you wanted? The fire department wish list. The wish list first would be reverse second street. That would be the best for them and I'm vaguely familiar with their response patterns as far as the clusters of way they respond to most and where they go to most. This is unofficial. This is not official numbers, but just in my experience because I work down there, they respond along the fdr to the reef houses and to the lillian walt houses. That's a large number of their responses. So, and that's really, this closure is really disrupting that response route. So, yes, so avid you see, reversing is first, the delineators is second and then, if you could make up some kind of barricades block signage, that would be third, so just to be clear, you wouldn't want any streets to be reopened up like six, a tenth or anything like that. Well, in a perfect world, yes, but under the circumstances, no, we understand the efficiency and effectiveness of these streets, so we encourage them to be closed, but then we also have to make everybody aware of the obstruction they're creating as we try to respond and try to fight fires at emergencies. So there's the answer to that. Okay, thank you. There's the there's, a political answer for that one. Thank you. I think the last question I'll take is carolyn. Okay. I just wanted to make a comment. At one of my neighbors who's, a mother of three small children was hit by a car speeding down avenue b when she had the light, because people came off the williamsburg bridge and used clinton street and avenue b as a freeway. So having the street closed in portions has been a godsend for our neighborhood, particularly with people with small children trying to cross the street to get to tompkins square park to the playgrounds, so anything that could be done to facilitate safety. For both I mean, I understand the need for the fire department and if a resolution could be worked out so that section between 6th and 10th street could remain open to pedestrians, because we have so many small children here in the neighborhood. You know ginny was out of work for months because well there are, there are traffic. There are traffic, calming measures that wouldn't require closing the street like speed bumps, I don't know. Are there a lot of speed bumps down avenue b? But if your goal is to slow traffic down, so that's a measure that you could suggest as a resolution to install speed bumps along avenue b that would slow traffic down it's better if there could be a way that at least one lane could be. You know closed for pedestrians for use and stuff, because it's made a huge difference in our neighborhood to have people have access to the street in terms of safety david. You want to jump in, let's see at your back. Yes, I am back I'm so sorry, my computer battery went dead and then it rebooted and I just got back okay, I'm very concerned I want. I want. Okay, I'm just going to speak for a while, I'm very concerned about public safety. Now I actually don't think that going down 6th street is a safe way for the fire engine to go. There are the speed bumps along sixth street, make it they really do have to stop. I have actually been looking up avenue b. I live at six and b just a little bit toward a and I've never seen people using avenue, b next to tompkins square park, while it's in an open street mode. It's desirable at my corner to go around the street because there is a. There is a choke point of about four foot. You know sidewalk width, but even there people are not using it. They'd never use it before 10 am. I always walk my dog now I'm starting to go out in the afternoon and look and I'll look north and see a few bikes along avenue, b and south. The fact is, the sidewalks are not too narrow along avenue b, especially next to tompkins square park. There are only restaurants on the one block between 6th and 7th. I don't think people use the street because it doesn't feel safe, even though it is blocked off they will on in other locations, but they're not doing it there. So I don't think that there's a trade-off here. I think we must deal with public safety, and I and I talked first so I really am not supposed to be making an amendment here and I won't, but I would like to offer amendment if I could speak a second time just to put public safety to make it clear that public safety is first and that if they cannot, if they cannot come up with a safe way to get the fire engines to go up avenue b from 6th street to 10th street, then we do support removing the open street designation for that stretch of avenue b. On the other hand, if they can do it, then we wanted to try to do the whole length of avenue b with the safer treatment and I'm going to stop. Now I have the amendment ready to go, but I'll make it next time I get to speak. Okay, let me just let me just add to that. Let me just add to that, so the fire department is the le. The worst case scenario for the fire department is to remove this, because we want to work in partnership with all the agencies and with the board to make new york city a safe and friendly environment for people to exist in so the last resort is to remove it. We're I'm on the phone to come up with a solution where you can keep it open, but at the same time, keep a lane open for the fire department to use that we're not obstructed. So that's my purpose for being on the call, so I think there are other measures that can be taken before we have to get to the worst case scenario, which is removing it from the program, and I think I put forth and everybody's kind of come up with good solutions here that we can still provide a fire access lane, while keeping this area closed. Well, that's encouraging you here. Thank you. Thank you. Clinton. You had your hand up before yeah. Just I just want clarification. The flexible delineators won't work at second street because at the moment, second street is only closed from friday until sunday, it's not a full week. Closure like the north part of avenue, and the only other thing, just as a compromise, to add to the northbound emergency lane. I know it might be hard to keep regular cars off it. What about? If we just kept one northbound lane open for all traffic, whether it be fire emergency vehicles or northbound cars and kept one, then I guess what would be the southbound lane permanently closed for the entire week? That way, there would still be one northbound access open at all times and there would still be a partial street closure that would give some more open space, but so does that mean that now avenue b is just a one-way, traveling north and no movement south? That's what you're saying yes! Are there, there's no buses on avenue b? Is that correct, there's no bus routes? There are no bus routes on avenue b. No, I mean that that's a possibility, that's a possibility. Robin I see yeah. I think my one concern about that. Clint is that if you have one lane as pedestrians and you've got one lane, that's got traffic heading north and you need a fire truck to come through quickly. Where do those cars go? How do they? Where do they go to move out of the way you know of the emergency vehicles? I wonder if there's gonna be a combination where you have one lane closed for pedestrians and those flexible barricades that you talk about, can be put on the on them and just making an emergency lane so that cars would be deterred from going on there at all. I don't mean to interrupt, although I am interrupting, but I just want to suggest that, because we only have them for a limited time that if we can focus on questions specifically for the fire department right now, rather than a back and forth debate among the members, I think that would be most helpful because I believe the captain needs to leave us in about five minutes. Okay, I direct my question to him if he thinks that would be workable, if traffic is also on the avenue and when fire trucks trying to get through, you know I would like to like analyze that scenario. I don't want to give an answer right now, because I'd have to see what the parking restrictions are. I would have to talk to the local units, get a feel. I mean I did work down there, so I have a fair enough idea, but I would like to get a better feel of avenue b as far as day in day out to hear what I would love to run it by the battalion commander of battalion 4. Before I make any kind of statement, thank you. I would suggest that if anybody wants to miss, stetzer has my email. So if anybody wants to put some kind of ideas together, proposals together, email them to me and then I'll take a look at them, I'll analyze them I'll, bring them to the chain up the chain of command to who needs to make the final decision, and then we could bring it back and discuss it again. Well, I see carolyn has her hand up yeah is it for the fire for the fdi yeah? Yes, it is first and foremost, I use the open street to go to 12th street to the community garden there, and there are people that are using it. They're bicyclists their mothers with carriages. When I go to the garden in the morning, okay, the other thing is that avenue b is one way: it's only northbound traffic period. So if you're talking about saving one lane for pedestrians, the air, the section that I'm in the it runs from houston street to 14th street it's one way avenue b is two whales. Avenue b's two ways really, because the cars are all part going north carolyn. Is there a specific question that you have for? I just think it's important that if there was some way of preserving one lane going for pedestrians, that would be really important for the neighborhood okay. So thank you so much. If that's all questions tonight, paul any other comment, I guess we can pull up that resolution. Yeah pull up the resolution, I'm sorry yeah! Okay! So michael, can you pull up the resolution? Thank you all right. Well, I have to sign off. I want to thank everybody for the time and much yes. Thank you and miss stepson could be the point person in anything you have for me. You could run it through her and I'll be happy to discuss any type of proposals to make this work for the city. Thank you, I'm so alicia. Michelle is now sharing her screen, so she can edit as needed as the secretary okay. Great. Thank you so much david. You have david. I have something you need to say and I should just say that the track changes that everyone's seen are just things that we were talking about, maybe adding when we heard that this is going to be happening, so they have not been added yet okay, I am back yes. I would like to amend this resolution down in the whereases. It's just going to emphasize that public safety is a priority, but we can then talk about it after I get it. Oh my gosh I, this is terrible. My windows are crazy. The thing is that this zoo window keeps going full screen. When you there we go now. I can share with another dang window so down in the resolved clauses. If you can scroll those up see that further resolved the first further resolve there. If you scroll much more you're going to get rid of it, I would like to put another further resolved above that, and it would say above it yeah and I got the text that I could cut and paste into a it who's. Dealing with this word document david, I might already have it- is it this yeah would go. It would be above that, okay, so that would go as the first one here there you go. Okay, so that is my amendment is to add that first result, if those options aren't feasible or won't, give fn fdny quicker access to avenue d, the city should remove the open strategy, installation on avenue b from east 60 to 10th street and the open restaurants designation for having to be between okay, someone had modified it after I sent it, but that's fine because I hear that's problematic and the open restaurants designation revenue b between second and third street in order to protect public safety by providing for efficient and timely response, we have dny units in the area. The next clause will still exist. I would actually like to change the that, while considering these options, to say just to clarify that to say that if those options are feasible and will give fdny and will protect public safety, it will protect public safety. Instead of give that why, I would say, and we'll protect public safety, we don't need to put the whole same long clause and then delete while considering those options is what I would like to have happen or that that's good the way he wrote it that, if they're feasible, that they should consider whether you know extending a long avenue. I actually made that amendment at committee that we would actually wow if they can make it safe from 6th to 10th. Let's do the whole avenue like it had originally been desired. I just want us to now debate whether we should include this further resolved in this clarifying language, so that our first priority would be evident that look it's public safety. If they really cannot come up with a solution, that's safe, we would. We would prefer that they get rid of the open streets designation there. I don't want it to go another month, because I really think it's a bad situation over on anywhere east of the park is a bad situation, but you understand that we've got like 24 story buildings, I believe over on avenue d, and if there were to be a disaster, it would be a disaster if there were a fire, and we know that the local firehouse is arriving to the scene. Second, whereas they ordinarily operate arrive first, so it is definitely the open streets thing has as it's solved has increased response time, and I think that that's a dangerous thing, if they're still unsure that they can fix it. I want us to put this clause in here so that they don't waste a lot of time. If they decide they cannot fix the route that they have now with open streets there. Now they can't make it cozies in a safe way. I want the board on record that we would prefer to they cut the open streets out. I'm done! Thank you, david okay, I saw lee had his hand up. Did you see that paul? Okay? I would agree with david. I think the paramount concern here is public safety and it has to be in the hands of fdny, making the ultimate determination. That's it thanks lee, you just scroll up a little bit. Do we have to david? Do we have to adopt this portion right now? Sorry, there's a noise in the background. Okay, we should debate. I was or whether we want to insert this or not, because I'm sure that there would be debate, but we should focus on. Should we approve of this edition or not. So that's what I would recommend doing that and then we vote on this amendment. Then we're back to discussing the larger motion, I'm personally, I'm personally fine with that amendment. I think the easiest way to do this might be just to ask if you know, if there's anybody opposed to adding this language to the resolution, can you please raise your hand and make a comment as to why you oppose this being added? There are no hands being raised, so in that my mind, this then gets added michael clinton raising my hand. So I so here's my question: I'm not 100 opposed to it. My only question is this: basically just giving them an out from what we're already saying in the resolution and that's a question more. For you know david crane or paul. I was going to take it as a rhetorical question. I don't think it does. I think it's clear that we're saying we you know- and I do want the open streets to remain, but I don't want them to you see what's going on is there's something wrong between DOT and fdny right now. This thing came very quickly. In fact, they installed it before they even came to the community board the avenue b stretch: okay, it went in super fast. Was there adequate planning? I have to believe that there was not at this point. We are now. You know well over a month we're almost two months into the installation. There was you know, struggles happening before the committee met, which was two weeks ago, and it's still the city has not yet figured this out. It does lead you to believe that there actually is not a good solution and I want the struggling to stop so I really do want to provide them this. Is it providing them an out? I don't think it does. Someone else might yeah. I think when we were at committee. We our whole purpose was to make sure if the ny dlt started talking because they weren't talking at all about any of this and then during when DOT presented it. We talked about second and third street potentially being closed and they went and closed it anyway, like a day or two later yeah, so it kind of just blew up right in our face, so I think we needed. We need to strengthen this right now. I don't know if it's giving them an out, but you know even the restaurants between third and fourth are trying to apply for the open restaurant. That's the designation right now as well. So it's about to take up all of avenue and that's going to really hurt fdny and any other first responder. I will tell you that d.o.t is very in favor of keeping open streets open, so I don't think that it is giving them out because actually they're the ones who would have to make that decision and it's not like they're itching to get rid of open streets. Quite the contrary, michelle. Oh you guys already said it's like been a clincher, so you know like they've. Just DOT has literally not been listening to anything that can, like has been said by fdny. So I think that's why adding this would be important. True I and that's, but that's my point. If yeah I don't, we don't need to belabor it anymore, but I agree with you exactly. I think that's, but I just yeah go ahead. That's fine robin! Well! I just wanted to. I was trying to make sure you know. I found it though, at the last. Therefore, it talks about resolving this without delay. I was wondering about the timing of this. You know. That's all. I think I think that's been solved, but I did want to also I made my pointer added. I don't know if I could add a friendly amendment to the fourth street comment about no parking and also adding to that. I would like to add a friendly change to say: where is that line about the traffic it's somewhere? Oh, yes, moving parking on these fourth street. I would. I would like to extend that to remove parking on east forestry and an avenue b between you know second and tenth streets on the on the east side. If that's the side of the street that the fire department we want to make this into the emergency lane paul, I think we're still debating the original amendment from david right, not a new one. Yeah then there's hands raised in terms of debating dave's amendment michael we good, or are we still debating you're still debating at this point? I would take val's hand and then ask the question again and at that point, if nobody wants to debate anymore, if everyone's fine and agrees, then it can be accepted and inserted. So we have to do that first and then come back to add anything else. Is that what you're saying yes, we have to do one addition at a time. Yes, thank you, valentina yeah! Well, I'm for this, because all I can think about is that if we don't do this and we don't do something the way that this the way that change would happen would probably be somebody's life that that's how change would happen. If we don't do this, then change will happen when fdmy does not show up on time or somebody dies, or somebody has some respiratory problems from inhaling some noxious gas because it took them, however, long to get there. So you know, I just think that this to me is just this is about life. This is about health. This is and the whole reason this all came up is about life and health. So I think if we don't do this, then life and health is what's going to be the determining factor, and I just think that that's absolutely terrible because he basically said that most of this is going to be over in jacob reese and lillian wall, where you have a majority of poor black and latino people, which I think is totally disgusting. If we don't do this. Thank you. Thank you. I think that's, who is that that's right, so there's no other hands raised. So I guess I'll. Just ask the question again. If there's anybody opposed to this language being inserted into the resolution, please raise your hand okay, so it looks good, but yeah, that's good. So now we can move on to any other proposed language yeah. So can I add my. I would like to propose to add to the resolution that talks about removing parking on east fourth street, to also add to moomoo parking east fourth street, as well as having to be between sixth and tenth street on the lane. That would be the fire lane or whatever you want to call it the emergency access lane or that whole stretch of it. I guess the northbound right. Someone can please help me so at the moment, parking is already suspended from thursday through saturday on the evenings. When this starts on friday. The second street to third street is closed, starting on friday. The current parking regulations on that side start on thursday night through saturday there's no parking zone, so I don't know if that affects that or not he thought of having to be between 6th and 10th street about right, I yeah, I'm not sure exactly the boundaries, but I know it's along the east side of avenue b for a good part of the way. Right am I to be corrected between 6th and 10th street yeah. Whenever, however, it's written earlier, that's not how it was written earlier. I don't have it in front of me to look at the language, so you have to scroll I'll, tell you what it says between east 6th street and east 10th street avenue, b between east 6th street and east 10th street. Okay, all right! Any other amendment suggestions, no we're good. I think this is good paul. Michelle has her hand, oh michelle yeah, so I added in these other track changes per what captain molloy said: removing the barricades on avenue be in favor of flexible delineators at ftny vehicles could drive over and then in terms of the dedicated first responder lane. He had said that it would need to be at least 15 feet wide and clearly delineated. So I added both of those and then I also added a whereas clause or a proposed ad aware as clause here explaining about the open restaurants designation, because when we were in committee the open restaurants, designation between east 2nd street east 3rd street did not exist. It happened two days after we passed this resolution in committee and so there's no, whereas clause addressing that. So I propose to add some additional context around that this one and then the just the 15 feet wide for the emergency responder lane and the flexible delineators, as suggested by captain molloy, and I apologize. I can't show both at the same time so I'll have to scroll back and forth david yeah. The flexible delineators came up right as my computer went down, so I kind of missed what that was it. The idea that there would be flexible plastic delineators which are used if you notice them to separate traffic lanes going to a bridge or something so that cars stay in their lane, was it to be using that to as the block traffic instead of the cute yeah, it was to use it to block the traffic, but the trucks can get over them without a problem right now. That is true, and they do break from time to time, and these would get run over quite often ten times a day, the the ten to twenty times a day they're going through. I guess we can even hear his option. I think it's, the least likely to happen see they would have to be taken down every day and put back up so yeah anyways a suggestion, that's good! Okay, all right! What is this? There's a misspell up there, careful that's somebody's last name, okay, so and david correct me if I'm wrong, but this resolution, as amended, will just be folded into our final vote. At the end of the evening, or we need to vote on it separately, no that we can put the whole thing back into the calendar agenda. Yeah, that's perfectly fine! Unless someone wants us to vote on it right now, which I don't want to myself, we can vote, we can vote on it all together. I think right, yeah. All of all the amendments have been made. Michelle yeah, I think so everything's in here that I suggested and that robin suggested and that david suggested, okay, all right so paul. How are you with this? I'm all right? Okay, thank you! Thank you, okay, so we're going to put it back in into the calendar for a roll call vote and we're going to go back. Thank you, alicia back into the agenda. Okay, you're welcome so for chair report. Yes, I really don't have a lot to report. I just wanted to say I wanted to continue to encourage the new members to attend their committee meetings and to attend the full board meetings. I know it's summertime. I know people are starting to go outside and frolic, as my grandma would say, but I just want you to you know. Remember your responsibility to the board and attending your committee meetings. Even for season members. Please don't forget to attend your committee meetings. I know that people have things that come up. Please be in communication with the board, the chairs of the committees in which you sit on or the subcommittees of which you sit on so that they know what's going on, because if you don't tell us, we don't know- and I want to welcome david adams back as he has been dealing with his own personal things happening in his home. If you'd like to talk to david about, what's going on with him, please everyone connect with him privately. Thank you all again and please have a great summer stay safe, stay hydrated during this heat wave and and continue to attend as many meetings as you possibly can on zoom all right, that's it! So, let's go to the next should be our district manager's report, but she's no longer on the call yeah. I know so we're going to go past the district manager's report and we're going to go executive committee. There was nothing really to report with the executive committee sla nothing to report. We got all the stipulations that are part of the resolutions. Thank you alex landmark nothing to report. Thank you linda. My news. We didn't pass any resolution, but I just have to have a few small updates on some projects. The first is some 70 marbury street. The city has already allocated 80 million dollars for the redevelopment of the site and currently they have stopped the demolition and because also in the process of hiring a consultant to conduct a community engagement process. So they want to see what the community's vision for this site is and then decide what to do. They also announced that they are going to reopen the link of the history soon, but they didn't tell us the exact time of the reopening and also next month, we're gonna. The land use committee will have a presentation on the two bridges rezoning application. Anyone who is interested in this topic can join us at the latest. That's all. I have thank you. Jackie transportation just met economic development, anita no updates for economic development. Thank you, health and seniors human services, mainly hello. Well at the July meeting we talked about district needs this past monday. I attended the Manhattan borough president, the Manhattan complete count committee press conference to launch the census week. The press conference was in chinatown. I know that a few of the other board members were also there. We heard you know from someone from new york city census, talk about the upcoming week of action, and he did say that you know the response rate in our area is something from 49 to 53. So that means that there's another 50 or 41 percent that haven't responded. So that really is a lot of people in spite of all the rah-rah we're doing a good job, so we are doing a good job, but we need to do a better job, and maybe we can follow up with that. I'm hoping we can follow up with that representative to find out. You know, maybe through the hard to count map. You know what are the areas that we need to work on and if any of the board members are interested in volunteering, for that would be really good, and I know that you know they also offer the option where you can reach out to your own family and friends, but if we could do something to reach out to those who haven't answered yet that would be good yeah. So if we can, I mean we can maybe follow up with that later, alicia yeah sure, and if you'd like, we can explore it a little more during exec and see what else we can do. Yeah well, there's this week of action coming up, so it's like this week. It's going to be so this week, because the enumerators go out on august 11th. So that's why they're doing it? Okay now! So what would you suggest me that we, like maybe have an email, a blast that goes out or should we post something on the social media page or well? We could do an email blast out and something on the social media, but if we're but the email blast at least to our members, yeah our members yeah to our members and then you know they're encouraging people to participate in the other stuff too, like anyone can you know just sign up on their sign up, google doc and sign up for something. If we just want to focus on our area, we could send a blast for our area. I focused on reaching our area, so do we volunteer with them, then you know you'll, just you know volunteer in general, but you understand what I mean. Okay, I do understand what you mean. So would you like to prepare an email and then let me review it and then we can send it out sure that would be great. Thank you so much me and alicia. If I kind of just want to add that I know that joe and tatiana have posted about the census on our social media, so we can simply again after may, get you whatever language she wants. We can simply just send them an email asking them to do it on a regular basis from now through October 31st. So maybe every couple of weeks they post something yeah. That would be good yeah. That sounds good, I'm so sorry trevor, I'm gonna go back to you parks just for that. I'm gonna do a one-hour update on escr, I'm just kidding I'll, be brief. We didn't have any votes, but for all board members and committee members escr will come to parks committee every month, as they have been for probably the last year and a half maybe longer, but next for next month we will also have what's going on below by esr, so pier 42, pier 36, pier 35, the Brooklyn bridge, montgomery coaster, resiliency and the Brooklyn bridge esplanade. All those will be on the calendar for next month. They will be relatively brief updates, but, as you all aware, the entire coastline of cb3 is under some sort of construction for redevelopment if you're interested attend parks meeting for next month and just be aware that escr is on the calendar for every month.

        "summary": "She is going to be covering basically everything workers need to know, as people start returning to their workplaces and their offices.\nI just got an email today saying we're back to work in the office on monday, so I'll be attending this to make sure You can submit comments in advance and we will also have a spanish and interpretation so for those of you who need it that will be available, so And we're gonna move into our public session.\nFirst of all, I believe the open meetings law applies and these meetings have to be public, since they include elected officials, community boards, city agencies, but even in the in the case of transparency.\nI'm happy to see assemblyman epstein on the on the call right, now, so I hope he will weigh in on having transparency obeying the open meetings law and allowing the public to attend the community advisory group meetings not to participate but to observe-.\nThey will not at this point, unless there's a groundswell of sort of voices to basically try to get us more access, particularly now with Covid-19 of people not wanting to be in enclosed spaces of being able to be on the upper decks of the ferries, where you can be outside to actually have transportation to have this affected, and so I was just hoping that we would basically be able to get some community support to basically have some hearings, at least about getting us additional routes, so that we can now go north as well as south.\nI believe we had an influx of people wanting to testify regarding the open, streets, specifically avenue b.\nI really just wanted to spend a short time thanking the transportation and public safety committee for supporting the open streets initiative and cb3 for supporting it and hearing testimony at the committee's meeting on people's experience with avenue b, open streets.\nWe heard some concerns from fdny, but given the discussion we had and the various recommendations, made, I'm fully confident that we can resolve the matter and make sure that fdny can get full access to do the great work that they do and our public health and safety initiative of keeping avenue b in open streets remains in effect and intact.\nA NYCHA resident myself, with limited space due to construction and scaffolding, having avenue b as an open street as an option to walk, is exciting and vital, and I.\nLaura sewell, I'm speaking today as a long-time neighborhood resident and the executive director of the east village community coalition, in support of the transportation committee's resolution on the avenue b.\nSo we really appreciate the transportation committee's efforts to identify several creative solutions that would help fdny improve their response times without sacrificing the health and economic benefits of the avenue be open.\nAnd I'm, also here to speak in support of the transportation committee resolution on sending suggestions to the DOT about how to improve the open street so that both the local residents, the local businesses and fdny's concerns can all be addressed, and we can have a more successful, more beneficial public environment for everyone.\nWe did a lot of work at the committee level, drafting a resolution that takes into account all of the stakeholders, needs, and I, think we presented a list of four or five really good options for not just It's not even a situation where you know we're giving something up to placate these concerns, but rather we have a number of proposals that will both make the streets safer in terms of emergency access, while also giving more opportunities.\nFor you know, outdoor exercise, outdoor transportation, reducing pedestrian congestion and making it a more conducive place for things like the open restaurants and to help businesses that are struggling, So I hope that the full board will support the resolution.\nResident, I wanted to formally introduce myself to the full board the new york city department of transportation.\nAs you now know, made us an official partner of avenue b's open street in late June, and we are a group of east village and lower east side, community members, business owners and non-profit leaders who formed with the goal of stewarding and maintaining avenue b as a shared street for safe and socially distanced.\nThis open street is a crucial public health need and no small joy to a community that has suffered greatly as a result of this pandemic.\nWe thank the board for supporting the open streets program and the community, the transportation committee, who has been working to find the solution that will allow the avenue b open street to succeed, moving forward, including their resolution.\nIf you cut the data just around your community board you're at about 56, so again a little bit higher, which is great, but Of of the total people who live in cb3 and if you want to cut it by neighborhood, the lower east side is at 59 response and chinatown If you think like we don't want half of a hospital, we don't want half of a school.\nThere was an article in the new york times a couple weeks ago about wealthier new yorkers being out of the city and that's a huge issue, because just because they just because they have the personal resources, doesn't mean that they can just not respond to the census, because they don't think that their neighborhood might need.\n2020, have a list of residents in our area that we could call that you know, maybe you called before, and they didn't answer the census, so you weren't able to reach them Could you cut a list for us, so I could definitely cut the list specifically for cv3 or for your neighborhood.\nYeah russell, if you can, if you can maybe work on that and get it from whoever you need to get it from and then just send it to our district manager's office and share with us Is there any online tools, because I'm part of a cooperative We have dear neighbor letters that we can send you a packet of that you can distribute within your building, and that would be great and the last thing I want to say.\nPeople are dedicated to the open streets on avenue b and they are doing such a service to our community.\nI also wanted you to know that I passed legislation requiring a public vote by the mta board, if they, if they decide to reduce subway service, less than 24 7 after the pandemic is over.\nYou know anger inducing than that they're using our public services, I mean I'm, not talking about class warfare, but I will say this: it's my understanding that many of them do not complete the census because they don't want the government to know where their home address is for tax purposes.\nThe government is not going to know your our colleague here from new york city, census.\nWorking from home, I had to take a little bit time off to recuperate after the budget fight, but I think one thing that is really important in our community.\nOn top of you, know, from night south of 96th street to lower Manhattan on murray street, and that includes chinatown on the low east side That will really help alleviate some more of the burden during this pandemic, and also we just passed a bill last month about supporting small property owner with some property tax relief, because we have a lot of you.\nYou know 116 million dollars in our youth, program, and I really wanted to thank all the nonprofits in our community.\nThat was able to step up and really ready to do, this, to provide the services for our young people, and you know providing emergency food, domestic violence, funding, all those things that we were able to say, but on the capital budget, side, I'm really happy that we were able to provide funding together with councilmember, rivera and speaker to the clemente cultural center, to really put them back on the right track and also we're gonna.\nYou know to make it brighter and safer, and we have to provide the funding from the city council to do that, and the rutgers community center is finally going to get a new stow so that they can have hot meal for their youth program.\nIt was mainly saving all the north programs that are in our district, and we hope that our senior center will be open soon, because we want to make sure look.\nIf you can try to keep your reports to two minutes, I'm, not gonna put the timer on, but if I feel like you guys are going, long, I will put the timer on andrew from mayor bill de blasio's, office.\nYou know, if the current rate, if a lot of people are not responding to census and at the moment our district office is not yet open, but we can be reached at at 718-539-3650 for any constituent service, and you know we can also be reached by the congresswoman's website.\nIs, is producing like sanitizing wipes, because I guess you know, because people cannot get enough of the clorox, My question is for the congresswoman, so hud and section eight developments did not qualify for the Covid-19 19 rental assistance and I was wondering if there was going to be any type of support for affordable housing residents for Covid-19 19.\nNumber two affordable housing, something that community board three is incredibly expert: What we're doing is we're talking to every affordable housing, expert, I, can think of and at least having a listing as to what needs to get done.\nAnd I just feel like we're falling way behind on this topic, so we will be working with the community boards and others to at least have.\nWe worked on the avenue, b, open street closure, issue, and I know that in terms of the park and the scr they don't, they meaning the city doesn't seem to want to do.\nAnd, you know, I see, d.o.t doing a lot of street reversals throughout all five boroughs and As. Far as like fluidity of the grid, I.\nThe way it's best for you, but I think we should have an opportunity, a planned opportunity for people to respond if there isn't I'm just saying give six months with the work and then see what happens.\nI want to plan it, because if people don't know that there's a place to respond, they may not.\nYou tell us how important these seconds, or these minutes are, for saving people's lives, because I'm a little concerned that we're hearing everyone talking about the fact of walking the streets?\nYou, know the fire lane idea, which I know most street festivals- And, but I also had a question about the trap, the parked cars on avenue, b, And I , don't know if this could be added some friendly resolution to add that those stretch of blocks don't have any parked cars, which would also create more room for both pedestrians.\nThink that's why we wanted to ask you what was your potential ideas of what you would like to see happen for that firehouse on avenue, b , The wish list first would be reverse.\nBoth I mean, I understand the need for the fire department and if a resolution could be worked out so that section between 6th and 10th street could remain open to pedestrians, because we have so many small children here in the neighborhood.\nThere are traffic, calming measures that wouldn't require closing the street like speed, bumps, I, don't know.\nYou know closed for pedestrians for use and stuff, because it's made a huge difference in our neighborhood to have people have access to the street in terms of safety, david.\nNow I, actually, don't think that going down 6th street is a safe way for the fire engine to go.\nAnd I've never seen people using avenue, b next to tompkins square park, while it's in an open street mode.\nI think we must deal with public safety, and I and I talked first I would like to offer amendment if I could speak a second time just to put public safety to make it clear that public safety is first and that if they cannot, if they cannot come up with a safe way to get the fire engines to go up avenue b from 6th street to 10th street, then we do support removing the open street designation for that stretch of avenue b.\nThe worst case scenario for the fire department is to remove this, because we want to work in partnership with all the agencies and with the board to make new york city a safe and friendly environment for people to exist in I'm on the phone to come up with a solution where you can keep it open, but at the same time, keep a lane open for the fire department to use that we're not obstructed.\nI don't mean to interrupt, although I am interrupting, but I just want to suggest that, because we only have them for a limited time that if we can focus on questions specifically for the fire department right now, rather than a back and forth debate among the members, I think that would be most helpful because I believe the captain needs to leave us in about five minutes.\nI use the open street to go to 12th street to the community garden there, and there are people that are using it.\nThe city should remove the open, strategy, installation on avenue b from east 60 to 10th street and the open restaurants designation for having to be between okay, someone had modified it after I sent it, but that's fine, because I hear that's problematic and the open restaurants, designation revenue b between second and third street in order to protect public safety by providing for efficient and timely response, we have dny units in the area.\nI, don't want it to go another month, because I really think it's a bad situation over on anywhere east of the park is a bad situation, but you understand that we've got like 24 story, buildings, I, believe over on avenue, d, And we know that the local firehouse is arriving to the scene.\nI want the board on record that we would prefer to they cut the open streets.\nAnd I do want the open streets to remain, They even came to the community board.\nWe talked about second and third street potentially being closed and they went and closed it anyway, like a day or two later But you know even the restaurants between third and fourth are trying to apply for the open, restaurant.\nI would like to extend that to remove parking on east forestry and an avenue b between you know, If, that's the side of the street that the fire department we want to make this into the emergency lane.\nAbout right, I know it's along the east side of avenue b for a good part of the way."
