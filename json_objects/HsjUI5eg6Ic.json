            "fullTranscript": "All right, hey angelic for one. Second, I do not know this Heim gross guy over here Heim is one of our presenters. He spoke at the last board meeting I think, a week ago, exactly about the Brooklyn heat, smart, maybe cool smart, also campaign and he's going to give a warning too cool. Welcome hello! Wait! I know Heim very well. He is welcome here. Thank you trying to get into this this train for a long time. So I'm glad to be here great. All right. So do you guys have any preference in which you present? Does anybody need to get off immediately Angelica? Can I ask you a question? How does it show that we have 15 participants when it's nine of us on the screen? There are additional attendees. This panelists are either people who are in the committee or people who are okay, we're the only ones who show, but we do not. Oh, I see attendees, you can click the attendees okay, so see bridget. I do not know. I do not know the other people right, so I guess just a few zoom things if you want to, if you're an attendee and you'd like to and you'd like to chat, there's a function where you can raise your hand and then I can unmute you or you could just type anything you want to say into the chat. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions if you'd like, and I guess for everybody who is on video right now, you can you and unmute yourselves at will so just be mindful that other people will be presenting any other zoom questions. No, and I guess for the parks presentation, do you have a presentation for parks being first? Yes, we have a presentation. So if we can get started, if you want yes does, I guess I meant by presentation: do you have a powerpoint presentation? Yes, so yeah? So we do we do have. I think I'm going to speak for a little bit and then maybe we can share christiandolly's screen and he can pull up. The presentation and Chris will go through kind of our capital update, okay and for everyone. We were planning to just kind of give you an update on where we are where the Parks Department is in relation to cobia, 19 and kind of our protocols and where we've been and kind of how we've adapted to things I'll, just blab on about that for a little bit, hopefully be as concise, and if you have questions, please throw them in the chat and we can answer them more or raise your hand and then I'll turn it over to christy andoli. Who can give you an update on the capital projects that are happening in New, York, Community, Board six. Does that make sense great? Yes, okay? How much time do we have total for this? Do you think just so we can time it well. When I spoke to Heim earlier, I told him about 10 minutes to present and then time for questions, so that would be great, so we'll try I'll try to be brief. I just want to introduce the folks on the line first, so one thank you guys for having us we're happy to be here and kind of keep the lines of communication open. We have regional manager, denise palmer on the on the call denise is in charge of the whole western part of Brooklyn so and she's joined by Kingston as well. Who is her son there? He is Hey, Kingston, hello, and so yes and then we also have the director of capital projects, Christian, dolly and so, and so Chris is going to run through the capital status in a little bit, but I'll just and my name is davey Ives, I'm the chief of staff for operations here in Brooklyn at the New York City, Parks, Department, Chris Denise, and I all work for Commissioner Marty Marr. So he says hello, but he can't be here tonight so yeah, so that's just kind of where we're sitting where our offices are in Prospect Park in Litchfield Villa, so that's kind of where we are compounding it from tonight. So Covid-19. I'll try to I'll try to be brief. On this. You know parks workers have been in since March. There was no stoppage in service for us. You know so parks workers are essential workers. You know tenise and her staff have been amazing hanging in there. Since the beginning figuring out what PPE is how it works? How that changes, the environment that you work in all that stuff, so it's been it's been. It's certainly been a challenge for us this past year, but you know, we've adapted all of our administrative staff or our administration out, for the most part, is trying to work from home, I'm still in the office every day. You know, so we are getting things getting things done with the new reality that things are so that said, I think I'm going to share a link in the chat. This is. This is to just put it to all panelists and attendees. This is just the latest update on where programs are and service changes to the parks. Department feel free to click. On that it's got everything I'm going to tell you right now. You know, but basically you know facilities all closed and then now that and they've reopened, but some have not reopened because it's just tough to socially distance. So the our thought process- and that was to keep things safe safety- is our top priority, whether it's for our workers or, for you know, constituents using the park. So you know when it comes to playgrounds being closed. We close those down because rates were above a certain level right now, with a little a bit of optic. There are certain zones where permits and activities are not our permits and activities are prohibited or limited. Luckily, community Board six is right on the edge of the yellow zone. I think it's right on the other side of the Prospect Expressway right now. If you click on that link, you can you can it'll. Take you to a page that has a map showing where all the zones are. That's the Kovid19 zone, finder on that, but so for now you know things are as normal as it can be in community board. Six, which is good playgrounds, are open, skate parks are open, grilling areas, dog runs, basketball, courts are open, basketball courts are open, but you know we are asking people not to play games. Obviously this is tough to enforce. We do not really have the personnel to look into it fully, but you know we ask that people just kind of practice and try to stay as socially distant as possible. That brings us to permits for sports for adults. We are not issuing at the moment, but we've opened up for what we call low risk low risk of transmission leaks. So you know soccer baseball softball. All those were are allowed and open higher contact sports like hockey and football are not worse where you can't so maintain social distance. So you know, if you have a permit and you have any questions, I recommend you get in touch with our permits office. If you have any questions about that, they are the experts and they can tell you exactly what the deal is. As these situations change day to day I'll continue with some facilities. Our beaches were open for the summer they're closed. Now, because you know it's a seasonal thing pools, we opened only a handful of pools in Brooklyn partially because we could not get lifeguards trained up and ready in time that eventually changed. We got them trained and so some pools opened, I would say for next season next year. It kind of depends on how things go with respect to the virus. I think our recreations, our club recreation centers, are closed. The public, our recreation centers, have kind of been amazing how they've adapted, though we've had some get turned into food distribution. Centers like in Brownsville in your neck of the woods, the Red Hooks Rec Center is now a cova testing site. Other Rec centers are now what's called the Learning Bridges program, so they're kind of functioning as Makeshift DOE facilities for education, so across the board, they're changing, but red hook is now Covid-19 testing center, which is free of free of charge. All you have to do is just walk up there. I would recommend it to see if you need to make a reservation or not, but it's free and open to the public. You do not need a reservation. I will interject here, because I went and had a test on Monday no appointment needed. I walked right in. I was in and out in 15 minutes had the results in two days. Wonderful yep so they're working, so we would have never thought that. That's you know, that's how our rec centers are being used, but we figured it out. Denise's staff has been amazing and kind of shifted around you know does not help that DOE is redoing all the sidewalks around the center at the moment, but we are getting by so that kind of I'm trying. I know I'm taking up a lot of time here, so I just want to give Chris enough time to go through the presentation. The sidewalks brings me to the capital thing, but before we switch into capital tinnies, do you have any other comments about operations that I might have missed? You're, muted yep? No, I think you touched on everything. Thank you, so yeah, so capital projects I'll just give a brief overview. All of our capital projects stopped during Covid-19, so everything that was in construction was put on hold that has since resumed. You know, I think, projects that were in procurement, so we had the design phase the procurement to get a contractor and then the construction phase. So everything in construction was stopped. That stuff has since resumed everything that was in procurement if it got far enough along those project has moved forward, but everything else, that's in the procurement phase, is currently on hold due to the budget office kind of waiting to see what the city is fiscally able to do so, all of our. So we had, I think, like 30 projects in Brooklyn that were slated to start. I think only like five or six ended up starting this past summer, so we are still kind of waiting to see what OMB says about projects. Chris will give you updates in a little bit. Some of those projects are now a little bit more delayed than they were and then in the design, phase, projects and design. They projects that we're in design continued in design, and so a lot of them are now done with design and now procurement, but new projects that were supposed to start in fiscal year 20.. We just got approval to start doing those, so we got some. We've had some remote scope meetings, some virtual scope meetings, but community Ward 6 does not have any projects slated to start in fiscal year 20 or the current fiscal year fiscal year, 21 so long story short we're starting scope meetings, but community Board six does not have any projects to start at the moment. All right in the design start. Can I just jump in and ask you: are all the public restrooms in parks? Open? Yes, public restrooms are open. That's a great point: they've been open, they never closed. We are trying to sanitize them the best that we can. However, that brings me to another point that I did not highlight. Is that Denise's staff is we did not get any seasonal staff, so that means in Brooklyn we were 500 people short or about 500 people short of what we normally get for the summer. So if you've seen things be dirtier, if you've seen things kind of, you know be less tidy than you you're used to it's, because you know denise and her team did not get all that seasonal help that we normally do. I see a couple of questions coming in the chat, I'm going to turn it over to Christian dolly so I can start and then maybe we can go back and address those questions, sound good, so Chris do you want to share your screen sure do I need permission to do that or I can just you should be able to do it right now. Let me try that. Okay. Can everybody see that yes maximize it? How does that look good? Okay, everybody can hear me too yes, great good evening, thanks again for having us, like Davey, said I'm Christian Dole, I'm the director of capital projects for New York city parks in Brooklyn. I'm going to run briefly through the capital status report and again just as davey sort of alluded to where we're experiencing some delays on projects due to the current budget situation. So first project, so here we're just highlighting one that we're very proud of a recently completed project, so Ennis playground, as I'm sure everyone on the board, is familiar with a largely industrial and residential area. That's that was, you know, pretty short on unusable park land. So we knew that you know this was a very important project to the community and we're pretty happy with the results so brand new playground, basketball, court, small synthetic turf lawn. We completed that back in July of 2019.. This is a project. That's a future project again currently in procurement is the Washington Park Dog Run, there's an exist. Existing dog run there. Now this is a renovation of that site. Originally, this project was delayed a bit. It's actually been rebid twice in procurement, so there are a lot of reasons that can happen at this site. Mostly what's happened here is the bids have gone out? They've come back too high, so the contractors are giving us prices that are inflated, so we have to rebid it. So that delayed it a bit and now it's in procurement again, but it's held up due to the budget crisis. So as long as everything goes as planned and we and it can be approved to continue, we expect it to start construction fall of 21. another site, that's in procurement. This is the harold icky skate park. So right now you might be familiar with the site, it's a big! What we call Mppa, it's a multi- purpose play area, it's an as basically an open asphalt lot. So this is bringing a renovation of the site and conversion into a into a skate park. This one was delayed a bit in the beginning in design by the MTA and Tbta, because it's actually right the site is right over the ventilator for the Brooklyn battery tunnel. So we had to do additional testing and monitoring to make sure that we're not adding too much weight to the site. You know with the concrete for the for the skate park, so they've worked all those all those kinks out, and this project is also in picturement but unfortunately also delayed a bit, and so we asked. We hope that this one can start fall of 21 as well, and then everybody's favorite topic and I know marlene- is on and you guys have seen this update a while. You know for a couple years now, but some of the dates have kind of changed, and some of it is related to Covid-19, but this is sort of a general timeline and I'll share this with the presentation with the board after this meeting so you'll have it. But this is sort of an updated general timeline and map of what's happening at red hook with the field remediations and renovations. So I'll go through each phase so phase one is a project that was in construction, pre- covered. It was shut down for health and safety reasons during Covid-19, so it shut down. I think, about three months: it restarted about June, June or July of the of this summer. So we are factoring in that delay, but they're looking at a completion in fall of of 20. So soon we're hoping by you know December. So we can get this project completed and then phase two is is also in construction. This one was also paused for a bit, but it also has restarted, and this one is a bit behind, but not behind, in timeline a bit behind phase one as far as completion, but we hope to get this one done by the spring of 21.. This is phase three phase. Three is one of those sites. That's in procurement, we're hoping to move this one along as it's an important project to the community, but basically we're just waiting for OMB approval on this. If everything goes as planned, we're hoping to get this one started by spring of 21. and then phase four, the final phase of the reconstruction and remediation. These are the small fields across from the recreation center, and this one is in sort of the early stages of design. I'm sorry almost complete in design. We hope to have this one completed by this fall season and if that happens- and everything goes as planned, construction would start in fall of 21. and sort of the. The final project here is over at the red hook, community farms a couple blocks away. This is to bring water service to the farm. I think right now, they're irrigating the entire farm by connecting to a fire hose, but this is to bring proper water service for irrigation to the farm, and this one is early in design. The design is scheduled to be complete in spring of 21.. I think that was it yep, so that that's all I've got on that. I'm not sure if I went through that too quickly, but if there's questions davey and I are happy to answer them. Thank you Chris. I just want to say one there's. A mac asked a question about public place, which is the site across from Saint Mary's park on Smith Street in fifth by the Gowanus. So this is- and I think if I got this, I correct this is like this is one that a developer was working on and as part of that agreement, part of it's going to be turned into public space. I think I'm not. I forget if it's parkland or public space, I do not have an update on that. I'm not sure where it is it's not in our operations portfolio at the moment, but I can ask the people from our planning office to see if there is any update on that project, I'm going to just unmute Mac, so he can add something macky thanks! Yeah can you? Can you hear me now yep thanks. I was like typing into the the chat, so it's easier to talk. I appreciate it, I'm just on my phone here, so I'm trying to see what's a little tricky. Thank you for this great presentation. This is awesome. I really like seeing the the parks different projects and thank you to the Parks Committee to for hosting. This is a great opportunity to be able to understand. What's going on, I live in Gowanus around Smith and ninth street and have become involved with public place through a group, but I've started with a few other people called Gowanuslands.Org that is advocating for a park on public place, and one thing we found is just that: there's a tremendous amount of local community interest in having a park on the place, which is actually consistent with the current zoned protections for the for the site which were put in place in the 70s and so yeah. I guess my question to you guys is given that there have been a few different proposals for the site, including like the recent DCP proposal, to have some kind of development on. Are you guys aware of the site and aware of the interest in having a park on the site? Is that something that you guys would be interested or amenable to engaging with the community on to talk about further? I can take that yeah. I mean I think, when we were having a lot of discussions about Carroll park, we did those visioning sessions. I think we had some discussions about what public place would be. I know that DCP has done some like neighborhood planning visioning sessions of their own. At the moment I think they're I have to. I have to figure out where we are with things, but because you know we're in the operations side. So we do not. We do not get too involved with the planning stuff, but I can talk to folks in our planning office to see where that project is and kind of where the agreements are with respect to public place and kind of like what the next step is in that process. But I think at the moment it's with city planning and whatever agreement, city planning and the developer are making, if I might suggest, Mac that you reach out to davey and try to make a presentation to Brooklyn parks so that they are aware of your proposal and the support that you've that you've built for that proposal, because clearly, you parks is not aware of this. It's sort of building in the community and just by way of background, this property was transferred to the city from Brooklyn union gas back in the 70s and was intended to be a public recreation space and was referred to as public place and it just sort of languished for decades until it was transferred to Hpd's portfolio at some point without any process and is now wrapped into the Gowanus rezoning. So some in the community are thinking hey before we give away this chunk of publicly owned land. Let's make sure you know that we're doing the right thing with it so Mac. Perhaps you can pursue that, and you know keep me in the loop, okay, cool yeah. Thank you. I and thank you davey. I think we would welcome the opportunity to engage with you guys in whatever format makes the most sense, and so potentially could I reach out by email? Is that is that possible yeah? I think I think that makes it maybe Angelica. Can you connect us or Glenn or someone from the community, where I can connect yeah I'll, take care of that? Okay, you know, and I'll just say you know from Park's perspective, you know the things that we need to take on a site. Normally are you know? First of all, we need funding to maintain it. We can't take on a site without staffing and that's probably the hardest thing. The second thing is: if we're going to be given land, it has to be remediated to the point where you know all the bad stuff under the soil, whether it's metals or you know, let lead or whatever have been treated and then the third thing is going to be money to actually renovate it. So like capital money. So if and with developer sites, there are ways like in Greenpoint and Williamsburg. There are all sorts of different ways and I'm sure, like in Gowanus they're like that property on bond street, that's not parts property, but parts looked at it at some point, but parks will not be maintaining it. You know there's spots like Domino park, which is developer, built and developer, manages it, and then there are parks like North Fifth street, along where the ferry drops you off in Williamsburg, which the developer built and then parks maintains. So there are a number of different ways that the developers agreements get finalized and, depending on what that agreement is with city planning, determines what parks's involvement with the site is so yeah, but happy to run through all that stuff with you in person and see how we can both advocate for better open space. I have a couple of questions, but I'll start by saying how pleased I am that there's no well, there are delays in the red hook fields, but none of them are canceled. So that's good news. I was not aware of the water access for the community farms. Is this a recent development because it took me by surprise: it's not access, it's where we're, basically putting like a drinking fountain and like irrigation right now they run their water. I think from like fire hydrant yeah from a fire hydrant, but you're actually bringing water in there. So it is a capital project of sorts and I just did not even know it was on the radar screen. So that sounds that sounds great. Then, since you showed Anna's playground, I'm wondering if you'd had any contact with the neighbors immediately east of the playground, because they had reached out to me after the park was opened to say that you know they wanted some sort of privacy screen put on that fence. Same thing has happened with St Mary's, and I'm just wondering if you know that conversation is continued. If there is a negotiation or any solution. I remember those conversations happening. I think I'm not sure where we ended up with Ennis and I think we had purchased something for Saint Mary's. I know that we had looked at specs for what kind of covering I do not know Chris. If you remember, if we've we ended up purchasing and installing anything, but I thought we had installed windscreen mesh at St Mary's. I do not remember a request coming in for anas, but we'll follow up on both and make sure yeah. I know go ahead, Denise I was going to say I think we put the the privacy screen up at and it's but I'll double check on that as well, but I think that would that did go up. You know just in case somebody asks me just like to be in the loop and the other thing is the Washington Port Dog Run. Is it likely that will move forward or any of the projects that are delayed? Is there a priority list? Is there some that might sort of slip through more quickly than others? Well, I think we can't tell you that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but we are kind of at the mercy of OMB. At the moment, however, I think you know the more pressure that they in the mayor's office here right, the better you know so if there are corresponds about it, I'll reach out to Kim yeah at the moment, I think you know this is city- wide too. So it's not just it's not just you know small projects or whatever marketing so we're having this across the city, of course, local to CB6. I have two questions: Chris one is the ball. Fails in red hook are all of them going to be synthetic, even the ones in the later phase. Right now, I believe that's the plan and two. I know because of Covid-19. Of course everything has slowed down, but when is there another plan to to share updates with the redhat community about the fields, even if it's by zoom? When is another plan yeah? So I think we're looking at sometime in November to do that. We're trying to figure out whether that's going to be a virtual call like this or if we just send out sort of an information packet since we've met several times so something similar to what I presented tonight I can we can send out, but with more detail and with an overlay of some of the EPA stuff. That's also happening and information and input from them so we'll keep in contact and I'll make sure that when we figure out what that looks like that, it gets out to everybody you might consider just making up some boards with the information you've shown us tonight and you know putting them on the fence or maybe installing them one or two places in the red hook. Buildings right, that's a great idea, especially about the the Little League Ball field, because I think people in red hook, residents and red hat rightfully so are just actually impatient about that project. Getting done because it's been sitting for so long, so the more information we have. I think it's the better right. I had a question about the skatepark just curious. If there's anything that can be integrated into the pr, I forget what, where what phase is it Chris? Is it already fully designed or the Harold Dickey's park? Yeah, that's already fully designed. So it's out for a bit- and this is moot probably, but I'm just concerned, because skate parks are a place where people come and linger for hours and hours and given its proximity to the high traffic area there I was thinking it would be nice if there was some kind of air treatment that was able to be built in to protect the kids that are going to be spending their entire days. There I mean I do not know of like a large- scale, filtration system or something like that. I do not know that. We've done that before I can say without looking at the design, because it's been a while now so right now, there's maybe you know a few dying trees on site. It's a big asphalt lot. I know where we are making it much more of a park- like setting so green yeah. Anything like that just to direct the right, fresh air fountains next to the water fountains. Exactly I'd like to see that I mean yeah, I just it's just a general concern of mine is that so much of our park land is near yeah as my ways we're increasing the permeability of the site for sure it's going to be much more of a park- like setting we're going to add a lot of planting there's in addition to the skate park, there's sort of a pedestrian plaza that'll have a lot of planting, so I won't just be a concrete jungle anymore. That's good! I mean I just wanted to throw out for Mac and anyone else who's interested tomorrow night. I believe the Cbe 6 landmarks land use Committee is hearing from planning about the Gowanus rezoning. So that's another good place to jump in. I kind of feel like there's, like this huge bulldozer, that's already in motion on that land, but nothing is final yet, so I think it's a great time to have the conversation. I'm sure Mac is aware of it. Chris also just to mention, I think, based on what Glenn has said, it would be helpful, regardless to put up some kind of board or something else, even on ball field, one and six. We know that. That's all the way, you know it's a later phase, but it will be nice to share that those sites are going to be renovated, because I often time get that question and then I can only answer it. So much and folks are not aware in the community in way what are the plans for all the different fields? So it will be nice to have something more visible that provides people with information, not necessarily deadlines about when things will happen, but just so that they can know that there are plans to renovate those spaces yeah, it's a great idea and davey, and I will discuss that and we'll figure out sort of how we can get the word out and what that looks like if you'll send me the you know the powerpoint, I will make sure it gets distributed to our committee and then to you, know our chair and manager. Sure I'll do that right. After the meeting, okay and davey, this has nothing to do with the update, but it has to do with red hook. So we've been, you know, because the some of the young men who use the basketball court has talked to me about this a million times. I'm tired of talking about it. The flood lights in Bush, Clinton playground do not work or they seem to work with a ghost. So right now they have not been on in months or even last year and even two of the lights around the children's play area. Those come on inconsistently. Sometimes they come on. Sometimes they do not, and so throughout the summer, and even now those kids have been playing in the dark, pretty much getting lights, even if that lamppost light comes on or just from the street lights or from the lights from off on the red of houses side. But the flood lies do not come on and that's over on the Clinton street side by Lorraine, okay, so the sport lights at Bush Clinton all right. So we can. We can try to figure out, maybe denise can we put in a work order to have our shops. Folks, look at that. You know marlene. I do not know if the surrounding construction has any impact on that too. They might. No. Those floodlights have not worked, I would say for more than a year, I think one of the kids was telling me that they think the last time those lives came on was like, maybe early last year, once or twice, but I am usually there a couple days a week and we work out there. Those lights do not come on, so we depend on the lights from the street, the lights from over in the red houses side or one or two of the lamps that are close to the exercise area, but even those do not come on consistently and sometimes they'll come on for 15 minutes, then they'll shut themselves off and then come on again at some other point, so yeah those things need to be checked. Okay, we can do that as long as we're in red hook, I'll ask you marlene about the parking situation around the ventilation building near Harold Dickey's. You know it's interesting. You asked that because I passed by there the other day, I'm always very aware when I started seeing a lot of cars parking, so they've stayed awful on top of the space and I noticed actually the city came and put in, I think one of two new trees to replace the London plane trees that had died. So I've noticed that so I do keep my eye to see. Folks are parking on top of the the space there so far. I have not I've mostly seen them just doing it on the side where they're supposed to be- and that includes the police, because the police were also doing the same thing as also the staff and other individuals. So far, so good, okay and no parks meeting would be complete without mentioning Hallux Street and the trash pile. That's there any buzz. I never heard back from menchaca's office. I pushed them as much as I could, but they did not seem terribly interested, but it seems a shame to just leave that this is the unmarked the paper street between the storage, the industrial lot and I think ball Field six, one yeah yeah. I do not think we do not. We do not have any update on it. I think we're just in the process of starting to do test borings to see you know what the what the ground soil is like, but no word on whether somebody's going to step up D.O.T clean it up, turn it over for public use. So just let whatever's there right away yeah like well, I feel better. Just you know mentioning it yeah. On that same front, I have something I would like to just mention, and I know I've discussed it with a couple of you guys before over the years but concerned about sanitation park. Sanitation vehicles, oversized large trucks is what I'm talking about on paths and sidewalks in the parks and it. I know that it's a city- wide problem, but I'm wondering if maybe we could brainstorm in Brooklyn and come up with some solutions to make it safer, because the problem being the guys are on you know, they're crunched. They have so many bins to pick up they're in a hurry trying to hit all their bins they're. You know they have lead feet, they're driving way too fast and kids they're not expecting them. All people are hopping out of the way. Is there any park in particular that does I live near? I live near Prospect Park, but I've also seen it over in Fort, Greene Park. That's why I have a feeling it's like a bigger issue yeah, but it has to do with somehow balancing their pickup schedule, the size of their vehicles and the terrain that they're on, because I know in Prospect Park, you know that main drive is you know is: is a well- trafficked area for all vehicles? It's not the drive so much that bothers me, but it's when they're on sidewalks or paths where people are just not expecting them to be right. No, they yeah. So it's just more about setting everyone's expectations, but well I'm curious. You mentioned the large sanitation trucks. I would imagine they have the smaller versions out on the paths and the larger versions stay on the paved roads. But that's not the case. No, that's not the case. Sadly, so they have the really the big guys barreling down the sidewalk on Bbw and in the you know, the paths in the park. I have talked to some of the drivers and said what would be more beneficial and they joke they're like oh, do you want to buy us an electric cargo bike? You know with a trailer and we'll do it that way and guess what I would if I were allowed, but I'm not, but it's just something for parks to just be thinking about more holistically. You know before something horrible happens, because that's how I think has this come. Has this come up at the comcom yeah? It has been discussed at comcom over the years and especially when DOT was reviewing the drive itself right and you know rejiggering the usage, so something I do not know if you have any sway. Davey or someone else, but DOT is way overdue. On doing a traffic study of the new configuration of the main drag in Prospect Park. Now that it is car free, there really should be a rejiggering of the signals. The signals make no sense in the park and they promised like over a year ago yeah it's unclear whether you're supposed to follow them or what exactly like the guys on DOT to get that done. I know the alliance is aware of it, but I do not think they really push them that hard. So you guys could Joanna. Have you been attending the comp com? Thank you sure I want to say in red hook. I do not think I've ever seen us have problems with the sanitation trucks generally they're on the road, and the only time we have trucks in the park is in ball field, one because we have the dumpsters there they'll go in there and then also, I think sometimes I think it is summer is the summer when we have the dumpster, sometimes what we used to in the back. But I can't say that we've had any issues with the dumpsters that I've observed in red Hat. I was going to say the same thing. Thank you for mentioning that marlene and also at Fort Greene. We have two locations because I'm also in Fort Greene as well, but there's a gem card that brings all of the trash to. We have a holding pen, there's one by the hospital and there's one on decal avenue and the packer is supposed to go there and bring everything into I'll. Put everything into the packer, so I'll speak to the staff as well just to make sure that they're staying off of the sidewalk, I'm also going to put in a small complaint on the handball courts at jj burn they're, pretty cracked up these days. I do not know if you're aware of that is that the wall themselves or the surface on the ground. I believe that the ground- okay, we can maybe denise, can you put in a work order for Chris until Chris Mcmillan to look at there might be an existing one already in there, but I'll just double check to make sure that it is yeah. I think I do not know what the condition looks like, but cracks on the ground. You know normally cracks on the ground is caused by something else, whether it's water moving or underground and causing it. But if there's a way we can patch it or smooth it over, or at least maybe feather it down, so you can at least play on it great. Thank you. I see a bunch of names on the attendee list. Would any of you like to comment or ask a question. This would be a good time before we move on to the next presentation, just write, something in the chat section and and we'll that's it while we're waiting. I just have two questions for you guys. I do not know, maybe you davey. This is relating to coffee. Well, one is coffee, but one is overall parks sort of strategies. I know about two years ago there were some discussions about what to do with the the asphalt space in coffee park that is oftentimes not used. Has there been any update about that? It's just a huge open space and there had been much discussion around what to do with it. So I wondered if there was any feedback on that and then secondly around- and this is just not red up- this is everywhere in coffee. I've noticed they've tried to put up a little banner about litter and get people to sort of put their litter in one space, which of course, does not always happen. So what is parks's strategy going forward for addressing the amount of litter in the space and what can parks groups? Do I mean? Yes, we can come in with our with our volunteers and help clean up, but of course, we're not always there and then, particularly during this period of Covid-19. So what else can they do, but also what is Park's overall strategy around that so I mean, I think, just on the first one that the Asphalt area and coffee, I think, maybe not before my time, Fairway came in and repainted it or something like that. But you know we do not have. We do not have capital money for it and I'll say that you know when it when it comes to capital money. It's not. That parks has a set capital budget and we choose which park. We slide it around to it's more. You know it's whatever we can. We can get elected officials to chip in and fund. So it's like a campaigning effort, basically in the lobbying effort that we have to take with the campaign with the council members there's going to be a new council member in the next year or so, maybe that's that will be an opportunity to fund it, but yeah I mean we would love to. We would love to fund it. You know the developer or the contractor at NYCHA was trying to do something with it, but you know I do not think he wanted to. He wanted to kind of chip in somehow, but there was not a way to make it work. Unfortunately, you know we've gotten interest from some groups. You know, but I think once they see the price tag, it's it kind of scares them off. So I would say the best. The best thing is really the our next opportunity is basically for the next council member. We would love to do something with. It is an ugly area that you can't really do anything on now, so yeah, that's it as far as litter goes. We did try an anti- litter campaign in parks that might be what you're referencing. If you saw a couple signs up, you know we would love involvement from the community to try to put together a stronger program or stewards to do an anti- littering campaign. I do not know how effective it is, but I think you know we do not know unless we try we'd be happy to have more conversation with you marlene about that. But you know we're not you know we get. All we can do is pick up the litter once it gets put in the park, so I'm not sure denise. I do not know if you have anything else to add about litter, pickup and coffee, and maybe you know what's working what is not the most yeah the anti- banner litter. We put it in places where we had barbecuing areas. So the thought was, you know if we have a lot of people in those barbecuing areas that they would potentially put it where we have the banner and then we can have that one location in order to pick everything up in some areas it worked in some areas. It did not because the community just did not respond to it. So it is something that we have been trying, but in terms of garbage we do have two people that are fixed posts at that location and they take the garbage out to the curb and then the packer would come and pick it up from there, but yeah any involvement, maybe marlene and I could top offline. An idea for you guys to look at is something the alliance has been doing where they have like a set time that volunteers can come every week and pick up a garbage, grabber and a bag. Basically is the only equipment and it does. It does require one coordinator to hand them out and check them back in, but it's been super popular and effective over here, like I went to clean the other day and the whole quadrant near where they hand out the pickers was totally clean on a Monday morning. It kind of blew my mind so something's working there. I have a question about the basketball courts and the I guess wishful thinking regarding no games be played. Is there signage? Could there be signage just asking people to cooperate so that you know we stay healthy yeah there was there were signs placed in all of our parks and playgrounds just to let people know that you know that we prohibit the group play and that they should wear a face covering if they're not six feet away from people great well, if there's nothing else, and it seems no one else has any comments or questions. Then thank you, Brooklyn parks, nice to see you all nice to see. You too, I guess we're going to move on to the next presentation. Right Angelica! Take it away. Okay, I brought up a great point about there needing to be more electric trash collectors and electric electrifications one of my favorite topics in a great segue into Heim's presentation. Heim. Are you able to share your screen nice, segue, you're, muted? Also, while he's unmuting he's going to be talking about Brooklyn heat, smart cool, smart and it's a program that is focused on electrifying, our heating, all right, you're on okay, great I'm going to sign up just. Thank you guys. Thank you to the love, the wonderful people from parks. Yes, thank you good night. Let me just open this up. Okay, so I can do. Can I do the screen share from my side? Yes, I can okay here we go. Let's see, okay, forgive me. Let me try to do this as smoothly as possible. It's working hey! Do we? Do we, please the technology gods this time, okay, great, fantastic! Well, thank you for the opportunity to present thank you, Angelica and all you lovely people, probably most of whom I've not met, I'm a, I guess, a neighbor. I live on 15th street, although I'm a lifelong new yorker from downtown Manhattan and uptown Manhattan other parts of the city, but my roots are in Brooklyn and now I'm back so I'm happy to be contributing. I hope to improving the environment and addressing climate change in New, York City, and particularly in Brooklyn, I'm going to try very quickly to present this project to you so that we have some time for conversation. Heat cool, smart Brooklyn is a clean heating and cooling campaign in community boards. Two and six. We need districts two and six in Brooklyn, we're supported by the Brooklyn borough president sponsored by Nyserda, and our group is the New York City 2030 district. We are a not- for-, profit partnership with stakeholders, part of a network of districts around north America, addressing or rather confronting climate change at an urban scale, we're establishing a district in downtown Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. Yes, so we're currently formally bounded by community board two in Brooklyn and lower Manhattan below 14th street we'd, very much love to engage with community board six, a little bit more and I'll. Tell you about how successful we've been so far, and hopefully we can work with you to even make that better and more so. The eco smart Brooklyn campaign is part of Nyserda's clean heating and cooling communities program. As Angelico mentioned. The goal is electrification in this case, primarily electrifying heating in buildings, removing fossil fuel burning boilers and hot water heaters from buildings. New York City has some particular challenges. We have cheap gas and expensive electricity. We also have a lot of regulations and overlapping obstacles that most of you are more familiar with than most, but this program across New York state has grown. There are now more than 14 active campaigns and we're happy to be one of them. Perhaps you're familiar with this basic information. I won't go into too much detail, but the short story is that natural gas is serving building. Energy is worth about 60 to 70 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that New York City produces. As you can see, a lot of that natural gas goes into generating electricity. A lot of it goes straight into heating and cooling. Excuse me heating and are producing domestic hot water in buildings. Nuclear is going away. Indian pointed one of the two reactors has been shut down. The second reactor is going to be shut down next year. We do not have enough renewables and most of the oil goes to transportation. So ridding ourselves of natural gas combustion on site is a challenge and that's what the program is primarily focused on doing. We also really want to increase renewables, and we do want to help property owners, install solar and do a lot of energy efficiency improvements. But the focus of this program is energy, Envelope improvements, energy efficiency and airsource heat pumps or variable vrfs, basically, electrified heating and cooling. Here's a mock- up of a card, a typical card, which I would be happy to give to you at a block party or a street fair. If there were such a thing to happen in our near future, we hope and pray hey Brooklyn.Org is our website. Please go there, fill out a form or find out about the program. I'll repeat that again, but this is what the card looks like and we hope to get posted more posters and cards out to everyone, whether physically or virtually so we're promoting two principal technologies. Building an Envelope energy efficiency is simple stuff, but the image on the left you may recognize is a blower door. Blower door is a temporary door that can be placed to test the air leakage or the air tightness of an apartment, a house a building, and it actually does monitor how much air can be pulled through the leaks in the windows and the walls and is used to establish what can be done to improve the energy envelope. In many cases, as you see on the right there, insulation can be blown into an existing wall into the cavities in an existing wall without doing a lot of cosmetic disturbance same with work around structural members. You know, and openings in around cellars and basements or roof insulation or things of that nature. So a lot of really air sealing around windows, we're not talking about passive house level. Super tight envelopes, you're talking about just improving existing building envelopes, so that you can really reduce the heat loss or the loss of energy in the summer from losing cooling so making the buildings more comfortable, more energy efficient is something people do not pay a lot attention to. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of incentives to work, but we're promoting it, because it's the way to save money and create a healthier and and more energy, efficient building, air source, heat pumps or mini splits, which many of you may be familiar with. You see the outdoor units everywhere. These are the the condenser units which can sit down a yard or on a roof or be mounted on a wall. These are tremendously efficient because they do not burn fuel to make heating or cooling. They use the outside air to transfer heat. Since they use a refrigerant, they can actually draw heat from Sub zero temperatures. So the advance in the last few years has been that these Air Source heat pumps, which used to be primarily for cooling, can now also provide heating down to below zero very efficiently again because they do not burn fuel. They just move heat from the outside to the inside, or vice versa. When they're cooling from the inside to the outside they're very easy to control, they can be mounted on a wall. The mini split that you see the cartridges you're probably familiar with some people, do not love them. Similar technologies can be recessed up into a ceiling or mounted like a radiator on the floor. There are different ways to incorporate them with ducts in other ways, so without going into too much detail. This is the way that the city and the state very much want us to move to heat with electricity and use this type of technology, which is improving it's very steadily, improving, even the refrigerants that are being used, which currently are not wonderful in terms of their greenhouse gas impacts. These systems are closed. So if it's installed properly, none of this leaks out, but in the future the plan is to improve those refrigerant gases, to the point where they would be much less impactful, even possibly using co2 as a refrigerant gas. So the technology is improving. When you get into larger installations, bigger than say a home or a say, a store or a small retail space or a small office, you would move to what's called vrfs or variable refrigerant flow, which is a similar technology, but a larger installation which allows for distribution of the refrigerant lines. These lines that are that are running from the outdoor unit to the indoor unit, carry the refrigerant line and allow you to transfer the heat from inside outside, so so the so this kind of technology can be applied to a much larger installation, say a big commercial space or school, or an institutional use or a multi- family use where the central system can distribute heating and cooling to individual units and that can be monitored as well. So it's one of the challenges that we face is that landlords provide heat in the city, but they do not provide cooling. We want to get rid of those window. Air conditioners, which are very inefficient and also provide for air leaks, and the challenge here is that you know how do you handle that split incentive where the landlord you know, if you, if you convert to this type of technology landlord, would not be paying for the heat the heat would be, could be applied to the tenant's electric bill. Then again, the tenant also gets a central air system, which is very easy to control and very comfortable. So there are trade- offs and there are ways to monitor and meter the usage so that you can modify a lease or or address that change in accountability or responsibility from a landlord to a tenant in co-, ops and condos. It's obviously different commercial, tenants, commercial landlords, so every property is different and every relationship is different, but that's one of the things we're trying to address so again. Just to finish the thought, your gas furnace is less efficient than a heat pump. Today, an air source heat pump, taking power electric power out of a power plant because the gas furnace is inefficient and even though the power plant on the and the line, the power lines are inefficient, the heat pump has multiples of it's. It's power, coefficient of production or corp. Coefficient of of a product of a power is two three or four times the source, so it's even more efficient today, but as the electric grid gets greener, we're going to save more greenhouse gas emissions and continue to be to be an efficient solution. This is our website. If you visit us at Heybrooklyn.Org, you can you can pull down from that property menu fill out a form we'll get in touch with you and and start the ball rolling. You can also find out about workforce training, volunteering and generally about our project. So I'm just going to go through a couple more items very quickly. Four steps apply, fill out. A form on the website. Assess will help you get either free or low cost energy or audit, depending on your property type, will help you finance it. There are low interest loans. We have a lease option: there are incentives which will help you get and we have. On the residential side. We have selected a couple of very good contractors to work with wonderful family buildings and we're also developing our list of commercial and multi- family contractors for the larger projects. Even though our campaign has been somewhat constrained by the pandemic we've, we have had a bunch of people sign up and we've had audits done and proposals sent out. So we have over 30 energy, obviously, we've completed and over 10 proposals out. We hope to get a couple of those signed up very soon, mostly on the small, wonderful families, but we also have some commercial projects and multifamily parts we're looking at here's, just a rough idea of the incentives available for the air source, heat pumps, there's for full load heating. So if you do essentially replace your heating system, then does not mean you take it out, but you replace the function of the heating system. Often the existing boilers are left in, as you know, as backups or the hot water heaters left in place, whatever the case may be, but if you do a full heating, meaning ninety percent of the load for your building, you can get a rebate of two thousand dollars per ten thousand btus and an average say a two family house. Typical is a two family Bro brown center townhouse and in our area might use 25 to 30,000 btus again everything you know, all the all the conditions are different, so there's substantial rebates, there's also a rebuild of a thousand dollars per hot water unit, there's also air source hot water heaters, which also work on electricity and work also very efficiently. There are I'll just show a couple of slides on the on the commercial multi- family, but those are very complex and take a little more work to determine what the incentives are: we're, also offering free workforce training classes. We actually just had the last round of the the best practices for installation of the air Source heat pumps. Last week, all the classes are available. They're recorded they've been virtual they're available. If you go online on our site, you can access those sign up to see those we have sales sales trainings coming up and those will also be posted we'll make sure to let everybody in CB6 know about those one of our commercial projects. We're doing is the Montauk club. You may be familiar with the Montauk club up near Grand, Army Plaza. The club itself is a private club which has retained the two lower floors for their ballroom and meeting rooms. The upper floors are now residential. Condos. Here are some images of those those rooms you can. You can see down here, one of the plaster murals of the exploits of our founding pilgrims and, in their no doubt, very fair and equitable dealings with the Native Americans, the Montauk tribe. I'm sure that these are somewhat idealized and perhaps maybe they deserve historic status, or maybe they do not. I'm not going to comment on that. The boiler in the Montauk club is dying, so they are going to no longer be able to make use of these steam radiators, and so the proposal is to install what will be a variable revision flow. Vrf system to serve the heating and cooling for these main two floors, which are used as wedding halls meeting halls with a lot of people in them. So they really have a demand for a good heating cooling system, we're actually working with a contractor and with the program, people that content and will down to make that happen and there's a learning curve, because this is a fairly new technology and also very new programs. The programs are just being implemented by the utilities having been transferred from connect Con. It also has a small, medium business. Direct install program, commercial channel program, won't go into all the details, but there are free or very low cost. Energy audits and studies that are provided and we're eager to work with. You know: small retail, small office and medium and large commercial, as well as multi- family projects, the the their incentives for Air, Force, Heat pumps, Ground source heat pumps, are not going to do a lot of those in New York City. But they are, you know, potentially a very you know: green energy source using the same technology, but using the ground as the heatsink. As opposed to ambient air and again hot water heaters, heat pump, hot water heaters also are available so different categories and with different levels of incentives, either for the capacity of the unit or the energy savings. Actually how much? How much energy you're saving by taking an old boiler or an old, inefficient HVAC system out of service, replacing it with an efficient air heat pump installation, and so there are various levels of incentive and, in the case of anything larger than a you know, a you know, small residential building or small retail space. You need some engineering to ascertain what the best installation is and also what the actual incentives are. What path you need to take to find the best incentives in the Beth installation, incidentally, Con Edisonison has a thing called the neighborhood program, which is an expansion of what used to be called the Bqd and the Brooklyn queen's demand management program. This is the area of of Grid stress. The stressed power grid used to be folk, concentrated in southeastern Brooklyn and up into Williamsburg around what was called the Brownsville. So was the brown the Brownsville. You know power center substation. Excuse me now. That area has been expanded to include parts of downtown Brooklyn, Clinton hill and park slope, so there actually are some additional incentives, because this is an area that is in need of peak reduction, Con Edison and a New York state, the power of the New York Authority determined that these areas need peak reduction. So there are some additional incentives for these efficient systems in our area. Due to the neighborhood program, we also have an option for lease, so a multi- family or commercial application can install airsource heat pumps as a service with no upfront capital cost of the operations and maintenance of the systems are included in the lease and the leases calculated, so that the energy savings will cover the cost of the lease. These will be revenue, neutral revenue, negative money, saving for the owner. The owners of the properties block power is offering these lease deals and we're trying to align some of those up as well. So again, save energy of the planet can visit us at heybrooklyn.org fill out a form. We have forms for different building types you can find out about workforce training more about our program and, if you'd like to volunteer and help us great, what I'd love for you, members of Community board, six and members of the parks and environmental Protection Committee to help us with would be to help us reach out to community groups in your area already have a really. We already have a relationship with ready and resilient red Hook Brad Lander was hosted one of our webinars. We've done. I think 10 webinars since the spring and we're working with 350, Brooklyn and others, but any help you could give us to reach out to block associations or community groups that might be able to help us engage and have people participate in the program. We would much appreciate it. I hope there's a few minutes for me to take your questions. Yes, thank you, Heim. That was great. I'm going to start with one quick question: how does how do the air source heat pumps impact indoor air quality? Are they better for like filtering out things that might concern people with Covid-19, or are they worse at that? What is that like? Well, the Air Source heat pumps, the Air source heat pumps by themselves, recirculate indoor air, so there could be a an air change now again the difference between a typical installation where you have a level of air leakage. You have a level of fresh air that comes in just through you know the porous nature of the building or the fact that you know doors open and close in the winter. You know you can open and close your window, but in a passive house installation. What you do is you actually, because the envelope is so tight, you actually provide for a recirculation of outdoor air and you use what's called energy recovery ventilation to keep the heat in or the coolant. As the case may be, with air Source heat pumps, you would need to actually add some feature to bring in outside air to get the air circulation generally. If you do not seal up an envelope to a passive house level, you have enough air circulation. Just air changes through normal use, people coming and going- and you know the normal leakage. So the air indoor, air quality is an interesting question. You can add filters to the to the the air handle units in within the installation. There are various ways to to filter using Hepa filters or ultraviolet light or different ways to you know, kill bacteria or viruses. What's the right word pathogens in the air and those can be added to the systems. If you have a larger system that already has ducts in it, then that can be added to the duct air circulation features of the the ducted system- or you can just you know, have a way to transfer air in and out, and there are fans that are used, for example, in passivhaus construction that are really just dedicated energy recovery ventilation, fans that are designed to give you a measure of fresh air air changes but preserve the temperature from the inside and avoid heat loss. So that's a very good question, something a lot of people are thinking about and it really depends on the type of system, but it is a feature that can be added. Yes, I have a couple questions. I I'm fascinated by all this new tech that I know very little about so they're, probably remedial questions, but no there's no dumb questions great. Does the unit have any effect on the outside air? The way that our conventional acs heat everything up? Does it like as it circulating? Does it change things outside at all? It does, but it's it works. It works at a much higher level of efficiency, so it pushes it pushes a lot less heat out during the summertime and for what it's worth it it does not. You know, increase the lower the temperature in the in the winter time it and no it's. I understand what you're saying and there is an element to you know. You know what are you doing to the to the ambient air? I think the challenge in terms of and it's a very good question in terms of you know. What are we talking about? We're talking about extreme the extreme local concern, the indoor equality, then the next level would be the community or the block ambient air right and then beyond. To the you know, the city and the and the and the the region and the planet the great benefit of this technology. If we can insulate the existing buildings and we're really concentrating here on existing buildings to be more efficient and clean the grid- and this is the second part of the you know or another part of the object- the objective of the climate protection and climate leadership. You know the clc PA on the state side and climate mobilization Act in the city is to greatly increase the renewable energy available to the grid, so that we have a greener grid with a lot of offshore and onshore wind and a lot more solar, so that elect electrification becomes cleaner energy by removing the localized. Your the boiler, that is in your basement, most likely, that is burning gas and to heat and make hot water. That's the greatest culprit to the local environmental quality that we'd like to remove, and the expectation is that with a cleaner grid and very efficient heating and cooling will do less damage to the local environment and the global environment. That's the plan. I hope that answers your question. It does. Thank you another question about cooking. Is there any element in this plan to help people transition away from gas cooking, because I know that's something that keeps people from wanting to seal up their envelope? It's just concern about. What's it what additives and things are in the cooking gas right very good point- this is not a you know: it's not a particular element in our program, but it's a more general challenge. If we can remove the heating and hot water oilers, that would be a great step, but my understanding is- and I've worked with them a little bit. The convection cooking is that it, the electric convection cooking, is really quite good and supposedly, if you know what you're doing it can be as enjoyable and effective a way to cook, then as natural gas, I think it's going to get there. But I hear what you're saying about sealing up and worrying about. You know the cooking gas. I think, probably the solution there would be to you know to have you know a ducted, hood and or move to convection cooking, but I think that you know somewhere down the line. Convection cooking will also likely be replacing cooking with natural gas, as we know, is a lot of fighting going on about gas infrastructure, and you know gas moratoriums and things like that. They're, not turning the gas off yet, but probably be a good thing to learn how to cook with electricity. Exactly thank you. I'm curious about the incentives you had a chart that showed consumer incentives and I'm just wondering why there's an incentive for the contractors, that's a very good question, but they've structured it this way in part, because a great challenge right now- and this is part of the work we're doing with the workforce- training segment of the project- the industry- is still heavily weighted. This is true across the United States and not true in Europe and other parts of the world, but in our region. Certainly, the industry is heavily weighted towards fossil fuel heating. So what one of the things we're trying to do, and one of the reasons that there's this incentive at this point is to try to train and and persuade contractors who are doing. You know oil and gas boilers and other HVAC work to transition over to Air Source heat pumps. So they're really trying to you, know, instigate a transition in the industry, and so I believe, that's why they're giving some money to the contractors. In some cases the contractors do pass those on to the to the to the customers and we've established our program in such a way that we have two Airshow C- pump contractors. So if you want say you're doing a wonderful family house- and you want to get two bids- we can get you two beds using two different. In most cases, one would be a Mitsubishi Air, Source, Heat pump contractor the other might be we're using daiken or Fujitsu or another brand. So you have a chance of getting not only slightly different types of equipment which might or might not, you know fit your exact needs, but also a different price from contracts. We also have two contractors who are providing energy efficiency services, so you can get some bids on that as well on the commercial side and the multi- family side, there are several larger contractors who can bid on projects as well. So you know those incentives, whether they go to the contractor and stay with the contractor or end up getting folded into an incentive for the customer as part of the negotiation. That's you know to be determined, but there is not an element of this where I think competition is very valuable and for what it's worth Nyserda has determined. You know the levels of incentives, you know for various types of applications, and some of those rewards, as you said, are going to the contractor and that's a an attempt to get them to. You know reach a certain critical mass to where this becomes much more of a habit in the industry, whereas now it is it's fairly. It's fairly. You know rare to see to see these kinds of installations outside of a very luxury installation. In most cases, or particular, you know case where there is not access to you know. Central heating or central cooling, otherwise makes sense to me and I'll tell you, I'm interested so I'll be reaching out. Thank you very much appreciate it, love to love, to talk to you, one more quick question: can the pumps be installed at roof level, or do they need to be yeah? They can okay, they can be installed in an outdoor space on the roof. Many of them are installed on the roof. As a matter of fact, there's a really great synergy or a complementary character between Solar, pv and Air, Source heat pumps and one of the things we're trying to get Kanye's attention about. But you try to get Con Edison's attention about something right, not easy in this area. This neighborhood program area, where they say they're interested in reducing the peak load having Solar Pv, feeding an air source heat pump in the middle of the summer time. Is it just a? Not only? Is there a natural synergy between the two but you're greatly reducing the peak load, your and, if you can add storage to that, then you're doing great. But you know one of the things we'd like to investigate and we may have an opportunity to do this on. Some of our projects is to have Brooklyn solarworks. Do a solar installation in conjunction with an air source, heat pump installation, and then we can monitor how how that affects the electric usage. That's why I asked. Actually. I can already be your guinea pig for that because we have the solar already and I'm just it just makes perfect sense. It would yeah it would be huge, they can work together and then Angelica could probably has, but maybe could tell you a lot about battery storage options, perhaps not quite as available as we hope to most users in New York City, but if that's coming, then there may be an opportunity to really have a level of resilience as well heating and hot water power, and you know a level of flexibility and how you use that in New York City. That would be great, but maybe we're not there quite yet, I hope very soon, not quite yet, but hopefully very soon, okay good. So I will send out a summary of our meeting tonight to the committee. Once I get the powerpoint from the parks Department. If I might suggest then Angelica you sort of reply with this information as much as you think is appropriate, whether the entire presentation or just that handout card and description of the presentation as you as you wish to. Let our committee know you know, since so few of us are here yeah. That sounds good and I think one of the things time and I talked about before- and I think he mentioned this earlier- is potentially getting us to be one of the co- sponsors to one of these larger events where they go more into the tech and the incentives. And what it looks like I do not know is that something that we'd be interested in doing as a group. Is that something that we've done in the past and try to try to do this again in a bit more depth and invite the rest of the board and the community? Somehow right? That's the idea. We've done, webinars, they're, usually 90 minutes on a Tuesday evening. We've and a bunch of them are by the way, are recorded and you can access the slides and also the recordings on our website. We've done them, for you know. You know row house type projects, we've done them for commercial projects. We did one focused for on Atlantic Enter, Homeowners Association may be familiar with them, they're right over by Barclay Center, they're kind of a community of townhouses that are privately owned, but have a they were. All built, you know in a similar time and similar type of building with common parking areas and we've had you know various co- hosts. We always have people from nice, certain who can really answer detailed questions. Often we have our contractors or engineers or others who can really speak to some of these technical and other issues, and we, you know we could help. You know produce one of these webinars with you specifically for the community, I'm sure we could get a resilient red hook to participate, maybe 350, Brooklyn and others. But if Angelica you and the committee want to talk to us about putting one together, we're eager to do it. Our project is now scheduled to run through the spring into the summer. You know the schedule is sort of up in the air, obviously with the pandemic, but you know if we could talk about doing this. We'd love to also I'm going to share some of this material with Michael, who, I think is going to just help spread the word on the you know the CB6 newsletters, but I'd love to coordinate with you on this or any other outreach. Great Angelica, when you send the information out, we can kick it around the committee and let Mike and Peter know and see if we can find some way to sort of widen the reach great. Does anybody else have any questions from Heim any of the people who are not on the panel? Well, most of them have left. We have two left, oh boy, okay! Well, I thank you and thank you. I hope I did not push you over your time limit. It's all good, but before everybody leaves for meeting next month, we have we're going to have an environmental justice, slash environmental racism, discussion, wow yeah, and we want to bring more environmental topics to the parks and environmental Protection Committee. So Mike and I are working on a survey that we'll send out to you guys into the community to see what people are interested in and who we can get to speak and how this all ties into our community so keep an eye out for that soon, cool Ken's great. So if there's nothing else, I just want to say thank you Angelica, for you know hosting us tonight with your your knowledge and skills, because I do not have a clue with this, so I'm on zoom every day, almost all day, so yeah, I'm sorry for that. Hopefully, we'll get past this I mean it's nice, but you know I miss the meetings, but it's nice to see all your faces. Absolutely and of course, landmark land use tomorrow and I've got permits and licenses next week, and here we get going yeah. So I bid you all good night and until next time. Thank you see you soon. Thank you.",
            "summary": "We have regional manager, denise palmer on the on the call denise is in charge of the whole western part of Brooklyn Then we also have the director of capital, projects, Christian, dolly and so, So Chris is going to run through the capital status in a little bit, But, I'm, the chief of staff for operations here in Brooklyn at the New York City, Parks, Department, Chris, Denise, and I all work for Commissioner, Marty, Marr.\nSkate parks are open, grilling, areas, dog runs, basketball, courts are open, basketball courts are open, but You know we are asking people not to play.\nWe do not really have the personnel to look into it fully, but you know we ask that people just kind of practice and try to stay as socially distant as possible.\nYou know does not help that DOE is redoing all the sidewalks around the center at the moment, but we are getting by so that kind of I'm, trying.\nThat stuff has since resumed everything that was in procurement if it got far enough along those project has moved forward, but everything else, that's in the procurement phase, is currently on hold due to the budget office kind of waiting to see what the city is fiscally able to do.\nDole, I'm, the director of capital projects for New York city parks in Brooklyn.\nWe knew that you know this was a very important project to the community So brand new playground, basketball, court, small synthetic turf, lawn.\nWe hope that this one can start fall of 21 as well, and then everybody's favorite topic, You know for a couple years now, But some of the dates have kind of changed, and some of it is related to Covid-19.\nBut I can ask the people from our planning office to see if there is any update on that project, I'm going to just unmute Mac. What's, going on, I, live in Gowanus around Smith and ninth street and have become involved with public place through a group, but I've started with a few other people called Gowanuslands.\nOrg that is advocating for a park on public place, and one thing we found is just that: there's a tremendous amount of local community interest in having a park on the place, which is actually consistent with the current zoned protections for the for the site which were put in place in the 70s My question to you guys is given that there have been a few different proposals for the site, including like the recent DCP proposal, to have some kind of development.\nWe can't take on a site without staffing, The second thing: is: If we're going to be given land, it has to be remediated to the point where you know all the bad stuff under the soil, whether it's metals And, then the third thing is going to be money to actually renovate it.\nPlanning, determines what parks's involvement with the site is But, happy to run through all that stuff with you in person and see how we can both advocate for better open, space.\nIt is a capital project of sorts Then, since you showed Anna's playground, I'm wondering if you'd had any contact with the neighbors immediately east of the playground, because they had reached out to me after the park was opened to say that you know they wanted some sort of privacy screen put on that fence.\nBut I'm, just concerned, because skate parks are a place where people come and linger for hours and hours and given its proximity to the high traffic area, there I was thinking.\nI know where we are making it much more of a park- like setting so green Anything like that, just to direct the right, fresh air fountains next to the water fountains.\nJust it's just a general concern of mine is that so much of our park land is near As. My ways we're increasing the permeability of the site for sure it's going to be much more of a park- Like setting we're going to add a lot of planting There's in addition to the skate, park, there's sort of a pedestrian plaza that'll have a lot of planting, so I won't just be a concrete jungle.\nYou asked that because I passed by there, the other day, I'm, always very aware when I started, seeing a lot of cars parking, so they've stayed awful on top of the space Actually the city came and put in, I.\nI pushed them as much as I could, but they did not seem terribly interested, but it seems a shame to just leave that this is the unmarked the paper street between the storage, Borings to see you know what the what the ground soil is like, but no word on whether somebody's going to step up D.O.T clean it up, turn it over for public use.\nCan you put in a work order for Chris until Chris Mcmillan to look at You know normally cracks on the ground is caused by something else, whether it's water moving or underground If there's a way, we can patch it or smooth it over, or at least maybe feather it down, so you can at least play on it.\nYou know the developer, or the contractor at NYCHA was trying to do something with it, but He wanted to kind of chip in somehow, but there was not a way to make it.\nWhile he's unmuting he's going to be talking about Brooklyn heat, smart, cool, smart and It's, a program that is focused on electrifying, our heating , all right Let me just open this up.\nI live on 15th street, although I'm a lifelong new yorker from downtown Manhattan and uptown Manhattan other parts of the city, but my roots are in Brooklyn and now I'm back I, hope to improving the environment and addressing climate change in New, York City, and particularly in Brooklyn, I'm, going to try very quickly to present this project to you so that we have some time for conversation.\nSuper, tight, envelopes, you're talking about just improving existing building envelopes, so that you can really reduce the heat loss or the loss of energy in the summer from losing cooling so making the buildings more comfortable, more energy efficient is something people do not pay a lot attention.\nUnfortunately, there's not a lot of incentives to work, but we're promoting it, because it's the way to save money and create a healthier and and more energy, efficient, building, air, source, heat pumps or mini splits, which many of you may be familiar.\nThe advance in the last few years has been that these Air Source heat pumps, which used to be primarily for cooling, can now also provide heating down to below zero very efficiently again because they do not burn fuel.\nThis is the way that the city and the state very much want us to move to heat with electricity and use this type of technology, which is improving.\nThis kind of technology can be applied to a much larger installation, say a big commercial space or school, or an institutional use or a multi- family use where the central system can distribute heating and cooling to individual units and that can be monitored.\nWe actually just had the last round of the the best practices for installation of the air Source heat pumps.\nYou can access those sign up to see those we have sales sales trainings coming up and those will also be posted we'll make sure to let everybody in CB6 know about those one of our commercial projects.\nSo, they really have a demand for a good heating, cooling system, we're actually working with a contractor and with the program, people that content and will down to make that happen.\nYou, know, small retail, small office and medium and large commercial, as well as multi- family projects.\nHeaters, heat pump, hot water heaters also are available so different categories and with different levels of incentives, either for the capacity of the unit or the energy savings.\nHow, much energy you're saving by taking an old boiler or an old, inefficient HVAC system out of service, replacing it with an efficient air heat pump, installation, and so there are various levels of incentive.\nWe also have an option for lease, so a multi- family or commercial application can install airsource heat pumps as a service with no upfront capital cost of the operations and maintenance of the systems are included in the lease and the leases calculated, so that the energy savings will cover the cost of the lease.\nIf you know what you're doing it can be as enjoyable and effective a way to cook, Then as natural gas, I think it's going to get there.\nYou know oil and gas boilers and other HVAC work to transition over to Air Source heat pumps.\nIn conjunction with an air source, heat pump, installation, And, then we can monitor how how that affects the electric usage.\nBut if that's coming, then there may be an opportunity to really have a level of resilience as well heating and hot water power, and you know a level of flexibility and how you use that in New, York City."
