            "fullTranscript": "She will do more odd number to follow up on discussions from the last meeting, Hey Isabella's request for books and magazines, the future of meetings, seniors and community unable to join meetings because of lack of equipment, technology skills, etc, long lines of businesses, including banks, post office, etc, making it extremely difficult for the seniors and disabled, and then it's you know the usual new business announcements. Next meeting. Ok, any questions about the agenda. Yes, I'm! Sorry I wish dad. Okay, what's up, I have a resolution to present okay got it, and could you explain to me how to unraised my hand so I'm not interrupting people? You got me. Okay, it's fine! Okay, I expect other people to be joining us, but let's begin so again welcome everybody to the meeting we had. Thank you sure we shared a couple of things. Hi Sally, welcome to the meeting I'm on my phone I. Do not really know how to use it that! Well, that's! Ok! That's what I have to do when I'm at home, so yeah just hang on just want to check in Yosef. You were not at the last not able to be at the last meeting for circumstances beyond your control. I know how's everything going with you thank God I'm, actually not in the city now we're in Maryland and my mother- in- law's home. So a little more space here for myself and for the kids, but watching and listening to what's going on in the city closely I can't say it makes me want to return home soon, guys we're good thank God, so Tara your mother. Just out of curiosity, do they have another room? Hey that's a good question I. If I have to go outside I'll show you the pool, that's nice: where is it I'm, Silver, Spring, Maryland, Oh? Wonderful! That's you! Terrific! Yes! But for you! Thank you. Thank that yeah I! Do it I, just I really do not need another room, but maybe in the future, not- too- distant future, yeah Jay. How are things going for you Jay, yeah, hello? How are things going for you about as usual? Okay, nothing has changed, we're still in a pandemic right and there are still major problems. I think, with the help of fern Hertzberg I have finally gotten the city to stop delivering uncalled for food deliveries, good cheap right, the only way she and it was to send a letter on her behalf and then my bag. At the same time before you do I love your scenes have not gotten any of the food requested, so this is a problem still right. So we've been hearing. It's amazing that we, you know having trouble getting food for the people that need it, and yet people that do not need it and do not want it can't stop Yo Morris. Welcome your modest you there she's, muted, need to unmute yourself with your muted. Welcome aboard Smith is a new public member to the committee. Great, so does that mean you have two public members now three uh- huh, three, oh good, okay, cool I mean you know yeah the more than workers it works for yep. Now it's perfect more voices Sally anything you want to share I, know you're keeping busy Sally so yeah and also because wanted one of the reasons I wanted to be in this meeting and I'm. Also on another meeting with Fountain house right now is that you had mentioned when you did your summary, that mental health needs for moving to your top priority and I just wanted to sort of weigh in on that and get some input. It does not have to be in this meeting, but to sort of see where your thinking is on that and then also I'm working with. We act on the key initiative on I mean I'm on their climate, democracy, working group and we're looking at heat issues and cooling centers and all that kind of stuff, and so I wanted to get and I'm, not sure if it's for you or through fern what the issues are that are communities facing with respect to getting the air conditioners that were supposed to be provided by the city, how they eligibility might have changed and also you know, utilization and what they might do during the pandemic. You know, what's going to happen to cooling centers, so I, just I sort of just went away in and sort of, listen but I. Think, as you know, with all with our community in general, I think you know what, if this pandemic ever ends, the next crisis we're going to face is mental health care services because of the crises that people have been through, in fact that we are not providing many of the impatient. Psych units have closed in our hospitals, including at Allen, pavilion and Brooklyn, etc, because those units have been transferred into Kovich units and I. Just you know, I think we're going to taste a huge crisis yeah anyway. So that's why I'm here, plus I love, inventing I actually have updates on some of the things you mentioned? Oh great, and otherwise the other issue has come up in what I guess is the noise issue and I'm I do not know they're facing it, especially if Isabella yeah, I'm helping Betty Lehman said she would be joining us. So I hope that since they able to do that so that we can, you know, get direct information from her. So I have a question for Sally this issues that you would like to add to the new business part of the meeting, or just these are just random questions that you have so I would like to say something about the a/ c, the air condition you know for information, so I'll wait until the end. If you know yeah, let me let me just go through. You know some of the updates that I've had from you know other meetings, and you know my dealings with other members of the board, Isabella's request for books and magazines. There was an issue because Daryl Cochrane had brought some magazines up to Isabel and security seemed to not know anything about that was brought up at the I think at the general meeting. So actually Betty was you know on that meeting as well, and Betty took care of that issue. She went. You know what she was up there the next day and spoke to security, so everybody's on board. Now. So, if you do bring, you know, books or magazines that they've requested for the residents. Let them know that they're from the Community Board and therefore Jessica Garcia, who was the director of recreation up there? Okay, as far as other issues with Isabel I'm, going to wait great joins us. Sorry, I have can I ask a really dumb question about the contributions. No questions are done. My touch always told me that I. Thank you very much. My teachers never told me that it was more like Sally. Another question. You know, I think the library has some special procedures once they reopen how they're going to handle books that come back into circulation, etc and I. Just wonder if Isabel has thought about that, like dude, when magazines come in or they get a quarantine the magazines for a couple weeks, and how do you dress? How do you address them? The risk of transmission and I just do not know, but I think that's something you know maybe Donita. At the end with library, I mean I behind asked her what the procedures are, but she could explain to us so we can save Isabella. You know the best practices from New York from New York Public Library. Are that you receive them, then they're held for a week before they're, distributed or two weeks or whatever the quarantine is for paper materials. Okay sounds like those are good idea. Justin. This goes to the Audubon Avenue facility right, the magazine, simple, yes, good and the books not extensive books, I mean they have a library. They have books, simple reading books. You know books with a lot of pictures, because a lot of the residents are, you know quite elderly and some have Alzheimer's they like to look at picture books. You know, maybe travel magazines, maybe you know books with that, have different kinds of pictures, whether the history books or you know, but some that there's not a lot of reading involved because they do not have the concentration you know and the ability to focus. You know lengthy period of time, so maybe people that had children or grandchildren that they have those really nice, their books, uh- huh and maybe they come printing over I mean they are very amusing. Some of thing and some of the you know sending over and over again. Maybe that would be you know. Okay, I. Look model. Sorry, the next item in the future of the meetings and seniors involved. In joining the meetings I mean there was some suggestion raised by the actually I think by Byrne and some of the we talked about it at the y- column, eating the possibility of using tablets having tablets for the seniors, and they seem to be a easier way to navigate the system and get into youtube or something like that for the activities that are actually being given by B by the Centers. So I do not know you know at least that's one thing, that's being thought about to involve seniors now, involving them in the zoom meetings like this. It's tough, it's tough yeah, but from what I'm told and I do not have a tablet, but I'm told the tablets are much less expensive than a laptop, so it would make it a little more reasonable. You know to be involved, so if there you know any thoughts about that or you know sources of purchasing tablets for seniors that can't afford them. I do not know we'll see if anybody has any comments on that. Well, I think that this is Maria. Maybe we could take a look of what resources we may have up here that they could donate a certain number of tablets, I'm looking at their project, or you know that they had the New York Presbyterian Hospital for the businesses to you know the incentives to the businesses that they they're getting a location. They have to apply them. Maybe that would be an issue there for the second round that they have. They already have one to help out for paying rent and salaries to some of the businesses that were closed, and now there is a second round that maybe the something could be done. I will ask a whole iottie start to see-. Give me some informations. If we can, if we can get some, you know, that's what it's going to ask if you could check into that that'd be great. The next item on the agenda is the long lines that seniors and everybody else have to wait in to get into certain businesses. Some of the places do not have these long lines anymore. I think people have figured out when to go when the lines are shorter, but there's still a lot of places that still have these long lines. I spoke to Domingo Estevez who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee I, spoke to him yesterday and one of the thoughts that he had was trying to reach out to you know, rather than change the hours, because some of them have hours for seniors like 8 o'clock in the morning. You know I mean I, do not know about all of you who are seniors. I, Richard I do not know about all of you who are seniors, but I do not get out of my house at 8 o'clock in the morning unless I'm going to see Bella for the exercise group, which is not happening so this day and age. You know if I get up at 8 o'clock in the morning I'm doing good, but rather than trying to change hours for all these businesses to a later hour. Suggestion from him was to try to have businesses accommodate the seniors. If there's a long line to let the seniors and disabled jump to the front of the line, you know, and they always when they're out of those long lines, there is somebody monitoring at the doorway. You know letting people in a few at a time. Is there any legislature on this meaning? Is anyone dictating that the businesses need to do this so just if they feel like it, because they're good people they're doing this? What do you mean, meaning if I, if I owned a Rite Aid, do I have to have a senior error at the beginning of the day or the end of the day or just if I decide to on my own and every business is deciding on their own I think that businesses are deciding on their own because right so then you're, depending on their goodwill, to do this right. If I had support from you know elected officials and making this more something that they more pressure somehow yeah, in other words a final business and I'm, not a nice guy. There's no reason to do this right, but we have Eli who's got. Who has a business? Okay, Eleazar, we have Ysidro who's on the bid. We have Domingo who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee, and we're hoping that between all these people, perhaps we can reach out to the businesses, and you know plea for their help with this. It's also the chain stores, it's not just the local businesses, it's the waiting on line in the in the larger supermarkets that might not even be owned by our local businesses. Right, however, they have managers and the manager can I think you know as a courtesy do that they can. You know they're the manager, so they have the ability to do. I. Think this kind of thing, I, agree: I recorded the local bounty I know that the Apple Van the Chase Bank years ago, because I used to go to the bank with my mom. They have a senior line just specifically for seniors of people with disabilities and if they have someone on line that will take care of them and there's another. You know regular line for this thing about the a o'clock in the morning. There was no way that I'm going to get out of my hat. My you know, get up my better a Oklo to get a six o'clock to get ready and since I that for most of the seniors also have home attendant and they do not start working. You know that early in the morning right so you know they are, they are on their own. So I think that would be. You know how many you know really large businesses do we have a seniors have to go out. You know regularly I'm, you know to bison, so I think it's really nice that it will allow I, think it will be up to the people on line to be kind enough to say. Could you know? Do you just take? You know, go ahead of me and since, like that, I will feel much better to see something like that done that implementing or trying to implement some rules and regulation the business so I know that some you know I really love. When someone you know I'm writing on there. You know and a person and people say. Will you take us to my school and I? You know I love it when they do that, but I think that if you know somebody students are not lying, I think that we should be able to say okay, but you just you like to go ahead of me only they have a car full of like fifty five items, but anyway, that would be something that we need to promote to be kind to one another: no one's ours, Ella's ours. You know on the Chamber of Commerce as well, so we complete you know we have an in chip leading with the Chamber of Commerce to help us with the shoes. So I think that was a good idea. I need to speak with Eliezer and a CEO yet, and you know so, I will do that. I want to pick up on a whole bunch of things that people said. Okay, I do not I, do not think there's a legislative solution here. I do not think it's entirely. The goodwill of business people that's happening, I think there's for the chains. There's been top- down pressure to do something like this. That's come from different places, I think and I do not think there's going to be a one-, size- fits- all solution to this yeah. How seniors would be given priority and businesses? That's a that's, maybe a little more challenge than it sounds like for local stores, with narrow aisles and small spaces and what it means to weave one of us through those spaces in close contact, I. Think if Le, you see Drew and Domingo we're willing to do some contact and figure it out if they may just come back with good information. I do not work with this, but I think having them as a next step is of much value in perhaps if we can involve all of the elected officials more in this in much the same way to figure out how to get to some problem solve. Thank you. Anyone else have anything to add new faces that you observe lines. Are the banks, the personal reasons of WebMD or one of the urges the urging both other places at this point? Do not, but I can only speak for a certain fact of the community that I've observed a few things, so there might be a little more tool both of the bank seem to be able to do then I kind of walk people ahead and have their own mechanisms. I know that if you have certain things that you do not need they're able to skip people around, and they do not have an issue with that, so that might be a good bet just to talk to them. So I think it would be good for I decide one anomaly yeah when you're talking about like urgent care centers and that kind of stuff I. You know, I know that the better health care providers are very specific in terms of arrival times in terms of getting people and because you know, deployments can be scheduled of all sorts in different times and I. Just I think that it's especially important when we're dealing with health care that you know I did not appoint me the other day, and they basically said to me. You know like when you call make the appointment. They always say like be there an hour beforehand and then, when I actually got to the office, areas going to, they said arrive no more than 15 minutes before your appointment and then you can come up because they do not want a lot of people do not yes of waiting rooms, I, screwed up and that kind of stuff, so I think that it also needs there needs to be some outreach, I guess to urgent care facilities and other groups that are dealing with specific medical needs, which is not which I do not consider business outreach. The volume down well I I'm, going to say something: hello, Carol, yeah hi is the person talking now go ahead. Carl no I was not going to say anything. Somebody else was: oh I'm. Sorry, no, that's! Okay! She did not say it. That's why I thought? Maybe you know hi I wanted to say something in regards to the lines and the business that I mean somehow I understand that it's not a regulation or a lot to do that. But if the committee sends a communication to businesses, they will do that during the pandemic time. I'm sure they will, because that's not a big issue and they also have to I believe they did I'm. Just it's. You know it's making it more difficult to educate people to stay on lines for so long right. So if we do, if we do send requests on the committee or the board since the request I'm sure they will they will, they will set up a line where we're on the other we will be, will have I mean priority, but Ned. You know in a in a organized way, it's saying to elderly and then one regular person, depending on how many is the people that can be inside I understand some businesses say no more than six the more than five. So something like that like, let's let let's give priority to two elderly people and then to people of people and then to more and like that. I do not see anything wrong with it join during this time. It's very you know. The other is anxious and it's having problems and waiting in line Under, the Sun or the heat. Or you know we have to there's something we could do about it and I think we should request that and I am sure the businesses will not say. No, not you know get upset with it. Carol did you want to say something: okay, I think you know, I agree with all of you. I mean I think that businesses will not fight this. We just have to organize around pleading to them, and so, if we get, you know, R 3, R, 3, board people who have access in a familiar way with those businesses and the. What do you call what am I trying to say any way that we can accomplish this? So hopefully you know with them. You know long before the next meeting. You know we can organize this, so I will be talking to all three of those people and see what we can get going. Okay and even if we can get it accomplished some of the businesses it's better than nothing. Oh yes, that is right. Okay, I just want to say a couple of things about under new business and then I can open it up. You know the CitiBikes are installing stations in our community. There were some concern expressed about City, fake stations being on a lot of them being on sidewalks that are narrow and therefore shortening you know: bada access getting by those stations, people with wheelchairs or walkers or whatever being- and you know, regular people trying to get by those stations in a reasonable way. Mta has promised that if this seems to be compromised, ABA access, they would not put a station there. So they've said that it got a couple of different meetings, so hopefully they will keep to their word. But if anybody sees anything that seems to be against that, please let me know, because I'm also on the traffic and transportation committee, so I can bring that up there. Okay, anything to say about that. The other thing I'm concerned about there's tables and chairs outside restaurants, on sidewalks and on the curbs that are now being allowed. Although the businesses have to apply for a permit to do that, those tables are not six feet apart. There is no social distancing there right and I. Think they're going to open up, Audubon I. Think yeah I read that that's being opened up to so that's another street, that's going to be impacted, but yeah it's right, but all streets are being impacted because there are these tables and chairs outside the sidewalks are not navigable and they're building their building. You know these platforms on the curb yeah one of the restaurants, but their tables are too close together. That's the problem, people you can't get by on 172 and Broadway this new restaurant Havana Heights as tables and chairs. You know on top of each other, so oh I do not know if that's something that the guidelines are fairly specific in terms of you know what the way I was supposed to be. I do not know if that is something that, if they're you know that could also be addressed by Ysidro or someone. You know in this agilent it's actually the OT do T's in charge and so I'm going to be putting in a call two three one great plane about three different places that I see is a problem, so make sure that they understand the guidelines because I feel like some people just do not. So that would be I. Think I think the guidelines are fairly straightforward, I, just at least in my neighborhood I think it's more business are hurting and they're trying to get away with as much as they can right. You can, because they're trying to make up for lost revenue that they do not know will ever come back and now that's you know. The decision was made, which I think was a good decision not to open the insides. You know people are, you know, basically struggling for their lives and I think that we have to address the fact that you know as much as we want the economy to get back together. We do not want it awesome, human life and that's the problem. You know this is a real public health and public safety issue. Exactly and I mean you know, I I'm understanding that, because I'm a person who's very much against the you know the unenclosed out, you know sidewalk cafes or in close to whatever it might be, if they're compromising the ability for the disabled to get by and that's what's happening. I have my Walker and let me tell you: I often have to wait for the other lines go by before I. You know navigate so well, not to mention also the Revell scooters and all that kind of stuff. You know riding up and down I mean it's terrifying, uh- huh I, do not you know. I have been pretty much staying inside, but I'll tell you something you know after it's, it was dark enough for fireworks to go off, there's no way I'm going outside, because not only people idiots for setting them off, but they're idiots and do not have particularly good aim and I really do not want a roman candle landing in my stomach so and I'm sure that those same concerns are affecting people at Isabella and the elderly throttle community people can't sleep and they do not feel safe when they go outside say. Was that you yes go ahead? I took a brief survey. I walked between 187th Street and Fort Washington, and a hundred and seventy fifth in Broadway yesterday and I did not see one restaurant that had actually followed the guidelines which, in addition to six feet apart for the tables, include having a barrier and allowing for eight feet of sidewalk space for pedestrians beyond the barrier. Would you be willing to call three calling a complaint? Two three one well I called in a complaint to three one as I'm saying. First, restaurant that opened before tables were permitted and nothing was done in addition to that. I spoke to the head of the Business Improvement District and asked him to explain to the restaurant owner that he may be jeopardizing his liquor license, but none of that helped so I have my doubts whether the city is willing to enforce those rules in Washington, Heights I'm, not aware of the situation at all in word, though, well I think the more that we call in the complaints. So you know at least this record of the complaints being. You know, and it's also like I said those rules are being implemented and I do not know about monitoring by do Qi, so you know we have to find out who and do T that we next go to and I will I will follow through on that because, as we all know, 3- 1- 1 complaints do not always get looked into at all. If ever so the next step I think would agree to go directly to do. T. Sorry, I'm, sorry go ahead. You know I was just going to say my experience with 3- 1- 1 is. The main purpose it serves is to divert calls from 9- 1- 1 do not, along with 9- 1- 1, as opposed to responding to problems. Yeah I hear ya, so you know this is hi. This is Marie I. Can you hear me for a little second yep? Okay, I. Do not think that the three one when they said of the three one it was to divert complaints may directly to the community boards. The community boats used to get all these complaints and channel them to the proper agencies. So they combine everything under the 3- 1- 1, but I think that I'm in order to be fair to businesses. If I am going to be coming into a place or use the sidewalk I will say to the whoever is sitting me. But you see that the table we are a little too close to each other and suppose I do not want to feel that they that they do not feel that we are attacking them after all, this period that they have, they did not have any businesses. So I think that we had to be a little subtle about how we complain and maybe they will comply. Maybe there you know some of them never have a permit to have outside businesses. So this is right, then, so we need to be a little. You know her for about. You know how we go about this thing. I think that we they will hear us if we the same thing that I've been talking about with the police department. Somebody peer meetings with businesses that provide liquor. I said today: if you see someone that have one drink too many, please let them know. This is a community residential community, but they should go either home, do not serve thing anymore, liquor and that any noise that they that they made outside of the business is going to be impacted on their business. So I think we had to be. You know in this type of crisis. We need to be a little. You know sensitive about some of the things that we are complaining about, or that we do not agree with I. Think Marines are 100 percent right and her concerns as well. I had mentioned previously because they had done work for some folks in Dyckman that people are concerns about, and they were able to kind of not only make sure that people had an understanding of the rules, but had a copy of the rules that things have changed, but I think now they're a lot clearer, but after they have that conversation, they were like alright cool, we'll make certain changes that were supposed to make because again, as Maria said, that could be seeming threatening where people probably never spoken to them before, especially there are newer business and I would use the example of the Havana Hyah Oh was trying to open when the pandemic began. Well again, I think it's important to address that folks need to get around. They need to get around safely, and it is not fair for you Mary to have to wait for people to walk by because there's so many things going on outside. But how can we best leverage, especially when there's a bunch of new places now, especially when the real locations are places that have been closed just to like work at the community? Again right? You can try that if it does not work, then great, but at least you can say, hey reach out to you and nothing has been done or you are we're not following the rules, because I think it's important to also think about that piece. Even though people have the complete right to be able to get places on time without having to wait or Carol did you want to say something yeah, I really kind of it's a ticklish situation. You know, because it's very sad that you know they're hanging on by their bootstraps some of these places so I kind of said. We got a walk, a middle ground. We can't have you know not getting by. On the other hand, you can't really expect them to do things perfectly that they've never done before. So we have I mean what I think I mean to walk a middle ground. Yeah I mean when I say we have to I'd like to see us walk a middle ground agreed Julie. Are you there? Are you with us Hi Shirley? Ok, how you doing! Thank you good anything inviting me anything you wanted to share at this point. Oh no III I really have not. You guys are much more experienced on this board than I am I just wanted to I know. I have not been able to come so much to the in- person meetings because we have staff constraints, but now it's zoom I feel like I am more able to attend because I can I'm not being out of the office so to speak. Does everybody knows Shirley I know Maria. Oh, if she's helped me a lot, Shirley is the executive director of Mariah Senior Center, no Carol I only deal I was trying to say I did not. I did not hear your name right when you first came on, but certainly yes, of course, I'm hanging on the phone, so I do not get to see you but hello to you a little bit of normalcy. Okay, the next thing that came up somebody brought up the air conditioners. I can't remember who it was, is that you Sally I, think Sally air conditioners yeah. Can you we've been making those air conditioner calls and we've? Actually had success, some of our seniors have. Let us know that they actually did get their air conditioners. Let me just back up Shirley. Let me just back up for a minute, because the people that are not involved with you know the board, or you know, with the I'm. Sorry with the you know why Cola or the centers do not know the background do not necessarily know the background about these air conditioners. So just maybe, if you want to do that, Shirley just back up out a little bit. Oh you want you want me to if the government of the aging is trying, since they can't really decide what they want to do about cooling centers, you know. In the past, historically senior centers have been cooling, centers, other locations have been cooling, centers I think they're actually going to be opening some senior centers as cooling, centers they're, making it optional now, and it's only going to be for their seniors, not for the general public, but in order to accommodate other seniors who might not be willing to go out or able to go out during Corona, there has been a very big high push campaign, that's still not over to get three air conditioners to the seniors installed in their homes and basically the senior centers have been making hundreds and hundreds of calls and I'm told. Another list is dropping on Monday to seniors to see if they are eligible to get these free air conditioners, and we have had some success with it. I personally do have some concerns, which are very similar to your concerns about the technology issue that it's very nice that we're giving these seniors as air conditioners in their homes, but the biggest expense on an air conditioner is not the purchase or the installation. For me, the biggest expense is running it personally and that's something that has not yet been addressed and I would like to see that address. I know for myself an air conditioner. Yes, it's a one- time expense but I'm I hate to I hate, to run it, and now that I'm working remotely oh I I'm, my own home I, hesitate to turn the air conditioner on as much it's expensive. So we have to think about what we can do about that portion of it also, but the campaign itself seems to be successful and it's up and running and we keep getting lists of names to call and we've been reaching out and reaching out and trying to get air conditioners into these homes. Some people have expressed interest in fans and unfortunately, that's not part of the program. Thank you. Anyone have anything else. Oh I said that I have a comment. I have been very successful, is Maria I'm reaching out to 3- 1- 1. They do not ask the many question. They ask the person, you know the and they fully five for whatever services and since like that we're saying three days if people have receipt, the air condition and install and everything now the second part of the issue which is dispenser paying the electric noise, the Canaries do not have a program. If you get a bill from the I'm, the one of the you know. Long pages understand that is a number there. You can contact, especially for seniors and people that have low exposure, so I think we have to take advantage and in another way to you, know these new condition. So you know it's going to be crazy. It is going to probably include is a little but a be a con. Edison is giving serious and opportunity to lower the cost so, but then take advantage of some more companies are calling and saying you know, you're going to be so busy switch to and do not try I do not I do not to do name. You may get a real, largely higher than the one that you get from Con Edison, but that's not the information they only asked for you know the age president. You have air condition before you do not have it if you have some type of like that, so it's really. They are really rush in this thing right. I, when you come here one they usually say you do I number like two hundred well, that number goes fast down, so do not get, is so discouraged. They'll. Take that call you know within maybe 45 minutes. You know the longer that I have being on the line for that Maria. One question: yes, do you think that, given that the fiscal year just began again gee do you think they were rushing it because they were trying to close out fiscal year? Twenty no I do not think so. Okay, do you live in the HPA? You know all right. So that's what I in my experience so far, okay, Thank, You, Maria I- think they were writing the information. That's we had a little hot weather, muggy weather, so I think they was predicting that it was going to be a hot summer. I think that was part of the rushing Mm-. Hmm I mean air conditioners. If they gathered in the October would not be very effective, but the other thing in terms of I know you know with opening cooling centers they're talking about you know they used to have them open. When there were successive 90-degree days now we're talking about the cooling centers not being opened in ninety five, three consecutive 95\u00b0 days, I mean right yeah, you know, I mean I'll, be like very fiery, now, they're very fussy as to who would be it because you have to be over 10,000 feet. Well, what's the social distancing and all that-, it's even worse, yeah did we at one point it was years ago, I looked at a map of him, it seemed like we did not have it or maybe we only had one in the Community Board district, one accessible polling Center. Is that still the case? I do not know no I. Do not think, though we were in cooling. Okay, except now we're not I, do not think we would the only one mm-, hmm, okay, well I'm, going to call it come cool off at your place. Betty. Are you with us daddy Lehman? Are you muted? Are you with us I'm? Sorry, yes, I am with you all right! Welcome aboard okay. How is everybody good pretty good? Considering we've been talking about a lot of different issues, I was waiting because I had an update. You know on as a fella gave the update, and you know what you took care of as far as the donations of books magazines being delivered to Isabella, we very appreciative of them. The magazines that have come in what happens is they are brought in either to myself or to the Recreation Department. There you're dropped off at the main entrance, because no one can get in the building and so they're taken to the library and then they're picked up either by myself or by the Recreation Department, and then they brought upstairs they're sanitized, they're, sorted out and sanitized just be careful and then we're able to distribute them to the residents. As you can imagine, it's very difficult for the residents because I have not seen family or friends in April May June. Almost four months now we have just started a system of video. Chats we've been doing that since the beginning, but we're also having window visits now, so people can arrange to have a window visit. We have a garden area in the back where people you know can gather outside and then we can bring someone down to the coffee shop with they have floor- to- ceiling windows, and then we have some also some windows in the other building the five one five building. So what happens? Is the family member context, the social worker and they work at a time? And then the staff brings down the resident to the area and then the family comes to visit. The visiting times are limited to a half an hour, we're working also on a plan eventually to be able to allow in- person visits. But everything ties to what the governor determines right now he's not permitting any in- person visits for anyone in the nursing homes anywhere in New York State. Until that changes, we can't do anything about bringing people and to visit. The only exceptions are if someone is actively dying and the process of dying, then someone you know, then we can make arrangement for one family member to come in and visit other than that. We can't do anything fortunately well we're very appreciative of their donations of magazines or any books, English or Spanish. We'll both would be fabulous, so I'm really happy about them. So that's it! You are. We have ours, our recreation therapy group working very well with the residents using video chats to connect your family members and so forth. So that's something that's an ongoing process. That's all I have Betty, can I ask you a question: do you have like I mean I would be happy to do an activity if there's a way that I consume and you do they have the capability like it's. If someone wanted to you do a planting thing, I could get supplies to you and then I could teach people we boat lis. It's that way. I talk to them about that, because a couple of groups reached out to me. You early on to try to set something up on zoom'. The problem is that they can't bring more than one it's only one person at a time. Okay- and it's so weird that people are not able to even gather there in the dining room for meals. They have to be served, it's so in so counterintuitive to what you really think carefully only or anybody should be that we should isolate, but the only way that you can protect the population that we serve is to keep them separated when we have very few people that have right now and those two are in a separate floor. Okay, we're very anxious to make sure that we keep culprit out of the facilities you command. Yeah I can imagine yeah. Maybe I can come up with some sort of Garden to go thing where I can just have instructions, and so it can at least be activity. People who do and they can do it on their own. That might be fine. In fact, I'll mention your idea to the Rec therapy. People I'll be going into the office tomorrow. Monday, so I can reach out to you. Sarah, okay, great I, know what they're thinking is. Okay. Thank you. We have been running a lot of zoom programming and I'm, always interested in more options for teaching the seniors new crafts and new projects and we've been getting projects to them as well and then doing them together by them. So if anybody has any leads on those kinds of programs, I'd be very interested in hearing them. Okay, good with the population we serve in the nursing home, any Megan extremely frail, but they also they do not have in each person does not have an iPad or oh, you know we provide that to them. We sanitize them anytime, you're used with their own phones, where you could say: okay, let's get a zoom thing together, and then you get three or four people or five of one of ten populations. Frail and does not have a lot of resources right. No I would what I was thinking. I would come up with some activities where I could just write out the instructions very simply, oh, and that people would do because most of the stuff, you know, I'm, not crazy, about zoom I. Just think I'm too old. It just says some people who do not want to read and look through magazines. Might, you know, want to like play into little plants, something to put in their window, and so, if I could have a garden to go, they gave them the soil, some seeds or something like that. Then they could plant something, and so, if you could, you know, or maybe some recyclable art activities or so okay I'm happy to do something like that. Yeah, okay, know what I'd love to see. I'd love to see you give a class on how to make those wearable items that you created out of plastic bags. Yeah cool, wait, I'll just take some pictures of your fashion show, and some of that stuff is very simple for me to just outline in a way. That's explainable, so very good I'll get back to you on Tuesday, all right, Monday, perfect! All right! Anybody else have anything to share with us about this or any other questions for Betty, okay, I'd say Jay, yes, you're on yes, I'm on for what purpose yeah for year, you talked about a possible resident resolution reso, whereas 98 patients of Isabella geriatric facility and three workers of Isabella geriatric vicinity died of Kovac 19 as of the end of April this year and whereas 25% of the workforce were infected with Cobra 19 as of the end of April and whereas we have not been updated on mortality and morbidity at Isabella. That's actually not accurate that he just updated us so I'm willing to change that, whereas the mortality rate of 14% at Isabella is a hundred thirty five percent above the mortality rate of New York, State, nursing home residents and whereas Isabella has failed to accurately portray the severity of the crisis at their facility. Community Board twelve Manhattan urges Attorney General Letitia James to investigate the causes of the crisis at Isabella and responsibilities of mjh in this continuing crisis, be it further resolved that the state Senate and the state assembly health committees, open investigations into the causes of the deaths and the spread of infection said Isabella Carole. This is this is Maria yeah you finished I have a comment. My doorbell Rang I did not hear the end of it Jay. What did you say be resolved what I'm sorry I said: community boards twelve Manhattan urges attorney Letitia James to investigate the causes of the crisis, Ed Isabella and responsibilities of MJ age. In this continuing crisis, we had further resolved that the state Senate and the state assembly health committees open investigations into the causes of the deaths and the spread of infection. Isabella. Is that it? Yes, okay, so Isabella Henry has reported to the Health and Environment Committee. So you know if you're saying that they have not reported to the aging committee. I do not know because I'm not I have a response. If you do not mind first of all, okay, whatever you want to say about MJ, yes or Isabella, all those numbers reported on a daily basis to New York State Department of Health since the beginning- and those are a matter of public domain and I happen to look at the website yesterday and we had a total since March total of 68. Yes, it Isabella not 98, but 68, so that number 98 is not accurate. Number one I do not know where that came from, but it was never on the New York State Department of Health registry. Nor did we ever report any such number, so I need to tell you that fact is not accurate and if you want I can send you the link I believe it was already sent out in a prior email with the Health and Environment Committee right. It's able to check it and we are you know where, if you look at the whole, actually that particular website contains all of the deaths in all nursing homes in New, York State, so I need to address that right up front and for whatever you want to say. We have done everything by the book by the book. No exceptions made since the beginning. So I need to be very clear about that. Anybody, the Department of Health, the Attorney General. Anyone can come in and inspect us any time and they have been. The Department of Health is in many times since the beginning, not just us, but all over the state of New York. Looking at. What's being happened, what's going on, what's not going on etcetera, so I know that this has been a difficult situation in the state but Isabella and for all nursing homes, we're not alone and whatever is going to come out of any kind of a commission or attorney general inspection. It's gone got to do with not just Isabella but all of the nursing homes a lot of contention, as you may know, from the press about why Governor Cuomo declared on March 25th to the hospitals to discharge patients had Colvin to the nursing home soon. Even if you had a nursing home that had no call did you start getting hospital patients who have Colvin and guess what you've now created a major problem within your nursing, which is why all of this is really such a problem. All over the state I have a problem with a resolution that signal that singles out Isabella, because it does not take much for you to look at Jewish, home or client home Amsterdam how's. Anyone in the nursing homes in New, York State, and realize that we're right in the mix with everybody else in terms of the kinds of horrible problems that we've had in terms of death. Nobody wants to see that number of people die anywhere, but unfortunately it happened, but I can not support and I. Think it's really not good. Do we have a resolution in this community? Singling out is no especially given all of the work that we've done with the community for decades to provide services and no other nursing home provides. So you know it's a little bit problematic and you know I can't tell you how disappointed I am in that effort to single out Isabella and punish us for something that we're really a victim of as much as anyone else. In this Toria I've said my piece I agree: Maria I am going to play the role of Jim bullying as parliamentarian number. One resolution lady here for what you say now: Maria what you're saying now well I'm going I'm going to add on that, but anyway, Thank You rabbi. First of all the this a resolution with no second, so there was no. We did not have a right to have a discussion on it number three, which is that probably the most important thing is that this meeting is in July, even if we come up with resolution or with both and since like that is not going to be an effective resolution, because this has to be brought in September to our committee and then to the full board at the end of September. So I will very much with respectful Jay- J that we bring on the community world for years and years and hundreds of years I would like him to stage remove these resolutions from our meeting today, because of what I, just you know, is playing if I have nothing to do with right. It's a very letter. If we like thing, if we do not like thing- and this been so many discussion about this particular issue since the beginning of the Corona virus or the compet whatever it is, that they call it so Jay I will you know I hope that you're, you know doing a. We are in agreement. I think that at this time this resolution should not be presented to our meeting I appreciate both the response of Barry and Maria. However, I believe the figure 98 refers to Isabella patients who are infected with Kovac 19 and subsequently died wherever they may have passed away. As to the problem of looking at how to resolve this. The reason I suggested that the State Attorney General and the various legislative committees look at. That is because of many of the reasons Betty outlined as to the governor's responsibility in this matter, which lead me to believe it's extremely doubtful that his health committee, his health department, will conduct a fair and complete investigation, because it would inevitably involve his wrists by disability and I want to point out that 6% of the nursing home residents, the New York State died of Kovac 19, while 14 percent of the residents died at Isabella as to what Reddy said about the excellent work in the past of Isabella before it had been acquired by Mjh Edison, now known, I, fully agree and I. Think in the past the outreach which Betty supervised has been excellent and I. Furthermore, think she's been a big asset to the Community Board. But those are besides the point as to the discussion of the question at the May Health Committee, which of course was two months ago. I felt it was inadequate and self- serving on the part of Isabella mainly had the purpose of justifying their actions under the circumstances and I. Furthermore, think that the death of one seventh of be Isabella residents might very well have been caused by the failure of Isabella to properly segregate Kovac 19 patients, which they are now doing a good job of doing so. Given those circumstances, I think there's a certain amount of urgency to the question and I would urge the committee to take it up. Go ahead. Okay, since I was the one that asked you know, parliamentarian questions now we really have the representation of this resolution. Since there was not a motion, you know. Second, the motion to be discussed. This is also have been presented to the Health Committee, which is the main focus of that particular resolution. Note the aging committee, which we can quicken join with them. You know in the future in the future, you know work but I think that at this time gay is not productive-. You know- Hallows, hold this committee on this particular resolution because you are stating a lot of fact. A lot information there that I do not know I would no be able to vote yes or no. On this particular resolution, so I'm asking you respectfully once more not to hold up because his herrera is doing a job. They probably you know wearing aware that this situation was going to road. You know as much as bid. We also have to be conscious that organization is providing a great service to our community and to the you know, to the city. A large I think we have to wait a little because as baby say, they are doing what they supposed to be doing. Bringing a resolution of this magnitude to front while committee, which is not going to go anyplace because this monthly Committee on the whole. We do not meeting of other thing. We had to go to September, so maybe also you can write J, send us something in writings and send this resolution in writing to Mary, and she will you know this. You know disperse that to our committee members and we can really you know, look a little further into the same I like to be a Alya song. I mean I'm. Just a person to you know to come up to some agreements because I do not. You know the way I feel I do not know how the other field, but I do not think that will be able to vote on this particular resolution right now. First of all, this resolution was not permit presented to the Health Committee, nor was a resolution on questions of Isabella, which was only discussed at the main meeting and not the June meeting resolutions were not called for so the Health Committee is a separate entity. There's nothing that presents prevents our aging committee from dealing with this question, except insofar as the committee does not wish to deal with the question. I personally feel it's an emergency situation. I do not feel it was handled well, I think governor all know, handled a poorly I think insufficient guidelines were given to nursing homes, but with all of that, I think when one seventh of the customers of any business died. Something went wrong. There's no way of getting around the question of the 90 of the hot 700 beds at Isabella, 98 people who had been residents of Isabella and probably infected Isabella, subsequently passed away wherever they might have died. Jay. You need to know something as I mentioned earlier in before we had a totally limited. Let me just I answer him, because he was referring to what my conversation I am NOT saying. That is nothing. That is nothing. That is something wrong with the resolution. I am talking about the process now this particular resolution at this time. In the meeting in July who's, not an official meeting of our committee, then we have to take a position right now in support or not support. That's my only thing that I am not disputing the fact that he's stating in that. You know that document and you're saying that we are going to be taking a position right now that is really not going to carry, because until we meet back official in September, that's the only thing I'm saying thank you and I. Think that you know I know I can be scared in writing, so Jay I need for you to send it send that resolution so that we can have something to look at. First of all, let me respond do say if the committee does not wish to respond to this. They have every right not to respond to this. I just want to make sure that this discussion appears in the minutes, along with the resolution that I proposed, and if the committee does not wish to vote on it, then they should not I disagree, but if everyone else feels that way, then that's the way they feel I. Think maybe, if it's on the committee I have to you know, make a decision on that. I need to say something. If you want, if your concept, your purpose, is to find out what happened, you really need to be looking at not only Isabella but all of the nursing homes in the community, not just Isabella, and you need to make a broader, and you need to talk about the fact that the governor mandated hospitals discharge patients that there was no testing equipment in the nursing homes until the end of April. We did not have any week. You had no idea who had Coleman and who did not until six weeks into the into the pandemic. So you're separating people but you're not or for you they'd, maybe they may have out COBIT but being asymptomatic and they could be infecting there's a lot of problems, but it can't be just Isabella. It can not be because that's really unfair. My question, then, would be what was the mortality rate at Fort, Washington and the other facility you mentioned as compared to Isabella's? Well, you got ta. Remember they all have different bed sizes, so I believe we're trying is 200 beds, Isabella Center for inviting the size facilities you're a hundred percent right in a facility with 200 beds. If 14 percent of the P, it's not we're not at 68, not 98, you keep saying 98 it's not at 68 the total deaths of all Isabella patients who died of Kovac 19 to the best of my knowledge, whether or not they died in Isabella or in a separate facility was stated as 98 now and I'm concerned, with where they were inspected. They're, not reporting deaths in the hospital, because the hospital is reporting that have you gotten any you've gotten or from Mount Sinai. Have you has no interest in investigating that either legs would only make the numbers look worse. It's not I believe I can't even have this conversation anymore because they listen well. There's good to this community, as Isabella has been that we're being singled out. Okay, I need I need to interrupt both of you right now. Please come on I think it's it open for discussion. Still, no, not right. There I was going to make sort of a comment yeah hold on. You do not want to hear it hold on hold on I, think, and those of you that have more experience than I do I. Think at this point we need to take a vote on what I'm, not sure Maria helped me with us take a vote on whether we want to okay. So today the resolution presented by Jay was no second I made a clarification that there were no second in so we could discuss the merits of the resolution. I had to take it attending a boat which we did not so and I asked Jay to take the resolution. Out of the I mean he can. We can put it on the main list we can. We can I do not know talk about it, but really there is no merit of resolution at this point. So if he says no, he would like to keep this resolution on the floor. Then we need someone to second the resolution and then proceed to a vote, but I say that even if we take a vote in a way, this has to be ratified in September, and that is like two or three months period between now and there, you know to continue working on that in the meantime, I suggest that he can send us Adam right into married, so cam married, so we can really take line by line to take a look at this resolution. Right, you married met very good marriage, but I think we had to go by well. You know our protein Oh process had to follow, which is right now to have a someone. Second, the resolution then we'll take a vote on either table the resolution or move it to committee back in September, which will be my main recommendation, could could not. We have a little more discussion about it. Well, unless we have a second the resolution, we can have more discussion right, all right. Okay, so is there a second to this resolution? There's a second to the resolution that does not preclude discussion of the question. No Jay I'm. Sorry, we had to hold. It was not after the after. This resolution is said: no, that's not true. We can respond, Sir, there's a bell of Fort Washington or any nursing home on this committee at any time, whether or not there's a resolution on the floor same like we discussed restaurants without there being a resolution on the floor. What we're talking about a solution gay! This is a different. You know right when asked. If she could discuss the matter, she did not ask if she could discuss the resolution but I'm trying to get United what we need. What I know is there a second to the resolution Richard all night, such thinking and we can't hear Richard? Are you muted, not anymore? Oh there you go ahead. All I was saying is I, think we're bumping heads on something that we do not need to bump heads on. It was appropriate to call for a second to the resolution, and that should be done if there is not a second, then we'll leave it up to the chair. What other discussions might happen and there's no particular reason but any other discussion. Any discussion might not happen as for me, I better get back to work shortly. So I hope this moves quickly, yeah nearly at the end of our time, here too so, but anyway, okay, so as far as I can tell nobody has nobody's willing to second the resolution. Yes, no takers going once going twice, no second to the resolution. Okay, very so yes can I ask you to make an exception to whatever procedure we may have. I would like to hear what yeah Carol you had some input. Well, a couple of things and I'm I, truthfully I believe I'm, not sure that there is a big investigation going on of this whole matter of referring patients to nursing home now I'm. What I would say to that is that in a sense preclude the resolution in the in the sense that as I think it was Betty who said all of the nursing homes that Cuomo referred the patients to are being investigated. Now, whether that investigation will be, you know, what's happening with the investigation. I do not know, but my understanding is there is an investigation of that of that issue. Does anyone else share that knowledge or I can confirm? That is not that going on right. That was my that's going on or it is going on going on, I thought so right so just to follow up with that thought. Jay, since there is an investigation going on, it would seem a little bit. What should I say out of line for us to jump in and make this resolution, because we've got to wait until and somebody was talking about September. We really have to wait to see what comes out of the investigation do renounce who's investigating I was reading the baby, Betty no I'm, not sure I thought it was the Attorney General. Yet, okay, one other thing: Jay yeah. That really is my understanding so I'm, something in that thought that this is. You know this is like jumping in and in like the tail wagging the dog, because this investigation is ongoing and I'm sure it will have to be thorough, otherwise, they'll be tremendous outcry from everybody that having been said, I just want to add one other little piece here. Jay I think it's a little bit now, but I do not want to use the word unfair, because life is really. We know sometimes is not fair, but maybe I would say a little bit presumptuous your bus to the aging committee to put through this resolution to second it or even to maybe pursue it is this is like eating. Our own I mean Truthfully. Isabella is one of the backbones of the community and has been for many years it just. It does not seem like a healthy, a healthy approach, as I mean healthy in the sense of a of a I, do not want to say saying, but it does not seem like a positive approach for what the committee is. Really you know mandated for I feel a little uneasy. It's like it's like if somebody started to say that document Senior Center was unsanitary rather than maybe all of this. It's turning on your own and I I'm, not comfortable with that and I make it go. Is right. Cuz I make a comment as well. I think that if we're looking at this an issue of what's going on with the nursing homes, we need, as Betty mentioned, to have the data for all the nursing homes in the Community poor district, and that has not been looked at and then you know it's something has to come out of that. But I feel, like we've come to a conclusion. Without knowing the facts and it's Betty he's mentioned, some of the numbers are contrary to what has been reported. So I would feel I'm, not a member of the committee I'm, not even a public member, so you can ignore what I say, but this would make me feel uncomfortable as a community board member that the research seems to not be complete or there's some question about the quality of the data and since it is publicly available, it seems like that research could be done easily and should have been done. Anybody else so I think that the procedure now is Jay will send me a copy of the resolution. I will send it to all of the people who were onboard here today and the committee members, because it's a couple of people, not here, oh hi, good doggie. How are you and we can look at it and we can I'm not hearing you I, do not know why this call perhaps there's someone who should be muted at this point. Thank you sorry about that. Okay, so I think at this point that we are going to table this resolution for now until we get the copy of the written resolution, we're able to go over it each and every one of us and come back in September, Maria well, I think that Jay have to agree to give us the resolution. So we can proceed. I do not know. We are now asking to you know to you know to just forget about it: we're just moving into analyzing order, and then we can. You know we can do that. Okay, so Jay! Yes, will you get that resolution to me so I can send it out to the okay. Thank you very much and that's correct. Oh okay, and does anybody have any announcements? I continue also distributing food, they met the next delivery is going to be for next week because of the holiday. There is some issues about you know the food coming being sent to differing areas, and things like that. So, as of now, I am I being are giving out 154 meals to the immediate community, and also anybody will give me the telephone numbers I will make sure that they give well. You know, I delivered the food today if they can not come together from the front of my building it being very successful, because it's really the communication between you know people. You learn a lot about thing. You know and I think that this is a great community that we need to help. Those that are, you know that are in need, so I'm very pleased with that. I have an announcement. You, okay, it's really a thank you to the committee by virtue of you letting me present at one of your meetings. I actually met Carol and we did arrange to do an e- waste recycling event that was scheduled for in with park. I actually worked with Lower East Side ecology, Center, with Carol, with the Dyckman houses to set up a satellite location which friendzone would help our quilted staff. So we would have doubled our a waste recycling event and that would not have happened. Had you not invited me to your meeting so unfortunately, COBIT happened before the event could take place. Well, we will do it in the future when this is over, but that was a direct result of you having me come and speak to your committee, great so I. Thank you for that and now let's beat this pandemic. You know seriously. So our next meeting will be on August 6 at 10:30 a.m. Mary. Do we have to meet them? Another I do not think I'm. Sorry, okay committee. What do you think should we had open in Logos the community boy yeah we had, we had said we were going to meet in August. Also I do not know like Maria says, maybe that's not necessary. What do people yeah I'd be very comfortable, leaving it to the discretion of the chair. If there are gender items that need attention, my non vote is to vote for it. We're in the midst of pandemic. I think it's important that we are visible to the community, especially with our most vulnerable population got ta, say I, maybe I got ta, say I'm, not hearing much enthusiasm for a meeting. I would just it's Mary Caesar Ruiz, and then we need to change that. Then we will in the middle of a pandemic. I could use it to our break. I do not know there may be some things we need to want to follow up on I you know, or I can I do not know if it's proper to email. The committee numbers within any updates on a couple of these things. An email is appropriate and realistically you've got to be 28th when the committee of the whole meets and when the August calendars put together to make any further decisions. We do not have a meeting scheduled. Let's go forward. I have hold on I. Have somebody on the meeting that wants to make a contribution to the discussion. Eleanor? Are you there muted? Yes, there you go bad Eleanor, you need to unmute yourself: I did I just did okay, my name is Eleanor whele I'm, a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. We meet at the office building at a hundred at your main office and we're here to support the community to love this tree. We did a letter, a card writing campaign with Isabella, so I'm glad that we're able to participate in the book- and so my program, chairperson, miss Monica Russell, will be reaching out to community 4:12 chair to see how we can be of more service to the inward and foot Washington Heights community. Wonder you know have now tell me the sorority and Alpha Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated. We sent cards to the seniors in our catchment area, which was Fort, Washington Isabella and a Wahlberg beautiful. So if I should get a contact information because we email Mr. Smith, but we do not get a response. So if we have another contact person that we can reach out and offer our service to for the community, we would appreciate that you can certainly do that. Do you have an email? Yes, Eleanor quello at hotmail, I could put it in the chat and elee2000 Kay I will email you my contact information pretty shady. Thank you, okay. Thank you very much. Okay, folks, I think this. Is it I call this meeting we're going to close this meeting at 12:15 p.m. thank you everybody for your contributions and we will not. So we will not meet in August. I will update everyone on issues in the Committee of the Whole meeting at the end of August. Okay, thank you very much. Everybody I do not much Thank You, Leigh, yeah I see well, everyone miss you miss Carol, everybody bye.",
            "summary": "She will do more odd number to follow up on discussions from the last meeting, Hey Isabella's request for books and magazines, the future of meetings, seniors and community unable to join meetings because of lack of equipment, technology, skills, etc, long lines of businesses, including banks, post office, etc, making it extremely difficult for the seniors and disabled.\nSo a little more space here for myself and for the kids, but watching and listening to what's going on in the city closely I can't say it makes me want to return home soon, guys we're good thank God. So Tara your mother.\nI mean I'm on their climate, democracy, working group and And I'm, not sure if it's for you or through fern what the issues are that are communities facing with respect to getting the air conditioners that were supposed to be provided by the city , how they eligibility might have changed and also you know, utilization and what they might do during the pandemic.\nYou know, I think we're going to taste a huge crisis, Oh great, and otherwise the other issue has come up in what I guess is the noise issue?\nSo I have a question for Sally this issues that you would like to add to the new business part of the meeting, or just these are just random questions that you have, the air condition you know for information, so I'll wait until the end.\nThink the library has some special procedures once they reopen how they're going to handle books that come back into circulation, You know books with a lot of pictures, because a lot of the residents are, you know quite elderly and some have Alzheimer's Maybe you know, books with that, have different kinds of pictures, whether the history books or you know, but some that there's not a lot of reading involved because they do not have the concentration you know and the ability to focus.\nI spoke to Domingo Estevez who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee I, spoke to him yesterday and one of the thoughts that he had was trying to reach out to you know, rather than change the hours, because some of them have hours for seniors like 8 o'clock in the morning.\nDo you mean, meaning if I, if I owned a Rite Aid, do I have to have a senior error at the beginning of the day or the end of the day or just if I decide to on my own and Every business is deciding on their own I think that businesses are deciding on their own because right, If I had support from you, know elected officials and making this more something that they more pressure somehow.\nWe, have Domingo who's, the chair of the Business Development Committee, and we're hoping that between all these people, perhaps we can reach out to the businesses, and you know plea for their help with this.\nThis kind of thing, I, agree: I recorded the local bounty They have a senior line just specifically for seniors of people with disabilities and if they have someone on line that will take care of them My, you know, get up my better a Oklo to get a six o'clock to get ready and since I that for most of the seniors also have home attendant and they do not start working.\nI will feel much better to see something like that done, that implementing or trying to implement some rules and regulation, the business You know and a person and people say.\nI need to speak with Eliezer and a CEO yet, and you know, I want to pick up on a whole bunch of things that people said.\nDo not, but I can only speak for a certain fact of the community that I've observed a few things, so there might be a little more tool both of the bank seem to be able to do then I kind of walk people ahead and have their own mechanisms.\nI know that if you have certain things that you do not need they're able to skip people around, and they do not have an issue with that.\nAnd then, when I actually got to the office, areas going to, they said, arrive no more than 15 minutes before your appointment Then you can come up because they do not want a lot of people.\nI'm sure they will, because that's not a big issue and they also have to You know it's making it more difficult to educate people to stay on lines for so long, right.\nIf we get, you know, R 3, R, 3, board people who have access in a familiar way with those businesses and the.\nI, just at least in my neighborhood I- think it's more business are hurting You can, because they're trying to make up for lost revenue that they do not know will ever come back and now that's you.\nThat, because I'm a person who's very much against the you know the unenclosed out, you know, sidewalk cafes or in close to whatever it might be, if they're compromising the ability for the disabled to get by, there's no way I'm going outside, because not only people idiots for setting them off, but they're idiots and do not have particularly good aim.\nIn, the past, historically senior centers have been cooling, centers, other locations have been cooling, centers I think they're actually going to be opening some senior centers as cooling, centers they're, making it optional now, and it's only going to be for their seniors, not for the general public, but in order to accommodate other seniors who might not be willing to go out or able to go out during Corona, there has been a very big high push campaign, That's, still not over to get three air conditioners to the seniors installed in their homes and basically the senior centers have been making hundreds and hundreds of calls.\nYou can contact, especially for seniors and people that have low exposure, so I think we have to take advantage and in another way to you, know these new condition.\nOkay, good with the population we serve in the nursing home, any Megan extremely frail, but they also they do not have in each person does not have an iPad Let's get a zoom thing together, and then you get three or four people or five of one of ten populations.\nDid we ever report any such number, so I need to tell you that fact is not accurate and if you want I can send you the link I believe it was already sent out in a prior email with the Health and Environment Committee Actually, that particular website contains all of the deaths in all nursing homes in New, York, State We have done everything by the book by the book.\nAll over the state I have a problem with a resolution that signal that singles out Isabella, because it does not take much for you to look at Jewish, home or client home Amsterdam Anyone in the nursing homes in New, York State, and realize that we're right in the mix with everybody else in terms of the kinds of horrible problems that we've had in terms of death.\nThat is because of many of the reasons Betty outlined as to the governor's responsibility in this matter, which lead me to believe it's extremely doubtful that his health committee, his health department, will conduct a fair and complete investigation, because it would inevitably involve his wrists by disability and I want to point out that 6% of the nursing home residents, the New York State died of Kovac 19, while 14 percent of the residents died at Isabella as to what Reddy said about the excellent work in the past of Isabella before it had been acquired by Mjh Edison, now, known, I, fully agree and I.\nYou know- Hallows, hold this committee on this particular resolution, because you are stating a lot of fact.\nYou, know disperse that to our committee, members and You know the way I feel I do not know how the other field, but I do not think that will be able to vote on this particular resolution right, now.\nThat is really not going to carry, because until we meet back official in September, that's the only thing I'm saying thank you And It send that resolution so that we can have something to look at.\nI just want to make sure that this discussion appears in the minutes, along with the resolution that I proposed, and if the committee does not wish to vote on it, then they should not Maybe.\nI think that, if we're looking at this an issue of what's going on with the nursing homes, we need, as Betty mentioned, to have the data for all the nursing homes in the Community poor, district, and that has not been looked at Not a member of the committee I'm, not even a public member.\nThere is some issues about you know the food coming being sent to differing areas, and things like that."
