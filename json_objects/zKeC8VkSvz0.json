        "fullTranscript": "All right, I have 604 p.m, and thank you. Everybody for registering and signing in I see irene is with us as well our vice chair. So I guess let's get started. Okay, we'll just hop right over to the landmark preservation. Commission applications, the first one is two now yeah do yourself: first, hmm, you have to introduce yourself: okay, I'm carlton, gordon chair, okay. I thought everybody knows me by now, but not the community members necessarily okay, all right, okay. So, let's hop over to the landmark lpc applications. We have two today. First one is 295 cumberland street in fort greene, historic district. The application is to remove the existing okay hold on a second roof deck and construct the full width. You know full width extension at the you know at the garden level, with a rooftop deck stair to the rear yard, to modify the side lights and the garden level and extend you know and extend the and work will be done. Also the front facade. I guess I have people here for 295 cumberland street for presenters. Yes, they are yes that that's me, okay, just give us your name and affiliation and proceed. My name is jeff wandersman, I'm one of the partners at pallet architecture. I believe robert is going to have to help me with this okay tia. Can you give me the pineapple so just to be clear from carl's explanation in the last week the amount of the scope that we actually need? The community board's feedback on has been reduced. We are now doing the replacement of the front door in the existing opening, and so that's able to be reviewed at the staff level of landmarks, and so we don't need to go through that anymore. The full scope, that's being reviewed, is the, as mentioned a one-story garden level, extension on the rear of the building and the review as we'll go through as a 12 foot extension. So we can do next slide. So here we are in the fort green historic district image on the left shows the front facade of the building is a wood frame building and there's two buildings on either side that are from a similar from the same time. Next slide. This shows again from a top picture and the view on the right shows the site plan. The grade box is basically the extension again, a 12 foot extension from the current rear facade and that's a roof deck. That's going on top of. On top of the extension, there is there'll, be better images below, but you can see a stair coming down from the roof deck and there is coming out from the garden level some stairs in the rear yard that meet the level of the current grade. Is that I'm looking at sort of a light gray on the right? And I guess the line is supposed to be the steps. Am I correct those long steps at the top you'll see this better and from the following ones, but those are steps coming up from the level of the garden to the rear yard and the shorter steps on the right are stairs coming down from the roof deck to the yard. And obviously I guess I was just saying on the left side is going to be the street and that's the front entrance correct. Okay, so just to give a little bit of a scope of the entire street, we're going between green avenue and lafayette avenue between cumberland and carleton. All of the different colors that you can see are the extensions already on the block, so there's quite a few extensions. Some of them are very significant. We were asked by the landmarks commission to find an average of those and those average out to 14 feet partially. There are. There are some that are very long, but ours is only 12 feet, but you see sort of the amount of buildings that have done extensions into the rear yard. The other thing that you should be able to see from this is that there's no real way to view the house from any of the streets, so it would just be what's viewed from already in the in the donut. This is just a photo to give a little bit additional information. Some historic photos, probably a little less relevant, but just to give you a sense of where it was no longer doing any work on the front facade that needs feedback from the committee. This is the front facade and its current conditions, so the main entry is its garden level and there is the deck on the part of the level none of that's being adjusted. This is the current rear, facade. It's vinyl siding back there. I think a lot of this work dates back to the 80s. So currently there is the that deck. That's off there. It's just a floating deck. It's not a roof deck right now, but we're basically and that's coming out eight feet. So we're coming out four feet past the edge of the that current deck and the stair there will be doing basically the same thing coming down to the rear yard. Some site plans just to show you how that's changing the eight feet on the left versus the 12 feet on the right front, facade again, no work that the group needs to weigh in on, but just a point of clarification for close readers of the agenda. We did list that work would be done on the front door and that work will occur. But mr watersman has informed me that that is now approvable at staff level. Yeah. We we've ended up taking off side lights from the door. They were on the left side, there's now just the side lights on the right side. So this is the proposed it's all existing within the current opening for that door. So, yes, the landmarks preservation committee is comfortable handling that at staff level and therefore the work you're asking us to improve is basically the rear extension correct. This is the existing condition of the rear and then the new, so large windows on the back, but just under the garden level, the roof deck extends out to the exact same point as the facade of the building. This is current section. This is the proposed section, so there is a drop in the extension of the floor level so that we can have a little bit of additional feeling height there. There's it's fairly low ceilings right now, a little less than eight feet and with the roof deck needing additional thickness to provide proper insulation. We wanted to create enough ceiling height there, so the floor does get lowered slightly and that translates out into the rear patio as well. So there is a few more steps to get from that garden level up to grade in the back, so that okay, that's oh yeah. I was just trying to read so the new work will be. I see you have a couple of steps going down on. I guess the street level I guess at cross and then out to the and then the steps up to the garden. That's basically where the work is going to take place. Am I correct? I'm not 100 sure I got the question. There's no work on the front facade right yeah. So there are existing steps. Those steps will need to be demolished because they're going to end up getting moved back and we will have a little bit more height change since we're lowering the level of the floor on the garden level and that rear extension. Okay. These are just plans for reference. This is a seller plan. This is the garden level plan existing on the top and then the parlor level or first floor plan. So this just shows the roof deck. That's it are there any committee questions for mr wandersman from the committee. Yes, yeah, can you speak to? You gave the dimensions of the proposed deck and the average? Can you talk about the adjacent neighbors? Do either of those houses have decks and if so, how does your deck compare with those? And if you could speak to the equipment that you're going to use? Is it heavy equipment and is it accessible through the house? Yes, I can speak to all of that. If you go robert apologies for making you do this work, but if you go to a probably about page four or something there's a in the page that has the block plan with the colored extensions, it's got to blow up of the adjacent ones right there here, yeah ours is 12 and then the two neighbors are eight and yeah. The plan is definitely we're, keeping the whole front facade so no work. No, it will all be done with basically hand tools. Nothing will be coming in that we'll need to impact the front, facade or major equipment that would not be able to fit through a three-foot door. I have a follow-up question, which is to mr dude's point about the adjacent neighbors. It appears they both have decks. Eight foot, I guess decks, are they on top of enclosed space or are they floating like the current property is now there? The one to the right is actually a two floor extension that well the right and the left. The green are two story ones and the orange that's three stories, so I have to check and see if there are roof decks, but those are both coming up above where our extension will be. Ours is only a one story. If committee members have questions since we didn't do introductions at the beginning before you asked your question, please identify yourself. Okay, this is john. Do again, have you informed your neighbors of this proposal? Yeah the owners have spoken to the neighbors. Thank you. Are there any other committee members or have any board members have any other questions? If not, then I'll seek a motion to approve so moved. John excuse me carlton, I didn't realize I was muted. I have a question. Go ahead judy I want to ask the applicant it's not clear to me why this extension can't be handled at staff level. If it's, if I understanding correctly it's a garden level, it's only one story. You know why I completely agree and we've done some other ones in this particular neighborhood, where it was required because of the number of stories they're saying because of the existing adjacent neighbors are at eight feet and you know those two were built at the same time. So, even though the average of the block came out to 14 feet, they still said that it will go to commission level. So it's the size, it's that it's the depth of it rather than the removal of historic material or anything else. Like that yeah I mean, if you look at the rear facade, it's all vinyl siding and none of it is from the original structure. So, thank you, hello. I can make a motion. Yes, I have a question. Okay, john, do you wish? I have a question? Okay, yeah, okay, okay, first, let me judy. Do you want a second john's motion? Yes, okay, so we have that. Okay, go ahead irene. You indicated that you have to to increase the ceiling height of your lower level, you're going to dig down more. So that's why you had more steps to go up to the garden. Is this going to involve the foundation or impact on the neighboring properties? We have not done probes yet sort of the way the process works. We need to get feedback from the committee, so the existing is all happening at the seller level. So if you go to the building section robert, you can kind of tell that, but in the extension we are going out further we're not doing a seller out yeah right there we're not doing a seller at pal out past the level of the existing. If anything, we may end up with crawl space. So the intention, if for anything, that we can do, is to avoid any kind of underpinning, if at all possible, but until the structural engineers are fully involved, I can't say a hundred percent on that. You know, as mentioned both the neighbors- do have eight foot extensions but we'll be checking to see what their what their foundation level is. Obviously, before we would start the work- and you know, the agreements would be made with the neighbors for anything that would impact their property, but the intent architecturally is to be as minimally impactful on the neighbors as possible, and we will, you know, do what we can to avoid any sort of underpinning. So I mean just on the line and repeat what you said is that the structural engineer finds that there is work that has to affect your neighbors. You will notify your neighbors as quickly as possible sure we would know that before we would start construction and there would have to be a neighbor agreement put in place to before. We would start construction, so I don't anticipate any situation where we're in construction and all of a sudden there's an emergency where we need to notify them. That would certainly be avoided at all costs. But yes, we will. We will endeavor to not have our construction impact them in a way that they, their building, is really at risk in any way, but certainly we would have agreements and be in discussion with them for anything that you know has any potential to impact their foundation. Excuse me, you said agreements does that include some type of insurance yeah, so the build the typical builders risk policy ensures all of the other buildings. So that would be the case. You know the neighbor agreements are typically there's not a set things that are in those, but just by the nature of construction. The builder's general liability policy would cover the neighbors houses. Thank you for that. Okay, are there any other questions or comments from committee members? This is esther. I have a question. Yes, you said that the owner spoke to the neighbors, but you didn't give a response on. Are they okay with the project in terms of the feedback? I just I got when I spoke to robert about it. He said this will be a question that comes up, and so I made the comment that they needed to speak to them and they said that they have done it beyond that. I can't speak specifically about what happened, but if there's any information that needs to come back to the committee or anything, I can do I'll certainly try to get that information. We do require that the adjacent neighbors be notified of this meeting tonight so that they have an opportunity to comment. Do you know if that process took place? It is it's my understanding from my clients that it did take place that they were informed, but I was not part of that, so I can't you know I can't say definitively I'm just going on what I was told and speaking of public comment. Are there any non-committee members with a comment about this project before the vote? No, then, mr gordon, I will do a roll call. Vote can't see hands. Mr gordon, how do you vote? Yes, ms janner irene? Are you muted all right ali? She left the meeting I saw howser left. Thank you judy. Ernest augustus irene is yes, thank you. No I'll vote, no daughter, christopher, yes, brian howald. Thank you brian any chance. We have anthony a belly on the call how about eric, sproul allen, washington? Yes, I'm here rob I'm staying mr dew, john dew, no neighbor notification. I abstained william flenoy elizabeth ginsburg, karen johnson judy stanton. Yes, do we know that the neighbors were not notified. I thought I thought notified, but they weren't notified of this meeting. Oh, I thought the client I thought the architect said the client was his client was asked to tell them and we've been informed that hazra ali voted yes using the chat function, and so the motion to recommend approval passes by a vote of six in favor. One opposed three abstentions, and I will note that some of the abstentions had to do with the notification requirement. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Moving on our next lpc application is 135 plymouth street in dumbo, and this is from the Brooklyn public library and they're, basically asking to put up a sign at the. I guess the temporary branch that exists over at that spot and do we have the people from representing the Brooklyn public library we do. This is dan wood, and I am here with two members of my team, troy, lacombe and leslie dugru. We also have milo rosario, who is the manager of government and communications for Brooklyn public library available for questions? Kat savage is the future branch manager she's also on the call, and we are joined by the graphic design firm linked by air dan michelson and bibi. Cosmeri are here as well, so we have a lot of people. If someone could make me the presenter, I will start my presenting okay. I am okay, clear. I see adam street library, fantastic okay, so we wanted to give a little bit of context to the signage project and also just we are really excited about this project, and you know, I think, it'll be a really great addition to your community. The adams street branch will be the 60th branch library of the Brooklyn public library, and it will be the first new branch to open since 1983. So I think, recognizing dumbo and and vinegar hills emergence as neighborhoods. This is a really exciting time for the neighborhood, so the location is literally dumbo. It's down there under the Manhattan bridge and right, it's flanked by the waterfront and it's plymouth street adam street and john street are the the streets and I think, from the beginning. Bpl's real emphasis was that this is a community resource, obviously a last truly public building that our cities have our public, our public libraries, and we really want to make sure that this building is embraced by the full community, and so we've done a lot of outreach. Oh here's that sorry zoom in what's great about the site is that on john street, the newer developments are a little bit pushed to the side so that our library, which is occupies just a part of the ground floor, has amazing views out over the waterfront, and we also have no real neighbors on the adam street side. So we have spent a lot of time in community outreach on this project and working with groups at both in dumbo, and we made a presentation. We had a little workshop at the fairground houses with some teens and potential library users, and we've really worked to integrate a lot of the community's demands into the design of the project. It's primarily an interior project. So that's, you know, probably beyond your scope, but just so you know, it'll be a quite extensive library, with space for teens, a large children's area, a reading room, public reading room stacks, a community room and a large meeting room which will be available for the community, restrooms information stand book, holds staff area etc, and it's really organized around this central element, which is the kids element. There are a lot of children in this neighborhood. We have a special parking garage for strollers and it's this kind of big bright object in the middle, so it kind of all circulates around the kids, who are, of course, our future leaders, and you see that in the in this image here, but even though it has this object in the middle, it's kind of punctuated by these openings, which allow visibility throughout we're. Also maintaining this is this old warehouse building. It used to be a bomb factory where we we're maintaining a lot of the existing patina and the finishes of the inside, in fact not only the brick walls which, of course, we see in new york a lot, but also exposing some of the wood ceilings, because this is such a ruggedly built building, we're able to classify it as heavy timber, so you'll actually have some of that incredible timber work in the ceiling visible in these cutouts as well. So it's really about visibility and about the history of the of the building and the site, and we wanted to celebrate that on the exterior as well. Here's the building, 135 plymouth. As I said it was a it- was a factory building and a warehouse building for most of its life recycling center. More recently, it does kind of stick out to the water, so it's visible from many areas even from Manhattan, but when up close it's a it's, a very imposing massive masonry building and it will have many ground floor. Retail tenants- and you know we really want to make sure that the library stands out and that it's clear where this new public institution is and where people can go. You know to use the library we want to make sure that people feel this is part of their community and so identity and really identifying the library is not a coffee shop and not a furniture store, but you know really. A public building is very important. That's why we really want to make a big deal out of the out of the exterior signage you can see here. It's just at the ground floor. It's this series of windows on adam street and these windows on john street. The ground floor has been painted a different color from the from the original brick of the upper levels, and so we're already dealing with a kind of mitigated situation where there is this kind of red paint at the ground floor which we're maintaining, because it's because it exists, we have been inspired by the idea of the beacon, which is something you see in new york. Historically, both on the outside. You know this kind of idea of a kind of object that really orients you and tells you where these public institutions are both on the exterior and you know on the interior as well. So this idea of a beacon is something that we're exploring both okay, I got this yeah. I tried to insulate myself from children, but what happened architect want to present as well. What's that yeah they're, probably better than me, and so on the inside. You have these these kind of beacon signs that really orient people and utilize the cutouts, so that you can really see okay, there's the dean area, the books are over there and really making it clear and dan michelson and his team have done a great job on the graphics here. You know, with using kind of bold, simple words and simple letters to orient people through the space and that's kind of what we want to do on the outside as well. So the idea is that there are exterior beacons that really announce these important institutions in the city, and we have been inspired really by the neighborhood itself and its history of kind of large super graphic signs directly painted or applied to buildings. So here is an original photo of the building when it was owned by the ew bliss company, making missiles and bombs later it became the wearing envelope company and there's still elements of signage elements from that on it. I'm sure you all know many of these examples. The thompson meter company in the neighborhood also still retains some of this large super graphics, sweeney manufacturing, company, the brillo, the preview paints and, of course, the eagle warehouse, probably the best known building in the in the community, as well as the empire stores, and we also note that more recently, peop retail tenants have been picking up on this as well. So our proposal is to utilize a word that everyone recognizes that is as clear as gay and just a proper noun. This is the library this and everybody knows a library is for everyone and really kind of pick up on this idea of the super graphics. And what we're doing as well is to continue the lettering over the windows and we're going to use that kind of adhesive frit that is used on buses so from the inside. It's completely transparent and it's a black material and on the outside, it's white, so it reflects against the windows and you'll really read this big, bold sign I forgot to mention you know we share a doorway with one of the future retail tenants, so it just again emphasizes this need to really call out like this is the library this is the public building, here's the entrance and you have the hours at the at the entrance there as well, and then around the corner on john street, a little bit more subtle just raised signs that read Brooklyn public library. That kind of draw you around the corner towards the entrance and really emphasize that entrance on adam's street. This is a little bit of detail of the frit pattern and the hours. Here's the material that we'll be using so you see the back is black, which makes it almost completely transparent. You won't notice it at all from the inside and this is the signage. Unfortunately, our public libraries in new york are the hours are not consistent due to budgetary reasons, and so this is a sign, that's changeable, as things change, hopefully increasing the hours and then here's the john street elevation, primarily just the windows with the race letters here. This is really the only elevation that has neighboring buildings as well. I think I mentioned at the beginning, so it's a little bit more subtle for them as well and just painted raised signs raised letters on this. So I understand neighbor notification is very important. Of course, the land lord, is enthusiastic about this project and we've communicated with him he's posted notice of this meeting in the lobby for the tenants, with some information about the project. So that's been done and I believe that rob has also reached out. Rob from community board has also reached out to the neighboring buildings. Although again, there are no direct neighbors and the developer for the park, we have also spoken with staff at landmarks. They said that if this wasn't a library it might be more difficult, but since it's a public building, they do. You know feel that this is a project that the staff can support and they really encouraged us to go to you guys and eventually to the to the commission. They also mentioned that if this was in any other district, they wouldn't look at it like this, but because this district has such a long history of this type of signage, they really felt it was an appropriate move and, of course, since this red paint is already removable, all of this material, including the frit, is removable down the road. If something changes, it's not a permanent change to the building. So that's our presentation, I believe yes, okay. Thank you. I did promise karen since she's our dumbo person to make the first comment. Hi. Can you hear me great? Thank you. Okay, any other comments from committee members board members hearing none. I will ask for sorry I just needed to unmute myself. I do it okay for the architect. Is there any percentage diminution of light? With that? I know you showed the black, the black inside of that lettering. Just is there if you, if there were if it were, if the sign were done in a different way and not yeah, you know I don't know if you've been on about you know, the buses are completely covered with advertising and you there's really very little perceptible change in the light that comes through this. I don't know if you've ever been on that, but there are stores that are completely covered with images and you from the inside there's no change. I should note that we have. I can't remember how many but a lot of windows and in fact we're a little bit concerned about too much light coming in we're, then cutting down the light because we do have the windows. Thank you sure. I have a quick question also related to that. This is daughtry car starkin. I notice in your renderings- and I don't know if this is intentional or actual or if it's not, but the window frames on the commerce, the quieter side. They appear the window, all the mullions and muntins and everything appear black, but the ones on the graphic side appear to be gray, and is that because of the signage or is that just the way that the rendering came out? It's just the way the lighting is in the rendering? I think they're in shadow on the other street, but all the the windows are already in place and approved by landmarks and the color of the frames and muntins will not change that. That's already done. Yeah. The freight pattern will only be on the glass okay. Are there any other questions or comments all right, since there are none I'd like to get a motion to approve motion to approve exact, second, okay, that was judy and irene, okay, judy and irene any questions on the motion. If not, then we'll take a roll call. Carlton gordon, yes, irene, janna, yes, azra ali ernesto is voting yes in the chat. Thank you judy has her. Ali is a yes ernest augustus, esther blanc, yes, dr christopher, yes, brian howell yeah, mr worthington, alan washington. Yes, mr paris, john, do mr d: are you with us and not muted? Mr flanoy, did you join us? I said yes, if you didn't hear me, I appreciate your chiming in mr floyd. Did you join the meeting? Did elizabeth ginsburg join the meeting karen johnson? Yes, judy, stanton, yes, and returning to mr augustus, are you with us? Can you hear me yes have a good day yet? Yes, the motion passes unanimously. Mr gordon news, thank you everyone and we will see you all at the library. We will do. Thank you all right. So we've, the third one I think we were that's, been laid over until september. I think it's on washington, something like that. It's been laid over right, okay, so now we move on to the statements of needs. Okay, I guess the first big thing on the statement of these. You can see it very clearly is I guess at the front, it's of course the affordable housing. I guess a statement and I think the basically one from what I've read and the statement of needs. It looks like it's a very comprehensive. I guess a proposal, or at least outline of the things that we're interested in. Are there any other addition? I know that especially is irene's area. I don't know if she wants to add anything else to what's in the statement of needs list. You know it's been outlined, but it looked very comprehensive and I think that is our top priority. Well carlton! Well, that's our priority. Given the change in our current environment, which is pretty substantial and what we're hearing about whatever exodus is happening in the city as we speak and whether that's going to be permanent, we need to understand long range. What the city's thinking is about the potential impact on affordable housing. I understand and in fact what I'm going to bring up during my, I guess my my chairs report. That's a it's an item that I wanted to bring up, especially because of the change. I guess we'll call it the atmosphere or the what's been going on in the city and that's something I do want to bring up. You know as part of our this. You know general discussion, but I think it is something that we have to keep in mind and I will be bringing it up in the chairs report. Thank you for that. Yes, all right. If there's nothing, I think we have a general consensus. That is our top priority. I was going through it and robbie can help me out on this. There were a couple of things that looked like it was listed in the health area, but I thought for things that I don't know. If we are it's in our jurisdiction or not, one was the 39 auburn street auburn place homeless, shelter which was supposed to have a upgrade now. Is that something that we would be discussing, or is that going to be left to the? I guess, our health committee? That does help you know any board, member or committee member who wants to discuss any aspect of the statement of needs or, but I will I will let you know that we did receive a response, that the electrical system was upgraded at the auburn shelter. Oh that's nice to know, okay and the other one that I thought again. That was in the health, for you well actually the whole, and I think we have discussed this briefly- 200 hillary street, the homeless, shelter. I saw the discussion that there was a because there was a an emphasis on safety and again I don't know if that's something that landmarks and land use would be directly about, but there was some concern about because it was a large there were a large number of 9-1-1 calls. Is this again? This is something that we would be discussing, or is that something that would be left to somebody else? I you know. If this committee has an opinion on 200 hillary, they should feel free to express it. You know conceivably you're, coming from a different perspective, land use as opposed to yeah social service provision. That was precisely why I was thinking about it as more as a this is something that we have to get directly involved with, or if anybody wishes to discuss that one, I guess, if not, then the other. The big thing, of course, is the study and I'll move on. Then, if there's no other further comments on, I do see that the big one, of course, is going to be to study, which is the land use for this, for the zoning for the downtown Brooklyn, which is the big thing. I see that that's listed, there's a study for land use and zoning, the better er hold on the better match. The current. You know the current. You know fitness which is being done at this time in downtown Brooklyn, current or future neighborhood trends. The problem that we are facing right now is, I think, that you're looking at it in this study is a reevaluation of the downtown neighborhood plan for possible land use. Now the plan initially was supposed to be for the development of commercial guest activities in our area. What happened, of course, is that the the plan has led towards massive residential construction all throughout the area, and one of the things that's been left behind is the commercial development. So I think the study is a good thing and that's something that we should be doing. Are there any other people who wish to comment on that? Yes, this sounds similar to the study. We've been asking the city to do that, re-evaluate the land use based on what we approved in the early 2000s, when we did the upzoning for downtown Brooklyn, where we thought we were going to get a lot of commercial and we got basically residential. Is that what this is going to be taking a look at well? That is the budget priority. Mr do. But while you were chairperson, you co-signed a letter with then council member leticia james, asking the department of city planning to take a fresh look at the downtown rezoning and the response that you got from the chair of the city. Planning commission was- and I can't phrase only slightly. We think everything in downtown Brooklyn is just fine and I don't think that the sentiment at at the department of city planning has changed in the years since I would also like to remind the committee that that they that there was a capstone project by four wagner, nyu wagner students that looked at the downtown rezoning. That was something that was pushed by former committee member. Oh, how quickly names evaporate once these people leave the previous, the previous secretary of the committee's name is oh yeah, see sandra that's right! Thank you, rothbard sandra rothbard. You know I and just one personal comment. I have no objection really to tilting at windmills, but to go back, I don't. I don't think this is. This is something that the city is ever going to expend staff resources on well. Do you think we should concentrate on that yeah? I don't think this rob. Are you saying we're wasting our time with regard to that one particular budget priority? It's you know if you want to if you want to have an ongoing expression of, I don't know what disappointment in the outcome. What have you? That's? Fine? That's your prerogative, but I you know you should be realistic about how the city views the development of downtown Brooklyn and whether they would you know, spend city planning staff resources on some sort of new rezoning. If there's going to be any new rezoning in downtown Brooklyn. In my opinion, it's probably an additional zoning to increase density. Well, the they've already started doing that and we're getting again a whole host of u-lock applications for larger buildings, downtown Brooklyn. So that's an ongoing process, but the issue is: how is the city going to look to accommodate the ever-increasing homeless problem? So a lot of what we're talking about is for the city to address an ongoing problem, so we are weighing in saying this is just one opportunity to begin to take another look at that problem, so the city needs to then come back with some solution to this problem. What is it that they are recommending be done to accommodate this homeless problem, which, again everything that we talk about going forward has to be discussed under this new situation that we are under? That looks like it's not going to be going anywhere. We have to do an overall analysis of where we are and what we're supposed to do to most sufficiently and effectively use the land, so maybe not specifically a rezoning, but some approach that actually speaks to the city's understanding and combined goal of addressing this problem. Well said: yes, I think it's a good point. Are there any other parts of the statement of needs that anyone wishes to bring up or any or any further comments on the points that at least have been picked out? Now I picked out the points that I thought that were most relevant to landmarks and land use. I didn't see anything else particular, but if there's somebody it's anything else that any member wishes to put forward, I'm going to volunteer because we're talking about homeless, shelters to a certain extent, mr gordon there's a building on the corner of vanderbilt and dekalb avenue. That was previously a funeral parlor that has been renovated. It has all the signs inside it's a relatively large building. There are rumors that is going to be a shelter of sorts. So for mr paris, is there any way we can check out? If that's a potential, I could check the ownership of that property. Okay, but that won't tell us what the property is being developed for or if it's being developed for a homeless, shelter is what the community is hearing. I could check into that yeah easily. Am I right and thinking that we would welcome more buildings like 90 sands? Isn't that was it like? I got the address right, a building that was taken over by not-for-profit that houses, formerly homeless people and has services in the building. It's it sounds it's a wonderful project. I think I got the address yeah. That's. That was a very good project. I think, because, especially because it's highly structured and the people there have a good track record from properties that they've had I'm trying to remember the group, but it's a I can't remember breaking ground breaking ground. Thank you. Esther yeah, yes, breaking ground did a very good job on that, and it's it's not just the usual. Oh we're just picking people off the street and throwing them into a place. You know it's going to be closely regulated and the people there will be closely helped and yeah. I think I think people most, I think most people would be glad to see projects like what breaking ground does just a matter, but this particular property was not. We were lucky, they were lucky to get it, and I think we were fortunate that they were able to pull together and come to us. The address that john mentioned, the calvin and vanderbilt and vanderbilt doesn't da says, have to give notice to the board if they're going inside a shelter there or a facility. Oh there is a 30-day notification requirement. Have we received any notification at all 30 days, 60 days, 100 days? I have not for that property. No, there's a first there's a person I mean. Is it I mean it's gonna I mean I'm just concerned that they're going to serve typically just open up the shelter overnight and then call it an emergency. That's been the mode of operandi of these says ernie and rob I'm seeing in the chat room that somebody named dstar. I don't know that. I don't know who this person is said that the dhs has to notify the community board. If I'm right in interpreting his chat. I believe that's he's. Muted, though we can't hear him, I don't know why yeah it was hims or her and daughtry car starfin you're fellow committee member reports that she is having trouble with her microphone and yes, so there is a 30 day notification. Yes, elected officials and community boards are often surprised. Despite that notification, there's a variety of reasons for why that happens, but ernie's kind of I would like for us to you know to receive some notification before the back and then after the fact. Oh ernest this is esthetic. I heard the same room about that building but yeah. I don't like dealing with I heard and I was concerned because I live on vanderbilt, but they told me that it's not going to be a homeless joke. It's like a room in houses. I think it's for college students yeah, but the thing is definitely not going to be a homeless shelter. It's going to be. I shouldn't use the word room house, but I don't know what other word to use, but you know dory dormitory, yes type living. I believe you know I don't care what it's what it's going to be used for. I don't like, since I live in poor grand clinton hill. I don't like dealing with rumors and misinformation and disinformation. I just want the facts period. Well, I think we'll rob will keep an eye on that. I don't know yeah and we'll, hopefully, when he finds out he'll, be able to pass on word to us, either by email or at an upcoming meeting of some sort, so that we can just to know what's going on, because there is it's a lot of concern of that particular intersection and want to make sure that it's something that we know we get the heads up on one way or the other are any other points on any of the statement of needs. We're just we're. Just focusing on land use right, we're focusing mainly on land use because there's economic issues, okay, so for land use, we're saying, affordable, housing and some way of dealing with the downtown football, perhaps and then homeless, shelters those three things or yeah. I mean I only brought up a homeless shelter because I thought that it might over that it might fall into our lap or part of it, but it doesn't seem to you know we can. We can comment upon it, but it doesn't seem to be an area that we would be involved with at landmark land use. I noticed a comment in the chat room from hazra and I'll. Just read it verbatim. In light of all the blm issues we saw in our district is police community relations, something we should consider- and I might direct this question to mr- do whether he foresees this being an issue discussed at tomorrow night's transportation and public safety committee meeting. The answer as to whether it's going to be discussed is an absolute yes, because I bring this up at every meeting. If there's something specific that the writer would like to address, they are feeling free to call in and participate. The commenter is your fellow board member hazra ali, oh azra, call and participate. Oh yes, we always recently have had to discuss. It should be the first item on the agenda. It's not actually the first. The first item on tomorrow's agenda by the way is eleven hoyt, but they will be brief. Okay, if there are no others. I thank you for your the comments and discussion on the statement of needs and I guess actually we can this actually slide in. I guess it's a good way to do it, because next coming up is our community forum. This opens up the discussion really to all participants. So it's not just members of the board or members of the committee, but anybody else who is sitting in our little online meeting if they have any comments or anything else that they wish to bring up yeah. No. This is just a general observation earnest. Okay. Yes, we were as ever looking at this cb budget request and we're in the middle of a pandemic, and, as I understand it, most state and municipal governments are broke. Your budgets have been blown out blown out of the waters, so you know I'm hearing about layoffs of city employees, possibly to close the budget gap, and I don't know what the city council is doing, but this is beginning to be more like an academic exercise this year, because we don't know what the budget's going to look like tax revenues are down. We are in deep trouble, I think it's positive and the state. You know I think it's clear that the budgets of both are really in terrible condition, because the economies are just not moving the way they used to, even though a few places have opened up still many places that would be contributing tax monies, entertainment theaters inside not only just for restaurants, I mean some are doing it, but really the money, a lot of money from indoors the and the indoor malls still have not reopened the one that we have. You know the indoor malls that we have in this our area every open and they have a lot of businesses as well. You know sitting there empty, so it's a they're, not paying tax. You know at this point they're not generating tax revenue and we all those people who would normally be paying taxes or not at this time. So we do have a big problem, mr gordon speaking of empty, with all the development residential that has yet to be completed. Can we get an analysis of the developments that are empty? What their prospects are these buildings going to remain empty, what's happening with the rental market in downtown Brooklyn? Okay, I was going to bring that up in my chair report, but I'll well, okay, let's do it now and it's one of the things that I was just very concerned about is it I think we have a very strange situation that, yes, we do on one hand this committee going to be receiving a lot of pr of proposals, a lot of projects to do major work in this in our in our board. We're going to be getting a lot to try to get again large buildings, there's a demand for apparently that they feel it's going to be coming up for the larger high-rises. They still want to do it and they feel that they can make. You know a profit from these things at the same time- and I thought in today's, the headline just saw the headline of new york times on my phone. The headline shows that there is a lot that there is a as we, the new york city now has one of the look. We have at this time, the largest vacancy rate that we've had for many years, and so we have to balance something. I think we should keep we're gonna have to bear in mind as they come say. This is what you what this district needs. This is what downtown Brooklyn needs. Is this new giant proposal that they're going to be coming to us? At the same time, we have to bear in mind that perhaps not all those I those units that they're going to be building will be come up and it's a it's something that like this at this point, all I can is that we should. We have to bear it in mind as the applications come to us. That was one. That was my thing that I wanted to lead off for my chairs report discussion, because that's something that seems to be coming more and more, I think, of a problem. Will there be a you know many vacancies coming up? Actually, alan washington allen. Are you still there still here, mr gordon? Okay, thanks alan, what I'd like to? I don't know, since you are a close to a lot of this stuff, is there a way that you could get to maybe or does your organization have a listing of all the recent new buildings that have been completed and are and, in addition are being built, let's say along let's say the flatbush avenue corridor and along the livingston street skimmerhorn streets corridor, because that seems to be where a lot of buildings are really being put up. Is there you guys the organization that you have? Do you guys keep a track of it? Do you have a maps of it or a list of it, something that could be shared with us by any chance? Mr gordon, if you're referring to the downtown Brooklyn partnership by, I haven't been with the partnership in a number of years now, but I can make the ask. I think that there's something that's actually readily available that we could share, but I would like to ask for you all right. I appreciate that yeah, mr washington yeah, you may recall that mr washington gave us the most detailed presentation on downtown Brooklyn a couple of years ago. At and it would be very helpful if the partnership continues to do that, information that they provide us with as comprehensive a plan at this current stage that they had done a couple of years ago. It's time for us to get up to speed with what people know in our district. We just need to know. What's going on, they tend to have this information. We should request they come and do the same presentation that was done three or four years ago by mr washington, and I did ask him for that presentation in writing, but it was the purview of the partnership, so we never got it, but we need to yeah well he's going to try to do us a favor on this one and they appreciate anything he can help us with and, of course, any presentation like that, I think actually is going to. I think we'll have to it- should be done when we can all really be together. I would think, as opposed to just doing it through these virtual things. I think something like that. Would you know hopefully, but you know we'll, take it one step at a time. My feeling is that cut that nature of that kind of presentation, hopefully, can be done in person. But let's see what el, what allen can get for us in the meanwhile and anything and alan? If there's anything that you need me or any follow-up, you have my, I guess emails and phone numbers. Let me know if you need my help I'll be glad to help. Well, if it's going to be in person, it has to be at the barclays center for social distancing, maybe at the barclays. Okay. Are there any other comments for the community forum, okay, which who is that alan? No, it's me. Oh okay, all right, yeah! There are no more voting matters. I understand. Thank you. Ernest okay, bye, it's well! Okay, yeah! The only other thing we have that require voting by the or at least consent by the committee. The minutes from the last meeting karen does a great job. Given what we have I received it looked at it looked fine. Are there any objections or any thing else that has to be added to the minutes from the previous okay approval? Okay in a second I'll? Second, it any other. I don't think we need to do a roll call. I just want to get if there's any objections or any problems if they're none. Okay. Thank you very much next thing I said: okay I'll go I'll hop over now. I can hop over to the chairs report. One thing that well, a couple of things that have come up is okay. There is rob paris and I had a information meeting on and we're speaking of large buildings. This one is coming up going to be going through the border standard of appeals. It'll not it'll, not be coming to us. I don't have a specific address, but it's look. It's going to be located at ashland and the cow it's going to be a large one. It's going to be 47 stories and it's going to be it's a c as in carlton six for zoning, what they'll be seeking from the board of standard appeals, there'll be 569 units, 172 of them will be affordables or designated as affordables, it's being put up by the rockrose development group they're doing the permits through the border, stand into the appeals and they they. It came to us just to make sure that if we had any problems or any major, you know you know points that we have to be made. It's going to be a large one, it'll be have a glass and brick on the front. Okay location is yeah, ashland dekalb, I see that's question that just came up. The their plan is to hopefully, as they start the application process with the border standards and appeals that they would begin work in august of 2021, so it'll take them to you know, go the application process with the bsa. I think that covers rob is anything else that I think I'd try to get the major points on that one anything else I should have thrown out or let people know. The real major point is that they are applying for permission to build in the right-of-way of ashland place when the four greenhouses were constructed in the 1940s. What are now ingersoll and whitman ashland place was mapped much wider than it's built, and so what the applicant is applying to the board of standards and appeals for is the ability to build in what is legally the right of way. Their argument is that one this was done 75 years ago and the city has never done anything to widen the street. You know I that what happened in the last 75 years doesn't necessarily predict what would happen in the future. But for me, a more persuasive argument that they make is that in order to widen the street, a portion of the bam harvey theater would need to be torn down. The city and others have invested a great deal of money into the bam harvey and they are probably correct when they make the argument that that's not going to occur and therefore there is no harm in building in the right of way. Yeah, that's part is particularly very narrow, as you know, if you go up or down on ashland, it's a fairly nice wide, I guess thoroughfare until you hit the cab and all of a sudden. It really narrows at that point, and I think one of the things they were hoping to do with the new construction would be to open it up a little bit so that these I think the sidewalks would be a little wider and that the walkways will be a little bit wider, at least in that little section of ashland. If I think I'm correct on that point right, so this is not the parking lot well it'll be there will be parking. No, it's not the yeah, that's across the street from Brooklyn hospital. No talking about that parcel! No mister! Do it's the parking garage that is cater corner from the hospital, so the garage would be eliminated is the proposal, including parking that will replace the parking garage. This thing over 100 parking spots would be included in the new development. Okay versus. What's currently provided well. What's currently, provided is a parking garage that is open to anyone. I believe the parking that would be included in this project is accessory parking for the residential units upstairs okay, so we would lose the public park. I believe so, mr gordon, that's a concern and unless we can get an analysis that the parking that is currently taking place there is nominal or there is some alternative to the parking if it were to be removed, that is proximal and serves the community. Do the Brooklyn hospital doctors spark there? You know we have to take a larger look at all of the impacts and address them as much as we can through every committee. But land use has a lot to do with that. But do we get to say anything about the bsa or just yeah we're not there? We wouldn't be involved directly to bsa, but I think what we can do to express our opinions. I think here at this meeting, and I guess I guess the board office can convey that to the bsa to say well just what john said, for example, that there is a concern about losing. You know the public parking, especially for use by people and by hospital employees. But if I, if I may I'd like to remind the committee that the question is not, do you like this project or not, the question is: do we have an opinion on an as of right project being constructed in a map street that is not built to its full width? Isn't that a similar issue as to what we currently have on fleet street? That is the one other location where we had a gcl35 application and we denied a school being built on that block because it was too narrow. Oh no, it's so same street same block. The additional street width is on the other side of the street and yeah. That's the one right by where I live across the street, from where mr gordon lives, a new building is being built in part of the right-of-way right, there's a new building being built on the like western side of fleet, and then there was a proposal and which has still been going for an office building on fleet as well. They had proposed in that for a school, but that did that came off the I guess off the drawing board so to speak, so that was pulled so they're there, and I understand I guess it's still open. The other thing is to propose the office building on sleep on free place for free rather getting back to this proposal. It does not involve and do we know of anything that is planned for that parking lot. At this point, the long island university parking lot. Yes, I do not, but I think it is fair to say that, as liu with their development partner, rxr builds the apartment house and retail and new athletic fields across from university towers that if they have additional parking new parking constructed at willoughby and ashland, it is foreseeable that the garage building and the parking lot then become potential development sites. Okay, how long is it going to take for that to develop well they're building the building right now the building is, I think I would say the framework is completed. I can see that they're putting on the facade right now. The actual corner, I think, is still in construction, so to speak at ashland and willoughby. You know so that's a I guess yeah. So those are still under construction, so to speak at this time by rxr and long island university. But I guess what we can do. The best we can do at this point is that we can hopefully convey a conce that concern about the loss of potential public parking for this ashland dekalb development, which is going before the board is standard in appeals. Mr gordon yeah, maybe we could ask mr washington if he can inquire with the partnership if they have done any analysis of parking in downtown Brooklyn, also it. The partnership is an important resource that maybe we should align ourselves more closely with, because they have an opportunity to give us information that we don't we're not able to get from the city as readily. So, let's see what out I like this allen, you want to respond, so I think rob will be able to circulate this in short form, but there is a section of the downtown Brooklyn partnerships website that has all of the reports and things that they have put together recently, including information on developments. What's in the pipeline number of units, all that stuff infrastructure stuff that they have publicly available, so I think that's a good place to start to look to see what they have. Thank you forever. You guys, thank you anna, I think, that'll be most helpful. Any little bit we can kind of put our finger on would be most helpful. Okay, the only other point I want to make on the chairs report. We were because, like I said, we're concerned with the desire of people to come, on the other hand, I'll say on the other hand, and maybe judy might or maybe judy does or doesn't know, matt damon has moved into a building. I think it's called if they get the name, if it's one of the older buildings on columbia heights and took over two story, the top two stories. So if matt damon is coming to our neighborhood, perhaps there still is demand for our neighborhood and then people who want to do develop to come in and live here. So I think it's I think. Who knows you know? Perhaps you know it could be six or one and a half dozen of the other. All right. I have nothing else in my chairs report. Is there any other business? Well, did you hear anything about beyonce and jay-z moving down into dumbbells? They never seem to hang around here. I don't know. Jay-Z seems you know he's. I know he's had some kind of brew project but jay-z. Never I don't know if he wants to come back here anymore. He doesn't remember, he stole his. He stole his interest in the barclays and he sold his interest in the nets. So I don't. I don't know if he wants a hanger, you know he might do he has something going on, but I don't think he wants to hang with us. Unfortunately, just carlton in matt damon may have signed a lease on an apartment a couple of years ago, and there are other movie stars in brooklynites, but the market is pretty dead. Houses are sitting on the market, the interest is elsewhere. Other parts of Brooklyn heights is no longer so hot. By the way. Mr gordon, someone texted that the vacancy rate in downtown Brooklyn is 14. That was doctrine, okay, interesting something, that's similar. It's something that's similar across the entire city. I mean it's not just heights. It's just residential right now in new york city is not what's hot, it's out in the suburbs. It's outside of the city, that's what's happening, and that's the point. If you have this kind of a glut and all this development is planned to continue to happen. Where is the money going to come from the people who are not going to be here to rent these apartments? So we need to have an overall look at the potential impact, so we could plan for whatever it is. That might be happening, but clearly we're no longer a desire point, because there's no desired points on this earth anymore, and we need to take this kind of happenstance into consideration. As we talk about what's going to be happening in the district going forward, it's going to be different for, though, that we don't jump to conclusions too quickly because I think we're just beginning to enter in what the full impact is going to be with all of this- and you know where we are now compared to where we might be at the beginning of next year, could be, could be very different. Alan, I agree with you and my request is that we begin to take a look at it. So we simply understand where we are, what is expected to happen, so we can make some understanding as to what we should be looking at and what recommendations we should be making, because at this point we wait until everything happens and then we turn around and say. Well, we should have done this and we should have done that. We need to get ahead of it and just in terms of the information so that we can understand the trends and make decisions based on what we think is going to happen. Well, let's see what alan can at least direct us to and well he just did. He gave us the website. We need to look at the website. Okay, we'll look at the websites and we'll look nation and after the next meeting we'll have a few minutes. Where we can, you know begin, you know, discuss how we can proceed from there. I ask that we get the website distributed to the committee so that we can actually have a basis for something to talk about. Okay, email. I have everybody, has my email. So if it's something that you can, you can email it to me and I'll distribute it to every emails for it, I'll distribute it. Mr gordon, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, I'm just going to say I'll distribute it before anyone gets home, but you're already there whenever you can deliver a word well, I feel, even though I'm sitting in my in my apartment, I feel when these meetings are still out there somewhere, so it's all right and any other business from anyone else. If not motion to include adjourned, getting a couple of people still moved. Thank you very much. That's right, bye! Everybody! Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for the tough times and thank you for helping out. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.",
        "summary": "Commission applications, the first one is two now do yourself: First, hmm, you have to introduce yourself, not the community members, necessarily okay, First one is 295 cumberland street in fort greene historic district The application is to remove the existing okay hold on a second roof deck and construct the full width.\nFull scope, that's being reviewed, is the, as mentioned a one-story garden level, extension on the rear of the building and the review as we'll go through as a 12 foot extension Here we are in the fort green historic district image on the left shows the front facade of the building is a wood frame building the view on the right shows the site plan The grade box is basically the extension again, a 12 foot extension from the current rear facade and that's a roof deck On top of the extension.\nAm I correct those long steps at the top you'll see this better and from the following ones, but those are steps coming up from the level of the garden to the rear yard and the shorter steps on the right are stairs coming down from the roof deck to the yard, Side is going to be the street So, just to give a little bit of a scope of the entire street, we're going between green avenue and lafayette avenue between cumberland and carleton All of the different colors that you can see are the extensions already on the block.\nSo there's quite a few extensions We were asked by the landmarks commission to find an average of those and those average out to 14 feet partially Some historic photos, probably a little less relevant, but just to give you a sense of where it was no longer doing any work on the front facade that needs feedback from the committee.\nWe we've ended up taking off side lights from the door, it's all existing within the current opening for that door, Yes, the landmarks preservation committee is comfortable handling that at staff level and therefore the work you're asking us to improve is basically the rear extension.\nThis is the existing condition of the rear and then the new, so large windows on the back, but just under the garden level, the roof deck extends out to the exact same point as the facade of the building.\nCosmeri are here as well, so we have a lot of people I see adam street library, so we wanted to give a little bit of context to the signage project and also just we are really excited about this project, and you know I think it'll be a really great addition to your community The adams.\nWhat's great about the site is that on john street, the newer developments are a little bit pushed to the side so that our library, which is occupies just a part of the ground floor, has amazing views out over the waterfront, and we also have no real neighbors on the adam street side We have spent a lot of time in community outreach on this project and working with groups at both in dumbo, and we made a presentation.\nRecently it does kind of stick out to the water, so it's visible from many areas even from Manhattan, but when up close- and you know, we really want to make sure that the library stands out and that it's clear where this new public institution is and where people can go.\nThe thompson meter company in the neighborhood also still retains some of this large super graphics, sweeney manufacturing, company, the brillo, the preview paints and, of course, the eagle warehouse, probably the best known building in the in the community, as well as the empire stores, and we also note that more recently, peop retail tenants have been picking up on this as well Our proposal is to utilize a word that everyone recognizes that is as clear as gay and just a proper noun, It's completely transparent and it's a black material and on the outside, it's white, so it reflects against the windows and you'll really read this big bold sign, I forgot to mention you know.\nThere were a couple of things that looked like it was listed in the health area, but I thought for things that I don't know One was the 39 auburn street auburn place homeless, shelter which was supposed to have a upgrade now I guess our health committee?\nWe've been asking the city to do that, re-evaluate the land use based on what we approved in the early 2000s, when we did the upzoning for downtown Brooklyn, where we thought we were going to get a lot of commercial and we got basically residential That is the budget priority While you were chairperson, you co-signed a letter with then council member leticia james, asking the department of city planning to take a fresh look at the downtown rezoning and the response that you got from the chair of the city.\nDon't think that the sentiment at at the department of city planning has changed in the years since I would also like to remind the committee that that they that there was a capstone project by four wagner, nyu wagner students that looked at the downtown rezoning That was something that was pushed by former committee member Oh, how quickly names evaporate once these people leave the previous , the previous secretary of the committee's name is You, know I and just one personal comment: Are, you saying we're wasting our time with regard to that one particular budget priority?\nIt's a lot of concern of that particular intersection and want to make sure that it's something that we know we get the heads up on one way or Just, focusing on land use right, we're focusing mainly on land use because there's economic issues, okay, so for land use, we're saying, affordable, housing and some way of dealing with the downtown football, perhaps and then homeless, shelters.\nBut it doesn't seem to you know we can We can comment upon it, but it doesn't seem to be an area that we would be involved with at landmark, land use, Just read it verbatim, In light of all the blm issues we saw in our district is police community relations, something we should consider- do whether he foresees this being an issue discussed at tomorrow, night's transportation and public safety committee.\nYou know we have to take a larger look at all of the impacts and address them as much as we can through every committee I think here at this meeting I guess the board office can convey that to the bsa to say well just what john said, for example, that there is a concern about losing You, know the public parking, especially for use by people and by hospital employees But if I."
