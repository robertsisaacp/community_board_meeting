            "fullTranscript": "Okay, great so before we get started well, do we want to do a little check on this members present? I have Elita Barry Brian Cause, Marco Lorraine and myself did I miss anyone so feel free to raise your hand, I see Russell squires signing in right now so, okay, great yeah, so I'm going to lower your hand for now raise it again. If you have something you have to ask about all right, so we're two minutes past 6:30, so I think we can get started so good evening. Am I coming through loud and clear? Can everyone hear me good welcome everybody to the Street Life Committee of Community Board 8.? My name is Abraham Salcedo and I chair this committee a couple of rules of the road, as always we'll go through the agenda. I will ask for the representative for each item to speak to that item and tell us about the application. I will then invite members of the public to comment or question the application, and then I will go to my fellow committee members for any questions or comments. As a reminder, any item that is voted on here will go as a recommendation to the full board meeting, which will be in September. The next full board meeting is September 16th, so all of those will go to that meeting unless there's any time sensitive applications that need to be sent out before then, in which case those will go as committee resolutions, and with that there's no questions for comments. We'll start with the first item. 1A, do I have the representative for Apq 1131. If you could raise your hand through the participant menu I have on my list. The names are Marina and Ryan are either of you here. I do not see anybody by those names. I mean. I see a mario hi good evening- everybody. Yes, I'm here to represent the Hong Kong City on great. So, let's start with, will you be representing for all of the items? A3? Okay, that's correct! So, okay, let's take them one at a time for voting purposes and, let's start with item a and take it from there. Okay, I apologize. This is my first time representing a company, but well could you just clarity? What is item a sure? This is for the 1131 Madison Avenue, okay, and this is showing as a new application for wine beer and cider they're all actually new applications. So I guess the first question is tell us a little bit more of. Why are these all new applications? I think I know the answer, but okay sure yeah, so we were recently purchased by Rfi, Brands and so part of that transition has been switching over all of our permits and licenses over to the new owner, okay, understood and so there's no other change other than just to reflect the change in ownership. Exactly and will this be true of each of the five items here? That's correct: okay! Okay, so with that, I will inquire if there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on I'm going to invite questions on items a b, c d or e, since they are all identical, if you could use the participants menu, I do not want to see people raising their hands like this and miss you. So we will use the raise hand feature through the participants menu, so you have Scott Greenspun and Jane. I do not want to mispronounce your last name, but Jane you want to go to Scott first, yes, Scott! You may need to push a button at the I I've just unmuted. Can everybody hear me? Okay, terrific, so my name is Scott Greenspun, I'm an attorney with the firm of Braverman Greenspun and our firm represents the board of managers of the terrain condominium, and my comments are, I believe, with item number d: that's on Lexington Avenue and 65Th Street location, philippines. The applicant is the tenant in the sole retail unit and an otherwise residential condominium. The unit owner's deed for that premises is subject to a declaration, and the use of the declaration specifically excludes any sale of alcoholic beverages, wine, beer, cider or anything else. It's not only Rep. It's not only referenced in the declaration. It's reference and the bylaws it's referenced in the offering plan. Certainly the tenant of the unit owner is going to be subject to those restrictions. The unit owner purchased the retail unit, knowing full well that there could not be any sale of alcoholic beverages in that premises. Certainly, the purchase price would have reflected that and on the other hand, all of the residential unit owners purchased in the building, with the clear understanding that there would be no sale of alcoholic beverages in the retail unit. The owner and the applicant were well aware of that restriction for the yet additional reason that several years ago, they came to the board of managers requesting a change that would permit them to sell alcoholic beverages from the retail unit. That request is denied, and, quite frankly, we were a little surprised and taken aback that this application would have been made to the community board when the tenant and the owner of the retail unit know full well that, whether as a as a community, it would be permissible in this particular premises. It would be illegal to do so, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you very much. Scott, yes, and I do note that we have the letter on file as well. So thank you. Thank you. Okay do not have any other public members. First before I go to Jane, you lowered your hand. If you want to speak, I see you shaking your head, so I would just interject I apologize. Jane Hootis is a member of the the Terrain Board of managers. I would have introduced her, but I was not sure if she was going to speak or not, but I think now that she knew that I was present and participating. She may not have any further comment: she's shaking her head that way: okay, terrific! So you have Judy schneider from the 60s Neighborhood Association hi Dude. Do I have to unmute myself? Or can you hear me? We hear you okay, so I'm a little confused the restaurant. The restaurant itself is okay serving food there. It's the liquor license that this gentleman is objecting to because of the documents. Is that correct I'll? Let Scott respond, but if I'm understanding it correctly the even though this is the sole commercial space that is allows food is specified within the lease and other documentation. There is an explicit prohibition on the sale of of any kind of alcohol. That's correct. Food can be sold from the premises, but it must be food that is prepared, off- premises. So no cooking is permitted in the in the retail unit. It must be prepared in other places and then brought into the retail unit and in addition to that restriction, there's a restriction on the sale of any alcohol of any sort. I just wanted to speak in support of this application. It's a place that I frequent very often because of its location and near all the subways whenever I'm meeting people this is the place that seems to be the most convenient to eat. Food is good. The service is good and I think it's a real asset to the community and I would hate to see it go away. Thank you, Judy. Thank you. Okay, he's getting no more hands from Public, I see Rebecca's hand is up from committee members and then I'll take other committee member questions or comments as well. Hi. Just two quick things will. Could you send the letter in the chat? I can not send it in the chat, but I will email it to you perfect. Thank you and then my question for Scott. You said they came before you recently to ask to get permission. What year was that I do know not. I do not know exactly what year it is, but it was several years ago, it's possible that Jane Hudas might know the particular year. Okay, thank you, but just but to clarify this would not. This would require a change of the governing documents. It's not a an a matter of the board deciding that, yes, we would like to. We would decide that we would like to have alcoholic beverages served. This is this. Prohibition is in the governing documents, it's in the declaration that is recorded when the condominium was formed and all of the deeds are subject to that restriction and including, most importantly, the owner of the retail unit. Yeah. No, of course thanks. I just wanted to make sure I had a better understanding of the timeline it was. It was sever. It was several years ago it was not recently. Okay, thank you and Abraham. If I may interrupt, there are a couple people from the public who want to speak on these, who do not know how to raise their hand. So I just want to really quickly tell everybody how to raise their hand. You can open the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. Right now, it looks like the number 34 and two little people are standing next to each other. If you open that up, you'll see a menu that pops up and, on the left hand side of that menu, there will be a button that says raise hand. You should be able to raise your hand from that Otherwise, John and Alex have both. They both raise their hands now: okay, let's continue with John and Alex, so John, First and Alex to close out any public just a time as to how long has the existing or the pre- existing restaurant been there, and for how long has it been in possession of a license to serve alcohol? Oh I do not. I do not think it's ever been. We are unaware of the business ever being in possession of a license to serve alcohol and, as far as we know, they've never served alcohol. So this it's not mere. This is not merely as far as we know. This is not a matter of just changing the name due to a a corporate restructuring. There has never been alcohol served in this premises and and it would have been impermissible to do so. I think the the restaurant has been there for several years. I do not know exactly how many years and I can get that information to you, but it has not been a an establishment that has served alcohol. Has it served food? Yes, it's no. The food is not prepared there. That is also strictly prohibited by the governing documents of the condominium. It's prepared, off- premises and then delivered to the premises for sale. That sounds as though it's different from what the applicant had said at the outset, so yeah I can't I can't speak to that. I just. I only know that there that alcohol has not been served and we are. We are unaware of any liquor license for that premises. I apologize for that just to be clear. That location has been there since 2015.. I just joined the company back in January and I was not aware that did not have a liquor license before so I apologize for not being correct in that aspect. It's our understanding. This is for a new liquor license in a place that had not sold liquor before that's correct, so the other four. I I'm certain that they had liquor licenses before this one. We have not had a liquor license. Okay, thank you for that clarification and just mario are just following up. Are you aware of the prohibition that is being mentioned here? I received the letter from the attorney. I got copy of the letter right and we were hoping that, in light of the circumstances that they would reconsider, it's never a beer and wine have never been our main avenue revenue at any of our locations. We just like to offer it as a yes to complement the experience by offering belgian we are belgian, Company, Select, Belgium, beer and wines. We do not have a outdoor patio, we're, not a bar in any sense of the word, and so in light of the circumstances, we were just hoping that they would reconsider. Okay, thank you Mario! So well, let's continue with the public hands. I think Alex was next Alex. You may hi, so I live in the neighborhood near the 1133 Madison Location and I just wanted to speak up in favor of their application. They've been here for 20 years, and it's been a great company and our particular neighborhood has recently lost two places where people can go and have a glass of wine due to redevelopment at the corner of 86 and Madison. So Peg Quotation previously had organic wines on offer at the restaurant location, on Madison between 84 and 85, and I think her neighborhood would like to see that again and would benefit from that opportunity. Great. Thank you very much. Okay, seeing no other public hands, but if you do well, let me know otherwise I think Russell was the first hand I saw then marco then Laureen Russell thanks. So it sounds to me like other than 1d. The rest of these pancreatitian applications are pretty uncontroversial, yeah uncontroversial. So I think we should maybe just sort of separate them and it seems to me like there is not really any opposition. I would move to approve the you know the ones in section one other than 1d and with regard to 1D I mean my view is that I think we should respect the you know the commercial unit agreement that they have, and I you know, I'm very sympathetic to the circumstances of Covid-19, and I know that you know we're. Obviously, there been a lot of changes to the rules lately and things like that, and I'm generally in favor of trying to be flexible in order to keep people in business through Covid-19 and help people out, but I think in this instance it's it really would not be fair to the people in that building, who, I think, have a reasonable expectation that you know the contractual provisions that they put in place would be honored, and so I think I would say we should disapprove the 1d and approve the others. Russell keep going along marco. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, and they complain, is very valid from the attorney, but the issue. What I perceive is we do not have to go inside of the small of the business between the co- op or the buildings and the tenant. In this case the restaurant or the cafe. Our role is basically is to see if we comply or not with its own resolution on the Sony resolution, that place is located in group six, which is eating and drinking establishment having a drink and eating and drinking establishment. That is the only part that is our rule. Also, the legal license authority. They will see if it's in the group, six or not. That is the commissioner said to us as long as in group. Six, we can not object. Obviously, if there are misconduct of the applicant absolutely we can go against them, but in this case there is no such a complaint. The complaint is it's a legal issue between the tenant and the under on the and the residents or whatever by- laws they violate. That is a legal issue between these two, but our role is just only since there is nothing that tell me that this restaurant behave wrong in the community or does not fit in the in the commercial district. From my point of view, we should approve these applications too, because that is our role is to see if it's comply or not with the with the regulations, and my position is in this case. I strongly support these locations, I think, is what they asking is. No even asking is cedar one and bigger, and I think it's reasonable what they ask they and more likely. If you, if you check the time of the operation, it looks like it's going to be very early they're, going to close, so whatever problems that they have between the tenant and the building is between them. It's not us for us is what is the compliance of the Sony resolution, which is commercial space, and that's why I strongly support this application. Thank you. Thank you good evening. This is Mrs Brown hi. First of all, I'd like to request that all the applicants date, whether or not the location has outdoor area and the hours of the establishment with regard to this particular application. I respect the prohibition for 1d that based on the law and what our role is we're to rule on the compliance of the law. So, therefore I would support the application and hopefully the residents can work this out. Thank you, okay, thank you. Abraham. We have John who spoke earlier in the public and then Barry Elita, Russell and cause okay. Let's go to John. If, hopefully, it's a new point or a new statement, it's just a good question. In brief, the is the I guess it's to Mario is the menu at Madison Location Madison, Avenue Location different from the other locations, so the menu is the same at all of the locations that were reopening in Manhattan, as well as the hours so just to clarify on the hours. We're open Monday through Friday from 9 am until 6 pm, mainly serving breakfast and lunch and on the weekends from 9 am sorry from Monday through Friday from 8 A.M to 6 P.M on the weekends from 9 am to 6 pm, so we do close early. We have truncated our menu, so we are are not serving the full menu that we used to have so between the limited hours and the truncated menu. We've chosen to reopen up the stores that way and then we'll I'll wrap up that menu as we reopen the stores, maybe we'll reevaluate that in a couple of months, so is food prep being anticipated in any of these venues. So all of our food is perhaps that our main commissary in long island city and then it's distributed to all of our stores each morning throughout the day, oh yeah, but things like hard- boiled, eggs and scrambled eggs, and things like that are plainly local. So we do not. We do not have a hot kitchen in any of our locations, which means there's no open flames. So as far as our hard- boiled eggs go, we do prepare those on site. Everything else is prepared offside, so we do not serve scrambled eggs or anything like that, but we have an oven that we do use to heat things up, but that's about it. Just as a resin between two of the venues they're. I do not know that I could live without them. It's been for me, one of the primary losses of, and that's to say it has not touched. The pandemic has not touched my life very directly at all, but even so the I'm. I live part of the year in Budapest Hungary, which still has a strong and vibrant, cafe culture and trying to find something like that in Manhattan is a near impossibility. My wife and I we're both in our 70s and we and both of us employed full- time, but we spend a substantial amount of time on a maybe four to five days a week basis just sitting at one another of the venues and and imagining that New York had as civilized a an attitude towards street life as as brutal does so. I wish you well. Thank you. Thank you for your support. Okay, let's go to Barry hey, you may have to push a button there you go good evening. My first reaction was to table the issue on Lexington Avenue and both the other together. However, listening to marco, perhaps we should allow the tenant and the landlord. If you want to call the condo landlord to work out their details, it's more convenient for them to work it out when they have a liquor license or have you the prop the prospect of being able to use liquor license to negotiate with the with the landlord? That was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, Le Pen Cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district, and I would love to see them continue in business with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the board of managers to amend their rules regarding legalizing. So I'm in support of the applications all together taken as one thank you thank you elita. I would have to respectfully disagree with Marco and Barry and Lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no we're not being neutral in the discussion between the building and the proposed and the tenant. We're taking a position and putting a lot of pressure on the building, which I do not think is what we should be doing since we're representing the community and that building is part of our community. I support Pen Quotidian. I even call it the belgian place because there's one around the corner from where I live, and I think they make fantastic bread so, and I hope you continue the recipes, but I can't support the liquor license and I think it's wrong for us to intervene in what should be a contract to speak between the building and the tenant. Thank you, okay. Russell. Since you've spoken already, I'm going to just jump over here real quick and go to cause yeah. I agree with Marco and I agree with Russell. I think what we should do is look at the application based on what our role is. However, I would like to put the if we do approve that I would like to put in the stipulations that there is a legal binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant which the SLA should look at. I think that's all we can do. We can not approve or disapprove based on one side of the other. I think if we approve stipulation to the SLA that there is a legal, binding agreement between the landlord and the establishment and let them have it out: okay, thanks guys, Russell and then Judy so yeah. I just want to respond to the points that marco and then others had. So I I think in terms of the idea that you know we can only weigh in on the you know whether they conform to the zoning regulations or that kind of thing I mean, I think we routinely sort of look beyond just the narrow requirements of what the zoning is or whether they fit with those I mean, obviously, when we're sort of dealing with stipulations regarding how late a place can stay, open or music, or things like that. I mean, I think, that's stuff. That's sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements and that kind of thing- and you know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation. So I think we routinely sort of look beyond just what the zoning says or what have you to you know and kind of take the whole picture into account and what we're doing and then the second point I would make is you know I certainly am sympathetic to the idea that we do not want to wade into some kind of a complicated legal issue and that that's sort of beyond the scope of what we do on this committee, and I agree with that and I think that's right. I do not think that this is an instance of that kind of thing. I think here the material facts are really not in dispute by either side. I mean, I think, it's clear that there is this component to the offering plan this provision about what is permitted and not permitted in the commercial unit. I do not think that there's any dispute over that and what the applicant has said. Essentially, is not withstanding the fact that this is prohibited by this document, we're asking for permission to do it anyway. So I think if we were to sort of say well, look I think you're bound by this or you know we think it's reasonable for the building to hold you to this agreement. You know it's not resolution of some kind of legal issue on our part. It's basically just assessing the facts as they are presented to us in an undisputed fashion and making a decision on that which I do think we're capable of doing great thanks russell just quickly. For the record, I will second, your initial motion to take four of them together and vote separately on d. Okay, so now rounding out Judy, I forgot to ask Mario: are you still going to have all your wonderful baked goods that you had before, because that made going to the store? So wonderful? Yes, so all of the staples will still continue to serve all of the croissants pawn chocolates muffins, all of our wonderful breads. Those will also be available and are available great thanks, Judy, okay, back to Marco, I think. Oh in honor of the time, I think let's go, let's go, let's go. Do the four applications, let's go about that and then let's go keep opening and discussion the last application, because what my fellow community members said that we're going beyond this resolution- that's not true at all, because I'm the person that usually I fight strongly with this only resolution and I strongly I carefully review all the application that must be inside of these rules. So we never go where we go always is. According what are the commissioner of the legalizing Authority told us, which basically said as long as we see that's what he said in court group six, it is approved this application, so if we wanna disapprove, we can disapprove, but the liquid license authorities will approve. Unless is a full management. It is a full management. Yes, absolutely I will go against this place, but I do not hear complaints that there is garbage noise, drunks or any kind of issues that destroy the spirit of the sun resolution or the character of our community. So therefore, I never see these displays by the way, but as long as it fits in that condition, I think this is reasonable to approve this application. But let's go first with the four that you said: let's go both the four the first four and then we can keep discussing the last one. Thank you, okay. So I'm going to unless there's any objections, I'm interpreting Marcos, let's go with the four as a calling the question on the on one: a one b, one c and one e setting aside 1D for a separate discussion. If there's anyone's opposed to that committee, members indicate objection. Otherwise I think we can go to the virtual role on those items. Okay, so with the virtual role. If anyone is voting no or abstaining, we're not voting for cause on approving one a one b, one c and one e give us an indicator. If not, then we will say that those are approved unanimously and now we can go back and continue the conversation on one I d, as in David. I just want to clarify Cause and Mrs Brown and Elita. Are you guys raising your hand to vote against items, one a b, c and e, no great okay, so calling that good, I think, yep. Sorry! I just want to be clear. No, that's great! Okay! So now we're going to speak to one d more, so we have hands for one d, so cause Mrs, Brown, Elita and then Mr Greenspun yeah. I would like to make a motion that we approve the application, with the stipulation that there is a binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant and that the SLA strictly look at it. However, I have one question: can this be put off for a month or two that would be up to the applicant to determine whether they wanted to come back next month or after they've had their discussion and we can take it on from there or do they want to go tonight? You know we're asking people to be flexible and so we're willing to be flexible so sure we can wait a month. I mean it's only a suggestion I can't force. You know we can't force you, but it's a suggestion that if you come back in the meantime, the two sides can have a chat. So can we lay it over till next month? Okay, so if mario you're fine with that, and then that gives you to have further dialogue time with the co- op. So that way, we do not take a position until there's more of a resolve point there. We can do that, but just Wanna make sure you're fine with that. Yes, we're fine with that Mr Greenspun. This is the applicant's decision, but I'm assuming you have no issue with that. I do not have any issue with them, making a request to us, but we we would hope sincerely hope that the that the board would respect the wishes of the unit owners who bought in this building with the clear, concise and undisputed understanding that what the what the applicant wants to do can not be done in the building, and I think, with all due respect to the applicant. They put the cart before the horse and they should not have made an application at all until they knew whether there was an opportunity for for the board to make a decision whether they wanted to even attempt to change the documents, but if they want to go ahead and make some type of presentation directly to the board, then the board can consider it and the board can make it to termination, and you can come back in a month and advise the board the community board how the Condo Board decided to proceed well on a legal basis. We can not refuse them based on all the facts and what we are basically looking at. We could not refuse it all we're asking is that both sides sit down, then that would make our decision a lot easier. Okay, I will, I will caveat. I won't go as far to say we can't refuse it. Obviously individual members can vote. However, they wish, I think we're saying we can. We can take a vote, but if the applicant has happy to roll it over and laid over, then that provides some time for more on the back end and we can have more updated and informed vote. So with the applicant's request to do that, we will happily lay this over and revisit. I would ask just to indulge you in one respect, and that is that they we have a member of the of the board here, who speak to some issues relating to garbage and other things relating to Pancreatitian's operation, to the extent that would be considered by the board, and we can go ahead and address that in a month from now. I just did not want the community board to think that we were being disingenuous and not raising that and only raising it at the next meeting when we had not raised it now, but I think it would make sense for there to be we'll. Have a discussion we'll hear what they have to say and then we can add anything else on with respect to how the discussions went and other issues relating to pancreatitians operations at the next month's meeting, but I did not want. I wanted to raise that now. No, that's fair enough. We listen to everybody for all their complaints and everything. So I mean where all he is all the time yeah. No, I appreciate it. I guess that there was. We thought that beginning the beginning, middle and end would have been the legal issue, but I appreciate the comments that were made by the board members regarding their role and we can address you know all of these issues and the event that there's no agreement at the next board meeting. Okay, thanks all right. Well, we can, let's just go through the hands, I think Jane's waving her hand, she's yeah we're getting we're we'll get to all the hands, so you wanted to go to Mrs Brown next yeah Mrs Brown, just to see what everyone has to say and then I just have one question for attorney Greenspun. Does he know the reason why the Condo Board has prohibited alcohol in the restaurant? I think that the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol served that there was going to be very restrictive types of retail use, and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate, but then there's also the issue of what the people who reside in that building and it's their homes and their investments. What type of retail operations they would like to have there and, aside from no matter how limited in the beginning, you might think that there would be you'd have alcohol served. It goes down a slippery, stop slope. It goes from you know, just from cider to wine to beer to six seven to eight to nine to ten, and I think that everybody knew the Le Pen Catinia knew the unit owners knew what could be done in these premises. They're it's undisputed. The applicant does not say that there's some there's some misunderstanding or that we're not interpreting the documents, and I believe that the unit owners are entitled to have their contracts. The declaration is essentially a contract amongst all the unit owners to have their wishes respected and with all due respect. If the board goes ahead and ultimately says you can have a liquor license, it goes ahead and puts the unit owners on the defensive to a certain extent, notwithstanding that the applicant understands that they have no right to serve alcohol from that premises. All right. Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate it. You're welcome elita. Thank you. I have to say I- and this is just me speaking. I do not really understand why the applicant would come if there's a contract that prohibits it from serving alcohol and say I'd like a license. Anyway, they signed an agreement and I do not think it's our place to say it's not a valid agreement to me. It's not really different from other issues such as trash pickups and that having and making a mess on the street and that influencing decisions on whether there should be licenses. I just do not. I do not think it's right that they did it, and I do not think it's right that we just say a contract does not mean anything. I am a lawyer, as you know, I do not practice, but I just do not think it is right to say a contract is irrelevant and the applicant could come knowing it signed an agreement knowing it bought the prop the the license or the name or the restaurant. With that agreement in place and then asking for an override, I just to me it just does not. It just does not feel acceptable, so I'll I'll. Just leave it at that, and- and thank you for thank you. Okay, great and last comment we'll go to Jane and then we can move on as we're going to agree to revisit in September. First of all, I want to thank everyone and certainly appreciate the last comments I purchased an apartment, along with my husband and family in this building. From the very beginning, I'm also a board member. We carefully evaluated what type of commercial restrictions would be in this space downstairs with all of them outlined, meaning no cooking in the building, no alcohol and several others. We went ahead and invested both in this apartment, as did everybody else in the building and the board. Based on that understanding, when Lepan approached us four or five years ago to ask go against that and could we serve, you know, could they serve liquor? The reality was: we've had years of trash all over Lexington avenue that our building superintendent cleans up himself there's been massive turnover in that location. The managers do not know from one thing, one time to the next what's going on and we as a building, take on the responsibility of cleaning up Lexington avenue, picking up trash and taking care of that area. The notion aside, the fact that it is not our wish to have an open bar in our building. There are grave concerns about refuse about bottles, and I know this came up earlier. I tried to raise my hand but refuse bottles and mess on top of the situation for the last five years has been very difficult to manage and we've been kind and supportive, so it is with that both legal basis, but also understanding that is not meant to be difficult. We do not feel it's in the best interests of the residents of our building who have purchased there, and so we need to support that. Thank you very much. I just I just wanted to say that we want to be respectful of people that live in the building. We want to provide a service to the residents, the other residents that live in the community. I think that all of our locations are consistent in that we maintain the exterior of our facilities consistently throughout our locations in Manhattan and then with regards to the beer and wine. Somehow a slippery slope be considered that at that point we do not have a lot of people that are coming in and having a glass of wine with their breakfast, and we mainly serve breakfast at lunch or at lunchtime in 25 years, we've never expanded our alcohol menu at any of our locations. Besides select belgium, beer and wine. So it's never been an issue at any of our locations in Manhattan, and this is the only one that we seem to be. You know running into an issue with and again we're just asking for some flexibility during these times. It's just it's a small Avid revenue Avenue for us, and it's just one that we just wanted to add on to help us navigate through these difficult times. Thanks Mario. Okay, with that we're close discussion on 1d as we're moving it over to September. So now the next item we're going to discuss is 1f. So do we have a representative or the applicant for 85 wine corporation? If you would not mind raising your hand to the participant menu? I have jacques and cynthia as the possible speakers, but I do not see either name appearing for anybody who does not know how to raise your hand, you go to the participant menu at the bottom of your screen or use the star nine. Do you see somebody I see is waving their hand? Ah, okay, you may have to push a button to confirm on muting there you go. You hear me yes, okay, you're, for 85 wine corporation. Yes, sir, how are you hi good? How are you good? Thank you so tell us your name and just a little bit about the application and we'll go from there. My name is Jacques Owari. I am the guy that started. Jack's brasserie next to the 85 wine Corp Okay Jack's Prasari, is in the business for the last 24 years. I'm still involved with you know the back of the operations and it's the same people. You know that would be dealing with the the corner store. It was an opportunity with the same landlord. Honestly I've been doing this for so many years for about 24 years. The last thing I want to do is open up another restaurant because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the SLA law, the community, and so I'm fortunate that sometimes and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say, but for the last 24 years we are very happy and proud to serve the community and, like I just said, the last thing I want to do is open up another restaurant and the only reason why I'm doing this is because I'm helping out is because it's just next door to the restaurant. It's the same landlord. You know I've dealt with so many landlords in my life, they're not easy to work with. Now we have the pandemic and getting everything to work together. It's just like being in it's like being in. I do not know it's not easy, but I'm willing to check the challenge just because it's next to the restaurant, so the diner went under the fire and we're looking to do something a little bit very simple, very focused on good establishment serving the neighborhood with the focus on you know. So this is like a day. It's going to be like more of a steps at a time- hopefully maybe dinner, depending when this is going to open up, because they're still doing the whole innovation under the building because of the fire and not they're, still doing the work, and maybe, if anything, would be sometimes in mid October end of October, beginning of November. Knowing what would be the you know the words coming out of the the syrian state right. If it's going to be a 50, then we'll have to decide on how we can operate, but hopefully, in the long run we would be open for breakfast lunch and dinner even later for dinner, with a big focus on more of an american diner, but Jacques style. You know with the touch of maybe on italian, so that we do not stay in competition with the Jacques customers and you know maybe, hopefully down the down the road, maybe three, four five: six months from now open for breakfast lunch and dinner even later something more of a Jg Melon pj clarks Uber, with the focus on the community and obeying and respecting the esla rules and our neighborhood comes first, our community comes first and that's what we do. You know we will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full like a license and that's the great yeah. Thank you very much. Yes, sir. Okay. So first I'll ask if there's any public hands on this item and if seeing none, then I will go to Barbara. You just have to go there. I did not position my mouse, I'm sorry! I just want to say that Jacques is a charming, lovely, well- run restaurant. I am so happy to hear this because I was worried that, after the fire of the restaurant, the diner that was there before and there's an empty store next to it, that it was going to be a raised building and we would have another monstrosity there and the idea that it would be, but I assume I I'm sure will be a well- run addition to the community. I am thrilled to hear that's what's going to happen, and I wish you would put another restaurant next door where the toy store was so that won't remain an ugly empty spot. The way it is now. Thank you Barbara and yours means a lot to us and without the community we can not survive, but I thank you so much for your kind words, Mrs Brown. I was unable to hear all of your presentation because of the fire trucks in the back. Given that, could you please share with me the eyes of your establishment, Mrs Brown? I really can not hear you. I'm sorry. Is this better? Is this better? That is better! Thank you. I apologize for that. As I was stating, I was unable to hear your presentation, given that. Would you please tell me the hours of your operation and did you say it was just specifically a diner there's? No, is there any outside area? Well, you know right, I'm sorry. I do not understand outside area, but I'm eating outside eating. It is an enclosed cafe. So we've not available. You know this. The whole thing is, you know: a restaurant business is so much of a gamble ahead of time. You have all these people that you have to employ, and yet you have to buy and go with the rules, so we only can go a step at a time if there is a need for it and if you do it, if we do put a sidewalk cafe on, I do not know I'm not even thinking that far all right. Thank you. We have not. We have an enclosed, cafe, we're happy with it right now, but I do not know what six months from now a year from now. You know we will. I do not really know. I have no idea, but I think for now we're good here, but I from what I understand in June of next year. They will allow you to have something on the street if the city, if I can do it the right way, I might thank you and what are the hours of operation the proposed hours of operation? Please. So for now it's going to be more like I said it's going to be a step at a time we're going to just do the dinner, and then hopefully you know if the city does not allow us to open. You know, because now we're going to the fall by the time we're open, we will open up it's going to be like maybe November, so if we're not able to open inside so it's just like, maybe down by 10:30, maybe deliveries, maybe we're not even going to open up, because it's not worth it me paying the rent and my staff when this is a new location. No one will know about it. Why would I bring myself a headache of opening up a place when I do not when I know I'm not going nowhere, but if the city is opening up a little bit at 50 capacity, we're going to go step by step eventually going forward later on when things become normal, we'll be open for all for breakfast lunch dinner even later so is it? Is it fair to say that you will be open until 11 pm in the evening? Is that what you might open up later? It's on the application? Oh, could you hear an estimate? Please lorraine, just though so the application again well there'll be a transition period and given that what's going on with code, but the application itself is proposes 11 to 4 A.M daily right. Thank you right, yeah. I have a problem with listen at the end of the at the end of the day, we're serving the community. If something goes wrong, are we the first one to pull out the hours and if I can not manage properly, I do not need to give myself a headache if I can not assure that I'm doing the right thing right. Okay, then next is marco. I would like to propose a motion and then to speak. The motion is to approve. Is anybody? Second? Oh, second, okay, so the issue right here is next and that is correlated with the other application. I do not want to speak with the other applications gone, but the bottom line is we lost a lot of jobs. You know in the country, in the cities and now we need to reactivate the economy and as long as is within the law, which is for me, the only law that exists right. There is the sonic resolution. If it fits we have. I strongly support this kind of business and unless, if those businesses behave or management very poor, so then I will go against them. Otherwise, I think we have to support business at this time and if he behaves wrong, we still have a chance to call him and to go and to ask them, and maybe we have to renegotiate their time. But, according with the president of revelations, I think, if I know one, all the places have to be closed, and so I do not think that he's going to be open at the four o'clock at least within six months, but whatever it is. I think we have to support those business. We need to bring back our economy and I think this is the right to do it. Thank you. Thank you. Marco okay, Barry call the question on the application to approve great and if you, it was anyone's opposed to calling the question raise your hand. Otherwise we'll go to our virtual role, seeing none. Then the current motion is to approve. So if anyone is voting, no abstaining or not voting for cause, please jump up and down with your hand, and I do want to point out that Elita had to leave so do not count her on this one. Thank you. Okay. Last call okay, see none, then that's a unanimous approval and okay moving along. I want to thank the committee. Thank you so much. Thank you and good luck. Thank you. So much. Thank you. Okay, do we have a representative for 1 G, bilal yeah and then my name is Jin Soo John and then I'm attorney for the Bilal Inc and then actually this is a filipino restaurant and then actually the shareholders is actually a nurse in the mountain sinai. She could not attend this meeting today because she's on duty and she's a filipino and she won two- the businesses these places, because her husband just has a drop shot just next to the building as speaking span and then so the husband, the business, is next to this building, so she will hire managers and then the manager will, you know, manage these places. I do not think any restrictions and then there is, you know this restaurant were in its diversity and then the chances for the near neighbors to taste filipinos cuisines. So I do not think you know there will be any problems for this corporate for this restaurant to apply. For the liquid equalizers they will sell just a pure and wine. Thank you very much. Okay. So before I go to the the hands, I'm just going to I'm going to do this going forward and apologies just looking at the applications. So the hours eight am until nine Pm Monday through Thursday 8 A.M to 10 P.M, Friday, Saturday, 8, A.M, 9:00 A.M to 8 P.M sundays, and it is an 80:20 food to drink ratio. With that right, I will go to Judy on the agenda. I printed out. I do not see this establishment. What is the name and location of the establishment? Maybe we could say that before each of the presenters sure? Oh yes, this is item one juice I'll, do it 1 G below Inc, 1437, First Avenue, and it is between 74th and 75th. Okay, thank you! No problem, okay, any other public members seeing none! Then I will go to my esteemed colleague, marco. I would like to propose a motion. The motion is to approve as present. Thank you. I would suck in that motion. Okay, see anyone opposed or abstaining. I'm sorry. Anyone opposed to no try again seconded. Does anyone want to call the question? Okay, all in favor any opposed to calling the question? None? Okay, now we're going to go for our votes. So if you're voting, no abstaining or not voting for cause on this motion to approve, let us know otherwise that will go as a unanimous approval. Okay, wonderful! Thank you, jinsu! Thank you. Moving on to section two, these are renewal. Applications for sidewalk cafe the first one is for Zucchero and Pomodoro renewal, unenclosed, six tables, twelve chairs. Fourteen thirty five second avenue between 74 and 75th. Do we have the representative? Yes, thank you, everybody. How are you hi? Sorry I'll, just drop that? Okay, sorry, I'm fine hi! My name is Sam and from Zukiro Ikomodori we've been there since 1991 been a long time yeah we just applied in March for the renewal, but then the cop it happened, and I was in hospital too. I was you know. I had coffee and I was hospitalized and after I came yeah she I had to close down the restaurant, so I could not go on with the general process and paper box as well, actually working from home most of the time I'm having like really going there well, I hope you're feeling better and recovered, and this is so. This is just a straight renewal. No changes yeah. Just there, no changes, nothing! Okay! Great! Do I have any public hands. If not, then I will invite oh, no okay, no public hands and then I will invite Marcos the first hand. I see I would like to propose a motion. The motion is to approve. I hope, sir, that you are recuperative fine and I think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community. Thank you do not change anything. I wish the best and I think we this is the community that we need these services. You serve our community, and that is what we are looking for. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Marco, great I'll, go to rebecca all second great and Sunday. I'm glad to see that you're doing better. If there are no objections, I would like to call to question none here. Miss Brown did you have a question or comment? Yes, I did. I wanted to wish him well. Thank you. Thank you Ma'am! Thank you, okay, so we have the question called all in favor, any opposed to calling a question seeing none. Okay, now for the vote motion to approve if anyone's voting, no abstaining or not voting for cause indicates so otherwise. This will also go as unanimous approval with our well wishes and good luck going forward. Thank you great. Thank you very much. Moving along to item 2b still in the sidewall cafe renewals. This is for persepholus 1407. Second Avenue between 73rd and 74th. Do I have the applicant. They had not been responsive to us so far, so I'm not. I do not think it's likely that they're here, okay, well I'll, wait to the end, but again, given the time we're in while just likely to lay it over unless there's any strenuous objections. Okay, so next item is three a this is a change. Do we have the representative for the candle cafe 17 1307 Third Avenue corporate change robert? You may have yes good evening nice to see everyone. So this is the campus cafe on third Avenue between 74th and 76th. Basically, the corporate change. The original two partners, joy and Bart- have decided they would love to enjoy retirement, so they are leaving the establishment. The two partners that have been in place with them over the years are going to stay, so there basically will be no changes to the establishment. It's going to be run the same menu the same hours, it's just those two are stepping away and the other two are going to run the whole operation. Thank you. I would like to propose a motion and if somebody want a second thank you, I'm assuming the motion was to approve so Barbara. Would you like a second barbara? I do have a question. What happened to 79th street? Are you opening there also or we miss you Robert? I muted you because you had some sound on in the background. If you could mute that or turn that off it's a distraction, but whenever you're ready to answer her question, I'm sorry it's gone. We do not know yet about 79th Street. I doubt it though oh okay, but I do second okay. I call the question at the same time. I just want to quickly. George has your hand up yeah he's he's one of the Parkinson's okay hi guys, my name is Jorge can do 79. I was going to reopen in April, but because the cover 19, I was not able to reopen it yeah and I wanted to stay open. So that's why we want to. We want to renew the license, but Kendo 79. It might come back next year, I'm working on it great, thank you, jorge and and Barbara. Yes, you can call the question. Do I have anyone objecting to calling the question on the approval? Okay, if not, then we're going to take the role. This is a motion to approve 3a if anyone's a voting, no abstaining or not voting for cause. Let us know. I also note elita is back so I will include you in this role. Oh alito, there you go include me. Whoops do not include me because I just came back just at the very end, and I want to give me a blanket approval because I support businesses, which there no is no issue, but I really did not hear enough so do what you will. Thank you. This was a corporate change for candle cafe just a swapping of the partners, so nothing complex here. So I will do a list. Yeah. Okay, great! Thank you so much all right. Then we will move along to our. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, George. Thank you. Now, moving on to item 3a, another corporate change, this is spice Corner, 1479, First Avenue between 77 and 78. Do I have the representative? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, Iris hi, I'm ernest I'm the attorney for the corporation, and I also have the corporation President Mr Kibi with us. It's the similar one to the corporation. Originally we have two shareholders of this corporation and now they are separating their investment, so the other shareholder, Mr Lenny, is going to be out of this corporation. That's why we're applying for this corporate change? Okay and not yeah, nothing would change to the restaurant to this establishment. Okay, great marco, thank you so much. You know what I would like that you call somebody else, because you have been called me over. Thank you and I I think it's better to call somebody else, but if you want to give me a chance at the end, you might have a chance. Fine. Thank you. Okay, Rebecca motion to approve okay, great Mrs Brown. I support this business wholeheartedly and I want to second the motion. Please wonderful, marco! If you raise your hand I'll, let you call the question marco call the question. Thank you, okay, so all in favor anyone opposed to calling the question seeing none then we'll go forward as a approval. Anyone voting no abstaining or not voting for cause. Let us know otherwise that's a unanimous approval. Thank you. Everyone! Thank you and good luck. Thank you. Okay. So last item is, I mean again just do a quick check if we had someone for persepholus, if not again, given the current environment, we'll I'll roll it over into September. Okay, those are all the items. Let me check the chat, real, quick, nothing, new, no okay, and if there's no other business then do I have any motion to Adjourn. I did have somebody who had earlier said they wanted to raise an item of new business if they're still here there we go. I think that this is the person hello there you take it hi good evening. My name is Carl Landsteiner and I'm an architect, and I live in the Upper East side, for I would say about the past year or two: the publicly owned private space, that's above tony Dinopoly at the corner of 64th and second, has been closed due to construction. Earlier this year they took down the scaffolding and the publicly owned private or privately owned. Public space was not opened back up and subsequently Covid-19 hit and everything shut down. Now it has reopened, except there's a restaurant, tony Dinopoly, which is exclusively using that plaza for for restaurant use, and so it's no longer open to the public, which I understand is not really the intended use of these spaces. I understand and I'm sensitive to the fact that businesses are struggling and it's been hard on everybody, but I also am of the mindset that these are public spaces and they are fully intended for public use. So I do not think that it's appropriate to be commandeering these public spaces, that not every restaurant, has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses, and I've raised this issue with 3- 1- 1. I've tried to raise this issue with the Community board and it does not seem to be gaining any traction, so I just like to formally raise this issue and see if there's anything that can be done about this now. Thank you for raising that. We'll definitely make a note and we'll I do not know if it's specific to this committee, but well, we can work together and see where what course we can take and we can get Carl's information and kind of see how to best move this along Carl I'll. Send you my direct email address so that we can follow up in the chat. If that's okay with you, I yes I'll, see you there is that. Okay, yeah, that sounds great one. Other thing I will mention is that the only access to the public space at this point is through the restaurant they've sealed off. I've never seen the gate opened along 64th street. So it's totally private at this point but yeah. If you, if you know, there's somebody else, I should talk to no that's helpful. Thank you for flagging that yeah and we can talk to the department of Transportation who's in charge of the program. That's doing the open restaurants, okay, great okay! I see a few hands I'll go in reverse order. Rebecca! Sorry! I was just going to make a motion to adjourn and wish all the businesses luck during this time. But if other people want to speak, they should I'll withdraw my motion. Oh you can hold it. Let's go to Barbara. I am blank with the name, but that rest of the famous hamburger place. That's on 86 between third and Lexus was a very big deal and they do use the outdoor space in the in the pops in the publicly privately owned public space. But the public is allowed to go there. Anybody can go and sit at the table and it has access. So it seems that there's a precedent from what this gentleman is saying that it should be, it can be used. It possibly can be used by the restaurant, but certainly should remain open for the public. Also shake shack check. Oh my gosh! Thank you. I was going nuts marco, oh thank you. I I'm going to say it you're, absolutely right. The colleague that he mentioned about the pups he's right and I did a study of the pups in the in our community, and I brought something about that and I think this topic respectfully. It should be addressed in the zoning and Development Committee and I think I'm going to try to talk to with with the two co- chairs, because this is unacceptable. What you described, because the developer took millions of dollars to develop large buildings and the in the best real estate market, which is in the top of the building. So basically the developer was well paid, and that is fine. There's nothing wrong and I support that. But the only situation is they have to provide the space for the community. That is the bottom line, and why was created? That is because our community work with lack of public spaces. We have a larger deficit in Parks public spaces, so this is where we have to deal this topic. Definitely in zoning and development. I strongly advise, sir, that you come to the. I think it is scheduled now zoning for next month on September and zoning, our development. We will address your issue deeply, because this is a very limited what we can do in this committee, and I think it's more as a the issue of zoning and thank you so much for coming and bring out the attention of this issue. Thank you, September 24th. This is that date, all right. Thank you very much. Elita leader, you have to confirm. Sorry. Thank you. If there were issues like this to communicate with the Community board, I do not know how you did it Carl, but emails to info Cb8M.Com will get attention. I do not know. I think you might have tweeted. That does not get nearly as much attention and you raise an important issue, one that is resonating throughout the borough and particularly as Marco pointed out in our community. So thank you thanks Abraham, thank you and you have my direct email in the chat. I hope yep great okay great. So I know there was a motion and a second to adjourn all in favor any opposed. Okay. Well with that, with that, I will say thank you to everyone. Thank you to the applicants, have a wonderful rest of August and stay safe and healthy, and we will see you next month, if not sooner, everyone.",
            "summary": "Next, full board meeting is September 16th, so all of those will go to that meeting unless there's any time sensitive applications that need to be sent out before then, in which case those will go as committee resolutions, and with that there's no questions for comments.\nIf, there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on If you could use the participants, menu, I do not want to see people raising their hands like this and miss you.\nThe owner and the applicant were well aware of that restriction for the yet additional reason that several years ago, they came to the board of managers requesting a change that would permit them to sell alcoholic beverages from the retail unit.\nWe were a little surprised and taken aback that this application would have been made to the community board when the tenant and the owner of the retail unit know full well that.\nThere are a couple people from the public who want to speak on these, who do not know how to raise their hand.\nSo, John, First and Alex to close out any public just a time as to how long has the existing or the pre- existing restaurant been there, and for how long has it been in possession of a license to serve alcohol?\nYou may hi, so I live in the neighborhood near the 1133 Madison Location And I just wanted to speak up in favor of their application.\nThat is a legal issue between these two, but our role is just only since there is nothing that tell me that this restaurant behave wrong in the community or does not fit in the in the commercial district.\nFirst of all, I'd like to request that all the applicants date, whether or not the location has outdoor area and the hours of the establishment?\nThat was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, Le Pen Cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district, and I would love to see them continue in business, with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the board of managers to amend their rules regarding legalizing.\nSo I'm in support of the applications all together taken as one thank I, would have to respectfully disagree with Marco and Barry and Lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no We're not being neutral in the discussion between the building and the proposed and the tenant.\nI. Think if we approve stipulation to the SLA that there is a legal, binding agreement between the landlord and the establishment and let them have it out: okay, thanks guys, Russell and then Judy So, I, I.\nThat's sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements and that kind of thing- And, you know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation.\nNo great I would like to make a motion that we approve the application, with the stipulation that there is a binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant and that the SLA strictly look at it.\nI do not have any issue with them, making a request to us, but we we would hope, sincerely hope that the that the board would respect the wishes of the unit owners who bought in this building with the clear, concise and undisputed understanding that what the what the applicant wants to do can not be done in the building, and I think.\nHe know the reason why the Condo Board has prohibited alcohol in the restaurant?\nI think that the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol served that there was going to be very restrictive types of retail, use, and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate.\nIt goes from you, know, just from cider to wine, to beer, to six seven to eight to nine, to ten, and I think that everybody knew the Le Pen Catinia knew the unit owners knew what could be done in these premises.\nNotwithstanding that the applicant understands that they have no right to serve alcohol from that premises.\nI do not really understand why the applicant would come if there's a contract that prohibits it from serving alcohol and say I'd like a license.\nJust do not think it is right to say a contract is irrelevant and the applicant could come knowing it signed an agreement knowing it bought the prop the the license or the name or the restaurant.\nAnother restaurant because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the SLA law, the community, and That, sometimes, and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say.\nWe will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full, like a license.\nThe whole thing: is, you know, a restaurant business is so much of a gamble ahead of time.\nOh, second, okay, so the issue right here is next and that is correlated with the other application.\nIf I know one, all the places have to be closed, and so I do not think that he's going to be open at the four o'clock, at least within six months, but whatever it is.\nSo I do not think you know there will be any problems for this corporate for this restaurant to apply.\nAnd I, think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community.\nDo not include me because I just came back just at the very end, and I want to give me a blanket approval because I support businesses, which there no is no issue, but I really did not hear enough.\nI did have somebody who had earlier said they wanted to raise an item of new business if they're still here, And I'm, an architect, and I live in the Upper East side, for I would say about the past year or two: The publicly owned private space, that's above tony Dinopoly at the corner of 64th and second, has been closed due to construction.\nThese public spaces, that not every restaurant, has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses, and I've raised this issue with 3- 1- 1.\nAt this point, That's doing the open, restaurants, If other people want to speak, they should I'll withdraw my motion."
