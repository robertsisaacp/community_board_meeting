        "fullTranscript": "But if you're not taking or wish to speak, please stay muted. For you know when you are sitting and just listening in all righty. Okay, let's we'll start off! Thank you for joining karen johnson. Is our secretary and I'll ask all presenters to spell their names out for her, so she can make sure that you know she spell gets it properly. Irene jenner is our coacher and I am carlton gordon. I think everybody is seeing the agenda so I'll. Ask people for. I guess a couple of people to unmute and just volunteer to approve the agenda right here. John do and just have a second okay, that's elizabeth, all right, very good! All right! Is there any objection to the agenda as laid out? Okay done we'll say it's agreed to. Thank you all right. So now, we'll just we'll hop right into the applications. The first one is two one washington avenue which is in the clinton hill, historic district and the application is to construct a rooftop terrace with planters thing and and a hot tub and inside screening around the existing condensers. So whoever is from 241 washington avenue, please unmute and speak up and tell us what you have anybody for 241 washington avenue. I guess he's bringing up his screen jarrett. You will also need to unmute. Okay, can you hear me well? Yes, I can hear you. Thank you sorry about it. I was having issues. Thank you for accommodating us on such a weird times. We actually started this up this process over a year and a half ago. Thinking about it, but okay before hello, yes, just make sure we get your name down, j-r-e-k tresco w-s-k-o. Are you affiliated with anybody or just it's just your own? It's my own company, architect galaxy. So I started working with this client over 10 years ago. We actually, can you hear me now yeah. We have a little freeze now, but I can hear you so we started working with this client over ten years ago. We renovated interiors. We changed windows, we did facade historic restoration of the facade. All this was approved with landmark, derek excuse me, I'm sorry, we hear you fine, but we still you're still not sharing your screen. Okay share contest. Okay, beauty, okay, I see it, we see it. Thank you go ahead, so we renovated the entire four stories. A few years ago facade we actually did historic sidewalk. All this was smoothly approved with landmark and now the client wanted to get tariffs approved. We didn't have, they didn't have enough money to do it all at once. So it's we coming back a few years later to do that, and we would like I mean we, the client and I live in a neighborhood, we're very active with the neighbors, and we want to make sure that neighbors are happy. We notify all the neighbors, we spoke with them and we want to make sure that this is not too obtrusive to view and also we want to make sure that neighbors are happy, so the terrorists that we're proposing is offset from the front facade. So therefore, it's nothing is visible from washington, avenue and and the corner of willoughby and washington. The terrace will be visible from the hall street, which is, if you go to the map hall street is just the border of the neighborhood and it has a carrick carriage houses on an on a historic site and pratt institute is on the other side. So the terrace is not visible from the carriage houses side of this historic street because the carriage is a two-story height. But if you cross this whole street, you will see the back of the terrace from the other side, which is theoretically not a historic site I'll. I guess I'll go to the maybe I'll flip it to these sections. Just to show you this situation here we go so you could see view from washington avenue person standing. You could not see the anything with due to the terrorists there, but from the back, because the carriages are shorter, you could see the back and you could. You will be able to see that on the photographs we have taken. So this is the this is the existing facade. The ac unit is actually on the roof because it was approved in 2008 when we renovated the interior. So the damage and the ac unit is already there, but we are moving it sideway, we're not moving it forward, we're moving a sideway to clear some space for the paris, so it's visibility of the ac unit is not being exposed in any more than a actually it's not visible right now from the street. So that's a proposed facade front to the left with a little bit. Everything is set back from the front, so in the section you will see that anything that you see on the roof is actually not visible from the street, because it's set back number of feet from the front and the back facade on the right, and we are also showing the material on the right that we would like to we're proposing to use it's a pretty much a historic color, wood, composite wood for the railing and above it you could see a it's a chicken wire, it's actually a vegetable garden shot and the client is right. Now they have a garden out there and they actually have also bees and the squirrels are not too friendly to the tomatoes. So they would like to have a chicken wire there, so those are large sections with the views and down below you will see a larger section. A red line is a line of view from across the street, so the planter is moved back, four foot, five from the line of the facade, but the cornice actually sticks out prior. So the planter is a is it's six foot eleven from the front of the cornice, which is not visible? The fencing privacy is fencing to the left and the right neighbors stepping back, because we don't want to see it from the strip since you've done a lot of work on the roof. I was wondering or doing a lot of things up there. Do you have to reinforce the roof? You have to reinforce it from the top floor, or is it will it support everything? Yes, so the entire terrace, the proposed terrace, is on a new darnage. Two of the dangers are already dead that are holding the ac unit and we go. They were engineered for the future, so we could rest the central part of the dac on those two, but we are bringing one two three four more structure members spanning across and then we backing above that. So all the taras is basically supported on a on a structure of party walls, brick walls and roof is intact. Underneath all right, then, the next page, you will see the sections cut in opposite direction. It's we're looking toward willoughby avenue and again there's a view. A red line is a view of a person and you will see toward the back. That's a jacuzzi with the planters above and expansion of the chimneys, we're extending flutes of the chimneys three feet above the line of the jacuzzi. The section below is the section through the planter and those two sections are vertical: horizontal sections through the jacuzzi since you're, adding a jacuzzi, do you have to do additional plumbing to get the water up there? Yes, there will be adobe right now. There is a line that basically just for the gardening, but will there will be a drain to the domestic water line and supply lines, and all this will be disconnectable for the winter. So there will be internal shadows and drains so they could drain it for the winter season and you could see right. We actually those photographs are taken with a mock-up on top. So you could see this first photograph on the laughter's view from washington, willoughby intersection. We could not see a markup. There. Second view is showing and you could start. I guess I could try to zoom forward. So you could see better. You could start seeing a mock-up of defense, privacy, friends left and right. So that's why we decided to drop it, so it will be not visible. That's why the private defense then will be stepping down toward the back. It would start at three feet and we'll go toward the back from here. You cannot see it and from here again, actually we are. We are down here behind the trees. We cannot see it again. Visibility starts here again intersection. You can see it. That's all willowby avenue. This is washington avenue. This is the back from hall street. That's the series of garages that are on the back, so this the area that the side sidewalk I'm standing on is actually on the outside of the historic district. The side of the carriage garages aren't historic, but this side of the street is belongs to pratt already, so we are outside historic district. Of course, one could argue whether the whole street is in historic, district or just part of it, we'll assume it's historic and sure. Let landmarks decide afterwards. Yes, well, the part of the landmark. I had these discussions with them and they basically said I just send it to the community board and hear the community board's opinion on that. So this this is shots from the roof that is existing ac photo number two is from the front so that ac will stay in place, but it will move to the right to the right. You see a little bit red mock-up, so it's not moving forward. It's just moving to the right and on the back you see those we use the eight foot dots to mark to do the markup on the back facade, but the five feet is what the privacy fence is. So the red tape is what you would see it on the other photographs that I will present later. So I'm just telling you that eight foot should be ignored. It was just used for the constructing of the wall and we were moving the tape back and forth, see up and down and deciding at what height the client would be happy with privacy. The reason why it has to be that high, because the roof steps down so the we would have to have series of stairs. If we would bring down the it's try, it's almost impossible. We need to be with the jacuzzi of both the structure of the roof. So that's the minimum. We have to be at five feet on the back, and this is the markup for the stepping down of the fans. The first section will be at three and a half feet above the deck, and then it goes back to goes up to five feet and that's looking toward. First one is looking toward willowby. The second photo is looking towards the cob, and you would this photo. You see area without markup, and this is a on the right I'll zoom in for you to see better. So that's a eight feet to the top of the railing, but the orange tape is a five foot benchmark of our privacy fence. I think next photos will be a street shot, so this is, we will from william b avenue. We have a very narrow area where there is a little bit of visibility, because there are gardens and there's no building here. If you could see on view 11. and we actually zoomed in on the close-up number three and you could see the part of the red tape that we outlined. That's how much the fan the privacy fence would be visible from there and I'm gonna go back a little bit. So that's the view from the two-story extension from the the visibility above the two-story extension on a building on willoughby avenue to the left. There is a gate and that will be visibility above the gate is I'm bringing these shots right now so actually view number 12 is a is a without a zoom? That's that's the hour visibility, but if we bring it closer, we will see quite a lot from that area. So that's a red mark here, and this is a little rendering of what this could look like- that. The insect screen, of course, will be see-through, so you would not see it, but for purpose of this presentation, I shaded it gray. So because of this visibility, we want to make sure that we're using a historic material to blend in with passat surrounding historic materials, and I think this concludes the presentation I have for you if you have any questions. Okay, thank you, mr trust. Any comments or questions from committee members board. Members yourself. If you wish to, I have a question in regards to the sloping towards the rear of the deck. I just want to make sure that five foot fencing that you've shown in your rendering accounts for the slope of the roof, so the hot tub will be sitting, presumably could be sitting you know, 18 inches or so above the current roof. So what is the height of your privacy, fencing from what you propose to be the finish for the around on the back yeah on the back? That's the five foot. You could see it. You could see right here if you could see still my screen, so the chimneys are three feet above the top of the deck so down below it's we're, exaggerating it's gonna be actually a little bit less. It's like 410, but I just rounded it up to five foot right. I understand that the the privacy fencing actually doesn't give privacy for anyone who might be in the jacuzzi. Is that correct? Yes, it's just we're obscuring whatever structural planter and structure of the attacking yeah, there's no privacy for a person sitting in the jakkus. Okay- and I have one other question- I wanted to go higher, but it was too visible and landmark was not happy with it, so we decided fine. The planters are, you know good enough for privacy? Okay, I'm just saying on this view for a second, I believe the code requires that the chimneys be raised three feet within a 10 foot radius of the chimney itself. So I'm just wondering: if can you confirm that the chimney height is accurate or its adjacency to the higher part of the roof deck? So it they have to be three feet of both solid roof within the perimeter or anything that is fire rating, but we just the composite docking material. We're using. Is it's a cement board material? So it's not fire rated! Okay! Thank you doctor. I have a question. Yes go ahead. Did the neighbors think that this project was okay with them? I know you talked to them. What was their response? Well, yes, we didn't have any negative, but our neighbors are really loved in the area, so they've been there around for a long time and every we the whole neighborhood. You know the street knows everybody there, so maybe they're afraid to say no they're joking. I guess you'll invite them to the jacuzzi, not me, but the client, maybe okay, so you were able to contact when you say the neighbors. Is it the adjacent neighbors? So I recommended that they supply letters to four neighbors left and right that actually yeah, because we all that that's a fourth house from the corner, so they all they were able to do three to the left and four to toward the cup ten across the street and also the carriage houses on the back and willoughby avenue neighbors. So I know that I'm actually, I know there will be first house on willoughby avenue. I know people it's betsy, lewis illustrators and they just told me that they're fine with it, they received the information. So I don't know if you guys know them but dalton. I live down the block from there. I'll now have a reason to look at that particular house. Well, actually the mock-ups are there. So please do. Can I make a motion that we approve this application? Mr gordon so move. Do we have a second okay that was adultery or okay? We have a motion and it's been so and seconded any other questions or comments on the motion. I did have one brief question about the planters: how heavy are they and are they immune to the increased wind that we're getting these days? So all the all the planters are permanently well, they are, they could be removable, but we have them enhanced with. You can basically remove the planter from the plantar construction but per because of the well because of the I coach we could not have a free standing planters up. There would be easier to get it approved through landmark because they don't have. We don't have to have a permit or removable planters, but it's not safe. So all the planters are within the permanent construction to make it safe, so nothing would blow it will be blown out the roof. Okay, it's an effect. It becomes part of the building, correct, okay, any comments or questions. Are you able to do the role or would you prefer rob to do it? Karen would just shake your head. If you would like me to do the roll call, would you mind that would be great not at all? Okay, so on the motion to recommend approval? Mr gordon, how do you vote miss janner I'll? Come back, miss ali I'll come back! Mr ghost, did you hear me? I said yes, I did not hear you, but now we do. Thank you. Thank you, mr augustus. Generous, yes, janner is yes, mr augustus, yes good to hear from you, sir, ms blanc. Yes, ms carstarfin, yes, mr howald, yes did mr sproul join us. I don't see him mr doom, yes, mr flanoy, I'm gonna abstain. Did mr scallow join us, ms ginsburg yep and miss johnson? Yes, mr gordon, the motion passes by a vote of 10 in favor and unopposed one abstention. Thank you all right, okay, mr gordon, your mic is cutting up quite a bit and hear me now: okay, I'll repeat it. Four or five vanderbilt avenue, cleveland hills or application is to construct a one story, rooftop edition or five vanderbilt, please I guess step up for step. Four. This is philip von dalvik from fondalic architecture representing 4-5 vendor build with rick azar, who, I think, will start it off bricky or muted, you're, still muted how's. This I can hear you, okay, the presentation so assume that I can. I can share yes, please. Yes, please bring him. Thank you, mr chair members of community board, two land use committee good evening: rick azar r-I-c-k-a-z-a-r for 405 vanderbilt avenue a two-story romanesque revival, brick carriage house, located within the boundaries of the clinton hill, historic district page two please proposed for 405 vanderbilt avenue is a one-story rooftop edition with us this evening are architects, phillip and kit von dalwick, and they will present their design for the rooftop edition in a moment, but first some brief remarks regarding the building and street history. Page 3, please this image is the 1980 new york city tax photo for 405 vanderbilt avenue and shows the building very much as it appears today. There are no 1940 texts, hello! Okay, there are. There are no 1940 tax photos for the carriage house. Okay, there are no 1940 tax photos for the carriage house, as it was considered an outbuilding serving the mansion at 404 clinton avenue and the practice at the time was to photograph only the main residents page four, please. We were able to locate a 1941 image showing the east side of vanderbilt avenue between green avenue at the far left and further behind this view on the right gates avenue. The second peak at the left is 94 green avenue, also known as 401 vanderbilt avenue. This italian revival building was completed in 1862 and altered in 1928 to accommodate commercial use at the sidewalk level to its right is 405 vanderbilt avenue, which is the larger subject of our discussion this evening and immediately to the right 407 vanderbilt avenue an empty lot until the year. Continuing to the right is 409 vanderbilt avenue the carriage house and coachman residence for the mansion at 410 clinton avenue, designed by the celebrated parfit brothers, the queen eye, queen anne style, mansion and carriage house, were completed in 1882, and the final carriage house on this block was in fact built as a car garage completed in 1919. This colonial revival building serviced the mansion at 416 clinton, avenue page five, please here we have a contemporary partial view of the east side of vanderbilt avenue, 401 vanderbilt at the corner, left 405 vanderbilt behind a tree but clearly identifiable by its distinctive parapet. You'll recall the empty lot at 407 vanderbilt. Now it is a new building completed in 2002., page 6, please, while the exact date of construction is unknown, we do know that 405 vanderbilt was in place by the year 1890. by 1898. The mansion this carriage house served at 404 clinton avenue was demolished, replaced by a two-family beaux arts building completed in 1901 that survives to this day by 1925, a separate certificate of occupancy have been issued specifically for 405 vanderbilt avenue, identifying it as a garage for four cars and by the early 60s. The carriage house is shown as a multiple dwelling. Throughout all that time, the carriage house has remained largely untouched. The 1981 landmarks designation report notes the original central double doors, hung on original ornate iron hinges and romanesque revival. Details such as the flat and segmented masonry, bosois arches, with limestone keystones at the windows and center doors also noted, is the corbelled cornice below a distinctive parapet, pierced by ziggurat openings. In closing, I'd like to share some contemporary streets survey photos page 8, please. Both of these photographs are taken along vanderbilt avenue at the left, from the corner of green avenue in vanderbilt and on the right, a view of 405 vanderbilt avenue farther down the block page nine, please. The photograph on the left is taken at the southeast corner of vanderbilt and green avenues and the building at the left in this photograph is 94 green avenue, also known as 401 vanderbilt, and at the sidewalk grade you can see the commercial openings done in the 1928 alteration. The photo on the right is, of course, 405 vanderbilt avenue, page 10, please, on the left. We have another photograph of 405 vanderbilt avenue taken from across the street and at the right we have a credible recreation of the 1941 archive photo presented earlier at the end of the block, 401 vanderbilt avenue, then to the right, 405, vanderbilt avenue, the new building at 407, vanderbilt, 409, vanderbilt avenue and then at the right, 413, vanderbilt avenue, and at this time, I'd like to turn things over to phillips. Thank you. I unmuted, I believe so right here, right, perfect, yeah, good evening everyone. So my name is philip van dalvik from fond dalvik architecture office. We are basically working and representing our client from 405 vanderbilt. We started this project probably over a year ago with having conversations with our clients, who is looking forward to a single story, addition to the described character from rick in great detail. The addition went through the zoning review at the DOB, which is at this point, concluded and approved, and initial conversations with two presentations towards lpc, where we actually just had today again a conversation with them to go forward with to cb2. So I'm looking forward to present on this project, to you guys the proposed edition- and I will guide you through it here- is the existing rooftop, which is basically a regular membrane. What we are suggesting is a additional bedroom with additional master bathroom a front and back terrace and a reading area. It's basically the extension of the existing house, where a single mom with two kids and in-laws living and they're craving more space, and that we need that space. What we suggesting here, you see the rooftop with the by code, solar panels, and I will go towards a section where we see or that rendering here from existing to new. I will tell you a little bit the story why things shaped out the way they are. The shape of the edition takes its cues from roof profiles of neighboring carriage houses proposed to say modern interpretation rather than impersonating of what was not present in the past. That means, basically it's a carriage house and as rick mentioned, there was no rooftop extension or anything like that in the past. Nor is that really part of a character with a multi-angled roof line and a continuous envelope that lessens the volume and visual impact from all sides, which means here we're facing kind of a particular situation where it's not a. You know your typical brownstone raw house, where you have one or two elevations front and back, but here we're really also exposing or are due to expose the side elevation due to its location, since the corner building has the lower drugstore retail space towards the carriage house, so we're dealing with two very public elevations here. Furthermore, the roof shape and its orientation takes into consideration, building code regulation governing installation of solar photovoltaic systems while at the same time avoiding additional mounting structures for solar panels as seen throughout Brooklyn. I just want to just interrupt for a moment. This is a choir yeah. I guess supporting, isn't good. You are you're really hard to see your breaking up. It's going to be bad yeah! Well enough! Yes, okay! I did. I just want to make sure so this is going to be a supplier, I guess supporting beams and construction that will support a full, be living on it, we'll be walking on it. So it's going to require work at the rooftop that you have existing to have it support all the new work, the plumbing and everything else that's going to be coming through. I understood partially your question. I guess you were you're asking I'm guessing your question here, but it seems like you're asking for description. Mr gordon, I'm sorry, but your connection continues to be pretty problematic. Mr gordon yeah, I can hear you well. Your connection is pretty bad. I'm sorry, okay, because I can hear everybody very well. Can you hear me now? Let me take on what I understood from your question. Okay, so I believe you're asking to get a overall description of the scope first, just to understand the work that you're going to be doing. Yes, okay, great, it is a one-story edition, which means it is in addition to the existing building, which entails structural components, plumbing walls, roof and so on and so forth. Yes, that's what I was asking. Thank you. It is basically a if you wish to say penthouse or third floor of this building. Now I'm diving I'm diving into the program in a second. I just want to give you the parameters a little bit. What it is. It is a 850 square feet. Addition to the existing building. The existing building is a single family building. The addition is stepping back in the front from the street facade by four feet and in the back roughly three foot six four feet as well, that is, within the zoning envelope, the we could build within the zoning envelope all the way to the street facade, but prefer to step back to have the current parapet and what rick described as the ornamental part of that building untouched. We are building from parapet wall, sorry from a party wall to party ball, a new structure that new structure will rest on the existing brick wall. There will be no new foundation necessary, which means the existing brick wall can carry the load which we are proposing. Now we can probably it makes sense to go quickly back to the floor plans, so that is the floor plan of the new edition. It's basically a bedroom, bathroom reading room reading, look with the four foot step back in the front and a four foot: six setback in the rear. That is the roof view of it with the proposed solar panels which are required by coat, and that is also part- and I will I will go further into that in a second but part of the roof, shape and degree of roof shape to have a the right amount of solar power. But I will go further into that in a second. That is the front elevation, so the building- and you will see that also in the mock-up- which we built goes up to 34 and six feet and then slopes back. That is the side elevation seen from the corner of green. Even so I mean you will have a building in front of it, but if I would take that building away, that's my site elevation, that's the real elevation! That's a section through the building here is existing. That is what we are proposing, that is again left side. Existing right side is proposed, and here you see an illustration and that I think, makes it most clear. So that's the existing building there's a certain amount of chimneys. The steel chimney on this side was built when the neighboring building, which is fairly new, built they had to put that in place. Sorry, that is our proposal where you see the solar panels, so the solar panels have a certain degree to catch the unnecessary sun and again, solar panels are now in any new roof edition or new roof, be part as a court requirement. Now what I mentioned before, and I think that's quite important to understand that scheme- why the roof is folding. That way is to avoid additional structural components for the solar system itself means you probably saw that whenever you have a brownstone and may owner decides right now to put solar onto it, even when it's in a historical district, most likely they're becoming a aluminum mounting or steel structure, which then hover is hovering above the building itself. We are trying to avoid that by all means and integrate that solar panel into the roof. Secondly, why we are going with a pitched roof is to avoid an additional parapet by code. The pitch has to be 20 degree or greater to avoid a parapet. If we have to have a parapet, then the roof line which we are trying to keep as low and in line with the neighboring buildings, would be extended by 42 inches and would be greater than the neighboring building. So that's important to keep in mind now, in general, the material choice of the edition is a standing, seam metal facade. It presents a bridge, a bridge material that neither mimics nor stands out the material continuation between wall and roof, and the reduction of essential details avoids competition with the existing building and its ornamental brickwork. So the approach here is that we are not trying to mimic what was never there in the past right. We are aware we are proposing a modern addition on this building. What we are trying to avoid is that extension is taking away from the beauty and the ornaments of the existing carriage house. That's why we are stepping away from the front facade to keep the parapet untouched. That's why we are proposing a material which has less details than the rich brick facade we have currently, which means it really tries to steps back and obviously we're aware that it's visible, but it tries to steps back and takes it glues from neighboring sloping, roof penthouses. The addition is set back by four feet from the front of the building and four foot: six from the rear of the existing second floor, with a 30 feet, rear yard, back from the property line, it will serve as an extension to the existing single home in an existing use group 2a, occupancy group and 6 r6b zoning. The front elevation of the extension with its three openings is in alignment with the opening of the first floor. So this is better seen in that image here, where the existing garage door or carriage door, the entrance door and window is mimicking the location of the upper new windows. The north facade is windowless, partly sorry. The north platte is a windowless party wall with three feet: extension of the brick wall to line with the existing parapet. So here that is the existing north wall, where you see that how the existing purple sticks out, what we are proposing to align that and actually having the new extension sitting on top of it and the rear elevation of the existing sorry and the rear elevation of extension has two windows openings and a roof access letter. So that looks like that, as seen from the street 405 vanderbilt avenue is part of an array of four buildings with unique roof shapes the proposed roof edition will complete the assembly without overtaking. The existing here are a couple of details which are important to us. Then, since the material is a we're choosing a material which we can use as a wall and roof material, what is important there that the details of corners and so on how these materials go into each other is resolved, so we're looking into certain corner details which we then bring forward in our construction drawings. There is currently a roof mock-up. So here that is the proposed line from there. The building is sloping, as you see, to the left to the rear and then folds down, which you currently can't see because of the tree, and I think I would like to conclude the presentation with these images. Yes, all right! Thank you very much. This is curious. If you would consider your your addition to have the color. Would you want it to blend sort of like the nice brown that you have, or you prefer, keeping sort of the black that you have? You know as you're proposing yeah. So if I believe you know that's kind of what we discussed with landmark, if, when you try to blend a it, wouldn't be a line with, you know historical buildings, as you see the neighboring building, which is fairly new, but still they went also to landmark, there is somehow an offset between a carriage house lower part and then upper roof part, but more so, if it would blend, you could come to the conclusion that it is something existing or it is something which was there in the past right because it tries to be part of the existing building, which means, when you blend too much the brick and the new material would look at once at one, and I think we really try actually just to go the other part, the other route that we are setting. Apart from that, we do not want to build a new building here, which was never there right. We have an existing carriage house which had never an extension to it and therefore it actually shouldn't blend. It should actually take the back seat if that makes sense so yeah. I understand your position: yeah, okay, daughtry, and so you had a question about pv, which I couldn't quite figure out. So maybe you can just elaborate on that. It's not a question, it's clarification and just one. I want to say for the record that I support this application and the approach that they're taking to differentiating the addition from the existing building. My number one concern as an architect was maintaining a parapet and the distinctions there and you've done that, and I think that I think that that the palette and the shape of the edition is a nice counter attack, I guess or counterbalance to the existing building, is that a motion to approve I didn't want to. I was I'm the first person to speak so I'll it can be so, but I don't want to let other people speak discussion. Okay, go ahead else. Yes, can you go back to slide? 25? That's the front! There are the yeah. Yes, I was wondering why you have on the extension, the windows. The windows are matching the first floor rather than the second floor, because I find it disturbing the layout of those windows. Yeah, it's something and maybe rick you can jump in here, but it is something which is seen in historical buildings throughout that it is building next door. The one with the man said their third floor is matching more their second floor yeah, so they have a wider center window. They have a wider sender window, but because it's matching the second floor, a wide center window also their windows are set further to the to the outside of the building right. So here we have the three windows. I think it could somewhat work in our floor plan not preferable for sure, but it really came out of the discussion with lpc that they also preferred to mimic out of historical evidence the ground floor, the ground rather than the middle. I think the layout makes it look more contemporary, rather than mimicking. What's old yeah I mean I also envisioned that these windows are less prominent as you're seeing them here. So you know I'm seeing it whoops, I'm sorry about that. I'm seeing it more like that being part of it. I think it should. I think it should mimic second floor and I would like to say that in a motion I think that wider window makes it look more modern. Yes, would that be more a discussion with lpc as well? It would, but I think, as you know, we've already just we have discussed this with lpc and it has been a topic of of ours since the very beginning on this fenestration pattern in the rooftop edition mimics, those openings that we find on the first floor, and we want this to have its own identity. But we do want to reference other things and in this particular case, the reference is to the ground floor of this building. Further the rooftop itself. The configuration is such that these are bits and pieces of a number of these carriage houses along the east side of vanderbilt avenue, and I think it's very important to keep its own identity, and this is a reference to the original. At the first floor, which I think is important, but I think there is a certain amount of honesty in putting together a rooftop edition which has its own identity, but yet is stepped back and allows the original architecture and design of the building to go forward. You know number 407 isn't 20 years old yet, and it was made to look as if it was something much older. This is a turn away from that. This is saying that this is what this is and we believe it is a modern edition. We do want to have some references to some of the quotations that we find and we feel that the fenestration pattern at the first floor is appropriate for the front facade of the rooftop edition. This is this. Is eric eric spruell. May I speak? Yes, eric go ahead. Okay, I live around the corner from this building. The the drugstore is my neighborhood drugstore. I use it every day. I don't have a problem with what the architect is proposing. With this building I'd like to move to approve okay, so move, do we have a second? Can you hear me? Okay, we have a motion to approve and we have a set. I acknowledge point as well as part of the discussion. That's part of what we'll be discussing. Anybody else wishes to make points on the emotion. Yes, hello, yes, go ahead. Thank you right, irene jenner, did you hi? Did you consider the black just seems so starkly? In contrast, I find it disturbing. Did you consider possibly a charcoal gray more like the mainsart on the neighboring building? We could we could consider. We could consider that so that the color is not yet finalized and it will be nothing. You know it will be, certainly well thought. Through I mean it will be not your glossy aluminum facade or anything like that right. It will be really taken back on a matte sheen and we will go with lpc to a couple of ranges between exactly what you're proposing between a charcoal and a black somewhere in between yeah [Applause] is the this is john. Do it's the roof edition for the grandparents for the grandparents? No, it's for. I don't know how they will actually use it, but I know they need. They need. Certainly another bedroom yeah. How are you getting up? How do you get up there? What kind of internal stairwell? I know it's not part of the application. That's fine! No! That's fine! I appreciate the interest, it's really the extension of the existing stair, so the what we are showing it to. I guess: that's the new building on the right, the carriage house there there is an existing staircase from the first to the second and we are extending that one to the third floor. Okay, I mean that's the actually the easiest part in this entire project. This is bill. Flenoy may I speak chair. May I speak okay, no problem I'll go yeah I'll, go yeah! Okay. I appreciate the fact that, because you only have a 30 foot backyard that you really can't do in addition back there, and I appreciate the fact that you're keeping the front of the building intact. I do appreciate that my issue, of course, is the design of the building in and of its the addition in and of itself. You know I feel it's not appropriate, but I understand what you're trying to do. You want to get a unique look and when it just delineates or take additions from other structures that you've seen along vanderbilt, but I don't think it's appropriate, especially with the color and my feeling, basically is being that you're going from. Basically it's a full edition, not necessarily a full full width, full height, but it is full width and but not full length, and I just have a problem with the fact that it's so visible and it's so distinctive. That's my personal opinion. I just don't think it's appropriate. I do understand what you're doing I do appreciate it, but the design and the color just doesn't work for me. I just wanted to say that okay bill. Thank you any other comments from board members committee members. This is esther. I live across the street if well I live at 424 vanderbilt. I think we need to vote on on the to approve okay investor anybody. I just want to make sure this is eric. I don't believe I've been seconded. I think somebody thank you. It was daltree cummins all right rob. I guess we can start with the roll call okay. So on the motion to recommend approval, mr gordon, how do you vote? Yes, ms janner, so I'll come back? Oh ms, hello, I'm here I think I'm here. Yes from jenner. I have reservations, though I think they should look at the caller. You said you prefer to gray. Is that correct? Thank you. Audrey. Miss ali also prefer the gray and have concern about the windows. Thank you, ernie you can there we go. How do you vote? Yes? Thank you, ms blonde. You heard me yes! Thank you, chris orphan. Yes, thank you, mr howald. Are you still with us? Yes, you are oh no! I am we'll come back man. I am here. Yes, oh okay, sorry, thank you, mr sproul. Yes, mr do yes, mr flonoy! No, although you know you abstained on the last one, so you're softening ms ginsburg, ms ginsberg elizabeth. Are you still with us? Yes, you are, but you're muted miss johnson all right. This is elizabeth. If you can't hear me, I said yes and yes for johnson. Yes, so, mr gordon one two motion passes by a vote of 11 in favor, one opposed with the notation that some people would prefer a dr dark color and ms ali would like the third floor windows to mimic the second floor windows. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Thank you all right. I'm going to try to move quickly because it's this particular as quickly as we can do. We have none board members non-committee members that wish to speak up. Can I see the notification again I'll repeat any non-committee members non-board wish to speak up? Have anything they wish to include. This is the open session for public speaking, mr gordon, before I'm here, and at this point I'll, let you jump in. I don't know that I have anything specific to landmarks to discuss. I would like to just go on record that with these changes in temperature and atmospherics and everything else, we just have to take a look at what the potential implications are for everything. This is something that I think every committee needs to constantly be reminded of, because we are in a totally different environment. These days and everything's going to change to whatever extent construction is going to change. Who knows a particular point, but I just think as a as a measure of consciousness, we need to just take a look at whatever is going on in the city as it relates to construction, along with everything else that is going on. I don't know if you can even hear me, we have trouble hearing. I don't think, there's any trouble hearing me, mr gordon. I think the connection the bad connection is unfortunately, on your end, we're having trouble hearing you and mr gordon is going miss janner. Would you like to go over chairing the meeting? Yes, okay? Are there any other speakers for community forum or any other business from committee and board members? Does anyone wish to speak? This is donald trump. I would just like to clarify my comment in the chat which is in regards to local laws. 92 and 94.. The architect made a reference to a requirement for pv panels. I just want to clarify that there is a new law that went into effect in mid-november of 2019. That requires either pv panels or a planted green roof. So in future projects we'll be seeing a lot more, but it's not necessarily a requirement to go straight with pv panels. Thank you. Anybody else wish to speak yeah. This is bill flenoy. Yes, I was unfortunate. I wasn't present at the last language committee meeting. I was just curious what the statement of needs decision was for land use. I think we gave some ideas, but we didn't actually have a vote or a specific all right rob. Can you clarify that yeah? I can hear you, okay yeah. I noticed that you didn't have an actual anything specific that you did bring up. You had a discussion, but nothing was presented or approved. The topics that I made note of during the discussion were a need for more transient housing, especially in the current or perceived economic climate. There was a suggestion that the community board seek professional assistance for their study of AMI, and we also discussed whether or not it was purposeful to keep the budget priority. That asks for a fresh look at the downtown Brooklyn rezoning or not. We there was no conclusion. There were opinions expressed on both sides of the issue, so technically they're not presenting anything land use. We will. We will conclude that input go ahead, mr gordon, that would just say that it was more, I think, a sense of the committee that we supported. I think it was the affordable housing and the other items that rob just mentioned was more of a sense of the committee that any actual formal proposal- okay, so there's okay, I understood. Oh, this is eric I'd like to say something. Yes, my daughter brought to my attention that I believe it's 810 fulton street is now ready to accept. Applicants 810 fulton street and another building on atlantic avenue were two of the buildings that were made available for affordable housing as part of the deal with the library at cadman plaza. My daughter brought to my attention and I immediately I haven't seen the notice, but she said that the affordability of those apartments are decidedly not affordable. Mr sproul, can I jump in sure, so we, the district office, did announce that, and unlike most of my announcements about affordable housing, the subject line for the message was income restricted housing opportunity. So affordability is always relative to what your income is. For some people this may be a perfect fit, but yes, the income bans start in the mid 80s and they and this building does not conform to what most people think of when they discuss affordable housing. Also yeah. That's the only point I want to make. So if I can continue, if I can continue, it seems that only make it considerate, because I'm trying to it seems to me that these kind of things happen all the time where developers make promises to us. You know we approve it and then somewhere down the line, it's not to what our expectations were. I don't know what can be done about this, but I'd like to see where there is some way that we can hold their feet to the fire in terms of what their promises are to the community. So eric. Why don't we find out what the promises were? Eric can I build on that we could get an analysis of the affordable housing that we have approved the date, to whatever extent, is reasonable, that it's occupied and what the current rents are, because we're always saying it's too expensive. We should have some specific details to talk about what we think was approved as affordable housing. What are they actually charging? We don't know, we just don't know. I just want to jump in here and just make sure that we are all aware about when these, when in the process, these decisions are made. If a development takes affordable housing bonus far in zoning, they have a choice- that's written to the zoning text about how they want to define that in terms of are they going to be in the 40 AMI band. What percentage of units are going to be in what bands and all of that goes in before the building's approved it's the first thing the building department looks at so I love the idea of following through to see what buildings that have gotten the bonus are actually charging post construction, but I just wanted to flag that oftentimes. These decisions are made far in advance of us, even knowing what is coming down. The pipe we've had that explanation over the many years, but again with a lot of what we do here and approve. We don't do any retrospective review to validate and use that information when we go forward. So again, we just need to have more information when we're talking about it. I did have one other item that I thought we might want to consider very in this discussion. First before you move on john, yes, okay, thanks sorry about that john, but you're about to jump to something else, and I also want to comment on this. I am okay yeah. I, if I recall the situation, we made a proposal about affordable housing. It then went through the different levels of discussion and eventually, if I recall there was a deal that was actually finally made that was outside of our committee and we never actually were part of that we made suggestions but down the line. We never saw exactly what was the final decision. It basically came along parallel to what we suggested in the first place, but I never or I never heard, of what the affordable housing was actually going to break. The breakdown was going to be. Are you hearing me? Yes, I recall this building when the discussion about the library was had. I don't know if you remember, we had a big hearing. Yes, they were saying their AMI was a range and they were saying like 40 to 60 percent of mi. They didn't give solid numbers and now that they have a building, they are on the higher end of their range. That's why it's really not affordable should have saying that it's too early because they are coming to us very early in the project. Mr parish, you're saying this wasn't part of the library proposition. No, so you know, let's go back to the library and see what they promised us. Oh, it wasn't part of that project. Okay, we'll just say one of them was the library yeah, but apparently it was wrong. Oh okay, all right! I just want him. Let me move. Okay, john, make your point. Then I want to move on the agenda because it's again we're breaking up a lot you're breaking up gordon. We have not discussed all of the issues that are surrounding what's happening with the sea level rise, it's going to have major implications. Apparently the glaciers are melting at a far higher rate than what was originally anticipated and we're expecting a sea level rise to have impact. Much sooner than later, can we find out what the army corps of engineers or the city of new york and get an update on, what's going to be happening in Brooklyn bridge park in the navy yard and all of our waterfront properties? Actually, at that point, john, what? Interestingly, I was going. Let me jump then air's report, because I just wanted to point out first, I wanted to point a thank you to rob if you haven't the email that he sent earlier today, rob sent an email to the entire committee. If you have not seen it or if you have not received it, please let me or rob know there was an email about. What's in the pipeline for things that are being developed, one of the things the point came out was the. As you point out, john. The concern was rising. If you remember, we had a meeting over, I think at in Brooklyn law school one of our committees, where we had a meeting where we met, and we had a presentation from the department of city planning concerning the shorelines and rising waters, and that is listed a pipeline item that will be getting back to us. That's going to be coming so take a look. What rob has sent us- and we anticipate that they'll- be coming back to us very much on that point. So I want to thank rob for sending it and also just bear in mind that we will begin a whole lot of stuff. That's coming. If you look at this, I call it the pipeline memo from rob, we'll be getting the developments from 625 fulton street. It looks like even with all the problems that we have in the that the developers are still coming and pushing their particular projects. So I just want to read the memo and I guess if there are questions, I guess you could send it back to the to rob in the board office. The other thing I also will point out, while I was this, I guess we'll call as part of the chairs report is ivory. I'm a member of the landmarks conservancy, which is a separate, not-for-profit good, guys group, which does a lot of work in helping people with their marks and they put out an excellent report and I would do it. Would it suggest that if you go to their website, it's called? Yes, it's a react reality and yeah. It's a hit of work, that's being done in new york, city housing. Now in new york, county new york and houses that are basically in most houses are more than 50 years old, and what they're trying to point out is that they are that the that the development that is known as development, but actually is that historic preservation in these houses is of a benefit to the economy and to us as well. So I think if we want to take a look at it, it's you know reality and recovery. It's in their website. If you can't I'll try to help you out on that and it's about give me. Could you give the information to mr paris and let him distribute it to all the committee members? Oh okay, I'll, send it on to him as well. All right, I just want to let on the last item I have here is just the minutes again, karen a good job. I like to get a motion to approve on the minutes and if there are any additions, I'll make the motion to approve the minutes from august. You have a second on that. Second, thank you. Are there any problems or any questions? Is there any objection to acceptance of the minutes? No objections? I have no other items, I think we'll accept. Well, we had other business. I think we get out of the business why this extended question. I have nothing else so at this time at 7 34 p.m. I will adjourn our meeting. Don't move second, okay! Thank you. Everyone. Once again, we got through all the problems that we have here, but thank you very much and we'll be hopefully seeing you again soon. Thank you. Okay, good night.",
