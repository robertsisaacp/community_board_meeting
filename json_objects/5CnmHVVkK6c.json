It's 604 and recording is going to begin, and I'm supposed to wait for a recording right is that on it's now being recorded. So the meeting of the youth, education and cultural affairs Brooklyn CB2, is called to order and is being recorded for access on the CB2 youtube archive in accordance with the open meetings law, and it is the practice of CB2 to conduct remote meetings with all committee members.

My name is Oscar Luckett, I'm a committee and board member I'll, throw it to Elizabeth, I'm not sure we've met yet no Elizabeth is not a board member. Let's see I'm just looking at the side list here, yeah sure, hi, everyone, I'm Meredith, I'm a committee member and a board member and the currently discombobulated secretary, but give me a minute and I will get my stuff together and be ready to take notes. Thank you, everyone, okay, so we know that the recording has begun. We introduced community members. People receive the agenda of via email. Are there any comments from the committee members about the agenda? I do want to add that before the chairperson's report, we want to discuss the statement of district need, which was not bulleted out as a separate discussion and also at the end of the chairs report. Dorothea Thompson manning has agreed to facilitate a conversation about future presentations that the committee would like to hear, especially from cultural organizations. So the next item is the presentation from the district 15. Core, Group, Maddie Fox will present her organization and those of you who have been attending our committee meeting know that district 15 has been involved in a discussion about potentially rezoning parts of district 15. That's part of our CB2 geography, which would be 261 and 38, and we've been in conversations with the cec and with the poor. So that said, Miss Maddie Fox. Thank you for joining us. Thank you so much for the invitation. Betty and it's very cool to be here, I feel like community boards are the kind of the coolest and the best form of government we have so. Thank you all for your work and and again, thank you for having me. I was I'm going to be joined tonight by another member of our of our team, who was not able to make it, but vanessa mcknight sends her regrets. She wanted to be here as well. So, as you may know, the there are seven schools within district 15 that are up for a potential rezone and it includes 261 and 38 and then also Ps32, Ps29, Ps58, Ps, 676 and Ps15. I think I named them all. Did I stick 29? If I did not, I think I got all the schools, so these are all elementaries right, so it's only elementary schools. It's and this process came up a year ago or a year and a half ago now, almost and the Office of District planning of the Department of education started to put forward a couple of potential proposals last summer and there was a reaction from acrosss. A lot of community members gave feedback that it was going too fast, and there was also concerns that the process was not so inclusionary of bipark community members and NYCHA residents who are connected to all of these schools. So there was there was like a community engagement process, but it was. It was not being conducted in a way that was really so easy to participate for communities, acrosss the impacted zones so ADA. There was community feedback about this and a rec, a suggestion that came from within the community to slow down the process and go about this in a more participatory way. So last March to cut a long story short last March we launched a participatory action research project, I'm which is I'm a parent in District 15.. My child is at ps15, but I'm also on faculty at Brooklyn college. And what I do is this participatory action, research kind of work, and so I, in collaboration with a community, a community leader from Red Hook and Matt Gonzalez from the Nyu Metro Center. We and in collaboration with many community members, acrosss, reddick and Gowanus, especially we present we proposed and launched this project. So in March we gathered together a diverse group of parents from acrosss the impacted school zones to form a research team, a community- based research team and we started meeting and we have been working and meeting ever since through the pandemic through thick and thin. We transitioned from meeting within a school to meeting. You know like this. We use zoom, but, and we have been working on building our own knowledge, around histories and contexts of rezoning talking with other districts around the city, who've gone through similar process processes, we've been having we've been conducting community conversations with community members, which kind of like interviews, we've been conducting and we've been spending time at food distribution lines and at open streets events and building our knowledge around a community member's experience of Schools elementary schools and getting kind of the access to schools, perspectives on that process and that experience and then also getting community members, dreams and ideas and vision for what could be or what equity. Would I look and could look like acrosss these seven schools in the sub zone. The seven schools are, some of them are quite segregated by race and socioeconomic status. So that's one of the core issues that we're working on in this project and we just recently building on the knowledge we've collected so far we just recently created, and then we just launched a survey that we're now spreading out far and wide that we want as many families connected to these seven schools, families that are either zoned for these seven schools or who attend these seven schools to respond to this survey. So if, if it'll be possible to go to the website, I'll just show you, we have a pretty simple website. We've been doing all this, you know in the midst of a pandemic, with sort of unexpectedly limited or resources limited and constrained and unexpected ways, but we have this website it's district15parproject.org and on it you can easily access the survey in a couple different places and then there's also, if you click on the, how can I get involved? This is a flyer that is actually it's easy to screenshot or download or share. If people want to share that out in different ways via you know, whatever distribution list- or you know social, media or whatever- and so we've been getting a robust response so far, but we are and we're really looking forward to hearing from and as many community members as possible, who might be impacted by this potential rezone and there's some background. Information and the site itself, has multiple languages and and can be kind of read in different languages. So we hope it's accessible, but we're not relying just on this website alone or just on these. On this online survey alone, we're really spending a lot of time out in community and talking with people who are very connected to local community organizers and community groups and community based organizations in building a knowledge and vision for what could be acrosss. These acrosss these schools and the goal is that by the end of September into October, with that, we are going to generate a a list of recommendations for- and this is the survey that is showing you now, but we're going to generate a list of recommendations to so to give to the Department of Education and the Department of Education will use those recommendations to develop proposals for the rezoning. So you could stop the share now or if you want, I mean people can go back and- and I did not say before- but just to clarify this project is a collaboration between the community, the you know, Brooklyn college and the Nyu Metro Center and the Department of Education, so that you know part of the idea is that the Department of Education and the Office of District planning are in some way accountable to the recommendations that we will present at the end of this process. When the survey when we, when we have a robust enough response from the survey we'll be looking through those responses and thinking about them in relation to the interviews we are also conducting and the kind of ethnographic knowledge we're gathering as our own community and we'll be sharing those back out with community to get feedback as we build towards recommendations, so the process itself will be iterative as we move forward. So we think we wanted to fill you all in about this, get your thoughts and feedback and also to invite and ask to in whatever way, you're willing or that you want to. You know, take the survey or spread the word about the survey. There's also other ways to be involved for sure or anyone who wants to get involved and be involved. You're very welcome. Okay, thank you. So much so now we'll entertain questions first from the committee. Do we have any committee members who would like to ask a question? Okay feel free to jump in. So I have a question so it sounds like I wish I think Nick Ferreira is trying to speak. No, I did not. I'm sorry I was delayed. I was just wondering if I'm sorry, if it was mentioned a timeline for this yeah, so we started in in March. There was a little bit of a delay because of the pandemic, and so the goal is to have recommendations in October. We can't go much beyond that because they, you know the way the process works. The cec has to vote with the ideally, the any changes would be in place in time for kindergarten admissions, which begin in December, so we're aiming for October for recommendations. Great. Thank you. Thank you. I have a question which is related to the pandemic, we're reading and we're hearing that families have left the city or certain areas and so on. So we expect that the pattern of the children that show up either for remote learning or blended, hybrid, blended, hybrid, we're not sure how many children to expect. I think, especially in areas where people have the ability to move or to change their situation. So at what point are those numbers? Do you anticipate that we'll know how many children are quote registered for the schools in terms of like their utilization and capacity, because one of the driving concerns was that some of the schools were overcrowded, absolutely yeah? So thanks for that question, yeah two of the schools are significantly overcrowded and we asked so we meet with. You know we're meeting and in conversation with the Office of District planning many times a week, and you can imagine that question comes up a lot in our meetings with them from the par team and then in all kinds of ways and the this. The answer that we get is that we do not know. We won't know those numbers, so those enrollment numbers are very hard gather. Apparently you know that data is apparently very hard to gather until well into the school year, and so we won't know there's you know, there's all kinds of there's enrollment that peop and it's going to be even heightened this year because we're just not going to know kind of who shows up until well after the fact. But you know- and we won't know, I think we can. We might have this sense that a lot of people are leaving and particularly families with you know, resources to leave, but we do not know for sure if that's a temporary or to what extent, that's happening and also kind of the time frame for that. So, unfortunately, we have almost no data on that now understood, but that's something that is people wonder about. The other thing is that because of the pandemic and the concerns about air and transportation, yeah and the original plan indicated that if the plan was unzoned and you would get a school within those seven schools within that sub- zone, that busing would be provided and now there's more concern about how much busing can be provided and parents hesitance may be in putting their child on a bus. So how does that fit into your survey and your planning at this? What we ask in the survey questions about how people get to school and now and how what they would kind of be willing to do? I we we're hesitant it's a tricky. It's a tricky situation to be conducting this project in the midst of the pandemic, because we all hope right that in the in a year, we won't have to be facing some of these pandemic related issues, and we want to be thinking about that future in this project. So but at the same time it's a reality that there are heightened concerns about putting five- year- olds on buses and and there's also concerns around budget. There's a lot of different concerns we have to. We will we anticipate after the survey that we'll need to have a kind of some special focused conversations with community members around some of those issues, and that will take those into account when we make our recommendations. But our recommendations are going to be about how we make these decisions in relation to be being accountable to equity? And it's going to be up to all of us, then, but kind of beyond the scope of this project to think about how we are both accountable to equity and reconciling that accountability in the context of the pandemic or post- pandemic or whatever we're in so. I do not think it has a direct impact, except for that people's psychological experience right now of thinking about rezoning is, you know, is certainly impacted. Thank you. I appreciate that. Are there more questions from the committee. I think you have a website or an address. If people have additional questions for you, yes sure I'm going to put, we have a district, I'm putting two email addresses well, this is fine. I'll just put this one in this comes to our team, and that way you just have one thing to remember: district 15 powerproject.org, I'm Maddie Fox and I will also put in my Brooklyn college email here. Thank you so much. I thank you for watching and I hope that our members did as well so hearing no further questions feel free to stay in our meeting or I know you have children to to. I do not know if you did not whatever okay. So next we have a representative from the New York City of Civilian Complaint Review Board, that I understand we'll be talking about Youth Advisory, Miss, Sonia Hi. Is everyone able to hear me? Yes, hey. Thank you. So much for having me here today and allowing me to share this information on behalf of the agency, I'm going to share on my screen with the powerpoint presentation. There are links that I'm going to share after the presentation. Just so it's seamless and I'm able to show everyone like the slides and people are able to access the information afterwards. Is everyone able to see my screen now? Yeah awesome. Thank you. So the New York City, Civilian, Complaint Review Board, is an independent city agency. That's tasked with investigating allegations of police misconduct. The Ccrb is overseen by a group of board members, so we have 15 people on the board. We have the chair that is appointed by the mayor. We have five members that are appointed by the mayor. We have five appointed by the New York City Council and three designated by the police. Commissioner, one person who is appointed by the public advocate and the chair who is appointed by the mayor and the City Council, so the Ccrb investigates certain allegations of police misconduct and a helpful acronym to remember. The categories is fatal: s- a-, d- o. So the s stands for force can look like pushing kicking use the use of a baton. For example, it could look like an officer drawing their weapons, even though they do not necessarily use it or discharge it. The a fatal stands for abusive authorities that can look like an officer threatening to call eyes on me. An officer searching me without cause an officer issuing a summons or arresting me in retaliation. The diabetes stands for discourtesy, so discourtesy can be inappropriate, language, profane, language or rude gestures. And lastly, we investigate allegations of offensive language offensive. Language refers to derogatory language that refers to my race, my ethnicity, identity, such as life, religion, sexual orientation, disability status or what an officer may perceive to be those things. So we share information about the right to know. What's with you and adults as well, so the rights rising elections passed in October of 2018 and that changed our police that changed the way police interactions occur. So, for example, if someone is monolingual, police officers have to provide language active services during an interaction. An individual is empowered to ask for a business card from the officer. So the business card will have their name, their rank, their shield, it's going to say their command and on the back of the business card, it's going to. Let people know how they can submit a comment or complaint and also how they can request body cameras along with the right to know, act in certain situations, and there are some exceptions. An officer has to let the individual know why they were stopped during an interaction and also letting the person know that they have a right to give consent to a search before it's actually conducted. So where an officer does not have the legal authority or justification to search someone letting the individual know that they have a right to give their consent or not, and so winter of 2018. The Ccrb launched its Youth Advisory council, so the Youth Advisory Council has 19 members and they're between the ages of 10 and 24.. So the Youth Advisory council members. They serve as ambassadors in their own communities for sharing information about the agency and how they're able to file a complaint, and these are individuals who are passionate about criminal justice issues and also improving police community relations in 2019. It was the spring event that we hosted. It was the first ever youth symposium that the ccrb put together and it has to do with youth and policing, and we use the insights from that symposium that you've attended to inform our policy report that is released in June and also to shape the way the agency does outreach and just our just our operations in general. Moving forward, I have, would it be helpful or how about this? Are there any questions? So far? No so one of the things that the Ccrb does in terms of outreach is going into schools going to youth groups. So a lot of the things that we're doing now is virtual, but still like showing up into those meetings, letting you know what their rights are. If they're stopped by the police, how they can file a complaint and also letting them know that you do not have to be a certain age to follow complaint with the Ccrb, anyone can file. So you do not necessarily need an adult to fall on your behalf, so that individuals feel like they can say something if police misconduct occurs and from so. We looked at specific complaint data that we received between January, 1st of 2018 and June 30th of 2019, and what we found was that there was a disproportionate number of youth that were stopped and one based on their race and ethnicity, also when it comes to the boroughs with those highest complaints where either the complainant or one of the alleged victims of police misconduct was a young person. Brooklyn was in the highest categories, so Brooklyn had the most. It was 36 of those complaints that involved youth in 2020 so year to date, the number of complaints that the Ccrb has received is 2775 and in terms of the local precinct like where the complaints are coming from so for the 84 precinct. So far year to date, we've received 84 complaints and for the ADA station here today we received 29 complaints, any questions so far. One of the things I want could you repeat: could you repeat those last two data points, the complaints for the 88th and 84th, of course, and the information that I just shared with you is actually on the Ccrb website and I will be sharing that link as well. It's on our data transparency, initiative, page, I'm sorry. I found a notification from Webex, so so this is on our data transparency initiative page from the agency's website. So on that page, you're able to look up the number of complaints for every preference in every borough so for community board two, the 84th precinct year to date. So from the beginning of the year till today the 84th has 56 for the 88s. There are 29. and to put these in context, the highest. The precinct with the highest number of complaints is the 75th with 106., and second is the 73rd with 84. on so on that page as well, we break down the complaints, by borrow so of all the boroughs. Brooklyn actually has the highest number of complaints so from the 2775 that were received, year- to- date, 901 are from Brooklyn. One complaint can have multiple allegations, so in an encounter with an officer there may be excessive or necessary force. That was used the spirit to see during that interaction. So it also breaks down how those allegations are coming up and it might be helpful for people to see. So what are the trends or what are the practices or the tendencies that are coming up when it comes to policing in someone's neighborhood this year? We also so the Youth Advisory Council put together a psa and it was start so they it was their idea like they put it together and it's to inform you about the ccrb and how they can file a complaint, and I will be sharing the link to that as well. Are you able to talk specifically about the youth in this youth Advisory board and how they're recruited and their role in this, because I think that was the focus of what the committee is interested in yeah, of course, so the applications for the Youth Advisory Council is actually going to go, live in the fall and I'll be sharing the information for that as well. So the Youth Advisory Council has regular regularly scheduled meetings where they'll come together and over the course of the year, like one of the things that they did was specifically work on the public service announcement that had to do with informing you about the ccrv and last year hosting the symposium on youth police community relations. If there were any youth who are interested in attending, so everyone do not hear you Ms Banegas, I think we've lost your audio. Could you try speaking again? Hi hello? Okay, thank you. Okay! Maybe rewind one sentence. Thank you! So, every month the Erb hosts Monthly board meetings open to the public. Anyone can comment if you want to attend and get a feel for the agencies or share places. These community relations or what things are going on in their neighborhood they're, more than welcome to do that. In terms of I mean, are there any other questions or is there any other information that I can provide in terms of the Youth Advisory Council, so the applications will be going live soon and we're going to have our new cohort coming in this fall, so you'll be sharing that with the community board. So we can publicize that as we publicize other entities, yes and I'll, be on posting those links in the chat great. So are there any questions from members of the committee hi? This is nick again. Thank you for the presentation. I was at last month's board meeting. I believe it was maybe an emergency one. I was wondering if there was any update on if the NYPD was actually showing up for the hearings. At this point there was a problem with them refusing to appear right. So while I can't comment on specific on investigation, so as an outreach coordinator like I can share information about the agency, but I'm not an investigator but from my understanding, officers has been working with the agencies. Thank you. Thank you appreciate it. Are there questions from community board members who are not members of this committee? Are there questions from anyone else? Hi? Oh sorry, Yahoo identify yourself if you're speaking, hi, my name is emily nadu. I live in Fort, Greene, hello. Are you able to hear me? Sorry, I'm not sure yeah hi, I guess it's more of a statement question so one very happy to hear about this review Board. I actually was not aware that it existed so excited just about learning more about it and I guess it's just for a statement, because this week I had the opportunity to attend a meeting in philippine park with ADA precinct just to think about. You know over policing how they're responding to things, and it was interesting at best I think, they're, obviously trying. I think one of the things that why this part of the meeting was particularly interesting to me and it's just been on my mind, a lot lately. I do not know how much this is like widely known, but I think when parents think- and I do not have kids, but I have a three- year- old, nephew, who's, obviously black and I think a lot of times when parents talk about having the talk with their kids they're, referring to the birds and the bees talk and like. When are you going to have that talk? Unfortunately, in black and brown families a lot of times? The talk refers to? When are you going to talk to your son about how he has to engage with police and about how they have to basically lower themselves demean themselves, not speak out, not ask about their rights because of how police will likely treat them as a result? So I guess I'm happy to hear that this is happening and I guess I'm just interested in anything. I can do or support to help put this in practice, and I realize, as I'm talking that, I'm not actually making a point. I just I've just been thinking a lot about the talk, and so it strikes me that a lot of the language about people knowing their rights and people should do this. That often ends badly for black and brown youth so, and I hate that there has to be something called the top, which is literally almost everything against what you guys are trying to do, because it is about telling black and brown young men in particular like careful, because you know when your rights upsets them and just causes bad things to happen. So but again, I'm very excited to hear about the work and look forward to learning more and everything. I can do. Thank you for joining our meeting and thank you for sharing. Are there more questions? Hi? This is Samantha Johnson, I'm a board member. I have a question in regards to youth engagement in the past a few months with Covid-19. I know that there has been a lot of obviously interactions with police and young people during protests and demonstrations, from whatever information that you can provide. Can you state any particular outcomes of what has been resolved of any type of disciplinary action for individual officers or any type of new practices that they're, considering while engaging with the public hi? So in June the Ccrb released our youth report and we actually made recommendations in our report like things that had to change in terms of police practices, even things that have to be updated in the patrol guide or in terms of their training when they are interacting with you. So there is a difference in the way an officer would police an adult or do policing with a young person, especially when it comes to you know them young people that interaction with an officer there's trauma that can come from that and it's a vulnerable situation. So goes there, for instance. So there are recommendations that the ccrb proposed in terms of disciplinary actions. I think I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're referring to. So anyone can file a complaint in terms of like specific case outcomes. For that particular complaint. It depends on a number of factors like. I can't tell you that a complaint that was filed in July is already closed at this point. So during presentations with young people, we'll explain what the investigation process is. So once you file a complaint, if it's not a jurisdiction, we refer somewhere else. What does the investigator do like using their subpoena power to get footage getting the body camera footage interviewing witnesses, one of the updates or changes that happened is that now you do not have to see misconduct firsthand. If you see a video online on social media and you believe that police misconduct occurred, you can still submit that to the ccrb and file a complaint and the ccrb will investigate so in term. I think that's like one of the changes that happened. That's like super major for the agency. Thank you. That's helpful. Did you have a follow- up, question Sam, or is that? Okay thanks, I think Sam and Alec came into the meeting a little later after introduction. So can you introduce yourself? Please Sam and then Alec I introduced myself, but I do not mind doing it again. I'm Samantha Johnson, I'm a community board member as well as the committee, and I think, Alec came in later, maybe yep, I'm Alec Duffy and I'm a public member of the principal. Thank you. Okay. So next on our agenda and thank you very much miss banegas and yeah that was Elizabeth Adams from Council member Levin's office is here. We I had a specific question as we remember when the building that was the Brooklyn heights, public library was sold and there was the library controversy one of the things the outcomes of that was the council number 11 brokered and an agreement to have a stem lab with some type of educational entity in the new building and as the building is coming closer to completion. I wanted a little bit of an update as to where the funding is, who provides the teacher who's, providing the build out of the space and, with these funding now very much in question with everything. Where does that funding stand? So thank you for coming Miss, Adams yeah. Thank you for having me for asking very important questions, so I do not have too concrete of an update. A lot of things, as I said, are in flux and would love to keep this as an ongoing conversation to check in on. So I can share a little bit of where we are now and then we also love to take in people's feedback and questions and can come back with more information and responses. So, yes, as part of the deal of the Brooklyn heights library, a multi- middle school science, lab of Cadman Plaza science lab was secured. Do we committed to some funding for it? I think, like a few years ago, back in the SCA committed capital funding, and I was trying to get kind of the exact number of where we are with that, but I believe that has kind of been sorted and and where it is now is the developer. Has the site and the developers is kind of doing, build out of the site? Now they will hand over the site to the school construction Authority, and at that point, we'll really get into conversations around the use. Who will use it and when and and so we're waiting for and just before, Covett had? Actually, we were trying to kind of move forward in these conversations with the SCA with the school construction authority, and now we're you know Vancouver hit. So there are some questions around timing, but it should be early. 2021 is the last that we heard around when the developer will hand it over to the sda and then there it will be their authority and so that that's the timing that we have there. I what we want to do kind of now and until then is have conversations with DOE with the SCA with community leaders and really think through the programming. The use all of these really important questions so that it is community led and really thought through about what it would what it looks like who would use it and when- and I think now especially you know as we are in a new Covid-19 world thinking about kind of how that plays into here and what people, what members of the community and what school members think kind of. We should be keeping in mind now. Thank you Elizabeth, one of the, so some of the conversations that members of CB2 have had this summer. It really focuses especially on equity, that every type of decision that is being made every discussion. We have to look at equity and when we cite this type of facility in Brooklyn heights, many are concerned. Will this be mostly students from Brooklyn heights who use this as opposed to students in other schools that might be further away that do not have access to that type of enriched learning environment. Yeah. Thank you for raising that. I absolutely agree. You know, I think, has exposed long- standing racial and economic inequities in our city and has exacerbated them. You know, but these have gone on for a long time. We have the most segregated school district in the country. That is, that does not happen by accident, that happens by decisions, and so there is a lot of work to do around equity. There is a lot of work to do around racial justice in our school system, and you know I'm heart and I think the new, I guess not new anymore, but the Cec 13 President Kamar samuels, has really committed and taken this on as well. I interrupted that, but I think that's an important point like will that entity that lab or a facility will that belong in a sense to district 13, so the district 13 community of school leaders, parents etc can help shape what happens there or is it a general DOE type of entity? Do you know if it'll belong to 13? In a sense, that's I mean that's a good question. I do not want to be presumptive, but the way the conversation that we've had so far was you know, with SCA and with the superintendent when with Cec 13, and so we like, I think, that's where you know these conversations should come from through and with, and so it is kind of focused through the district. Okay, so that the district 13 superintendent is does have input into this, as well as the cec of 13.. When you talked about the DOE, the DOE is this a huge organism, organizational organism and then who owns it in a sense? So, okay, so we know it's district 13., so you know we appreciate the update and you'll. Let us know I'm sure as things proceed, are there any other questions for Elizabeth Adams, and thank you for your time tonight anything else for Elizabeth about this. Okay yeah. I actually have one really good question. I'm curious more specifically what the use of this space will be just a little bit yeah! No! Thank you. That's a great question, so the it's a the goal of it is a science lab. I think a lot of the schools in the area do not have like stem or like tech spaces, and so the original planning was for stem and I believe steam, which is also arts. It's the a in that, but in terms of the specifics of what it could look like and what it would include that is, I think those are. Those are the conversations that we want to hear from people now we want to kind of build that together, so to not kind of pre- impose what would happen in science labs and you vindicated in middle school was that something that was part of the agreement, or is that something that has come up the I bel, I'm not sure if it was in the original agreement, but that what I've how I've come to understand it was it's for multiple middle schools, multiple medical schools, okay, so thank you very much and we will be a continuing conversation, so I want to move on to the before the let's see we have the approval. I think we need to have some approval of minutes. Yes, June 24th minutes was sent to the committee members. Is there any? Are there any corrections or discussion, or can we approve it by consensus and thank you, Miss Thompson manning did a very good job on that. It's appreciated. Oh, thank you. There was something in the minutes that I I was unsure of. I could not print mine out, so I'm trying to read it on my phone, which is not working so anything that I had a question with. What I would do is well let's office board and just take it out, because it was unclear- and I do not know if that person is here to clarify what was said. Okay, that's fair enough, yeah anytime, it's a detail and we were not sure we can. We can rework it, so it is not a gap. So I appreciate your effort on it. It's a job that a lot of people this town, you know it's a job, okay and I did it to do it. But it's not my favorite thing. I'll tell you! It's nobody's favorite thing. We appreciate you. We appreciate meredith, okay, so the minutes are approved by consensus. So we say: okay, thank you! Okay, so we have the statement of district needs and we, I think some of us got an email saying what they were last year and then we can comment on some of these and I, in my understanding some of this has changed like because, as time watches on things change- and sometimes we do not have enough information to really push it and then with Covid-19 and with the severe budget strains. I myself wonder: can we really recommend some of these things? When they're we need to feed people, you know it's. The priorities have changed. So two of the items that our group has discussed for years now is new, a new elementary and a new middle, probably in Pacific park, and we heard during the year of the presentation from the S school construction authority that they were in the pipeline. So just does this group feel comfortable taking those priorities out of our district statement. What would we, what would we put in there as sort of information to indicate that they are taking care of so to speak so that we do not forget about them and we can hold people accountable if things do not move forward and we tip them out? I think that's like a district office question I do not. I do not feel prepared to answer that, but we know that they're being constructed. We had a presentation from SCA and we saw some photos of built the building going up in the Pacific park and I think the elementary school it's near at that Alby Square area Meredith lives near there Meredith do you know what that it's city point? Is that it? The construction of the on of the school on Albe Square, is that where you're at it was x number of floors in a building that was going up yeah, it's still going up. It's still going up, so I think they're in construction, I mean they're in progress. I think it looks nearly complete. I mean they've been working through pandemic, but I mean I can't say that I've heard specifically, I mean we can ask for another update from SCA if we want, but I think so I'd like to know their name and their number like just so that we know they're real. You know like because this stem lab right. It sounds similar, they're putting it inside a private facility. We know nothing about almost done. That's a point well taken. I can ask the district office and Rob might have some of that information or we can get it. So. Yes, I think that's a good point. I just, but I support it, removing from the list, because we have other priorities. Okay, we had another item that called for that schools should get upgrades of technology and science labs, because we've heard you know anecdotally that schools do not have the current technology and equipment that they need to meet the current learning standards that were children. So I found, even though I supported that recommendation, I found it vague. I would rather say we needed tech upgrade right in x building because they have no science lab was something very specific. This was like very general. So what do you all think and should we try to do some research and see even to name one or two schools that really need it? Where you have middle school children learning without a science lab? I think that would be important. This is darth yeah. How would we be able to find out which schools we should target, and will we have enough time to do that right? I agree with you. I think that that's something the district office, the district staff can follow up with the superintendent's office because they all keep spreadsheets of who has what and it would be in their interest as well, and we can also reach out to the cec, because that's a parent group and they have children, they have representatives in each school and I think we can get that information. Remember. We had Ayanna yeah last time right, yeah. She spoke to us, I think, when we were at the y, so that was in the winter, maybe January or February, and I can reach out to her and ask which schools you know, according to their information at two schools, that we could name in our district, that would make better sense yeah. I agree with you agree that would be awesome. Yeah, we'll work on that. I can work on that with the office okay, high school, remember we heard a presentation about high school cafeterias and some of them needed redesigning not just for salad bars and things of that nature, but so that students could eat in more quote civilized way, rather than in these long tables, with those long benches that it's not like a family type of environment. Oh we have this edits and revisions Meredith. This is what I had mentioned to you that this would be great to respond to okay for our notes. So do we still think renovating or upgrading a high school cafeteria to the food court design? Do we want to recommend that, in our document, the presentation that we saw? I think that was at the Brooklyn hospital and they presented it, I'm not sure if that was just a test or if they were actually put it in certain high schools. If I mean, I think it's a good idea, but you know I'm thinking about how things are going nowadays. I do not know who's going to be able to do what and what really is going to be much more important than some of the other things that we need to think about, but I do not think it will hurt to at least make the recommendation, because you want the kids to eat healthier and to eat foods they like and to feel a little bit more of a semi home setting, as opposed to you know, yeah everybody their setting. So I do not see it as a problem. I just you know. If there's anything else, that's more important, then I would not recommend that makes sense. I do not know if you want to add to that or leave it alone, but one of the things I get passionate about food is water. That kids often do not have access to water and in a lot of high school cups, they have to pay. You know a dollar or a dollar. Fifty for one of those plastic, one use disposable bottles, even though kids supposedly should have water bottles, they do not all have them, so they could. Schools could put in something called water jets so that young people could access water for free from like a healthy type of thing, not a fountain where maybe kid's bed is on it or you know like that. So do people think we should put in water jets in terms of Cafeterias water jets are like those soda machines. You see in pizza places where you put a glass, you know underneath a little gizmo and then an amount of water or soda comes down. We're talking about water, well, being them used just for bottles and it'll have to be because you know you have to be careful with bottles. Okay, because sometimes people put their bottles right up to the spout or whatever. So it has to be one that there's no contact between the what you're going to use and the water that's coming out, and I have seen those I think that's what's important because years ago I stopped filling up bottles from water fountains, because people would take their fat their bottle and stick it right on there, and I said, that's it for me I'll just break water. I do not know how these machines look, so I think it depends on how the machine is made and how sanitary it is so that there's no contact from anyone else's bottle or glass or cup. Fair enough. Any other comments on this yeah. This is Alec. I just. I just feel that it makes a lot of sense. What you're saying about this? It feels like it's a little bit more of a priority than the previous one, in that, if kids have to pay a dollar every day to get a bottle of water, that's obviously that's pretty bad, so that free water seems pretty important. So maybe we could make that a separate item rather than putting it together with the renovation of the high school cafeterias so that it could stand on its own, maybe as a priority. I think separating the two had served as waterchat: okay, separate them. Okay, there was an item about remember it's a perennial issue with Brooklyn tech with the trash and they do not have enough dumpsters. They do not have room for the dumpsters. There's rodents they've had all these different inspections, they've, never gotten anywhere with getting a better system for the trash. It's like it's almost like a losing battle. I think it's really important, because there's rodents on the block and the trash situation is pretty awful. I mean I would be fine with continuing the recommendation. What does it say here? Brooklyn tech has over 5,000 students produces more trash than can be handled within the building. So I have a question about this, so it looks like our request is a cap. This is capital right to renovate the building, I'm wondering not the whole building, just the part that would take the thought we'll take trash right. I'm wondering if this is an opportunity, does a larger discussion with people who know things about this topic beyond sanitation of how to reduce waste. How to do this better and different and 21st century? Is there an opportunity to have those discussions and get a plan together that may be renovating a small interior space won't be solving. Unfortunately, the city has gone backwards in terms of trash and that they're no longer collecting, compost like when you take and schools have been teaching young people how to separate out the food and sanitation in some districts has been collecting the food and vegetable scraps for commercial composting, and that reduces the garbage tremendously right. So that's disappointing and I do not think they removed that program. So it's going to be worse correct, so I'm just I do not know, I'm just wondering if our ass should be keeping that conversation alive, because if it has the most trash it says what then anything around produces more than trash. That can be handled, I mean I do not know. I just feel like something has to be done larger than renovating a room, but that's just my two cents. Maybe that's something the district office could have a meeting with someone from the D.O.E facilities. I do not know if that's something that could be brokered, but maybe we could find out about it to get a little bit more information and to push it and maybe there's a group within the school. That's pushing this that we could be connected to. I love that I think that's great, because I'm just concerned that that's not the solution that maybe we came up with the solution, but it's not a really viable one, and maybe that's why it has not been addressed that way: yeah, okay, fair enough and then our favorite, which is dear to our heart, the cornerstone and beacon we need more after school. We need more child care, so I think we should prioritize this higher than some of the others, because it's a tremendous need and the city seems to not have as much money. What is your understanding nick of the money for the after schools and the beacons, and that yeah so obviously full disclosure? I make a living off of this and you're knowledgeable about it. So that's it! Yes, I'm not asking to line my company or my pockets yeah right now. Fortunately, the money for existing contracts for Fy 21 is. There are slight reductions to. I think middle school programs that, like the newer middle school programs, the ones that did not have a summer camp this past summer, that usually get restored every year through fighting with city Hall, did not get restored this year and those programs got school year, cuts as well, but beacons and cornerstones cornerstone. Some cornerstones actually saw an increase in funds this year. I think there's at least an acknowledge that they're definitely food hubs and things so that's kind of where it stands for 21. So I do not see 22 being worse and I do know that ultimately, a lot of the council is supportive of it. A lot of the parents obviously advocate and in normal times quote unquote that advocacy does translate into well increased, necessarily increase, but sustaining, I should say more sustaining. So I have that item in our list and is there a way of strengthening the word, the verbiage so that it well to the maybe to the last point of the vagueness of our request for technology upgrades? Maybe there are some schools, as we speak, to equity issues that do not have one that we'd want to highlight. That would really benefit instead of keeping it vague and or you know with cornerstone any if there were any other. You know niches that were not represented. Okay, so that could be part of my discussion with Ayanna to see if there are schools that really need this that are not funded for it yeah. That would be my recommendation, okay and then all them than in the Cox Cultural and other. I think we had a library item see I can't scroll this up. Can cultural services library services are there about library services? Does everyone see this on their screen? Yes, okay, so should we leave it? Should we change it yeah? I think we just updated it last time, you're right, it seems good to me: okay, yeah. Okay, so is there anything else on the statement of needs that people want to add that maybe have not been listed by our committee? I was thinking of something sorry to be so talkative. Oh, wait! It's fine! I was wondering and it's it is speaking to the current situation, we're in and bringing up maybe some inequity issues, I'm wondering if there's an opportunity for funding for schools. I do not know if it's designating people in sort of a case management role but very specific to technology, access and internet access. It's it really is a utility. I mean I think now it should be considered a utility. It's not a luxury, and you know when we went remote. It really exposed, like other inequities, this vast gap and while DOE found some money and they did a pretty good job. That does not mean that the message gets out that the families actually get the device that the device is sufficient. You know for their needs, so yeah, that's just where my head is at with devices in the hands of our students and internet access in our homes and from an educational perspective. We're talking about the library right now. Is that correct? I think we just said: are there other things? Oh so nick? What you're talking about what additional supplies for students electronic supplies is that what you're talking about so I made that would be part of it, but I I'm wondering if the schools almost need people in the role of making sure families have access to the internet and connecting them to it and like making it happen because handing somebody a device is not enough. You know, and initially the dua handed people devices thinking they had internet and then had to give them ones with hotspots, because they do not. You know and a lot of these families. I know just from experience got the free, maybe three- month, offer or two- month offer a one- month offer and those have run out and they can not afford to have internet, and that means kids can't I mean they really can't engage in their education to the level that you know, children in a middle class household can, and so it speaks to inequity to me. So I do not know if that was clear or rambling, but I do not know how to work it for this. It's just a need. I think. Well, it's access. It's broad. It's broadband! It's getting access to people's homes. I've read that in the homeless, shelters. The kids who live in the homeless shelters do not have access to this. So could you take a stab at drafting like a sentence or two because, as you say, it's more than the device itself like giving out devices like a store, it's helping families connect and it's establishing more broadband or bandwidth or whatever. That is called. Anybody have any input around that any ideas around that before I take a stab at any language, I mean one. It could be looked at as like similar to a model of the Free School lunch program or the school lunch program, so that if you need assistance, there's an application process, potentially where you like, at the worst in the worst case, you'd actually have to submit a bill or and or they just have a flat like rebate per month like 70, or something that, if you, if you apply and are accepted, that you just receive from the from the school system. Oh I'm so glad. I asked that question that to me sounds awesome and has like a direct tie to schools when you compare it to like the lunch program, cool. Thank you yeah. So if you could anybody just give it a stab? You know you can write it to me and tell ya and we'll try to we'll get it into this document. Okay, that was that was really good, because it is it's like food. I mean people absolutely need internet access and the doa sends all these surveys out and all these things and people who do not have access do not have access and are not getting the information so and then their voice. They have no voice on top of all everything else, then absolutely okay, so we're up to the part of the chairperson's report. I'll try to be brief and then Dorothea will lead us in the conversation about the cultural, because we need to always keep an eye on our cultural partners. So I wanted to share that in the executive meeting in July. Instead of doing like little licenses and the usual landmarks and the usual agenda items, we, the whole meeting was devoted to concerns about equity and race and how all this plays out in our district and the most important takeaway for me is that in considering the district needs, we have to look at it through a lens of equity and not just certain projects that you know, we think would be a good idea. So we'll keep that first and foremost- and it was a very it- was a thoughtful meeting to step up. You know with everything that's happening to step away from the usual agenda items and think more deeply. We want to give life to the idea of actions, and not just words, saying this be good of that, but really as we're trying to do pass it out and what actions are needed to get us closer to this, and our chairperson of CB2 is saying that for our September 9th meeting put that in your calendar, September 9th instead of a reg. You know the committees have been meeting on Webex and I think, we're doing a little better job than initially we're getting used to this platform. But he wants to do something called a wellness check. I'm not sure what it'll look like. But again it's not going to be the typical committee reports and I'm not sure what it'll look like. But we want to see that everyone's okay and kind of come together through the Webex platform and kind of see where we go from here. We're not even sure that everyone does the webex or again has access. We have not heard from all of our members, yet we hope everybody as well. So that's what's coming September 9th, okay and then I wanted to share talking about food and free lunch just to let people know in your communities that even people who are not low income, so in other words everyone who had a child in a pub in the public school in this last year will be getting what's called a p pandemic ebt card and some people feel at the 420 and that's significant. I mean even for a working family 420 for each kid come up to a thousand very easily, so some people feel you know. Fortunately they do not need it, but it can't be transferable. So if you talk to people about this, some people are forming mutual aid societies or going to Costco or going to places with like grocery lists for other families. So it's a way of sharing the 420 per child. Also, if people go to green markets, green markets accept this card, like it's like a debit card and then on a personal note, I've you, some of you, might have read about outdoor learning and so on. I've been involved in some advocacy groups to look at schoolyards parks, other places for outdoor learning in adequate weather, because we know that the the disease is more is what the air quality in the buildings is of concern. So if we can keep kids outside as long as possible, that would be a good idea and we saw some movement on the part of the mayor and the chancellor. So I think that's my report, so I will hand this over to Ms Thompson manning for discussion about the cultural, oh hi, everyone I'm I just had to plug in was like it was getting very, hopefully I'll, be able to get through this without running out of you know, whatever one of the things that of places that organizations that we could use to make presentations- and there was a list- I think that was included in one of the emails. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to give the name of the organization a little time about it and discuss it and figure out which ones we think would be more beneficial for us moving forward, probably something that we have not heard from before or something that's. You know a little different that we could get more input as to what's being done to in our community, so the person was base is independent and that's the school. That's the one! That's going up on city point and it's going to be for grades. What is it from kindergarten? Through the second grade, we have had several independent schools, so whether or not we would want to include them again is something that maybe we could discuss. The other. One is very interesting called Brooklyn boat work, something I had not heard about and what it is. It teaches students how to build a boat, and it seems like there's a group of students about 12 students, I'm not sure how they get together, especially now, but anyhow they have blueprints that they have to follow, which means that they really have to get. You know pretty proficient in math and drawing find it now, I'm not sure if it takes place through the student year or Graham. The other one is the Brooklyn public library, which you know we hear about all the time, but there's something in the Brooklyn public library called center for fiction and what it is it seems like if it's going to be workshops or reading groups. Just talking about fiction works that come out. It may be a little bit more involved than that, but I did not go into it that thoroughly. The other is divine ange's angels Wellness center, that is they're reaching young people living in temporary housing group, homes, shelters and detent centers, and their goal is to try to help them develop. Self- confidence, learn how to be entrepreneurs and other things that you know can maybe help them get into a better situation. As things improve in their life or as they, you know, depart from high school another one was past zach Martin I went on, I opened it up and it said family of four following God and it said it was unsecured website. So I did not look into it any further. I'm just letting you know the other last one is teens for food justice, and this is the workshops and I know Betty's going to probably say: oh yeah. We need to do that, so it's the students that put together the gardens so that they can provide food for different schools, and I guess maybe take some home not really sure how exactly how it works. So what we could do is, I could just say the name again and we can just say whether or not we would like to do it or we can just bypass it. How would you like to proceed? Yeah? I think that's a good idea just name each one and we can discuss it or opine about it: yeah, okay basis, independent the new school, coming up any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, recommendations or what my thinking originally when the board office asked me. Do I want them not really they have tuition, something like 50,000 a year. It's not what we really want to deal with, but I know when they started their upper school in Red hook, the community advocated for full scholarships for some of the kids from NYCHA housing and red hook. So I thought that would be the an angle that, if they presented to us, we could say what is your financial aid? How are you out reaching and telling people they could apply and there would be a few needs based slots, but other than that? I'm not particularly interested in a school that costs so much money. Any of the comments go ahead. I support that. Did you support half the presentation? Oh no, I'm sorry supported what Betty said all right. Let's move on to Brooklyn boat works comments. I like that this is Santia Hi, Santia hi. How are you hi, I'm sorry for joining late? I miss you guys, miss you too. That's you too. Oh, I mean my yeah. My opinion is, I think I would like to say what they say, because I did not know they had something like that and I'd like to know how they teach the children, the students, I should say how to get together and pull something off like this and what happens with the finished product, and all of that, so that to me sounds pretty good I'd like to hear about that agreed. I think we should have them, but I would encourage you to lower your expectations as I've already met them. Who was that Nick, okay Nick? How does the group feel is that one we could possibly look at because we do not know how many we can put on, but I just looking at the possibilities that we could maybe have them available. Yes, question: this is Samantha. I have a question. Do you know if this particular group is active right now and what that capacity looks like as far as their activities during copay? Sorry, I could not understand you, I could not. I do not. You said something about whether the group is active yeah, it's doing nothing yeah the way things are going now. Everybody is doing things some kind of way remotely. So I would just you know, I'm not going to make an assumption more than likely if they can not present. If they not show us something, then they would probably tell us that's something that we asked how continuing the program during Covid-19 and I'm quite sure they can. Let us know twice once in response to black lives matter and wants to make all of the offerings fully remote, so you're saying they can change the children boat. Building remotely, I'm not clinic, smiling, I'm not sure it's probably not quite boat building, but I got the impression that they're they've transferred some of their team- building exercises to a remote context, and we also know that rowing people can still do and Covid-19 if you're, apart from people x, number of feet and wear a mask, so I know people that still grow. Actually, the Brooklyn waterfront volunteer, Kayak Hut and a stand is open again. For that reason, oh, let's we'll put that down as something that we would look into the other one is the center for fiction, any thought comments, and just to be really clear about that. The Brooklyn public library and the center for fiction are actually separate entities. The Brooklyn public library wanted to offer specific updates on a few items: the addams and Southside libraries, the Brooklyn heights and Walt Whitman projects. The merger with the Brooklyn historical society and post-, coveted reopening and center for fiction was more of a general introduction to their really amazing. So then we'll talk about the library, then what about updates with the library which we usually have any objections, or how do you feel about that yep in some way they merged with the Brooklyn historic society? So I think we want to understand how that merger works, and you know all right so another so we'll consider right now for consideration would be Brooklyn boatworks and the library just the plain library updates. The next one is the center for fiction and I was not sure exactly what they do, but they just made a comment about. They have writing workshops and reading groups, and I think they just let people know what some of the latest fiction books are available or out for reading any thoughts or comments. They have free programs as well as membership, and they have a facility. That's right. Next to the Mark Morris, they have a bookstore and workshop, some of which cost and some of which you can join on zoom or webex, and they have interesting series. For example, they have about puerto rican authors. They have lbgtQ&Authors, they have a wide range of discussions, so I thought it would be interesting to hear more about it. Okay, anybody, everybody else. Okay, with that, I mean any objections. Okay, so that's a possibility. The ex the next one is divine angels. Wellness Center thoughts, comments, I'm interested, I'm definitely sitting in here. Does anyone know them particularly or have worked with them? No? Okay. We could hear from them. I guess we have so many students that do live in temporary places and how do they get along? What's being done to provide for them, and since our focus is on youth, I think it would be good to hear some of the of the youth in these discontent. These kind of type conditions are being helped yeah. I agree you said Wellness Center and I think that we could use a lot more wellness centers for all of us. Okay, but certainly youth in need, so that'll be that'll, be for consideration and the other one was passed to zach Martin, and I tell you I did not go any further with that. I personally do not feel that it's what I would like to hear from the community for our committee. All of us said it was a family before following God I can offer. I would not go into the website because it said it was unsecured and I you know I can't I can't take that chance. I just left it. I do not know what else they have to say. I did not care that much to find out. I can offer some context on that. One as well. Zach was actually an invited speaker to a different committee and for the life of me I can't remember which one right now, but he was specifically at that committee meeting. He was specifically speaking on the topic of social justice initiatives in the district and the suggestion was made for him to reach out to Betty to this guy I see, but I know he would speak more than that. Just like I said I could not. I did not go on the website to see what else is samantha that little bit of information. I did not want to go through it. Yes, samantha yeah, so also a little context to Mr Zach Martin he's also the founder and CEO of Trellis, which does youth engagement under a you could say, sort of a social justice lens I've worked with them in the past. I do think that I would like to hear from some of the youth, not necessarily from him to see some of the work that they have done around Covid-19 and also they've partnered, with a lot of other partners in neighborhoods, and most of the young people come from NYCHA. So it is something I am interested in. I say that with a little bit of reservation because of the Mr Martin's, you know his presentation of doing other things around social justice, but I would love to hear from the youth if we can get one of them to speak on some of the work that they've been doing and the purpose of what they're doing when they go back to school things of that nature. That would be something of interest, but I'll defer to the rest of the group. Well, let me say that if we choose him that we I mean, if we, if we'd be whatever that would be, that we'd be what we would like to hear and whether or not he could provide that. Oh, I was going to say that, based on what Samantha said that if we decide to have pastor Martin, that we'd be very specific as to what we would like to have presented, and maybe he would like to speak about his views on social justice, but maybe we would probably say that we would want to hear more from the students that he works with. So I'm saying, if we have him, we need to be very specific on what it is. We'd like him to present left yeah that we could actually visit a school that has the Hydroponics lab. So you know we talk about these things, but to actually see it in action and have a student take you around is great, but if we're not visiting a school, it would not be quite as great, but if we were able to it's changed it's at the Urban Assembly School on is it on gates? I think it's on dates, Avenue and it's a remarkable place where kids learn to grow food hydroponically, and then they can take some home yeah. I think, regardless of if we can get in the building. It's probably worth listening to. I have met with them many times. I almost worked with them, but we did not end up working together, but it's it is a remarkable program and it is, I think, very timely as well, and it's empowering people to grow food, sell food share food, make smart decisions about what you buy and how you budget for it. So it's yeah, I think it's just a really great program and the more people who care about it, the better. So let me say this about the teens for food justice. It sounds as if you're saying that if we get an opportunity to visit a site, I'd like to do that as opposed to just having a presentation. Is that what I'm hearing I'd like to hear anyway? But I think this site is quite remarkable. I would not have imagined it. You know just seeing pictures so, but I think we should hear from them and what Nick said he's interacted with them and especially if they can get a young person to be part of that conversation, because then we can see what their experience with the program has meant to them and their family in terms of their food choices yeah, and they may be able to provide some visual some. So I think it would be great. Okay, that's the end. Well, we did not take a vote which I do not think we need to do. It seems as if we have interest in just about everything, but I would say if we start to reach out that, maybe we want to reach out to the divine angels Wellness Center as one of the first of people we'd like to reach out to just because of what's going on now, and it would be, I think, appropriate to do that, and also the Brooklyn boat works regardless, because also we're talking about kids teens, and so I think those two would be- maybe the first ones that we would like to reach out to and then after that, of course, the library, because we do want to know what's going on with the library and in conduct in conjunction with the library, this, the one, the centers for fiction, which could be a two- part thing, the regular library and then a speaker for the center for fiction. I think that may be round two of who we look out for and the last group I'm just putting him in groups, because that's just what I'm doing it does not you know matter how it actually comes out would be only pastor, zach Martin. If we can get him to do what it is, we would like to do and we probably should discuss that and the teens for food justice. I would say what we could. We could either do the teams for food justice next or the basis independent, I'm not sure which one since we can't have. No one really knows. What's going on with the schools right now and we're talking about maybe seeing if they're going to provide full scholarships and everything else. I do not know how much we're going to get we're just going to find out what's going to be happening in you know, Covid-19 what they can do, what they can't do so yeah. I would just dorothy. I would just say we have to find that for everybody. My gut tells me teens for food justice on Gates is operating because they're not going to let all thousands of dollars die. Okay, no people have to take care of the farm. Okay, so that would probably be maybe before base is independent. I'm talking about how we reach out, because if we can't get someone, then we got to reach out to someone else, so I was just grouping them in. You know pairs just a note for scheduling, so I've been taking notes through all of this, I think with the first four that you listed that'll cover September and October, and then scheduling gets kind of tricky for this committee and we also see what's going on just in the world, so yeah another thing. So if we could do it for the next couple of months, at least we'll have something and we'll worry about the end of the year at the end of the year, because we do not really have too many meetings, it's hard for us in November and December anyway, so we may be able to just get one group in around that time. If possible sounds great. Is this? Okay with everyone? Well, actually, sorry yeah one thing to throw into the mix not to throw everyone off after we've already decided. But one thing I had in mind and something I would love to see- is some youth voter engagement organizations come and present before the November elections. One I had in mind is the League of youth voters somewhere in Dumbo in districts. Definitely I know there are a couple other non-, partisan groups that could definitely help to bolster voter turnout in our district. Especially, can you send tell you some of the names of the groups, so she could see what's available or get some information Oscar. I used to work for League of Youth footer, so really very funny. Talking to Oscar is your school opening in person or on the computer this year, four out of five days of the week are going to be online, so you know I mean you get to have your senior year one day a week. Yes, I'm excited for it all the best to you and your senior year yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, so it is yeah. There's nothing else for me to present. Thank you thank you. So that was good to really go through each one. I thank you. So is there any other comments from non- committee members? I'm committing members? Okay, I do not know who some of these people are. Okay, so I think we're ready to adjourn. Some of us have some little follow- up work to do so. I hope everybody continues to be well and we'll see you on zoom on the not on zoom on webex on September 9th, and we wish our young people and our parents in this group good beginning of school. We hope school opens and we hope that everyone stays well. So is there a motion to Adjourn. Do not move 7:48. Okay! Thank you. Second, wait! A second a second okay, so long everyone have a good.",
            "summary": "Brooklyn CB2, is called to order and is being recorded for access on the CB2 youtube archive in accordance with the open meetings law, and it is the practice of CB2 to conduct remote meetings with all committee members.\nLet people know if topics are open for comment by Committee, Members, Board members or the and or the general public, and if you have questions outside of the public comment time, you can type your questions into the chat and we will try to address them.\nI know people will say because yeah, okay, sorry, I need oh you're, Muted I do not have any documents open yet to have the list of everyone's name, because I just I should do that.\nCore, Group, Maddie Fox will present her organization and those of you who have been attending our committee meeting know that district 15 has been involved in a discussion about potentially rezoning parts of district 15.\nIn March, we gathered together a diverse group of parents from acrosss the impacted school zones to form a research team, a community- based research team and we started meeting And we have been working and meeting ever since through the pandemic through thick and thin.\nProcesses, we've been having we've been conducting community conversations with community members, which kind of like interviews, we've been conducting, and we've been spending time at food distribution lines and at open streets events and building our knowledge around a community member's experience of Schools elementary schools and getting kind of the access to schools, perspectives on that process and that experience and then also getting community members, dreams and ideas and vision for what could be or what equity.\nIf people want to share that out in different ways via you know, whatever distribution, list- Or, you know social, media or whatever- And, so we've been getting a robust response, so far, but we are and we're really looking forward to hearing from and as many community members as possible, who might be impacted by this potential rezone Information and the site.\nThis online survey alone, we're really spending a lot of time out in community and talking with people who are very connected to local community organizers and community groups and community based organizations in building a knowledge and vision for what could be acrosss.\nI mean people can go back But Just to clarify this project is a collaboration between the community, the you know, Brooklyn college and the Nyu Metro Center and the Department of Education, so that you know part of the idea is that the Department of Education and the Office of District planning are in some way accountable to the recommendations that we will present at the end of this process.\nYou know we're meeting and in conversation with the Office of District planning many times a week, and you can imagine that question comes up a lot in our meetings with them from the par team and then in all kinds of ways and the this.\nNext we have a representative from the New York City of Civilian Complaint Review Board, that I understand we'll be talking about Youth Advisory, Miss, Sonia, Hi. And I'm, able to show everyone like the slides and people are able to access the information.\nThey serve as ambassadors in their own communities for sharing information about the agency and how they're able to file a complaint, and these are individuals who are passionate about criminal justice issues and also improving police community relations in 2019.\nA lot of the things that we're doing now is virtual, but still like showing up into those meetings, letting you know what their rights are.\nSo the applications for the Youth Advisory Council is actually going to go, live in the fall The Youth Advisory Council has regular regularly scheduled meetings where they'll come together and over the course of the year, like one of the things that they did was specifically work on the public service announcement that had to do with informing you about the ccrv and last year hosting the symposium on youth police community relations.\nAnd I hate that there has to be something called the top, which is literally almost everything against what you guys are trying to do, because it is about telling black and brown young men in particular like careful, because you know when your rights upsets them and just causes bad things to happen.\nI know that there has been a lot of obviously interactions with police and young people during protests and demonstrations, from whatever information that you can provide.\nWe I had a specific question, as we remember when the building that was the Brooklyn heights, public library was sold, and there was the library controversy one of the things the outcomes of that was the council number 11 brokered and an agreement to have a stem lab with some type of educational entity in the new building and as the building is coming closer to completion.\nWe were trying to kind of move forward in these conversations with the SCA with the school construction authority, and now we're you know: And, then there it will be their authority and And until then is have conversations with DOE with the SCA with community leaders and really think through the programming.\nThink now, especially you know, as we are in a new Covid-19 world thinking about kind of how that plays into here and what people, what members of the community and what school members think kind.\nThink that's an important point like will that entity that lab or a facility will that belong in a sense to district 13, so The district 13 community of school, leaders, parents etc can help shape?\nI could not print mine, out, so I'm trying to read it on my phone, which is not working so anything that I had a question: Well, let's office board and just take it out, because it was unclear- It's, a job that a lot of people this town.\nI think that's like a district office question I do not.\nI mean they've been working through pandemic, But I mean I, can't say that I've heard specifically, I mean we can ask for another update from SCA if we want, but I, think so I'd like to know their name and their number like It sounds similar , they're putting it inside a private facility.\nRemember we heard a presentation about high school cafeterias and some of them needed redesigning not just for salad bars and things of that nature, but so that students could eat in more quote civilized way, rather than in these long tables, with those long benches that it's not like a family type of environment.\nI think that was at the Brooklyn hospital I do not know who's going to be able to do what and what really is going to be much more important than some of the other things that we need to think about, but I do not think it will hurt to at least make the recommendation, because you want the kids to eat healthier and to eat foods they like and to feel a little bit more of a semi home setting, as opposed to you, know, There's anything else, that's more important, then I would not recommend that makes sense.\nSchools could put in something called water jets so that young people could access water for free from like a healthy type of thing, not a fountain where maybe kid's bed is on it.\nThe city has gone backwards in terms of trash and that they're no longer collecting, compost like when you take and schools have been teaching young people how to separate out the food and sanitation in some districts has been collecting the food and vegetable scraps for commercial composting, and that reduces the garbage tremendously right.\nSo is there anything else on the statement of needs that people want to add that maybe have not been listed by our committee?\nThat would be part of it, but I I'm wondering if the schools almost need people in the role of making sure families have access to the internet and connecting them to it and like making it happen because handing somebody a device is not enough.\nThat's what's coming September 9th, And, then I wanted to share talking about food and free lunch just to let people know in your communities that even people who are not low income, so in other words, everyone who had a child in a pub in the public school in this last year will be getting what's called a p pandemic ebt card and some people feel at the 420 I mean even for a working family 420 for each kid come up to a thousand very easily, so some people feel you know.\nWe need to do that, so it's the students that put together the gardens so that they can provide food for different schools, and I guess maybe take some home Basis, independent, the new school, coming up any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, recommendations, or what my thinking originally when the board office asked me.\nLet's move on to Brooklyn boat Do. You know if this particular group is active right now and what that capacity looks like as far as their activities during copay?\nI. Do think that I would like to hear from some of the youth, not necessarily from him to see some of the work that they have done around Covid-19 and also they've partnered, with a lot of other partners in neighborhoods, and most of the young people come from NYCHA.\nI say that with a little bit of reservation because of the Mr Martin's, you know his presentation of doing other things around social justice, but I would love to hear from the youth if we can get one of them to speak on some of the work that they've been doing and the purpose of what they're doing when they go back to school.\nYou know we talk about these things, but to actually see it in action and have a student take you around is great, but if we're not visiting a school, it would not be quite as great, but if we were able to it's changed, I think it's on dates, Avenue And it's a remarkable place where kids learn to grow food hydroponically, And then they can take some home."
