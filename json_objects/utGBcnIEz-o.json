            "fullTranscript": ">>> good morning, everyone. i hope those of our brothers and sisters who celebrated yom kippur yesterday a good day. we wish them happy holiday. we have with us today dr. howard zucker. health commissioner of the state of no special counsel to me. melissa derosa, secretary to the governor. happy birthday to melissa. how do you celebrate a birthday in public service? you do a press conference with me. i want to go through some facts. then i'll outline a strategy that we're going to begin deploying. we have begun. i haven't articulated yet. today's day, 113. state-wide infection rate. we have been doing a lot more testing and a lot of targeted testing. i want to make sure you understand the data. when you look across the state, western new york, 1.3%. that's not great. but -- that is better than it has some days. we still have a caution flag in western new york. finger lakes, 0.9%. north country, 0.2%. capital region, 0.9%. long island, 1.2. new york city, 1.3. but, the findings are really within those numbers. okay? hudson valley, 2%. we did more testing than any state in the nation than any country on the globe per capita. why? because when you have that level of data, you can really identify what's going on geographically across the states. that's why we do all the testing. and you can identify hot spots very quickly. and then you can target those hot spots. that's -- we have seen hot spots before. if you remember, we had some factories upstate that had clusters. we have had gatherings, certain gatherings that developed a cluster. but this is probably the largest cluster that we have addressed before. and the clusters are brooklyn, orange, rockland. and that's where we're seeing clusters. the activity in the cluster is very different than what's going on in the rest of the state. so if you look at the top 20 zip codes and to put zip codes in context, there are 1,740 in the state of new york. when you're talking about 20 zip codes, you're talking about 20 out of 1,740 zip codes. very targeted areas. we have zip codes where you have 18% positivity. 10% positivity. 8% positivity. 7% positivity. orange, rockland, kings. a couple in queens. and then you go back to kings, basically. so, you see a much different story happening in these clusters. that's actually good news in some ways. because you have effectively identified the genesis of the potential growth of the virus. you now, once you have this information, aggressively target these clusters. okay? these are embers that are starting to catch fire in dry grass. send all the fire-fighting equipment and personnel to those embers and stamp out the embers right away. that's -- what this data does. local governments need -- we have shared all this data with the local governments. they're the first line of defense. they must respond. they have been very uneven across the state, as you know. and i have expressed my frustration with candor as the moment requires. they have to respond. and they have to respond directly. we have also asked public schools, private schools in the area. we have made testing, rapid testing equipment available to them. rapid test does a test in 15 minutes. so you can find a student, a teacher, who is infected. get them out of the school right away. and the rapid tests allow you to do a number quickly. we have also made them available to local governments. attack these clusters. that's what it is. attacking the clusters. testing and compliance. testing and compliance. and the discipline and the capacity and the competence to do it. the government these days has to be competent. this is not about rhetoric and giving speeches and slogans. do your job. you have a job. do it. competent government must do compliance and enforcement. why? a cluster today can be community spread tomorrow. a cluster today can be community spread tomorrow. i don't know who first said that. but if nobody claims authorship, i'm going to claim it. cluster today is community spread tomorrow. they have to do their job today. i'm going to be meeting with religious leaders of the orthodox community. and -- local officials. if you look at those clusters and you look at those zip codes, you will see there's an overlap with large orthodox jewish communities. and, that is a fact. so i will be directly meeting with them. to talk about it. this is a concern for their community, public health concern for their community. it's also a public health concern for surrounding communities. and i have said from day one, these public health rules apply to every religion. atheists. it applies to every citizen of the state of new york. period. i happen to be roman catholic. i had to cancel the st. patrick's day parade, which, in many ways, is a -- a holiday that's near and dear to the heart of many catholics. it's public health comes first. so i'll be meeting with the leaders of the orthodox community and the local officials in those areas to make sure we're all on the same page. but, compliance and enforcement is key. i can't say it any more bluntly than that. mask-wearing is a state law. it's a law. it's not -- it would be nice if you could. i really think you should. every health official says it's a good idea. it's a sign of respect. it's also a law. okay? so, yes, health officials say it. yes, it's a sign of respect. yes, it's good citizenship. it's also a law. i don't care what your political opinion is, at one point. i don't care what your religious opinion is. mask-wearing is a law. well, i'm politically opposed to masks. i'm religiously opposed. i'm ideologically opposed to masks. i'm opposed to masks because they're a bad fashion statement. i don't care. it's a law. and the local governments are supposed to be enforcing the law. and they haven't been, many of them. and then we're shocked that there's a cluster. don't be shocked. this is a very clear period of time. you're actions determine your consequences. that's it. you enforce the mask ordinance, you have a lower infection rate. if you don't enforce the ordinance, you'll have a hire infection rate. those are the facts. we know the facts. enforcement is key. now, we have targeted many more tests and testing resources into those clusters. as i said this is a fire-fighting drill for us. so, we have really two sets of numbers in some ways today. we have the overall testing numbers. and then we have this effort that's been in the clusters where we have done a disproportionate accelerated testing schedule, right? the 20 hot spot zip codes if you average the 20, they're at 5%. some of them were up to 18%. but if you average all 20, they're about 5%. that is five times the normal state rate. okay? that's why they are hot spot clusters. state-wide positivity is about 1 -- 1.1%. and -- those hot spots are five times what the state-wide positivity is. if you take all those tests from those hot spots, which, again, are disproportionate, because we have poured so many tests to those hot spots -- and add them into the overall state number. then we would be at 1.3 with the overseam. but, we're 1.1. 1.1 is 1% is basically the lowest infection rate in the nation, right? and where do you want to be as state? ideally, you want go the lowest infection rate in the nation. that's 1%. these hot spots are five times that number. number of deaths are two. they're in our thoughts and prayers. number of hospitalizations, 571. icu, 147. injoon tubation, 61. Covid-19 has been very disruptive on almost every level in new york city. it's been disruptive to how people work, how people live, how people travel. question of children going back to school, yes, they are, no, they are not, yes, they are. people trying to make plans. the level of disruption has been extraordinary. that's not a new york city phenomenon alone. that's all across the state. that's all across the nation. that's all across the world, right? the disruption is in and of itself a force to be acknowledged and recognized. you're going to have a lot of PTSD from this period in time. we're already seeing substance abuse up, mental health issues up. this was a traumatic period. don't underestimate it. and you're going to see the consequences of that trauma for months, if not years, in many different ways. so, acknowledge that. the disruption causes anxiety. yes. many people in new york city are anxious. yes. i talk to them all day long. i'm a Queens boy. that's my orientation. born and bred. not an import to the state. we love the imports. some move to new york. move to new york. but i'm the original species. i get it. i get the anxiety. but -- we have to keep it in focus. and we have to address it. and remember, at the end of the day, we are new yorkers. we have gone through difficult times before. we have gone through 9/11. you can knock us down. but we get up, we dust ourselves off, and we come back stronger than ever. that is the definition of being a new yorker. that is the culture of this place. this is the difficult place. it's a difficult place to make it here. the competition is intense. the energy is intense. but, have we gone through tough times? sure. and we come back better. again. and again. and again. and we will again. in the meantime, what's the treatment for anxiety? what pill can i take? i can't distribute pills. i was going to issue -- but he would stop me if i went to do it. here's my treatment for anxiety. facts, not rumors. not hearsay, not anecdotes. logic. and action. facts, logical facts, correct facts, and action. this is about doing things. accomplishing. doing things that are responsive to the problems you have identified. this is no time for incompetence. no time for apathy. no time for indecision. it is a time for action. Covid-19 is real. you don't do the testing, you don't do the compliance, you don't have the hospital beds, more people die. that's the reality of this situation. you make a mistake on testing, you open schools and you're not ready, people get sick. that's the reality. that causes me anxiety. it should! it should. constructive anxiety, not negative anxiety. but the anxiety is the body's way of saying there's possible danger. by the way, there's possible danger. and there has been disruption. but -- deal with it factually, logically, take action. people have seen the new york state government acting all through this. every day i said here's the problem. deep breath. problem can give you anxiety. burks here's the solution. and this is what we're going to do. where the action actually alleviates the anxiety because people know intelligent action is being taken. and that makes them calmer. when they are calmer and they have confidence, then they actually start to think more logically. all right? we're announcing the new york city stabilization and recovery program. stabilization and recovery. stabilization means all this disruption, all the tumult, first, stabilize the situation and thenlet talk about long-term recovery. on the stabilization, let's talk about schools. many, many new york city school parents are anxious. the principals' union came out, increased the anxiety, because the principals' union said the schools are not ready to reopen. that increased parents' anxiety. why? because they're principals. when you're called to the principal's office, that's real. when a principal's office calls a parent, i have to talk to you about johnny. that's real. they're principals. i respect the opinion. i respect the statement from the union. i knew and i know that they did not do that easily or cavalierly. i take their opinion very strongly. at the same time, you have michael mullgrew, and the teachers' union saying schools are safe to reopen. why would the teachers' union be saying the schools are safe? why would michael mulgrew want to endanger his teachers if the schools are unsafe? you have the mayor saying the schools are safe. who is right? who's wrong? who knows? who knows? new york city did a plan. they say we'll do x number of tests and -- we will do this -- we have these poliies in place. we will know tomorrow by the data. the schools must report to the state the data. they're doing testing. the numbers will tell you the facts. and once you have the facts, you can operate logically. if the schools are not safe, i'm not going to allow them to operate. period. for me, it's simple. would i send my child to that school tomorrow knowing the facts i know? that's -- that's my decision point. we'll get the facts. and we will know. and we'll operate logically. and i say to every parent in the city of new york, if those schools are not safe, i will not allow them to operate. period. how do we justify the principals' union versus the teachers' union versus the mayor? we get the facts. we get the facts. everybody has a theory. nobody's been here before. this has never been done before. who's right? who's wrong? who knows? you'll know when you have the facts. the state can close down any school in the state of new york. that gentleman right there with the very attractive blue tie signs a letter, closes down any school in the state. new york city, buffalo, long island. you have my word as a parent, as a citizen, as your representative, if a school is not safe, i will not allow it to operate. take a deep breath. and we're going to have the facts. they'll either report the testing data. or by the way they won't report the testing data and if they don't, they already violated their own plan that they were supposed to be taking tests. if you don't get data, that's the answer. they can't get the data. we also all agree, if you can operate the schools safely, we want children back in school. that's the best -- by every expert. if you can operate safely, you want the students back in school. the question is, can you operate safely? we will know by the facts. okay? that's schools. crime. new york is very concerned about crime. why? they should be. that's a fact. it's not illogical. they should be. shootings with victims are up over 100%. that's why new yorkers are concerned about crime. the percent of shooting victims, 86% black and brown. 86% black and brown. that's why bronx, queens, brooklyn, staten island, that's why they're concerned. the crime problem in new york city is real. i don't believe in denial as a life option. if you deny a problem, you will never solve it. you deny a substance abuse problem, you'll never solve it. you deny an addiction, you'll never solve it. the government is the same way. first instinct is to deny or you're wrong, there is no crime problem. yeah. new yorkers are not -- there's a crime problem. okay. then, we have to address it. this is not a new york city phenomenon either. the tension post george floyd's murder between police and the community has never been higher. it's all across the nation. everybody knows that. but, it has to be resolved. and it's not going to resolve itself on its own. the police have a position. the community has a position. you see these repeated flare-ups, another video, another video, another video, cop versus protester. protester versus cop. it's over and over and over the same thing. well, i think it's going to get better. it's going to change when the weather changes. it's going to be gone by easter. oh, it's nothing different than it's always been. sound familiar? that was trump on covid. the denial. denial doesn't work. didn't work with covid. it's not going to work with crime. it's real issue. and it's also an opportunity. redesign your public safety functions. why is the answer to every 911 call a person with a gun? why? why is the only answer to a 911 call an arrest? how about if it's a substance abuse issue? a mental health issue? why is your response from a public safety point of view always a gun? you know the expression, when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything look like a nail. when all you have is a gun and a badge and the ability to arrest, that is your only solution to that issue. a more multifaceted public safety function that has mental health response, substance abuse response, a domestic violence response, and then, for violent crime, where someone's life is at risk, yes, a person with a gun and badge who is equipped to arrest. that has to be redesigned. new york city has 35,000 people, $10 billion budget doing public safety. what is the best way to spend $10 billion? of the 35,000 people, how many should be mental health people? how many should be substance abuse people? good question. they have to be answered. who is going to answer them? we say in the state, each community has to answer them because they're going to be a little different. new york city is different than buffalo. is different than the adirondacks. is different than suffolk county. you design the approach that works for you. pu people in the room, public safety, community representatives, redesign your public safety plan. it can be fun. it can be exciting, right? nothing is static in life. we're redesigning our education system now. remote learning. who ever heard of remote learning a few months ago? we're redesigning education and medicine. telemedicine. who ever heard of that? we're redesigning medicine. we have to redesign our public safety function. that's good news. but paralysis in this dysfunctional situation is bad news. people are dying. that's a fact. it has to be resolved. politically, it's a quagmire for local politicians to step into. because it controversial. you know what politicians like to do? avoid controversy. that's what politicians like to do. i'm a little exceptional that way. i'm wired to do it differently. to get the local officials to do this, i said, let's do this, if you don't have a redesigned public safety function by next april, you're not getting funding in the budget. you know what that means? you're bankrupt. they can't survive without state funding. so you have to have it done by april. but -- i said, you should start doing it now. because April is around the corner. and this is not going to be a fast process. it's not an easy process. so you should start doing it now. 146 jurisdictions in new york state are already doing it. not just new york city. it's every community with a police department. 146 started for next april. you know what jurisdiction didn't start? new york city. well, we redesigned in the past. the past is the past. that's why they call it the past. today it's not working. it's not working today. i don't care what you did in the past. it's not working. today. and today you have to come to the table and make it work. because this situation is not sustainable. people will die. and when you're talking about new york city's stabilization, i'm nervous about schools. i'm nervous about crime. i'm nervous about homelessness. i'm nervous about cleanliness. now you're really ervous. and now you have a population that is really destabilized. there's a cumulative effect to the situations. that night of looting really shook people up. what i'm saying is, we're resolving that. we're going to resolve this issue also. the mayor can lead the collaborative. if he doesn't want to lead it, the head of the council can lead it. by the way, the council has to pass the plan. has to be passed by the council. the head of the council can do it. public advocate can do it. controller can do it. but somebody's got to do it. or, say, i don't want to do it. and then i'll find somebody to do it. maybe it's better that it's not a political official. but somebody has to convene and lead the effort to redesign the public safety function. people in new york city, the leaders in new york city say -- well, here's how i think it should be done. this is what i think public safety should look like. great! do it. i need somebody to do it. government is about action and progress. you want to be a progressive, make progress. that's how fdr defined the word progressive. everybody talks about it like it's a new work. zach fink. i'm a progressive. i'm a progressive. new, new progressive. no. zach fink did not make up the word progressive. nobody made up the word progressive one year ago, two years ago, three years. you know who was the progressive? fdr. al smith. big campaign poster in my room in albany. original. fdr for progressive government. i brought in zach fink. i said, you think you came up with progressive? i want to show you a poster. you know what he said, fdr stole it from him. how can that be? but that's a different conversation. third is the economy. in terms of stabilizing new york. and here's to the economy in a nutshell. we have tremendous losses because of covid. we're not liable for them. i'm not accepting liability. i'm not accepting the premise that new york state or new york city should pay. we didn't do anything wrong. the federal government should pay. they were wrong. it's the federal government that allowed us to be ambushed by covid. the federal government missed that the virus went from china to europe. and they missed it for three months. and the federal government missed people getting on planes in Europe and coming into new york. it was the federal government that does the border control at the airport. the department of homeland security was supposed to be protectioning the border. you know how they wanted to build the wall in mexico? protect the country. and many in meantime, Covid-19 is walking in the door at jfk while you're spending billions keeping us safe from mexicans, we were invaded by europeans coming into the country with covid. we had no notice. the other states had several months' notice. we had no notice. the federal government is liable. them. not us. you know when you're at a dinner table and they put down the check you're there with a number of people. if you're not liable for the check, don't touch it. once you pick up the check and look at it, now you're liable. how is new york state, new york city going to solve the deficit? we're not. it's donald trump's deficit. he has to fix it. rupert murdoch says new york city, new york state should pay. yeah, because he is a donald trump supporter. no, mr. murdoch. donald trump pays. or you could pay. but new york city, new york stay's not going to pay. either congress -- congress could come up with the package. i spoke to speaker pelosi yesterday. she's talking to white house about a relief package. or in november, donald trump could lose, joe biden could win. joe biden will do a state and local relief package. or -- the senate could become democratic. senator schumer become the senate leader. he will do a state and local package. he will make sure new york is covered in the state and local package? why? because he's a great senator. why else? because he's a new york senator and he has to come home to run. so, those are very real possibilities. congress passes or joe biden wins or the senate goes democratic. in any of those cases, it's a federal problem. worst case scenario from new york's point of view, donald trump wins. and the senate stays republican. then what happens? yes, then they try to kill us. which is what they've been doing from day one. then we have all bad options. to close a $50 billion deficit, which would be historic, you would have to do all of the above, praise taxes. raise income taxes. number one. you would have to cut the budget and cut expenses. and you would have to borrow. you would have to do all three. none of them positive for the economy. it would be a question of how much damage you do for how long. but you can't close -- it becomes math. you can't close $50 billion without tax increases, millionaires' tax, billionaires' tax, wealth tax, cutting expenses dramatically, and borrowing. if we did that, you're looking at a bad spell for new york city and new york state and i'm not going there. we would have to do a financial controlled board for any locality that borrows. i would never sign a bill that allows borrowing for a locality in this environment without a financial control board. all the financial decisions couldn't be political. which is the political process now makes these budget decisions. i'm going to give this much to this uniyor but i'll lay off this union. these would have to be financial decisions done by a financial control board. but -- i'm not -- i'm not picking up the check because i don't assume or accept any liability. it's all washington. and if trump wins again and the senate republican wins, yes. we have a terrible economic forecast. cleanliness, i'm getting a lot of complaints from new york city about the cleanliness of the city. the garbage piling up. in a -- that adds to crime, economy, and now garbage piling up, literally. people saying the -- there's an odiferous environment because of the garbage piling up. i don't know what's going on in new york city. if they can't do it, i have offered to send in the national guard to come help pick up the garbage. state can bring in trucks, personnel, and clean up the city. i think that would be important is the public health pandemic. cleanliness matters. you know, we made millions of gallons of hand sanitizer. cleanliness matters. so, if the new york city department of sanitation and resources can't do it for one reason or another, i can deploy the national guard. we'll come in. i understand there's a higher level because people are staying at home. but, in this environment, we don't need people complaining about cleanliness of the city. on the issue of homeless, it's getting old. the -- there are homeless encampments, homeless people living on side walks, under scaffolding. there's no reason for it. we're better than that. i worked on the homeless issue since i've been in my 20s on every level. ran a not for profit. managed it in the federal government. did a plan for the nation and the federal government. homeless people should be offered safe shelters with services. many of the cities and the states closed their shelters during covid. it's time to reopen those shelters. you can open schools, you can open bars, you can open restaurants, you can open gyms, you can open flexible art studios, you can open a shelter. you have to open it with precautions. but open the shelters. get homeless people off the street. keep them safe. get them a test. get them treatment. this is eminently doable. should be doable. should have been done a long time ago. we had homeless on subways for years. remember? and we had the same circular conversation. never made sense to let people sleep on the subways. put themselves in danger. what kind of society says, oh, yes, i respect you. you can sleep on the subway all night. that's not respect. we fix that problem. and we can fix this problem. homelessness is now a -- public health concern. if there's a homeless person on the corner who is sick with Covid-19 and people are walking past that person, now it's a public health concern for that homeless person and also for all new yorkers who are walking past that person. so, there's no reason for it. we opened the shelters. there are 680 shelters across new york state. new york city. 130 shelters for adults. 32% are empty. 27 at less than full capacity. we're putting out guidance on how to operate a safe shelter. but, you know, it's common sense. we have done this on a number of facilities now. and, we know how to do it. on the long-term recovery, i'm focused first on the stabilization of new york. the long-term recovery we have to find out how many of these changes we're seeing, how many of these disruptive patterns are permanent. you have people working from home. people who don't want to go in to the office. people who are living in other places. is that short term or is that long term? when do they come back? or have they just readjusted their lifestyle so they're saying, i'm not going back to the office five times a week? and i'm not having my employees come back. i like it better. i can give up the office space. they work from home. or some hybrid. we don't know. we have to assess that and i also think it -- there are some factors that will -- still be calibrated in that equation. and one of them is when you get a vaccine. if -- if a vaccine is safe and ready by tend of this year, that's one situation. if it's ready by the beginning of next year. but if you start to say spring, summer. and i mean the full vaccine. you have to have it, it has to be safe, and you have to administer it. to 19 million people. how do you do that and how long does it take you to do that? and -- that safe question is already complicated. because there's a sense among the american people that the vaccine process has been politicized. why? because the vaccine process has been politicized. because the president says he told the FDA and thinks the FDA are being political on their approval process. the president accuses the FDA of being political. you wonder why the american people don't trust the vaccine? because the president says the FDA is political. now what happens? the FDA approves it, the president says it's political. the president overrides the fda. for sure it's political. i never saw a doctor's certificate on the wall when i visited president trump. rob came with me. did you see one? >> no. >> no. so he's not a doctor. people have to feel it's safe. we want to make sure we can tell new yorkers it's safe. and we want to have a distribution plan. we're putting together our own group, once the FDA says it's safe, we'll have a new york group of doctors and some of the best doctors around the world who will review what FDA did so i'll be able to say to new yorkers, it is safe. at this rate, you could have a vaccine -- poll, that says half the american people wouldn't take the vaccine right now. because they don't believe it's safe. i want to be able to say to new yorkers, it is safe. take it. and i'm going to have the best distribution because ideally, we want to be the first covid-safe state in the nation. what's our goal? new york is the best. highest goal. first state to immunize, vaccinate everybody. that's our goal. you set the bar high. yeah. new york. you set the bar as high as you can. h is the group that's going to review a vaccine once the FDA says it's safe. if this group reviews the FDA data and protocols and efficacy and they say it's safe, i will say to the people of new york, it's safe. we're going to administer it. we should take it. again, we want to have the best vaccination program in the nation. be the first covid-free state. think of all the lives you'll save if you're the first covid-free state. think of the business opportunities if you're the first covid-free state. i said this last week and president trump tweeted new york is now going to be the last on the list to receive vaccinations. you know what that is? it's called a threat. it's called a threat. if you have your own state review, i'm not giving you the vaccine. that's what he's saying. it's a threat. it's also unethical. it's also illegal. he can't use government power to stop distribution of a vaccine to new yorkers because he is personally upset. but that's what he said. and what i say is, don't threaten new york. it doesn't work. i know you're mad at us. i know we rejected you. i know you feel that you are a subject of scorn and a joke in new york when you were here. i know the tabloids mocked you. i know the people in state overwhelmingly voted against you. but, be bigger. be better. remember the oath you took. and try not to threaten and try not to do anything criminal. that's my advice. the threats don't work. we know how to handle bullies in new york. we have come across our lot. because we are new york, tough, smart, united, disciplined, and loving. questions? >> during the reopening -- specific neighborhoods. as of tomorrow, you want to go with indoor dining as well. is there a potential to delay that? and by extension, the rest of the city. the rest of the city is not ready for indoor dining given that we're seeing this uptick? >> we have, at this point, it's a cluster problem. a cluster problem is caused by lack of compliance. that's how the cluster problem starts. from lack of compliance. why was there a lack of compliance? because the local governments failed to do its compliance job. oh, those are harsh words. yeah, well, it's a harsh situation that was created. people get sick, people die. and you sat right there and i said, 150 times, local government is not doing compliance. on the bars, restaurants, we sent in the state police. i said i don't have state police to do all the compliance state-wide. that's how the cluster happened. let's be honest. there were pictures of people violating compliance and not wearing masks. we all saw them. they all circulated. lack of compliance, now you have a cluster. if you don't now control and take the cluster, you have community spread. we're not there yet. that's why i want people to wake up. and attack the cluster. compliance first. i don't believe we're at the point of rolling back anything. if the local governments do not do the compliance and attack the clusters, you will be there in the short term future. once you're up to 18%, 20% positive, just think of the o exponential equation of that spread as we sit here. right? day before we had infection rates up to 30% in some of these clusters. 1 out of 3 people is infected. all those infected people are out there meeting and talking and going to schools, temples, churches. the numbers ballooned. so, now, there's a real issue to deal with. but we're not there yet on closing. this could be held to clusters. if the local governments respond and respond in a way they haven't done up until now. right? what they have done has not worked. and that's why there's a cluster. and look. i get in some areas, there's religious sensitivity. let's be honest. i get it. but -- i have no problem and i said from day one, i love and respect the jewish community. the orthodox community. the catholic community. the muslim community. these laws apply to everyone. and these laws are going to be enforced against everyone. because i love you. because i love you. that's why i'm enforcing these laws. because i love you. when we see the infection rate at 20% in some zip codes, that means people are going to die. and because i love you, i want to protect you. and when i didn't do my compliance. that wasn't loving. that wasn't loving. it was weak. it was scared. but it wasn't loving. >> you're meeting with orthodox leaders, is that meeting in person in are you going to Brooklyn or rockland county or doing it virtually? >> i'm doing it virtually because i want to do the entire community. you have orthodox leaders all across the state.",
