            "fullTranscript": "Just one second, we're waiting for Graham, just texted me that he's joining 20 now, once he's joined, we're going to get started all righty we're going to go ahead and get started. Graham just joined. My name is Curtis Sean, I'm the chair of Manhattan community 412 public safety committee today is November 4th and we're going to call our meeting to order. It is officially 708.. So thank you all for joining who are watching on facebook live. We have several representatives from the precincts we'll be speaking on the numbers in our community this month and we're also joined by our community members. We'll start by having you introduce yourself, I'm beginning with our assistant chair who just stepped away from our computer and please enjoy, and after danielle, please feel free to just jump in if you're on the committee. Sorry, I was getting water, I'm Danielle, I'm the assistant chair, I'm Gabriel, Estrella hi, I'm Yo safe, I'm having some video trouble, hopefully I'll, get it on later. Hi, I'm Graham, Cero, Public member. I too will be putting my video on shortly hi, I'm Mariella Graham Alrighty. Thank you very much. We are also joined this evening by Charles Captain bellow from the 33rd precinct, as well as lieutenant Simioli from the 34th precinct. I believe that's all we have as representatives. Oh excuse me, oc caminer who's. Also a committee member just joined as well, so I'm going to write her name down and we will get started right now. So without further ado, we usually start our committee meetings with an update from our precincts, followed by our agenda items. We have two agenda items this evening. One is a discussion of the furious act which is related to speed cameras in areas where there have been record number of complaints for speed racing. We'll be discussing that I invited the the author of that legislation, Senator Brad Hoyland, to comment and share what that legislation is and for us to give feedback and come up with whatever we want to share with him as a community board as and also as a community members, and then we will be also discussing this evening. The enforcement of parking tickets and Danielle Assistant Chair Daniel General was going to take the lead and share what that is all about. We'll have a discussion on it, so without further ado, we will turn it over first to the 33rd precinct, also for the precinct leaders, if you're here. If you want to stick around and hear about the legislation, furious Act, I think it'll be great to get your perspectives and dispute here and understand what's happening and how this, how the state is responding to the excess number of complaints for speed racing. So, if you're able to stick around, please feel free to do so, we're going to turn it over to captain Bellow first to give us our updates good afternoon, everyone good evening, actually so for the 28 day, preview we've been doing pretty well when it comes to the actual of violence. I want to say the last two or three months we had a string of shootings that were taking place in the vicinity of 175 audubon 175 and saint nick, where we took a homicide back on September, 2nd September 3rd. That case is still an active investigation. We have very very good leads on who we believe was the perpetrator in that incident, but we just we still trying to establish probable cause with the district attorney's office, what I've been doing ever since we've been flooding the area of 173 to 175 and Audubon avenue, usually on weekends. Anybody that lives in the immediate area you'll see our car either posted on 172 and sing, nick 173 in Audubon 175 in Audubon and 175 and St Nicholas. So that's kind of like what we've been doing. It's been effective the last couple of weeks. We have not taken any shootings or shots fire in the vicinity, we're currently up one shooting seven versus six year to date, but one of the shootings that we've taken this year. We do not believe it happened in the 3- 3. We believe it happened in Jersey, but we're still carrying in the books. So if you look at our comps that she like is being experienced throughout the city, we're up in burglaries significantly we're up in glas attributed to you know, keys and ignition. We also have an active pattern that autocrime is currently investigating. I think there's over 100 vehicles city- wide the last time that I was able to confer with them, which was a couple of months ago. So that's one of the things that we've been trying to do, trying to educate people. We've been posting it on the our social media page just to make sure that you do not leave your keys or your key fob in the ignition, because once you leave it even if you step in for a quick second, somebody is jumping in your vehicle and taking it. There was an individual that we arrested three or four times for glas. Just on the 28th day period alone, we locked him up one day. He was out the next day, so those are some of the things that we've been battling. We have several burglary patterns, specifically on 176 and 177 window entries. We've been looking at our burglary recidivists just to see if there's anybody out that has some type of deficiency, either warrant he's on parole or probation and just to see if they're hitting us again. So those are some of the things that we've been implementing. We have a list of like about 15 individuals that have attributed or have contributed to 15 to 30 of our overall burglaries, there's an individual that he targets, the 3- 3 and the 3- 4. That he's been arrested at least 20 times for burglaries this year alone and we're currently seeking him for two burglaries in the 3- 3 and a robbery in the 3- 3. So he's wanting at least three crimes in the 3- 3 and those are the ones that we could account for. So that's the overview for the 28 day. I know a lot of people have been complaining regarding three one ones: fourth place and things of that nature. We've done several operations when it comes to fourth place. We've made apprehensions in regards to them. We've been focusing in the areas where we've been taking the most violence just to make that connection, and that linkage and for the 28th day we have at least we've taken at least three guns off the street, so those are some of the things that we've been doing in the 3- 3. Okay, thank you very much. I'm actually sharing the comp stat 2.0 screen right now. Can you all see my screen? Yes, okay, perfect! Thank you. So thank you very much. Captain bellow. I have a few questions. We'll turn it over to our committee to post their questions, followed by anyone from the community to post questions for the three. My question is mention the window. Break- Ins is that residential or commercial- I know, there's been a there were patterns last month with commercial break- ins. Is this commercial or residential? These are residential, primarily focused on sector charlie, which is the Northern east end of the command, the commercial pattern that we had established. We had, we actually made an apprehension and we were able to drop six to seven numbers on that individual ever since we have not really been seeing a considerable spike in commercial burgs, so we believe that he was the one that was hitting us, especially on Riverside avenue ever since he was apprehended he's currently still in. We have not taken a hit in that area, so these commercials that I was referring to were more residential in three out of the four incidents. There was actually a resident inside the premise in one of the incidents. The description might possibly match one of our patent perps from back in August that hit us about eight times, so I was able to do a conference with our squad they're going to try to create, which is a six- pack, which is a photo array. Hopefully the person will be able to I d, if it's in fact them. If it's not him, then we're going to still. We try to see if we could establish any any leads. The difficulty when it comes to these window entrances is that normally they enter through firescape, it's very difficult for us to be able to get video. So unless we have a detailed description that we could possibly match with a previous burglary visit and the person will be able to identify is very difficult for us to be able to determine who in fact is committing these burglaries. Okay, all right- and my second question and final question for me- is you mentioned forest place. There's been a lot of in my neighborhood I've seen a lot. A lot of my neighbors have been complaining about people with forced plates, because they're also connected to other forms of you know what they perceive as crime. How do community members report? What is the process of enforcing the? What are you doing right now to enforce these people? Who have these paper plates? That we know are not legal right. So what we do is we do a conference with especially new Jersey, because the majority of the temporary place that you see is they come from New Jersey. The state police will be able to confirm whether the plane is legit or not. If it's not legit, we'll be able to arrest the individual charge and refer forgery and most of the time we'll issue them a disappearance ticket, it is it's a little sensitive, it's a sensitive subject, the majority of the people that get these paper plates. The reason why they get them is because they can not afford to register their vehicle. So sometimes we do conduct a car, stop, we see an individual with a forged plate and they have no criminal record, so you know we'll arrest them and we could charge them for it. You know, but it sometimes the individual is doing it because they can not afford it, not necessarily because they're in essence trying to commit or crime or people that are utilizing to commit a crime. So I try to tell my guys to defer differentiate between somebody. That's using a forged plate to then commit a robbery and get away with it, as opposed to somebody that does not have the means, because of Covid-19 or the pandemic, to be able to register their vehicle. So, but what we have been doing, especially with our traffic offices, is we've been doing a lot of initiative and operations with the fourth place, making apprehensions we're also utilizing it for locations that are a problematic drug prone location narcotics because they utilize these. They utilize vehicles to stash their products, and normally they do not register them. They just put forth plates. So whenever we see them, especially in a drug spot, seven five and autobahn I'll make sure that my guys get it towed and nine out of ten will recover contraband from inside the car. So, okay, all right! Well, thank you very much. Captain bellow I'm going to open it up to my committee members who may have questions. Let's see, I do okay, just please dive in, because I can't for some reason I can't disagree with this. So please I have one Danielle Captain Bella! Thank you so much for the presentation and I just want to say I really appreciate you instructing your officers to sort of try to distinguish between individuals that you know have these plates because of an inability to pay versus somebody who's. You know trying to be deceitful and that's actually related to the resolution that I'm going to just discuss later, which is related to parking, but one question I had for you was related to guns. You mentioned a couple of guns were taken off the street and it think of this flyer that I saw that was encouraging people to donate to the precincts. I do not know if that was coming from the 33rd or the 34th, but I wanted to know if you had any updates on that gun donation program and then related to that. I wanted to know what is being done to protect people who are bringing guns to the precincts, in other words, to ensure that they're not stopped. You know, while they're on the way to the precinct right, so those are two different programs. There is a program that an individual if they're willing to give a weapon to the New York City Police department. What we do is we give them a distinguished number if they're on their way to the precinct and they do get stopped for whatever reason they'll just provide that number to the officer and Thou. Let the officer know that he's in the process of surrendering that weapon in terms of the gun back, I know the Da's office spoke about it briefly, the last community Council meeting that we had, I believe they were able to get about 38 guns off the street. But besides that, I do not really have much information in regards to it, and also I just added that was that was a they were delivering them to East Harlem appreciate East Harlem, not necessarily our community. So I'm not sure if there's a way for us to get any information on who would have contributed, in particular guns from our area. It was east Harlem, though the gun buyback program right, it did not yeah. What was that yeah? I'm here? Oh, I think you got cut off. You know I was going to say that it was not something a program that covered the 3- 3. I believe it was a program in Manhattan north, but definitely it was in the 3- 3 precinct. So I'm not sure I do not even know if information is provided, people just go there surrender their weapons, they do not give any pedigree information residents name or things of that nature. They get the gift card and they're on the way so yeah we do not have any data on if anybody from the three or three four were one of the individuals that surrendered their firearms. Okay. Thirty-. Third thought about initiating this program, or is that something that has to come from the NYPD at large that actually comes from is in collaboration with the NYPD in the district attorney's office? So it's not really done by individual commands. Okay got it. Thank you, you're welcome. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions from our community members for captain bellow? If not we're going to move on to our community members, we have a question from Cheryl Miller, hey good evening. Okay, so hi captain bello, I wanted to ask about decibel calibrators. Do the patrol cars have those in their cars and are they trained to use them or do they need to be trained to use them, because this noise going up and down broadway all night long is like ridiculous. I mean these cars that, like I do not know what kind of speakers they got in those cars, but it literally sounds like an earthquake in my apartment, and this is during the day and at night I was hearing it earlier and I want to know about that. Also. I understand that it's police policy not to chase dirt bikes, also zipping up and down broadway. So what is the remedy then to catch these bikes and issue? Summons is if you know, because I understand that the bikes themselves are not illegal, but it's the way they been operated. That is illegal, like speeding running through a red light running up on sidewalks and that nature. So what then, is the policy to catch these dirt bikes? If you can not take them? So to answer your first question, we do have officers that are trained in Lidar and things of that nature. Primarily, we try to give that training to our traffic safety officers because they're, the ones that generate the majority of our traffic enforcement. So what they do is if they do hear one of these mufflers. Sometimes it sounds like gunshots. They'll do conduct a stop and then they'll issue the summons when it comes to the dirt bikes. Obviously, one of the policies that we have in the 3- 3 and I'm pretty sure we're city- wide. We do not try to engage mostly these dirt bikes are either stolen or they're. On register, when we try to stop them, they'll just take off our fear is somebody is going to get hurt. What I instruct my cops is to record them on body, one camera we'll be able to kind of like identify. Hopefully, who are the individuals operating we'll, prepare a complaint report and we'll charge them with reckless my reckless driving reckless endangerment, depending on how many violations we observe them? Sometimes, if there's a large enough group we'll notify aviation will track them to see if they stash the motorcycles or the dirt bikes at any particular location. If we do get that location that address we'll be able to confer with the district attorney's office to see if they're willing to give us a search warrant, what we try to do is we try to get the bike? If we, if we're able to remove the bike, it makes it easier, but if not because they take off like I said, we try to record it through body phone camera, we'll generate a complaint report and then we'll will let the squad be able to establish I d and make an apprehension in the future. We've been successful at it, there was an individual that we arrested three times we charge them with records endangerment. Over the weekend. We actually made an apprehension of one individual that was operating a dirt bike. We were able to confiscate two, the other party took off and we were not able to catch them, but our policy is to either try to follow them. I'm Incognito, hopefully they'll be able to pull at some gas station and once they're off the bike, try to make the rest of the apprehension. If they take off, we do not chase we'll get the bike with Archer it either, as forfeiture determined, true owner ninety-, nine percent of the time, because the bike is stolen, they do not come to the prison to try to recover it. Okay, what are your recommendations? What are your recommendations? Thank you for answering my questions. Thank you, yes, and thank you for the question cheryl. What do you recommend community members do if we see large packs of these bikes feeding through certain areas? What are what are your suggestions is, there is just say three. One call is that a call to you what do you? What do you suggest yeah, I mean usually what I advise them is to call 9- 1- 1. What the policy that we have in Manhattan is to notify the duty captain when the officer responds to these type of jobs. What we've been seeing in the past is that they travel in packs and they'll go throughout the whole borough and sometimes they'll go lacrosse. Boroughs they'll come from the Bronx into Manhattan from Manhattan into the Bronx. Sometimes they come in robberies and things of that nature or we'll end up getting some type of violent act. So what I advise the community is to call 9- 1- 1, but if they know specifically where they're stashing it or whether they're parking it like I've, gotten information from community residents in the vicinity of 160 and for Washington do not let me know whether they're parking these dirt bikes and what I'll do is I'll do an operation. If they have the fourth place, I make sure that they're towed or if they're stolen, I make sure that they're towed, and it makes it easier for us because they do not have the bikes that they could utilize. Okay. Thank you very much for the update we're going to move on to our representative from the 34th Precinct lieutenant Simioli hello good evening. So I'm going to start with the 28 day period: crime, complaints for the 28-day period. We have unfortunately, two homicides that occurred in the confines of 34th Precinct. Now for robbery we have 16 total complaints in the 28-day period, which is a 15 drop from the same time. Period of last year, felonious assaults down 33 16 this year versus 24 of last year. Just like captain bellows spoke earlier, burglaries and Grand Larceny autos are up. We have the same issue that he has. Our burglary complaints are 17 complaints for the 28 day period versus 8 of last year, leading to 112 percent increase our grand Larceny autos are 380 percent increase, that's 24 this 28 day period versus five of last year and for grand larcenies. That's just complaints where the items are in excess of one thousand dollars. We are actually down 15:40 this period versus 47 the last period now with the Grand Larceny autos a lot of times that I know, captain Bellow spoke on it already. It's these. The technology is supposed to make things better in this case, it's making it more difficult for us. A lot of these individuals have vehicles that have pushed to start and they have the key fob in their pocket. They'll hop out of the car and they'll go order, food or go talk to somebody leave the car unlocked thinking that nobody could take the car because they have a key fob in their possession, but they're incorrect. These vehicles are only equipped that once the car started with key pop, you could drive it without the key fob, at least until the gas runs out and a lot of time. That's really what is happening so to combat that the 34th precinct officers have been instructed to make sure that, while they're out there in these, the from the majority of the locations are occurring on Saint, Nicholas, Avenue and indictment. So they're to go out there if they see vehicles that are running unattended there to see if the vehicle is unlocked, then after at that point wait for an owner of the vehicle. If the vehicle is double parked, the vehicle will be issued, a double parking summons once the owner or whoever's operating the vehicle returns to the location. The officers are then issue a what we call sea summons as a criminal court summons regarding the relieving unattended vehicles running okay. Thank you very much. I did not know that about the key Fob issue. That makes sense that it also explains why it's so much easier to just do a couple of days. All right so are there. I do not have any questions for the three fourth this month. Are there any questions from our committee members for Threeport? Please speak now or you can raise your head or post your comment or question in the Chat box. Danielle. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you so much for the presentation. I was just wondering if you have any updates on those two homicides. Well, regarding the homicides right now we have a person of interest, but this person has still not yet been apprehended. There are two separate individuals that they're not connected at this point and then also I mentioned earlier- that I have a resolution that I'm going to discuss relating to ticketing and parking. But I just wanted to ask you, given that they're all of these people double parking, presumably because there is not parking in the vicinity when they're going to to the stores. Have you thought at all about not like our? Is it the policy that everybody will necessarily be ticketed, or do you sort of try to do something like what captain bella mentioned with the paper plates like? If someone is, do the ticket agents automatically give tickets or are they trying to avoid giving tickets? If they see that somebody is double parked, because they're just running into a store and they've left their car on? Well, if somebody's double parked and they leave the vehicle unattended and run into a store with the vehicle running, do we run into that same problem again of the vehicles being stolen? So if using your example, if somebody were to leave their car double parked running on Saint Nicholas Avenue run inside to the store, real, quick leave, their vehicle running and my officers happen to come across. It he's going to be issued two summonses, one for leaving the unattended vehicle running and unlocked unattended vehicle running and then the summons for the double parking got it. Okay. Thank you. No problem, hi! This is Mariella. I have a question. I think the person from the 33rd precinct had mentioned how given some incident, there was increased police presence, and so I'm wondering the two homicides that we're talking about. Are these the ones that were on post correct? So I'm wondering? Is there increased police presence in that area? Since I think those two were less than a block apart yeah we have a dedicated vehicle, that's face. We have face- to-, face relief, so there's a vehicle that stays in that location that vicinity between on post Avenue between 207Th Street and 204Th Street. I believe it is and that their main priority is to stay in that location. It is a face- to- face relief, meaning that if the next shift comes in the previous shift can not leave until they have their officers until they have their relief auto at the location. So it's never unintended. Okay, thank you. No problem, curtis! I have one more question. I do not know if anybody else has questions, but does anybody else have questions yeah? I have a quick question, sure wait. Curtis does anybody else have questions? Yes, you muted. I think it's on YouTube, oh shoot. I just forgot my question dang. Actually I want to correct myself regarding something I stated earlier on October 10th. We took the homicide in front of 105 post Avenue. There actually was a arrest made in that October 10th, correct. Okay, thank you for the update, all right. Danielle. Do you? Have you remembered your question? If I remember it I'll bring it again? Sorry, you do not have the age to be excused, please all right cool. So I mean I I'm not sure it's captain below, but Bernard has a question for captain bellow, but I do have a question based on something we discussed last month. As we did, we wanted to know how many decibel readers you all had at the precincts. So if you have that information, could you share that with us now like how many of these devices do you actually have in your possession is available to your outside? I refer my question by the way. Okay, do you have an answer to that for the 30 I'm lieutenant yeah? Normally we have about two or three, it's just a matter of if they're operational or not so usually that's what they give every command about two or three per and normally what we have is we post them in the cars that are utilized by the traffic safety officers, got it okay and that I guess that would be, and that would just be rotating throughout the day with between officers and cars right, yeah, affirmative, based on whoever is trained or not, okay got it so there's a separate training. Do you know how many people are trained? I will have to get back to you with that information, because it always changes. It expires every so often cool. Do we have an answer for the 34, or is it just generally two to three per person? It is like the captain stated two to three per precinct. The training is given very infrequently and I would have to actually look up and see how many officers are trained as well. Okay, thank you very much for that answer. Danielle. You have you have your question and then we'll go to bernard right after you danielle. Yes, so it was your understanding that unmarked cars were now prohibited. Is that accurate, because I saw an unmarked car pull somebody over on Dikeman and Broadway the other day? So I was just wondering if you could provide an update on that, not that I'm, I have not been told that unmarked cars are prohibited on officers. Working crime enforcement in plain clothes at the moment is misprohibited, so officers in uniform are allowed to be in unmarked vehicles. Oh it's just plain clothes officers are oh okay. They were wearing, they were wearing their uniforms. Okay, thank you. Okay, no problem. All right, bernard hi, captain bell how you doing I have a ques. Actually, I kind of changed. My question is: it: are decimal meters actually necessary to to enforce loudspeakers that are out on the street or extremely loud loudspeakers in cars? Or is it just simply the mere presence of the loudspeaker on the street being used without a permit yeah? Normally we just utilize them for actual vehicles. If there's a speaker, someone calls 311911 normally what my policy is we'll tell them to turn it down. I know exactly what happens once the cops leave. They just raise it and then, if we do come back, especially if I'm working, we try to confiscate the speakers or the reproductive device. So that's normally our policy, but we do not really need a decibel reader in order for us to be able to issue some for us to be able to take enforcement or issue a summons for like a speaker or things of that nature, we actually confiscated a speaker on 172 and Saint Nicholas. I want to say about two weeks ago: that's one of our problematic location. Knockover related. We got a. We got a tip of information that there might be an individual, possibly in possession of a firearm. We responded, we saw him, he had a loud speaker that he was blasting music. We were able to bring him back to the station house confiscate his speaker and show him a summons, so it is not necessarily required or necessary when it comes to our speakers, but primarily when it comes to vehicles, we do utilize it. Okay, thank you because there's been a misconception about that about decibel leaders being necessary for speakers just out on the sidewalk and stuff, and that's it thanks. Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your presentation and your updates. This month. We look forward to having you back next month. We do not have anyone from Fdny or District attorney's office this month we're going to go to our next agenda item. I believe we have our guest Senator Brad Hoyman as well as Senator Robert Jackson. Here we're going to be talking about the furious act, which is a piece of legislation currently in Albany that would help mitigate some of the issues we've had over the in over the past summer with racing in our community. So I wanted to provide an opportunity for them to share just what this legislation is and to give us. You know update on where it is where it stands, and maybe we can, if there's a way for us to provide any advice on how to make it stronger, and we can do that as well, so Senator. Thank you very much for joining. Please go ahead and dive right in. Thank you. Thank you so much curtis for inviting me to speak here tonight and it's good to see my colleague Senator Jackson. We both got reelected just yesterday, so we're freshly minted new term senators right R.J. So very happy about that, and I know everyone's heart is in their throat as we wait to see what the results of the federal elections are. But but you have at least at this point two senators who know they were elected on the line. You know throughout Manhattan we've seen and heard the number of cars that are speeding, racing drag racing whatever you want to call it three thrill seekers essentially and it's putting people's lives at risk. It's making our streets less safe for pedestrians and cyclists, and you know it's keeping us up late at night. I know my daughter, nine years old, wakes up when she hears when she hears the roar of those engines- and you know dangerous drag racing- has was a problem even before the pandemic for some of our neighborhoods throughout Manhattan, and you know for years, but it's definitely gotten worse because of the lack of cars and the sense of kind of freedom. I guess that has created, and so just to give you one fact about the issue from March 20th to September 10th of last year there were five times fewer. The number of complaints made about these types of racing. What a total of 1057 complaints were made to 3- 1- 1 about drag racing during that period of time this year. So that's a five- fold increase, so something's definitely going on, and I think we need to address it. So I introduced, along with Senator Jackson, a bill that we're calling the furious act, which stands for fighting underground racing and our streets act, the very tortured acronym. But, of course, we all know the film fast and furious, so it's a it's a takeoff on that, and so what it does is under current New York state law. The city's automated speed cameras are only allowed to be operated between 6, A.M and 10 P.M on weekdays. The bill that Senator, Jackson and I have introduced would allow them to be operated overnight and on weekends in areas that the city has identified as hot spots for street racing, and we actually in the bill, seek specific input from community boards through a public hearing, and so the goal is pretty simple: it's going to make it easier to catch these speeding. Drivers who you know are often racing late at night and on the weekends, with no cameras to enforce or track them down, and we also think it's going to bring you know: law enforcement somewhat out of the picture and just make this an automated ticket. So we do not have to get into the issues around policing that have troubled so many of our communities. The other thing it's going to do it's going to change New, York law, to make it easier to hold drivers accountable for violations of our laws against what are called speed contests currently to be in violation of a law that we have on the books, which prohibits speed contests. You have to have been shown to have pre- planned, a racecourse, believe it or not. I'm not sure what that means. That's what it says in the statute, but you really have to have thought out what that course is going to look like, rather than just you know, spur of the moment. I'm going to drag race you down the west side highway, which we think is happening more often, so you know, we know that speed, cameras, work and that data shows that when you get more speed, speeding, tickets, there's a reduction in drivers, you know that are speeding and thanks to a new city law, that's going into effect in February drivers that repeatedly receive speed, camera or red light. Camera violations are going to have to take a safety course or have their vehicle impounded. So just wanted to say thanks to Senator Jackson I'll turn it over to him, but there is a companion bill sponsored by Senator Grenardis, along with Senator Jackson, that's going to require mufflers and exhaust systems to limit noise to 95 decibels for motorcycles and 60 decibels for other motor vehicles. We think that should be called the furious act and the fast act so we'll have both so Senator Grenada's bill will be called the fast act. Ours will be called the furious, so we can have the fast and furious act, but that's an important bill to it's going to also raise the penalties for not having proper equipment on motor vehicles from 150 bucks to a thousand dollars and require police vehicles in the state to be equipped with decibel readers to really crack down on this noisy and flagrant violations of of our of our acquired enjoyment. Great Senator Jackson Well Brent. Let me thank you for coming all the way up: yeah Long subway man to Community, Board, 12 and, as you know, community board 12 runs from 155Th Street and all the way up to the end of Manhattan, and unfortunately, we have the reputation, as has the most noise complaints of the 3- 1- 1 in the city of New York. But you know quite frankly, we're trying to quiet it down. So people can sleep, people do not jump out of their bed. People do not hear the walls of shaking when the music is so loud and even you know, complaints of you're talking about drag race and they're, doing doughnuts in the street in the middle of the street round and round smoking- and you know I was saying to myself. If you look at all of these commercials about the new cars they are, you know just the commercials itself to buy a new car. You see them driving real fast, which you know, people think that that's what they need to do in your city, one of the most crowded places in you know the United States and the bottom line is it's 25 miles per hour and the city speed limit and up in Inwood, it's 20 miles per hour and up in Washington Heights is 20 miles per hour, and so, when you're coming into the neighborhood, you see the sign that says 20 miles per hour, speed limit, but I just think that people that are driving speeding- I mean they even speed. One block from you know from where, from Broadway to post Avenue just that little maybe 400,500 feet they're speeding because they want to be seen, and so, if they want to be seen, let's see them getting a ticket, 150 or 500 dollars. I'm telling you, I received a red light camera ticket on 196Th, Street right near the school, and I said, wait a minute. This broadway, the entrance to the school, is not on Broadway it's around the corner, but one day I was running late for a meeting and I was doing you know ten mile eleven miles over the street limit and I got a ticket fifty dollars forgiving me believe me, you know I do not have money to give away, so we just have to drive a little slower and I have not gotten a ticket since, but I say to you even with I'm watching so many of the scooters, the motorcycles, the delivery people with the with the with the the bikes that have the battery they're, going on sidewalk they're, going up and down the wrong street. I mean it's like crazy and you have to watch your kids if you're walking in the street before you cross over and if you're driving. You have to make sure that you look because if you do not look they're coming right up on this, the right side or the left side and it can cause an accident. So I just think that we need to be able to get people back into sync with the laws and regulations that we have as far as usage and as you know, all of you should know that if you have a bicycle right and you're riding your bike, you have to obey the same laws as a car. Does. Oh, but obviously a 99, in my opinion, do not do that, but it's important that we crank clamp down and that's what this is going to do. One of the things that I said to my staff that I want to, if necessary, pass a law brad, because someone said the rebel bikes can go up to about 30 something miles per hour, but the speed limit in New York City is 25 miles an hour. In my opinion, they should not exceed the 2500 and those rebel bikes are not allowed on the highways. So why should they go 30 32 33 miles per hour when the speed limit in New York City is 25 and those you see so many of them running around without helmets on still, even though they say that before they take off they're supposed to take a picture with the helmet on, but so we just need to clamp down on all of this eating loud music, excessive driving, going every which way in which, basically it it's like the okay corral. In some respect, I think I think that we will have the support of our colleagues in the state, Senate and the assembly. I want to know what assembly member or Senator in New York City is not going to support this bill, they'd be in big trouble. Let me tell you that, so I just think that we need to move it when it comes up there. You and I and our staff need to go to every one of them and get them to sign on, and then we go to the speaker and the majority leader. Let's pass this bill, I'm sure that governor Cuomo will sign it into law. So, thank you for coming all the way up. You did not write your background. Thank you, Senator. Thank you Curtis. Yes, thank you both for joining the public Safety committee and giving us an update on that legislation. I think is really important. We'll take a few questions. If you have time sure I my initial one of my initial concerns, I think you've answered the question already was. I was concerned about the the placement of these cameras across our community without much input from the community board. You know I've been dealing with this issue. All summer. People come to my committee sharing their concerns. I want to make sure that the community board will have a seat at the table and helping to give advice on where these cameras should be, and I think you could answer that question by saying the legislation does call for a hearing on by the Community board. Is that accurate? That's correct? Okay, great so that answers my question there, and my second question is what about what about the issue of those with fake plates is not you can't give a ticket to those who have fake plates paper plates? So is there any discussion on how we can you know include language to maybe solve that issue at the same time, yeah or someone says in the comments or no plates. You know that is a that is a technical challenge that I know that we have, generally speaking with speed, cameras and easy pass and other types of infractions. You know that's a very severe penalty, so I'm not sure how common it is, but it is a good point that we need greater enforcement around people who are disguising their plates and trying to evade speed cameras and other types of camera enforcement yep. Thank you all right. Thank you. Those are all my questions. I'm going to turn over to my committee members. I see two hands if you are from the community and you have questions or comments, please make yourself known in the Chat box. I will acknowledge you we'll start with my assistant. Chair Danielle Joe. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, thank you both so much for the presentation, so I just want to say I understand that this is a response to all of the 311 complaints and sort of a way to address the inability of the police officers to go after people who were speeding, but I have some concerns which I just wanted to raise. Personally, I do not love the idea of speed cameras. I think I'm opposed to them unless they're in school areas or areas where they're are known, drag racing. So I understand that the goal is to put these in places where there's been drag racing, but they just feel very paternalistic to me the idea of just having a camera flash when you're driving, potentially you know five or ten miles over the speed limit, feels paternalistic and I think Senator Jackson I mean even you've got a ticket. So I think that just shows the ease in which it's possible for just an average person to go over the speed limit, and you know those cameras do not distinguish between someone who's going like 10 miles over the speed limit versus 50 miles over the speed limit, and so I think that's a concern for me and also you know you made a comment about post and that's just a neighborhood street, and I so I guess this is sort of to Curtis's point about. You know having our input because I just am worried about you know these cameras just being sort of all over the entire neighborhood, from Post to the West side, highway to fort Washington to everywhere, and then before we know it. There are cameras everywhere and we already have I mean- and I understand you know: we've had some shootings and some issues in the neighborhood, so there are some police towers as a result of that. But you know I just feel like for me as a public health professional. I just I'm always trying to consider the happy medium between you know: paternalism and public safety and so yeah. I think those are just sort some of my yeah. No, if I could yeah so Danielle. I hear you on that. So this does not create any new speed cameras. This only utilizes speed cameras that are currently in place in school zones and that's the only cameras that we'd be using here, but what's so amazing about school zone, speed Cameras is that they are in existence, but they're turned off during non- school hours and they can extend, though you know close to a mile beyond the school zone. So we would be using existing school zone cameras at the suggestion of local community boards and allow them to be turned on during off hours to try to catch some of these racers, so no new cameras would be created. That makes I appreciate that comment, but I guess like to that point. I would still I feel like it still both the question of you know: why extend the camera that was meant to be used during school hours? It seems like it's not being used for its intended purpose. But again I acknowledge the issue at hand here with noise and drag racing and people's people not being able to sleep but yeah. I think it just raises that question for me of using something for a use that it was not initially intended to be used for it, and you know I like to think of it too daniel that you know again we're substituting technology or in some respects is uneven enforcement against people who may be racing, you know, and when you bring you know, the thing about the thing about Cameras is that you know they're pretty they're, pretty fair, you know nobody gets. Nobody gets a ticket simply their age or what they look like, or you know for you know for another reason that you know we may find repugnant so that that's the other thing that I think is kind of you know. Well, while we have to consider the number- and I totally agree with you on that- we do not want to. We do not want to have cameras, you know throughout our lives like some places. I do not know Singapore, but you know that's why we'd be relying on the advice of the local community boards and the existing speed cameras around schools. Okay, one thing I want to just add before we move on is well. I have a question too yeah, John Graham you go ahead and Grab go first. Fma just make one last one, please Danielle, please go forth in the graham criminal last point I was just going to make and sorry I do not want to take up too much time, but the last one I'll just make is you know I hear what you're saying on like how they are. They do not discriminate, but somebody that has a warrant or you know, was recently incarcerated and then now has a bunch of unpaid speed, speeding, tickets. You know they. Those are the sorts of folks that are going to be more likely to be incarcerated upon. You know, being stopped, and so again sorry I just want to. I just want to make sure I raise all of so. For me, the most important thing for my constituents is their safety and security, and when you have speeders speeding that could endanger other people, then it needs to stop okay, all right. Thank you, yeah. I agree with that Robert I I was wondering what the education and awareness campaign is going to be around this. If there is going to be one because you know, I think also to Danielle's point, you know the more people are aware. I guess the less likely they are to you know, run afoul of this. You know, and you know be caught and you know get in trouble. So I was wondering like what you know are there going to be signs? Are there going to be any kind of publicity around it, or is that something that community boards could really work on yeah Graham? I think you're right, I think we'd have to you know, make certain that there was appropriate signage in areas just like there is now around school camera zone. You know school camera zones and yeah, let's be real, not those cameras are not turned on all the time. Part of the part of the you know benefit of speed cameras is that they serve as an incredible disincentive, just thinking that they might be turned on, and so drivers are more careful when they drive near in a school zone. So that'd be the same thinking around these. The use of these types of cameras so you'd want people to know that they are there through signage, okay, and I also think that, from a social media point of view, you could do some psa's public service announcements, because I was going to say that those that look to the speed racing, whatever medium they're looking at, we should do a PSA and we can do it in our local papers and social media. That's really worth it, because the people that are speeding and drag racing. I do not think that in their 60s 70s and 80s or 50s, the younger ones that were so. Let's be, you know that's what we're going to have to do we're going to do some psas on social media. Okay. Thank you very much. We're going to go to our final question from our committee member. We have, I think, a few questions from our from the community as well after oc. Okay, thank you. I have just a few points. I think it's an excellent idea. I think that you're right that down people and people understand that. I know that there is a camera they're more careful and we have to think about those that getting killed those that get injured by fast drivers and Danielle. One last point: actually the fine is related to how fast you drove. So if you, if the speed limit is 25 and you drove 100, the fine is reflect that way. It's not just a flat fine for everyone, regardless of how much you sped. Thank you, okay, Ariella yeah. I just wanted to ask my support for this. I think that it is what I really liked. Is that piece about it being an automated ticket? I think we've had a lot of time speaking with the precincts about this, and I think it's a it's a good way to use technology and to make it a clear- cut issue which I think it is. I think speeding, whether even in addition to the drag racing, is an issue, and I think that one people understand that it is that cut and dry that it will serve as the as the deterrent that I think it could also be so that it's not only punitive but also it determines. So. Thank you. Thank you all right. We're going to start our to our local community members who are joining us they're, not on the committee, but they are they are. They are special guests this evening, so we're going to start with bernard, followed by Nancy. Did I see your hand? Okay, so Bernard, followed by cheryl and we'll take it from there so Bernard please come forth hi thanks, Robert Jackson yeah. I voted for you actually. So it's great to see you here anyway, I was going to ask about well. First I was going to. I was going to say that if you really advertise where exactly those speed cameras are, are not you going to basically be telling these guys to just speed somewhere else where there are no cameras, is not the idea that they could be anywhere. Would not that be more? You know, you know I'm going to tell people that we're not going to tell the everybody where the speed cameras are you're, not supposed to be speeding period exactly and obviously, if it's in the school zone you're clearly not supposed to be speeding in a school zone. So I do not think that we're going to tell them, but everyone has to obey the law. The law says 25 miles per hour and the speed zone, I think, is 20 miles per hour. So that's just it. We all have to slow down. I mean Marielle said it's a deterrent. Well, let me tell you for me: it's a deterrent when I got that 50 ticket in the mail and I had to pay- and the other question I was going to say asked was that in I think in in Paris and in London they've been adding acoustic cameras, so, in other words, there's an attachment. They can actually add to the speed cameras which can detect decibels and detect loud cars and we'll take a shot of the cam we'll take a picture just as if the guy was speeding and let's record the decibel level. So I was wondering if you guys had looked into that at all. No, that's a really great idea boy! I had not had you robert no yeah can I can put. I can put the link to like one of the cameras into the chat. You know, I guess you can copy it and look at it. You know whenever you want that. That's why we're all here? That's what success yeah! Okay, so that I guess that's I mean the other thing is that is that the speed cameras won't do anything for the illegal off- road bikes that have no plates at all on them. But do they get pictures of the people actually riding the bikes to when they winning speed, or are they only getting a picture of like? Are they aimed just down and where the license plate would be now it takes a picture of the car, so it would take a picture of the bike right yeah, but the bottom line is, you know, there's so many bikes and they're going against the traffic and not towards the traffic that, but you know, every picture is good because who knows it may be a red bike, and so and the police say: oh wait a minute. This is what we've seen this on the camera. So you know we just have to try to do the best we can under the circumstances that we're in yeah. I agree all right, I'm going to put this Lincoln. Thank you very much. Thank you great. Thank you very much bernard. I think we have gabriella. Thank you know it takes me a little bit to find the new meal, so I just want to say thank you so much to both Senator, Holman and Jackson for this this bill. Definitely, you know. We are very happy that you put this together because this will enhance already the work that the police is doing alongside with the community, and I'm saying that, because you know I live in 11 for George Hill, which is right in the corner of San Nicolas, Fairview and coming up to Diamond. So I am a witness and a victim. Let's say of all these, you know extremely noisy racing cars. You know it does not matter what time of the day. So I am very happy that you put that together again. This is not going to replace the fact that we need police presence and we need police assistance and we need the community also involved, but this piece of legislation definitely will enhance. You know the work already. So. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all right! So Cheryl I did not forget you Sir, so Cheryl Miller, please go for it thanks curtis. First of all, I want to say Senator Jackson. Thank you very much and Senator Hoyleman for pushing this legislation and, as gabriella just said, it's very essential, and I do hope that you know some of the assembly members get on board with this and that this passes and that governor Cuomo signs it into law. With all due respect, I do not know where a lot of people from the Community board live, but I'm just going to tell you that where I live on, West 165 and Broadway has been like the Indianapolis 500 and all I'm hearing is these dirt bikes the other night. It sounded like about 200 of them and it was ridiculous and it sounds like gunshots going off, and you know this needs to stop I'm living here 14 years. This is a very high accident intersection over here 165 in broadway, where Morgan Stanley children's hospital is. I have seen accidents over the years. I've been living here where Wendy's is, and there definitely needs to be speed. Cameras over here you have people sitting in the restaurant over here in public house on the corner, people sitting outside and dining outside. If Gotham did that one of these cars or one of these dirt bikes loses control, then what then, it's going to jump the battery and hit all these people, while they're sitting outside and eating. So this is a very dangerous situation and you know I'm 66 years old. I have health conditions I like to have peace and quiet in my house and not be jumping out of my skin every half an hour. You know- and this is affecting my health and it's noise violence and it's a noise violence issue. It's not a it's, not a noise pollution, it's noise violence and this has an effect on people's health, whether you already have underlying health conditions- and if you do not, you can, you know, get health conditions from all of this and dealing with this night after night day after day after day, it does not stop. So I'm really hoping that this legislation passes it's very needed and I hope that Wes, 165 and Broadway is going to be one of the intersections where they're going to put cameras. Thank you thank you alrighty. So I think that concludes all of our questions. From our committee members, as well as our community members, you know my initial thought was that we would. I would also we're just going to add that our assembly woman, carmen De La Rosa, has signed on to the Sen the assembly version of this bill. I believe so. I think we are covered with getting people uptown, I'm not sure if our sami and Al Taylor signed on yet. But my initial thought was that we would do a resolution in support of this, but adding not in support of the legislation, because we're not legislators but to give feedback and suggestions on making it more applicable to our community by ensuring that the community boards were in fact consulted through the public hearing process, but that's already there. So I'm not sure if it makes sense to draft a resolution. I would love to hear from my committee members on your thoughts on how we should proceed. Okay in terms of what the resolution or not yeah a resolution or not because most of the language there that I initially thought we needed to provide or to suggest is in the legislation. So I'm not sure what are your thoughts I'll say. I think it should be a resolution: okay, yeah I and Curtis. I agree considering we as far as the most annoying complaint can we all have seen and experienced the drag racing and the donuts and all of these souped- up cars and the speakers bouncing off the world in our in our apartment. All of it is part of has a condition on our health and welfare and our well- being okay. I think, if you're, if you took the lead, you were five tv-12 and then other community boards in New York. I think that many of them will also follow the resolution of Cd12. Thank you. So I you know my one of my initial thoughts. I was, I read the bill over the weekend myself great detail and took down some notes and whatever one of the possible results I was thinking prior to this conversation was something along the lines of well. First of all, I think we need a motion from a community member to move forward with the resolution. Is there a motion? A second who? Okay, who emotion? Is there emotion I would like to motion, but I thought somebody else was speaking at the same time, so I was speaking and I stopped so. I think you are the person making the motion for us to proceed with drafting a resolution. It's a in support of this of this effort and there was a second I believe who was the second me? What's the second gabriella? Okay, all right, so we have. I am happy to take the lead on drafting that legislation. Oh committee members, all in favor, aye yeah, I'm here I just can't use my my camera and then yeah was that a yes yeah. I definitely support this and I understand the issue that we've been having and the number of noise complaints in the way in which it's affecting folks health, like Cheryl, mentioned it's a very real issue, and somebody mentioned that noise pollution is a public health issue which I totally get. I think I was just trying to raise some points that I think it's important to be mindful of, but I by no means I'm suggesting that I'm a. I think this is a great idea. I just want to make sure that we do it in a way- that's not overly paternalistic, and that does not exist most certainly. So I will take the initial staff stab on drafting the resolution and I'll share it with the committee. You can give feedback. We have two weeks prior to our general body needed to come up with the and the full leg, the full resolution that we can share for the vote to the board, but one of the one I was just thinking about what the resolve would be and I'm thinking something along the lines of the resolve. Cb12 Manhattan supports efforts to mitigate you know they and we come with some language there and to in support of the furious act to work in coordination with the community boards to determine locations. Should the city be authorized to move forward with this plan, something along the line of that of that of in that nature? What are your? What are your thoughts on? What some of the points I just made? Can I can I say something so yes, I agree on that, but I think it would be a good idea. Also to include what I basically, what I expressed the fact that this is in no way a replacement of you know: police presence, assistance, community involvement and that this will be, like an enhancement of you, know the efforts, because what I do not want is that you know other other key people might just lay back just because of this piece of legislation. You know we want to take it as a an enhancement. As I said, I agree. I think it should. We have some language on. Maybe you can provide some comments on this senators, about coordinating with the local precincts on these sort of efforts like what should be the expected when deciding which areas we would move forward in it can't. Would it just be the community board, or should we get be looking at data, that's provided to us through the traffic division of our local precincts? What are your thoughts on that? I think it's important that we run it by them. They have you know, they may have some good suggestions for us and they may have also suggestions for the community boards as to where, if any other hot spots, and obviously the people know the hot spots. So if they give a suggestion, it will probably just match up, and so that would be real good, in my opinion, all right about it, so that they can be inclusive in trying to make our community safer and more livable okay. So the main points are to ensure that the community boys are at the table, helping to make a decision working in a coordination with the precinct and we're all helping to mitigate the issues that we've been experiencing. So I would work on drafting that language and I will share with you what our I will share draft with my committee members and we'll move forward prior to having that completed for our next exec committee meeting and then have taken to the General Board. So thank you all! Yes Danielle! You know I just wanted to say. If so wait, I just want to clarify Senator Holman. You mentioned that you're not advocating for additional cameras right or are. Is this going to include language about installing additional cameras in hotspot areas? No, it's going to it's going to allow cameras in hotspot areas which currently exists in school zones to be turned on okay, and so it's so just that I'm clear so because somebody had, I think Senator Jackson had mentioned the West side highway before so we're not advocating for cameras on the highways. Well, actually, the West side high would be there. We've done a survey of these cameras and they really do cover most of Manhattan because they extend up to a third of a mile or more beyond school zones. So the number of schools and places where they are currently in existence allows really broad coverage all right. Thank you very much. There's some background noise. If you please mute yourself if you're, not speaking all right, so thank you. Thank you. Both Senator, Olympia and also Senator Jackson for joining and sharing that update. I look forward to you know: please feel free to join us for the general meeting, where we have our full vote on this resolution and without further ado we're going to move forward in our agenda. Thank you. Thank you. Plea, you're, welcome to stay or drop off if you like so Danielle, our assistant chair brought up another issue that we wanted to take up this evening and possibly discuss a resolution. Danielle is going to talk about this issue and we can discuss it afterwards, but before we do that, I also want to acknowledge Marielle De La Cruz from Comptroller's office. You feel free! Well, you have stuff if you want to make any announcement, we'll do that after the next item is that, okay with you, unless you have to leave you, okay, all right cool danielle, take it away! Okay, can you hear me? Yes, okay, I'm just putting my zoom my screen down, so I can read my notes. Sorry give me one second. So basically I have some thoughts around. I I've observed I'm personally a driver, and so I myself have gotten a number of tickets and I've observed many tickets on people's vehicles in no standing zones who are double parked, sometimes in near fire, hydrants and so I've. Just I've been thinking about this for a while, and especially since during Covid-19 people are sort of additionally financially strained, and so I just have some thoughts that I was hoping to share with everybody and potentially we can create a drafter resolution, but this is all to sort of have a discussion. So just a few points that I I like loosely drafted a resolution, so I'm just going to sort of read them off how I have them written. So I have you know. The first point is parking is pretty limited in our area. This is a predominantly working- class neighborhood covered places, additional financial pressures on individuals and families. We recently found out that Idonis Rodriguez actually has a resolution that he a bill that he has that's addressing. It's covered monetary relief relating to parking meters. So this will this will basically, I guess, refund anybody that was ticketed during the start of Covid-19 up until the end of September and let's see also, we have a bunch of no standing zones in our district that I thought could potentially be converted into parking, but I think this might be actually a traffic and transportation issue, and then I guess one more point is that a lot of the fire, the areas near the fire hydrants, are not actually demarcated with the yellow markings. So sometimes people are parking, I guess where they believe they're supposed to be parking or they can park, but they're a little bit too close to the fire hydrants. So those are some things that I wanted to raise and I have some ideas for potential resolves. I'm not sure if I should mention that now or if we should just sort of have a discussion based on those things. Curtis, I'm sorry. What was your question? No yeah, I mean those yeah. I have those are some ideas. Those are some observations that I've made and then I guess I have some ideas for potential results. Should I read those off yeah, I think we want to open it up for questions and comments from the committee first and then we can take some questions from the. I think there are a binocular question from the community. So are there any initial questions on this issue? First from the committee members? Well, Graham! Yes, I could say I like where this is going. So what you're saying is that? Are we looking at like what it's like 15 feet, now parking yeah? So it's so high. That's really like big like yeah. Not only is it huge, but also I have not seen any. I have yet to come across a fire hydrant that has the yellow marking. So I was thinking that one of the potential resolves can be to encourage the fbny to actually paint these areas, but also, I was thinking that perhaps the NYPD could not ticket if there's no yellow line, but also if the person has made an attempt to park at a reasonable distance, because I know I personally have gotten a ticket where it said that I was like eight feet away, and you know it's hard to know exactly where you can park and where you can park when there's no yellow line. I agree, you know I'd almost I you know I one thing that does concern me a little bit, though, is, if you put the yellow lines, you know it and they're 15 feet that actually could reduce it kind of like lowers. It makes it very obvious. You can't you can't park any closer so but they're measuring the areas, though oh they really measure okay. I just think I I'd like to see. I do not know where what it, what it is. It's always frustrating to me why it's a wide like a wide berth. I mean 15 feet is a lot of space. You know, I think that people should be able to park closer, and I also question if some of the fire hydrants are working. Some of them look like they do not work yeah like they do not work they're like they're missing, like parts like I do not know. I like this issue because I think it is yeah. I think a lot of people are ending up paying a lot of money for things that you know for in times and places they should. It should not so yeah, I'm supportive of this. I just wanted to think about what making the most of it yeah. So I think I want to just clarify and add, because someone posted is this a useful post. It is this a public safety or traffic and transportation issue, and I've gone back and forth, and we've been in conversation with Debbie who's, the chair of traffic- and you know, since it is an enforcement issue and the traffic division or the people enforcing it, comes under NYPD. It becomes a public safety issue with some leanings on the scientists. All that stuff is under transportation. So Debbie did say that you know whatever we did tonight. I would just share with her and we can discuss it further through her community mechanic committee between now and the time we have to bring this up before a full committee to make any adjustment to the language to ensure that it is focused on you know what agencies should be. Enforcement agencies should be doing not necessarily you know, necessarily. Okay, just a related question is this: is a city wide? This is not you know CB12, so I do not know if the NYPD would have different rules uptown than they do in any other area in the city. So if the rule is 15 feet, how can we even consider saying well in these blocks? It's going to be 12 feet or 11 feet? Well, you're, saying no we're not changing the law. The law is still 15 feet, but we're asking for more leniency up here. I'm just not sure what the event is yeah. Definitely so I'm not I'm not suggesting that we should, you know, include language about changing the law. What I am saying, though, however, is given the fact that parking is super limited and it's a working- class, neighborhood and Covid-19. You know it's like we're. The track. Traffic agents are ticketing, people who are parked. You know they could be parked theoretically 14 feet from the pump and still get a ticket, and so what I'm saying is that perhaps there could be some leniency there if they, if they're, if it appears as though an individual has made an attempt to park at a reasonable distance, not ticketing, but then also having language encouraging the fdny potentially to paint those curbs. I think the painting is probably more important here, because otherwise you're left with a judgment, call both on the parker and the policeman. If it was clear, sorry not go ahead, yeah, that's no! I think that the like permanent solution would be like or like the. If we did not, if we, if the curbs were if the if the curves were painted yellow, then we would not be in this situation, but so I guess what I'm saying is in the interim. You know to avoid people getting ticketed. Can we like put a suspension on that or like, if folks have attempted to park like at a reasonable distance? Let's say like eight feet or more? I do not know if we should even say a number, you know. Is there? Is there someone from I'm trying captain bellow? Are you still there? Okay, maybe not lieutenant still here, okay, any thoughts, any thoughts on this possible. You know effort. I think it's something that really needs to be passed by the fire department they're, the ones that have to get the hoses these large hoses into these areas and if they have to maneuver around vehicles, it's going to be quite difficult. So I would really think this needs to be passed by the fdny before it's even considered. Well, we're I'm sorry, okay, so we're going to go with Mari, Mariella, Graham and then Nancy and then Lawrence Mariella yeah. I just wanted to say I think that there's there are like competing interests here, and one thing that is difficult. Is that we're trying to imagine what it's like when all of these things coexist? So I think you know getting ticketed stinks, but I do not think that we would want to- or I would not want to start playing with safety measures around fire hydrants, because a ticket was frustrating. I also worry, I mean I understand the financial strains of the community that we live in of Covid-19, but again I would not say that we're going to use those as reasons to make safety decisions. So you know I'm glad that the lieutenant mentioned that this would have to run by the fdny, because we would never want to be in a position where we're making judgments about hydrants that we think do not work or what we think is eight feet, which is very different than 15 feet. And in my experience I mostly take public transportation, but we do have a car I've never seen ticketing when you've parked like 10 feet from a hydrant, like, I think in most neighborhoods. It's almost like obvious, like where the last car parks before the hydrant, even if it is not exactly 15 feet, but I so I think that leniency in my experience all is already there, so I would just really I would be very hesitant about supporting anything that now questions or makes us make a decision about safety versus like a frustrating ticket Graham. I think what makes a lot of sense here, though, is you know, definitely the yellow lines and marketing. It makes sense to me. I've always wondered why that really is not the case or why it just does not seem to be kept up and also, I think we can call for an assessment on of working which fire hydrants are in service and which are not because, like I said, I think a lot of them number of them do not look like they are, so I think that's a reasonable thing. Yeah. I think that's a reasonable thing for a community board to ask, for I do not mean to interrupt again. It's lieutenant Samuel from the 34th. The fdny actually is required to flush out fire hydrants. So, every once in a while, you will see the fire engines going out there. Opening up fire hydrants, see if there's any issues, and then they go back to their whoever maintains them and makes those notifications to get them fixed. Okay, nancy you're. Next, yes yeah, so you know I just sort of was looking to see. If this is this, 15-foot rule is it's nationwide, and actually a lot of states have a 15-foot rule, but Massachusetts I found did not so you know there is. There is some difference there and I think it does have to go to what are the unique requirements for safety in your municipality and the difficulty it could be for navigating streets. You know, but the other thing I wanted to say is regarding Lincoln C with tickets. One thing I have observed for the 20 plus years that I've been here is on alternate side of the street parking days. The residents of the neighborhood, which are most many of the people, parking, often get towed and ticketed right away. When we see many other violations of traffic laws go ignored and, for you know, it's really kind of a thorn in my side, because it's like picking you know picking the low fruit the people in the neighborhood that trying to get out there you get out late. I often see I see fleets, I've, seen police of tow trucks during times just taking the cars away, and you know that's it's kind of overkill when other things are ignored, and certainly you want you know you want to be reflective of the needs of this community, because you know as much as there's much controversy over having a car in the city. This is a unique neighborhood. Many people live work in areas that they have to drive to because of the proximity of this neighborhood to the highways, and you know, and low- income people having you know going other places to buy goods because they were cheaper. So you know that's that's just what I have to add to this to consider. So thank you for bringing this up Danielle. Thank you. I appreciate you Nancy and I just want to say that I'm one of those people I work. I live up here. This is my home. I work on Rikers island and it's impossible. It would be impossible for me to get to work. It would be a over four hour commute per day and so that's the reason I have a vehicle, and I and I actually to your point about going after the the folks who are parking on alternate sides. Two things one. You know parking rules were suspended during Covid-19 and then they they were just doing the street cleanings one day a week, and so it occurred to me. So that was another thought that I had when just thinking about you know preparing for this that you know. Why is it that we have street cleaning so many days and on Broadway near me and in Inwood I heard I learned that they actually made the hours even earlier, that it used to be from 8 o'clock to 8:30, and then they made it even earlier, and I know I've personally gotten a few tickets from being out there. Like it's 7:36, you know and it's a pretty expensive ticket and Marielle. I understand your point about you know an annoyance, but for some people it's not just an annoyance. It's the difference between you know food and you know it can add up, and so I just think like I totally get that you know we want to be moving toward. You know: enhancing public transportation, buses, but also a lot of people do have vehicles and there are many people that have vehicles that are just regular working- class people. So I just I'm trying to you know, raise some of the issues that those folks address, because I think we do not really talk about car owners too often lawrence, I'm Mr Lee bluntly: are you saying hi Curtis hi? Thank you yeah! It's an interesting topic. I live in the community and I have a vehicle which we do not use daily. I just wanted to make a couple observations. Number one: the street cleaning, the towing and ticketing there's supposed to be some sort of 10 minute grace period. I actually looked it up once there's something about that like and I actually just got a ticket a week ago, because I forgot what side I parked my car on and it was, the ticket was like at 11:46 or something and it there should be like a 10 minute grace period. That's number one number two. I was not aware of the painted curbs. Those would certainly be helpful, but I've also seen some indications somewhere like you should not look at painted curbs. I do not know why, but perhaps it's because someone could just slather on some more paint and extend the parking period, so I've also gotten tickets so along that line, I've also gotten tickets for being too close to the curb, and so I read it's 15 feet so I mean I take it pretty seriously because I do not want to ever get one of those tickets again. If I have a question about whether I'm too close I will get out- and I know my feet are roughly a foot, so I will literally measure from the front of my bumper or back my bumper to the hydrant and I count out roughly 15.. So I make it a point because I do not want to get a ticket and then I think this is my last point around. That is to the folks who have been talking about the need for public safety. You know I live in a very flammable building, it's not concrete. If there's an issue and we've certainly had the fdny come to our building on various occasions, I would hate for someone for the fdny not to be able to access the hydrant, because someone needed to be a little bit closer, so I would say, as I drive I've gotten tickets more than I care to and I've been towed and so on and so forth. So I you know, there's that ten minute limit- and I would I would you know I will personally skip a spot if it looks too close because number one I do not want to endanger public safety number two. I do not want to take that ticket and number three. I know that I can always count out like 15 feet. I do not think we have to depend on a painted curb to mark that. So thank you, okay. Thank you very much all right. This is lieutenant Semioli, I'm sorry, but I have to go back out on patrol okay. No thank you for joining us, we'll be in touch we'll see you next month. All right! Thank you have a good night. Everyone! Thank you all right, so I think we had a. We had a great discussion jenya. What is your? What is your pleasure? Yes, this is your proposal. What do you? What are you hearing what we? What we've just heard? I like Graham's idea of what did you mention Graham the lines and understanding doing an assessment on which hydrants are actually in operation and focusing on the line? Is that what do you yeah? I mean I like those ideas. I do not, I think, especially the hydrants. It's always something I've wondered and we should know it, but that's also something we do not have to. We do not have. We do not need a resolution for that. We can contact the fdi directly with that question to get that data yeah, but I think also you know it should be marked whether or not a hydrant is operational. Yes, and if not, we should be able to park there, because we should open up some parking. You know, I know we've been taking away a lot of parking, so part of the reason I thought about this is because we've lost even more parking with the cafes, and so you know sorry, I did not mean to interrupt you Graham. Did I interrupt you? No, I agree. No, I think that you know this was born out of you know. You know the fact that there is not a lot of parking in the neighborhood. The fact that you know people are kind of pressed for cash right now and gets exacerbate that, and you know I've observed so many no standing areas. I've observed people getting tickets in fire, hydrants and I've just been trying to think of ways to reduce. You know people getting ticketed and possibly expanding, but I get you know that somebody made a comment about public safety, making a resolution that opposes public safety. This is not meant to do that. This we were simo, we're thinking about people getting ticketed and the NYPD is the entity that tickets, and so you know that's why we're discussing this on this. Okay, all right- and I also just want to just want to clarify- I think we are focusing on the assessment- Mr Mr Rob- we're doing we're discussing and up hydrants that are not in well right. Now we're refocusing the conversation on hydrogens that are not in operation right and getting an actual count on how many are not in operation, because, if they're not in operation, we need to know why they're not in operation and what needs to be done to get them in operation. Are they still needed and if they're no longer needed, because of whatever reason, then they should be able to be used for parking spaces in the community. I think that's what we're going towards we're, not necessarily saying we want. We do not. We do not need hydrants, because we obviously know that we have had a lot of fires in our communities. We would never advocate for decreasing public safety, all right so Danielle do you. I do not want to take over your proposal. Do you want to do you want us to take it Offline and focus on making contact and getting those data points from fdny on the numbers of hydrogens in operation and getting a kind of idea and maybe trying to work within the agency and then come back to to the committee with Rep for something that can happen? An action that can happen afterwards. What is your? What is your pleasure yeah? I guess it sounds like the lieutenant I forget his name from the 34th. He recommends that we try to touch base with the fmy, because we do not want to do something or advocate for something that's going to interfere with the fdny's ability to respond right and okay, all right, so that how we can do that, how about you and I reach out to them to just send them some questions, follow- up questions and then make sure they come and maybe have them present something to us next month, and what is this November December meeting? Is that does that sound, a good plan for our committee? Sure? I think we need to be folk. We spent a lot of time on NYPD and I would love to get more participation and more issues surrounding the fire department, especially this time of year, because their winter months there are a lot of fires because of all the electricity we use, and my biggest concern is that they're going to be even more fire because of all the heat and electrical lighting. We're going to have outside so I think it will be. This would be a good conversation to have in coordination with them for the month of December, as we move into the outdoor dining electricity issue, we're going to probably have in a few months. That sounds like we can also coordinate with Debbie around the no standing zones, because that was another idea I had. I had to like sort of conduct a study of the no standing zones and see if there are any areas that might be. That, maybe are, I do not know, can be converted into a parking area that I do not know. Do you mean no parking understanding, sorry for interrupting, just looking at the no standing yeah, no standing, because there are a lot of areas I mean just from walking from you know, 215 to dikeman, you passed like three or four of them and then also at the near the Dyckman Marina there's like a whole. The whole roundabout is no parking or no standing, and I have observed folks getting ticketed at all hours and so yeah, I'm just trying to think you know about expanding parking and just thinking of different ideas. Okay, that works right now. I think we're going to wrap it up, but I did speak with Debbie Nevada today, who's a chair of transportation, because I do not want to overstep our boundaries as a committee, and she just suggested, maybe in the future or maybe quarterly. We have a joint meeting with Tran with tnt, because so many of our public safety issues we have are intermingled with traffic and transportation and actually Community board nine. They have a traffic and transportation is one committee. It's like it's called. I do not know transportation and public safety or transportation and safety, or something like that. So I think there's a lot of room, especially now with all the new enforcement agencies because of outdoor dining and everything else. It may be helpful to have a meeting, not December, but perhaps she suggested January, February or early night here, just to kind of get ahead of the curve. For some of these issues, but we will we will table this for now, we'll do our danielle and I will do our due diligence and make sure we have a larger presentation next month. Someone called it demystifying the hydrant issue, so we can focus on demystifying the hydrogen issue for the month of December and then, if there are any actions in a form or a resolution, we'll have the actual data and suggestions from them to move forward cool. All right with that being said, we've gone through all of our agenda items, but we did have a drop- in guest from Scott Springer's office. I would love to give you an opportunity to share anything. You would like to share on behalf of your office, hello, everybody. It feels like it's been a really long time. I was out for the General Board meeting, so I apologize. You did not see me there and just fyi I pop in and out, because I attend other meetings or I kind of tend to at the same time and that's really magical for those that can. But I try to pop in here and there sorry also curtis for the interruption. I just it caught my ear just because I know that no standing zones are there for specific reasons, and I think people put that in the chat- and I do not know parking- is a little more mystifying. I like the term about parking and mystification, because that's true and I'm not sure if mythification is the word I just wanted just to share something quickly with you all, not necessarily related to public safety. I know that over the summer we have a lot of conversation about quote-, unquote, funding the police and what that looks like or budget cuts to the police department, and I know that's something that my boss had answered to some extent or had said this is what I've been thinking for this piece. I just wanted to add for folks here that we are doing a survey of working folks and flexibility which again I know it's not part of your committee, and I usually do not do that. I just wanted to share that quick piece, but I will mention it further and send it to your board chair, so he can share it with whoever he wishes, because I do not know people's situations, but it'd be great, but you were saying: Daniel Copeland has led to a lot of different things and looking for parking for three hours is not an additional thing that you want to do, and I know that that's what happens now, but I will send that out for you all. I do not have anything necessarily related to to public safety, but just wanted to say hello, listen to a few of the issues that folks have and hopefully at one point collaborate or at least involve you all in anything that we are doing, but thank you for giving me the space curtis you're a wonderful chair of the committee. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much great, always a pleasure to hear from your office I'm giving my regards to comptroller. So without further ado, just to recap we did we did. We are going to move forward with our resolution. I will start drafting that and I'll share that with you in the next week for feedback and try to have it wrapped up by our general body meeting later on this month. So is there a motion to adjourn motion, all right, emotion, accepted all in favor, aye raise your hand all right all right! Well, you all have a great thing and we'll be in touch okay, good night adios.",
            "summary": "Just one second, we're waiting for Graham, just texted me that he's joining 20 now The chair of Manhattan community 412 public safety committee today is November 4th We'll start by having you introduce yourself, I'm, beginning with our assistant chair, who just stepped away from our computer and please enjoy, and after danielle, please feel free to just jump in if you're on the committee.\nIf, you want to stick around and hear about the legislation, furious Act, I think it'll be great to get your perspectives and dispute here and understand what's happening and how this, how the state is responding to the excess number of complaints for speed, racing.\nAnd, that's actually related to the resolution that I'm going to just discuss, later, which is related to parking, but one question I had for you was related to guns.\nSo, if using your example, if somebody were to leave their car double parked running on Saint Nicholas Avenue run inside to the store, real, quick leave, their vehicle running, and my officers happen to come.\nThe bill that Senator, Jackson and I have introduced would allow them to be operated overnight and on weekends in areas that the city has identified as hot spots for street racing, and we actually in the bill, seek specific input from community boards through a public hearing, and so the goal is pretty simple Drivers, who you know, are often racing late at night and on the weekends, with no cameras to enforce or track them down, and we also think it's going to bring you know: law enforcement somewhat out of the picture and just make this an automated ticket.\nI'm, going to drag race, you down the west side, highway, which we think is happening more often, so We know that speed, cameras, work and that data shows that when you get more speed, speeding, tickets, there's a reduction in drivers.\nYou know that are speeding and thanks to a new city law,, that's going into effect in February drivers that repeatedly receive speed, camera or red light.\nYou, see them driving real fast, which you know, people think that that's what they need to do in your city, one of the most crowded places in It's 25 miles per hour and the city speed limit and up in Inwood, it's 20 miles per hour and up in Washington Heights When you're coming into the neighborhood.\nYou see the sign that says 20 miles per hour, speed, limit, but I just think that people that are driving speeding- One block from you know, from where, from Broadway to post Avenue, just that little maybe 400,500 feet.\nYou know, I do not have money to give away, so we just have to drive a little slower and I have not gotten a ticket since, but I say to you even with I'm, watching so many of the scooters, the motorcycles, the delivery people with the with the with the the bikes that have the battery they're, going on sidewalk they're, going up and down the wrong street.\nWhy should they go 30 32 33 miles per hour when the speed limit in New York City is 25 and those you see so many of them running around without helmets on still, even though they say that before they take off they're supposed to take a picture with the helmet on, So we just need to clamp down on all of this eating loud music, excessive driving, going every which way in which.\nI want to know what assembly, member or Senator in New York City is not going to support this bill, they'd be in big trouble.\nIs there any discussion on how we can you know include language to maybe solve that issue at the same time, But it is a good point that we need greater enforcement around people who are disguising their plates and trying to evade speed cameras and other types of camera enforcement.\nSo I understand that the goal is to put these in places where there's been drag racing, but they just feel very paternalistic to me the idea of just having a camera flash when you're driving, potentially you know five or ten miles over the speed limit, feels paternalistic And, so I think that's a concern for me That's just a neighborhood, street, and You know these cameras just being sort of all over the entire neighborhood, from Post to the West side, highway to fort Washington to everywhere, and: We've had some shootings and some issues in the neighborhood.\nSo, we would be using existing school zone cameras at the suggestion of local community boards and allow them to be turned on during off hours to try to catch some of these racers.\nThe thing about the thing about Cameras is that you know they're, pretty Nobody gets a ticket simply their age or what they look like, or you know, for you know for another reason that you know we may find repugnant so that that's the other thing that I think is kind of you.\nI think we'd have to you know, make certain that there was appropriate signage in areas just like there is now around school, camera, zone.\nSo you'd want people to know that they are there through signage, okay, And, I also think that, from a social media point of view.\nAll due respect, I do not know where a lot of people from the Community board live, but I'm just going to tell you that, where I live, on, West, 165 and Broadway has been like the Indianapolis 500 and all I'm hearing Is these dirt bikes.\nOh committee, members, all in favor, aye I, definitely support this And I understand the issue that we've been having and the number of noise complaints in the way in which it's affecting folks health, like Cheryl, mentioned it's a very real issue, and somebody mentioned that noise pollution is a public health issue which I totally get.\nManhattan supports efforts to mitigate you know they We come with some language there and to in support of the furious act to work in coordination with the community boards to determine locations.\nIt's, going to allow cameras in hotspot areas which currently exists in school zones to be turned on okay, So, because somebody had, I, think Senator Jackson had mentioned the West side highway before so.\nI, look forward to you know: Please feel free to join us for the general meeting, where we have our full vote on this resolution and without further ado We're going to move forward in our agenda.\nAnd I've observed many tickets on people's vehicles in no standing zones who are double parked, sometimes in near fire, hydrants and so I've.\nThis will this will basically, I guess, refund anybody that was ticketed during the start of Covid-19 up until the end of September and let's see also , we have a bunch of no standing zones in our district that I thought could potentially be converted into parking, but I think this might be actually a traffic and transportation issue, and then I guess.\nShould I read those off, I think we want to open it up for questions and comments from the committee first Are there any initial questions on this issue?\nSo I was thinking that one of the potential resolves can be to encourage the fbny to actually paint these areas, but also, I was thinking that perhaps the NYPD could not ticket if there's no yellow line, but also if the person has made an attempt to park at a reasonable distance, because I know I personally have gotten a ticket where it said that I was like eight feet.\nYou know, I think that people should be able to park closer, and I.\nI like this issue, because I think it is I think a lot of people are ending up paying a lot of money for things that you know for in times and places they should.\nIs this a public safety or traffic and transportation issue, and I've gone back and forth, and we've been in conversation with Debbie who's, the chair of traffic- And, you know, since it is an enforcement issue and the traffic division or the people enforcing it, comes under NYPD.\nThink a lot of them number of them do not look like they are The fdny actually is required to flush out fire hydrants.\nIt's really kind of a thorn in my side, because it's like picking you know picking the low fruit the people in the neighborhood that trying to get out there I often see I, see fleets, I've, seen police of tow trucks during times just taking the cars away- You know you want to be reflective of the needs of this community, because you know as much as there's much controversy over having a car in the city.\nSo I, just I'm trying to you know, raise some of the issues that those folks address, because I think we do not really talk about car owners.\nI've observed people getting tickets in fire, hydrants and I've just been trying to think of ways to reduce.\nWe would never advocate for decreasing public safety, To. Do you want us to take it Offline and focus on making contact and getting those data points from fdny on the numbers of hydrogens in operation and getting a kind of idea and maybe trying to work within the agency and then come back to to the committee with Rep for something that can happen?\nWe, have a joint meeting with Tran with tnt, because so many of our public safety issues we have are intermingled with traffic and transportation and actually Community board.\nThink people put that in the chat- I like the term about parking and mystification, because that's true And I'm, not sure if mythification is the word I just wanted just to share something quickly with you all, not necessarily related to public safety."
