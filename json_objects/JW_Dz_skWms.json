            "fullTranscript": "Oh so well, it is 6 31.. I know there are more people coming in. Do you two want to get started or give it a minute? Or so? If you see people coming in, let's just wait another. Let's just wait another three minutes. If it's okay with everybody, we have some speakers and I just want to make sure we have as many people who can hear them as can be expected. That's okay with you, Sarah sounds good. It's a pretty busy night in New, York City as we open our indoor dining. So no ghost town here must be in that parallel universe. Tell us what you think will there's more people coming in or let me see if more people are signing up or okay, it does not look like it, so I think you're safe to let folks trickle in, but probably this is the bulk of everybody. Okay, hi. Everybody welcome to the Community, Board, eighth small business meeting, September 30th 2020.. When we put our agenda together, you could see it was a very general take a look at the restart because things can change in a moment, and so we were not sure where we would be tonight. We're actually going to focus on the opening of indoor dining, which is today, is the first day of indoor dining, and we wanted to focus on that and we've got three speakers from various New York City Health agents agencies, one the Department of Health, the other, the department of consumer affairs and then the department of small business services, and I I'll introduce them individually in a minute. But I just wanted to thank them for coming on to the Zoom meeting tonight on what is pretty short notice. But, as everybody has learned in this Covid-19 opening environment, things can change fairly quickly, hopefully for the better, but that's yet to be determined. So anyway. Unfortunately, like we're having this meeting tonight- and you know we're going to hopefully have some good suggestions for both restaurant owners and diners, but because people are in the middle of trying to keep their businesses running. You know this time of day may not be the most optimum time for people who are running businesses to participate in our meeting. So we're going to think about maybe scheduling a time, maybe earlier in the day, maybe a morning meeting at some point to shake it up a little bit see week that might encourage some of the or not encourage, but allow a lot of the small business and restaurant owners to participate before they open their doors. It's not like they're, not working already, but to allow them to participate at a time when perhaps customers may not be in their in their shops and restaurants and they're, taking care of business, okay, so without further Ado unless Sarah, please chime in where you want to oh, no. This is an exciting agenda. Thank you so much for putting it together, Valerie and will okay thanks. So I just want to start just a little intro and then we'll throw it over to the representatives of some of the agencies and talk a little bit about options. But you know, as I, as I began with today, is the first day of indoor dining. It was announced that this today would be the day by the governor earlier in the month and I'll just give a little bit of an overview of what we understand to be the criteria, and that is that you can open your restaurant to 25 of its capacity without counting any bar service. There can not be any bar service. You have to publicly post your capacity outside your restaurant. There is no service permitted after midnight. The tables indoors must be at least six feet apart all patrons and workers at all times, but all patrons must be wearing a mask, except when seated at the table. So if you are getting up to go to the bathroom, you have to have your mask on, etc. You need to give your contact information for tracing purposes and there are temperature checks before you're seated at the table. So I say that for both of the point of view of possible patrons as well as restaurant owners, everybody has to work together to make sure that this can be a success. So, if you're not willing as a patron to have your temperature checked or give your contact information, you know do not put the restaurant owner in a bad position that he has to he or she has to turn you away. There's some responsibility that goes on here. We should all be working towards the same end. There are going to be. My understanding is that this is somewhat of an experiment and all the guidelines are going to be reassessed on November 1st to see how everyone is doing. There are going to be 400 enforcement personnel, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe some of the people on the call from the city agencies will be more aware, but there will be 400 enforcement personnel walking around to to make sure that the guidelines are being followed and that's along with my understanding, a state police task force. I do not know if you've been in some of the outdoor restaurants, but there is a fair amount of inspection going on. I was at a breakfast meeting outdoors the other day and people were coming in with tape, measures and measuring distances with tables etcetera. So there is a fair amount of enforcement out there. Interestingly enough, you know you also. I just want to say you also have to have your ventilation systems if you're a restaurant owner there are various various ways that has to be done. I'm not an expert, but you have to have a merv, 13, filter or better, and my understanding is, to a certain extent, simple air purifiers with Hepa filters are available as well. I did want to make a note. I tried to invite this group to come, but it was on rather short notice, I'm going to say who they are and then, if later on after we hear from some of our speakers, hopefully give their information again. But there is a an architectural group out there. It's called the Rockwell Group and they have been working with restaurants to come up with design solutions for their outdoor spaces. Working with a group called dine out NYC and they have actually put together a kit. It's a if you go to their website, which is rockwellgroup.com you'll, see from some a module. That's been designed, that's adaptable for outdoor dining that allows businesses to operate within the current health guidelines, and it's really quite interesting. It's a pro bono project that they went out and did and it's being deployed at restaurants and bars in diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. Well, I did not have time to coordinate this with you, but if you go to their website, we might be able to put it on the share screen right. It's rockwellgroup.com and this kit that shows you how to put the module together can be downloaded from their website at dineoutnyc, NYC, rockwell group.com. So it's just another example of how people are working together in New, York City to put us back together and thrive. There are all sorts of you know. I do not know how many restaurant people are on the call or listening in, but you know it's daunting to try to to comply with all these regulations and still keep your eye on the ball, which is serving your customers. But you know very low tech solutions are being employed to with much success. I know that you know many of the Community board. Members have been going throughout the community everybody's quite pleased by the creativity of our restaurant owners on the Upper East side and all over the city for that matter and how they have met this challenge with great success. They're all one of the low- tech solutions, that's being offered is, you know, movable partitions in your restaurant in the indoor state in the indoor space so that you can accommodate more people at a table and move it around and another thing that this rockwell group has also thought about. Too, is: if you have a hostess station inside your restaurant, you might be better served to move that outside of the restaurant, to minimize the number of people indoors and also to keep one of your employees in the fresh air as long as possible. So I thought that was a pretty good idea again, pretty simple. You just have to take your station and move it outdoors, and this way you do not have a clog inside and you're making it a better atmosphere for everyone who's involved. So I guess we can get to questions, but I'm going to ask some of the representatives from the city agencies. If maybe they can just talk a little bit about what their particular agency is, how they are involved in the opening reopening of indoor dining, and I guess the first person I'll ask and thank her for being. The first volunteer is pauline Ferranti from the Department of Health Pauline. Thank you for joining us tonight and anything that you can share with respect to on the Department of Health's involvement and what's in this reopening program, and then once we hear from the three agency members, we can open it up to the floor. I think for questions if that works for everybody. That sounds great thanks, valerie for having me and thank you for pulling all the other agencies together. You went through really great over a really great overview of the guidelines that the state has set forth for New York City in terms of indoor dining. You know, I do not think there's much more for me to add in terms of the information that you shared, but I think what is important and what has been on the forefront of the health department is. There have been increased rates in positive cases, certain communities within the city, and I think it's really important for all of us as we continue to move forward and reopen that we all take responsibility and follow all of these social distancing guidelines, because we can see that when there is no adherence to those guidelines, cases will go up and rather quickly, and so we really just want to remember- and you know, maintain the core four, which is stay home. If you're sick wear face covering wash your hands frequently and there's one more, but it's off, I can't remember off the top of my head: what is it stay home if you say oh and maintain physical distancing? Obviously, so we really want to just encourage as restaurants open. We know it's been a very difficult time, especially for the restaurant industry, but you know the health experts have always indicated that indoor space is potentially more conducive to the virus being spread and transmitted, and so this is the reason why the governor and the mayor have decided on these particular rules and then also just keep in mind that again, as we continue to open. If we do see, cases continue to increase, the unfortunate option will be that we would have to go back and rewind everything and potentially see shut down again. So I do not want to be the bearer of bad news, or I do not want to be the one to continuously remind people. However, it is really important that we all remain vigilant and responsible, because it's not just for you, it's for the most vulnerable of us and it's really just important for us to maintain all of those guidelines. So in terms of the health department and indoor dining, I think the most important role that our agency has in this particular part of reopening obviously would be around inspections. So normal inspections of restaurants will resume, but they have been modified to take into account the current pandemic. So if your restaurant is scheduled for an annual inspection, where you receive your letter grade now, restaurants will be notified beforehand for to give them a period of time in which to expect an inspector before they would just show up at your business, but now they're, offering that time frame so that you can prepare your staff so that everyone has proper PPE and that you know you are able to follow those social distancing guidelines. But those regular inspections will continue as of right. Now there are no talks of you know extreme fines, obviously, because there is like a situation in which businesses are just starting to reopen. But again it's more focusing on education at this point and then there is that other level of enforcement to make sure that outdoor dining, if you have outdoor dining, is adhered to properly and then, as indoor dining continues that you know the restaurants are following those rules. But those inspectors are made up of multiple agencies inspectors. So it could be a health department inspector, but it could also be an fdny member, an NYPD member someone from the office of special enforcement. So it's not just the dohmh going out to do those social distancing, reopening inspections. So I do not know specifically about the 400 number. I know the mayor was talking about 400 NYPD staff, that's being designated to those areas that we're seeing an uptick for mask regulations. So if you're not wearing a mask out in public and you're, you know in a in a space with a lot of other people. You could be fined for that and that's just an effort for us to drive down those numbers of positive cases in those communities where we're seeing upticks. But that's the only 400 number that I know off the top of my head, so I can always go back and see what the number is for inspectors with regards to indoor dining. But I do not know if my other colleagues from the other agencies might have a better idea. So I think I can. I can stop there if there are any questions. Obviously, after my colleagues speak, we can all provide some answers to some questions. Folks may have thanks a lot, so let's go to Eric Parker from the department of small business services, eric thanks so much for joining us tonight and we'd like to know how you are assisting in this effort. Thank you Valerie. Can you hear me? Oh yes, good evening, everyone, my name is Eric Parker, with the department of small business services from the start of the shutdown sps has, like all other agencies, we transitioned to providing our services online, that included providing financing assistance to small businesses, as well as different courses for those small businesses that were in need of instructions on how to transition to an online platform. When the phase one two three and four reopening of the opening started, we were hosting webinars with our partner agencies, providing guidance and guidelines to how to reopen within compliance of city rules and regulations. When we heard about the September 30th indoor, dining reopening, we quickly put together a webinar with our partner agencies, which included the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Department, consumer Worker, Protection, Fire Department and the buildings department to provide that early guidance. Although there are still some unanswered questions about specific guidelines, we are still diligently working to provide information as much as we can as far as up- to- date. Information on how restaurants can open within the guidelines when the open restaurants program started with DOT our folks from the compliance team. We have a team of compliance advisors that actually go out and provide guidance on how to comply with rules and regulations under the open investments program. That team is still in place continuing to provide guidance. Now that we have indoor guidelines, we have a ton of information on our website entitled restaurant reopening guidelines, which has information from the state as well as Department of Health and mental hygiene, and some other city rules and regulations. So, for the most part, we've been partnering with our with our sister agencies in providing the the most up- to- date, information as to how restaurants can open within the guidelines that was set forth by the state. We have a hotline, that's launched back in June, which is a 1- 888- 188 SBS for NYC, which is a hotline providing up- to- date, information to small businesses who have specific questions about complying with new rules and regulations. So, for the most part, we've really been working with our agency partners in providing those guidelines providing virtual compliance consultations, as well as providing free PPE through our local community partners. So for the most part whatever need, wherever there is a need for a small business to understand how they can better navigate we're there to provide that assistance, as well as one- on-. One consultations with small business owners and just a whole wealth of information. That's on our website. You can go to Nyc.Gov NYC business to find a complete list of all the services and programs I'll take any questions that you may have pertaining to the indoor restaurant guidelines and how else we're playing a role in helping businesses understand those rules and regulations. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Eric! Maybe you can share with will some of that those phone numbers and direct links well we're I'm going to introduce tangila ramen from the department of consumer affairs hi. Can everyone hear me? Yes, thank you for joining us. Thank you. Community board. Eight. My name is Tanjila Rahman, I'm from the New York City, Department of Consumer and worker protection. We have a new name, we're no longer department of consumer affairs, we're now department of consumer worker protection. So, as my colleagues mentioned, Colleen and Eric, you know where we've been working closely with our sister agencies and doing outreach. You know for businesses that have reopened under phases, one through four. In addition, our agency we put together particular resources for the different phases of reopening. We just created a new document for the additional industries that reopened, which includes indoor dining, so we have a very specific guidelines on our website if, if everyone can visit, our website is nyc.gov forward, slash workers and we have the New York state requirements for indoor dining. As you know, my colleagues mentioned limit occupancy to 25 maximum capacity and also you know, designate separate entrances and exits for customers and employees where possible, taking a temperature of every patron at the door and also collecting information, full name phone number and address from one member of each party for contact tracing purposes and also you know, closing indoor food service at midnight and just social distancing. It's really important that employers, they download the New York state the safety plan and have it available at their work site, and the other thing is that they conduct daily health screenings and keep a record of it for their employees. So they have to keep a daily log of employee health screenings. Some just some important information from our agencies and we do enforce city workplace laws. So just a reminder that our agency enforces the New York City paid, safe and sick leave law, and this law covers employees at any size. Business in New, York City, including part- time employees full- time employees, temporary employees under the law. Employees can get up to 40 hours, five days of paid safe and sick week each calendar year at businesses with five or more employees. The paid sick leave is paid at businesses with fewer than five employees is unpaid, and you know we we mentioned that employees can use sick leave for themselves or for a family member, including preventative medical care, for example, staying home to observe symptoms of cloven 19, and we do encourage employers to take additional steps to protect all employees, customers and the public. Our agency, we have this great New, York City Workplace laws document which has a chart of the city workplace laws and, in addition to the federal and state sick Libra like the New, York, State, Emergency Clovid19 paid sick leave, and we have this great char chart on our website and in addition, we launched a worker protection hotline back in June, so workers can call through on one and ask for the worker protection hotline if they have questions about reopening health and safety guidelines paid safe and sick people are just you know, other questions they could call through on one and after the worker protection hotline. The other update is that you know right now: we're not reviewing or processing any new or renewal style. Cafe. Applications due to the mayor's executive order that was issued in June, certain laws and rules relating to style cafes have been suspended to administer the open restaurants program. So restaurants, they have to you, know, go through the vot's program for outdoor seating. Now that indoor dining commences the restaurants, if they have, they may use their enclosed dialogue cafe as part of its broader capacity for indoor dining, the regulations governing indoor dining, including the 25 occupancy limit and six feet. Distance between tables will still be required. Also because our enclosed cafe laws and rules remain suspended. They do not need to renew their enclosed. You know style, cafe, license or pay. You know anything at this time. We do have all of our information available. You know in multiple languages on our website, so we encourage new yorkers to visit us at nyc.gov forward slash dcwp alerts. Thank you thanks very much. Thank you very much. Okay. I at this point. Since we have everybody on, I guess we can go to questions from the public. Do we have any questions for any of our guests? So Judy Schneider's hand went up, but it came back down, but it's also a good time for me to remind everybody that the way that Valerie and Sarah will be able to see you and call on you to ask questions for our agency representatives is to use the raise hand feature through the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. So you'll find the little button says: participants a box will pop up and you'll see a raise hand button on that box, that you click and then Valerie and Sarah, and I can see you as you raise your hand and if you're on the phone, it's star nine. To raise your hand, you have one person from the Public Judy schneider, as I said, and then our board Chair Elita Camp, okay, Judy hi. I have two questions. I'll get a last speaker. I guess my first question is for her my understanding correctly, since the mayor extended the outdoor dining permanently that restaurants, who had in the past, applied for a sidewalk cafe and had to pay money for that, permit that they no longer have to do that. It's all free. Now, hi Judy, so your question was: if, if a business had the Sawat cafe license right in the past, is it no longer usable right for the outdoor since outdoor dining is permanent right? Do they still have to continue to pay for that license? No all of the consent fees they've been refunded earlier this year for existing style, cafe, licensees and right now we're not accepting reviewing renewals or new applications until further notice. So, regarding the DOT you know, listens, outdoor dining program is now permanent. You know businesses would have to go through DOT, I guess to apply for the open restaurant program, but we can follow up with you in terms of any updates on the star wars. Cafe you know, rules and regulations. I would appreciate that and my other question is for pauline and it's about the mass. I was not quite sure what you and Valerie were referring to, that there are 400 people is that from the mayor's office from the police department, from what Department of Health that's going out to enforce, mass wearing and I'll go a little astray here? Is it not just for restaurants? Is it for like public plazas and how does that work right? So the 400 number that I'm aware of is that the mayor announced 400 NYPD, who will be going and dispatch to those areas that have seen an uptick in cases in Brooklyn specifically to enforce the mask specifically the guideline on masks in public. So that's for those neighborhoods in which we're seeing that uptake in cases with regards to the indoor dining enforcement of all of the social distancing guidelines, those will be made up of multiple inspectors from different agencies and the state, and so I do not have an actual number of how many of those people it will be, and I do not know the amount that will the city will make up and the state will make up. So you know I'm happy to go back and try and find those answers. But at this point I believe the mayor's office of special enforcement or the mayor's Office of operations is pulling together inspectors from all the agencies that have inspectors so that they're all trained up on indoor dining regulations and that they will be the ones dispatched out to restaurants to make sure that they're all following the state's guidelines. So I hope that clarifies I just wanted to follow up. The number that I got was from a newspaper report and had nothing to do with mask it. Had everything just to do with the restaurants themselves, and that number was coming, it just said: 400 enforcement personnel. It was not specific as to where they were coming from, and it did say in addition to the quote-, unquote state police enforcement, and I think, as I mentioned earlier, I'm not sure you were on at that point. Judy I've actually seen the fire department inspectors coming in and checking on the restaurant, even outdoors, measuring the table. So to Pauline's point I think the mayor is drawing from various agencies in terms of enforcing the outdoor, dining and indoor dining roles. So I have further questions on this issue, so maybe I can speak to you Offline and Pauline, possibly offline, on what my problem is. Okay, all right! That sounds good Elena. I was disappointed to hear that law enforcement would be involved in the social distancing enforcement, because we've seen disproportionate policing in the way that law enforcement has been deployed and on a public health issue. I think it's we should be reconsidering how we use law enforcement and, and so pauline is there. Are there I'm guessing that DOH is incredibly strapped right now, but are there either DOH or other agency staff that could be doing that kind of enforcement or education in the same way that the mayor's office is taking inspectors from other departments to train them on restaurant inspection? Could there be other non- law enforcement agency staff who can assist with social distancing education? Yes, so absolutely understand that concern and I think, in the beginning of the pandemic, the mayor was very clear that the NYPD would not be used for this type of social distancing enforcement. I think, because we are seeing such a drastic uptick in cases in certain communities that they have no other choice but to deploy the NYPD. Obviously it's just fines. I do not believe anyone's going to be arrested for not wearing a face covering in public, but your point is very well taken and as a public health industry, you know agency, we really are very aware of you know racism as a public health crisis and all of those things that fall into disparities among neighborhoods, and you know that point is very well taken and to your question. Yes, there will be a multitude of other agency staff who will be going out and educating people specifically in those communities, but in general, so it'll be a dohmh staff, but also health and hospitals, and they really want to get people to go and get tested and then really follow through with the test and trace. So multiple agencies are going out and assisting with this education effort. Thank you, Judy did you have any follow- up, because if not then we'll go to Wilita, not at this time. Okay, great elita go ahead, and then you also have Matt Bauer for the Madison Avenue Bid to stand up all right go to Matt First thanks, Valerie sure hi, Matt hi good, to see you all and hello, our city agency, friends, just a quick question: the 25% capacity is the same for other establishments and that is based upon the certificate of occupancy. Is that correct? So it's Cfo! That is that's what it's based upon. It's still the Cfo right since you have it all here and 25 percent is a is a funny number or that's a funny number, it's a difficult number to calculate. Is there any way or any thought of working with DOB to to make the certificate of the occupancy easier to determine for a small business, because right, especially if you're in an older building and you go to the Department of buildings website, you try to download the cfo it's complicated, especially if it's a building with multiple multiple tenants on one floor and just wondering, if that's still, what you're just saying is business should just go to the DOB website. Is there any other right now? Dob is the agency that kind of oversees that those small establishments without a cfo or do not know the actual capacity of their location? The quick answer is to hire an engineer, to make a determination as to what your capacity is in your space. But then you know businesses being impacted the way they are right now. We would really be reluctant to tell businesses to do that right now. We are still waiting for guidelines from the department of buildings as to how they're going to make those determinations for small businesses. You know if you know, if you're, in a larger space that has a place of assembly. Obviously you can calculate 25 based on the place of assembly, but if you have less than 75 folks that becomes quite a dilemma. I believe they're still working on some guidelines to provide businesses that do not that won't cost them any additional monies in order to determine that, so it's still being worked on at this time. Thank you thanks Matt are you? Can you follow up with us eric if you get any additional information relating to that absolutely go ahead? Elita, okay, there's someone else who may be from the public. Valerie he's the identifier, so I'm patient iphone. You just have to unmute yourself. There you go, try speaking you're unmuted right now. We can't hear you if you're speaking, I do not think your microphone's working. Maybe you have some headphones that do not have a microphone while we wait elita, maybe you and I thank you. I have a few questions. I'd go from the broader to the more specific, so come November. First, how are you going to determine whether to revisit the indoor dining will it depend on neighborhood? Will it depend on capacity? Will it depend on an overall city or borough infection rate? Do you have any idea? In other words, has it been determined yet how you will reassess the indoor, dining okay, I'll ask my other questions? Does do partitions between tables make up for a lack of six feet between them? So if they're very close together does a partition work instead of the distancing and are there specific guidelines about cleaning things like condiment bottles, salt and pepper shakers containers that sugar packets are in between diners? I know people are really concerned about safety and sometimes it's the little things that make a difference. So I wonder, if there's guidance on that, thank you hi sorry. This is pauline from the health Department. I was trying to unmute before so I do not know the specific indicators that the state and the mayor's office will be looking into in terms of re- evaluation of the program. So I am happy to go back and figure out specifically what they're looking for, but I'm assuming it's based on the numbers of daily indicators that we are using now to make sure that the city can continue to move forward with reopening. So if we hit a threshold at any point over a five percent positive test rate, I think everything is going to have to go back to a lockdown, but with regards to you know, potentially pausing the indoor dining. I do not know what that number is, and I do not know what what they will be using as specific indicators. So I'm happy to try and see if we can get someone from the state to provide us with that information and then, with regards to the partitions, I have not read through all of the state's guidelines on their on their indoor dining the guidance that they provided on moving forward, New York for indoor dining, but everything should be pretty much stated in that document. All businesses have to read and affirm that document before they can reopen- or you know, have indoor dining. So I can look through that document quickly and see if there's anything about the partitions, but I believe indoor dining. The tables do need to be six feet apart. I believe outdoor dining partitions are okay, but p people need to be about six feet apart, but I can double check that unless Tengi Tenjilla knows more with regards to yeah or Eric, I was yeah. I was going to add on to that, so you can install physical barriers between patrons. You know, customers, even if six feet of this distance is possible, so you can install partitions, but I believe, even if you do it should still be six feet. You know of distance, but we can look into that, but we do have some educational materials on our website and it does say that you can install physical barriers between dealers and patrons, even if six feet of distance is possible. I was thinking the reverse when it's not possible- and I have one more question and thank you for your patience is whether bars are allowed if they're serving food to be serving people indoors. I know there's no bar service in restaurants and I apologize if this is well known. Whether bars themselves are allowed to have indoor now that they're required to serve food if they call it dining if they're allowed to move drinkers inside, and it would be concerning because I've seen outdoors with no food at all and tables full of drinks and crowded with people and no food inside anywhere. I was just reviewing the state guidelines this afternoon. I believe I read where, if you are a bar and you do serve food, you must serve first of all, you can not use the bar area. There would have to be a common area with tables and chairs. So if you want a bar and you do serve food, you can not serve food at the bar tangila. Maybe can correct me from wrong, but I believe I read that today earlier yeah, okay, thank you very much. I wish all the restaurants around the city's and thanks success, the patrons yes! Could I ask a question my I finally got my headphones on. If you can hear me now, okay, so would you identify yourself? Sorry, I'm sorry. My name is colleen. I live on the Upper East side and we have a small business restaurant. So we're wondering you know we're more of an upscale dining. So it's not a bar. It's more upscale dining. We used to have a lot of people, pre- theater and after theater that would come and even sit at a dining table and have like a glass of wine and a dessert or just have a glass of wine or an after dinner drink. So I know it's very it's like comparing apples and oranges, but I have to say that we turn around. We turn away a lot of business of people because we're very concerned of them actually ordering a full meal. Then the other problem is, if say, if there's three people at the table and they say well, I want to get the dinner. You buy the bottle of wine, but then we're concerned that an inspector comes and then they see that there's only a bottle of wine. But then there were three people at the table, so we're actually like turning away a lot of business and it's really hard to turn away business during this time. So we're just wondering when, if ever, will it ever go back that people can sit and have it or wait and have a drink while they wait for their table because all those sales count they count for the business? And it's really important. So if somebody has to wait 10 minutes for a table and we tell them they're not allowed to have a drink while they're waiting and we try to explain that they have to have food, but then they say well, we are waiting for our table. We are going to eat food. So there's a lot of gray area and if you could help us understand that and if, whenever it's going to go back, that people could actually sit and have a drink without eating, because you know that is all new yeah. Certainly I think you know we're following the New York state guidelines, the you know, that's the governor issues. So as soon as we have updates from you know from New York state, we can share them. I did not know with regards to inspections, so they're done by the state and also there's the mayor's office of special enforcement that also handles like business, reopening complaints and inspections. So you have like state level and also city level, but regarding indoor dining- and you know resuming like service right for bars, we would have to you know, get updates from the governor on. You know on that right so like even if they're sitting at a dining table, they're not allowed just to come and have a drink or a drink and dessert like from my understanding. Food must be served right eric you can not have like a drink or because we've been we've yeah. We've been telling people it has to be like a meal, but we get. We turn away a lot of business that people want to have. Maybe they've went somewhere else and they want to come to us and have an after dinner, drink and dessert, but we turn away business so we're trying to figure out. How can we increase our sales but still be within the guidelines? Can I just follow up on Colleen's question, because I thought the original rationale for the food and drink was that technically you're not supposed to have drinks out on the sidewalk with unless it's in a restaurant atmosphere and what was happening on the street was that Pete there was just you know, drinking going on and for a variety of reasons that was supposed to be downplayed so to your question, colleen, which I think is an excellent one if you're indoors and you're no you're not well, but to your point that you're seated at a table right served a drink just on its own. Like yes and I guess, Eric, I'm looking at the same as somebody who orders a salad and a glass of wine already allowed to have someone sit and order a glass of wine, I mean because when you're selling a glass of wine for twenty dollars, I mean in a business. Twenty dollars is a twenty dollar sale, plus the tip for the employees. So you try to capture, engage and you know, and some people they'll say: oh I'm only going to be here, for you know a half hour or I'm going to grab a gelato and a glass of wine. Can I do that and so it's like all those little sales. You know that you're talking 30:35 plus the employee's tips. You know it does add up, and so then you have a table sitting there and say it's three o'clock in the afternoon and that's all they want to do is have like a suite and a glass of wine and we're turning people away and they're sitting. They want to sit at a table, yeah Eric. Do you have any advice for that yeah? So I'm not sure what meets the threshold of having a meal. It may be dessert in a drink that might be permissible. Okay, we do know of small establishments that add appetizers on the menu very small appetizers that could constitute as a meal. So I'm not quite clear on that, but I'm not so sure turning people away by because they order dessert would really be. You know you know that. Might I'm not sure whether that's advisable than that yeah. Let me get back to you on that, but okay, good question yeah, because we we're under the assumption it has to be like an actual like entree or a sizable, salad appetizer. You know not ordering an order of fries yeah. Well, how do we get colleen and Eric Parker together so that they can continue this? It's an excellent question but yeah Colleen. Can you send me an email directly I'll leave my contact information and I will have an answer for you tomorrow? Okay, thank you yeah! Do that? Yes, thank you. Okay, great! Thank you very much colleen for participating. It sounds like you do not want to say the name of your restaurant, but we wish every success no matter what so much. Thank you. It's been a rocky road, that's for sure. Well, we're all pulling for you and we'll try to figure out who you are and then okay. Thank you. So much marco. I think you are next. Thank you. I would like to address two issues, the first one that do not have co. Usually what DOV does is they issue the letter of no rejection? The problem with that is DOB. They do not establish the number of people and probably they are unwilling to do to establish. If this is small, they're going to say, 75 people regarding the size, it could be smaller than that or if it's higher than that, then they trigger all the regulations. So the concern that should be is to call DOB one of the agencies and tell the ov to speed it up any applications in order to establish the number of people and issue a little, no objection with the number, with precise number of people, the capacity of that place, the venue. In addition to that, yes, any professional, they can do a very simple calculations. It's just only to calculate any area divided by 24 or 12 square feet. They give you the right a the number and the ova could be issued apart. So with this is more than a point of information now. My second point is the indoor dining we know very well. The major problem is this: virus transmission transmit transmission is through the air, and that is the biggest problem. The problem is, you have people asymptomatic and symptomatic the as the symptomatic you catch right away with one of the tests. Whatever thermometers, you can catch them, but the asymptomatic is the problem. If those people go inside of the place that is coming the issue of ventilation and the ventilation, I found a profound luck from the from the government, especially for Mr Cuomo, that they said. Oh just change the filter. They tell us just only to change the filter. Like one filter, you change forever. It has to establish how frequently it has to be changed or how many? What is the quality of air or how many changes of air is required, because by law is only to change 20 percent of the inside air, so 80 they recycle and at 20 they bring fresh air. In this case, it should be a mandatory that a hundred percent it should be fresh air. So with that you wanted any air to go to the to the air. Conditioned is completely is outside and they appreciate they put it inside, but this is just only for two kind of assistant other conditions, but we have the package system I just described, and this the second system is the split system which is very popular right now. I myself, like one of the people that I used to install this condensed system, because it's high efficient quicker to install, but the problem is they do not offer ventilation, and now I find it that it's very hard to use these split systems. Why? Because the only thing that this air conditioner does is does not ventilate. The only thing is just change the temperature inside, even if hot they put it hot, they need cold, they put coal, but they recirculate the same air and the major issue is the air, the quality of air, and that I find that a complete lack of regulations is hard because not even ashrae, which is the agency for the engineers which usually govern all these countries. The inside ventilation do not have a policy, but the major issue is: if you increase the number of people, you increase the number of troubles inside, and that is my concern. My concern is lack of understanding how crucial and how important is to have a fresh air inside of the spaces and you kind of circulate the same. The same, the same air, the best way and the safest way. It should be a hundred percent change of the inside, never recirculate the air, even though that is required by code. But if you happen that now the bill of the lights is going to increase dramatically in these restaurants that is starving for income. So I my question to you is: you should have a policy for how frequently, as you change the filter inside of the air conditioner and for the split system which basically recycle 100 percent they just put a coal or hot inside. It has to have some policy too, because otherwise, when is created, trouble in the in those restaurants, how you going to proceed to clean those restaurants- and this is basically is something that you is. You do not see that you can put six six feet apart, the with the tables and you can see you go in and see you can see by the air. Nobody see that, and that is my major concern and would like to hear any answer for that. Thank you, Pauline is that a health department concern so yeah. I mean, I think, the it's more of a question for the state in terms of guidelines around ventilation and then requiring businesses to then purchase different ventilation systems. I'm not 100 sure what that would look like and how that would work for businesses that are already struggling, but definitely get the the point that Marco was making about the fact that there needs to be fresh air. I think that's why the city opened, or this state opened up with a 25% capacity and then with the additional temperature checks at the door, because it's thought that you are more able to transmit when you are actively ill. So you know coughing and sneezing and those particles are in the air. So you know people will be able to assess their patrons at the door to see whether or not they're actively showing symptoms and then temperature checks just to make sure that maybe, if they're not showing symptoms but have an elevated temperature that they can also ask that person unfortunately not enter their premise. And so I think all of these guidelines together are put in place to minimize the risk. But again right like we just do not know, and everything is sort of just trying to figure out as we go, which sounds terrible. But I mean this really. This is something that we've never encountered before and so, I think, being conservative in terms of limiting how many people come in and having those temperature checks and having a contact for one person in the party. I think all of these are in place to really just do our best in making sure that businesses can reopen, but also being responsible in not returning to a place where we had rampant community transmission. Thank you cause. Did you have your hand up? He did but he's lowered it. So he's talking a little bit. I do not know yes. No do you want to ask okay, I'm mute a new cars. Please! Yes, based on what I've heard tonight I mean yes, we're allowing the restaurants to open with a 25, but it seems like everything is being thrown upon them. It's up to them to basically take care of many things, a lot of the equipment, the filters and the air conditioners and the heating lamps, and this they're so short in stock. It takes you six months to get so I mean trying to open. Now is trying to struggle up here with shackles. You know there's so many different rules, regulations and they keep changing every single day. Would it be possible for the agencies to come together to come with a real true? You know opening scenario and go with the department of with the cfo from what Matt and Marco was saying that some buildings do not have a cfo. So do I take 75 people as the Cfo as the maximum number? Do I take it on the square foot? Okay, I open with all the restrictions along comes the DOB DCA or whoever and I get fined you know what is the you know, there's so many pitfalls to opening and a lot of restaurants are not going to open because of these pitfalls. Is there any coherent code? You know, communication between the different agencies and the state. I guess it's questions and comments. As I mentioned earlier, we had a discussion with the department of buildings before our indoor dining webinar from last week, and so they are still working out. The details of how folks, without a cfo in the building can make that calculation accurately. So I mean it's still being worked on, so I'm sorry, I do not have an answer for you right now, but it is forthcoming. That's all I can really say at this time. Well, so in the meantime, I should not open yeah. Well, I mean, let me ask you, let me ask you a question: go ahead, no go ahead! No, I'm just going to say Eric! You mentioned in the beginning that you had some kind of like you could do a virtual cons consultation. So I guess I would be encouraging if you think that a restaurant owner call you call your agency up directly and talk about their situation and then maybe you can sort of customize the answer for that. Thank you so much valley. That is certainly a start. I would advise the gentleman to definitely submit an application for a compliance consultation or make an appointment for a virtual consultation, but with regards to the certificate of occupancy and total occupancy, that's a tricky one that really does not fall under our jurisdiction. Like I mentioned we do. We are aware of the fact that DOB is looking for putting together some guidelines on that for small businesses that do not know what their what their capacity is so yeah. Definitely I would advise the gentleman to certainly have one of our people contact you to just sort of talk to you talk to you about what solutions you can come up with regards to capacity in your space yeah, but I think the message if I can talk for cause for a second, the message really is you know these restaurant owners are put in this dire situation. They do not want to. They do not want to get in trouble, they need to make money, and you know it's not like the government city state, whatever you want to say, did not know that this day was going to come, so it's like when they open up. It's not like these issues should not be a surprise to anybody, but now it's on the backs and the pockets of the restaurant owners to take all the risk and there's there does not seem to be a lot of you know. You know if there's no like okay, if you make a mistake the first couple of weeks, you know we're going to work with you, we're not going to give you a fine or you know, to get to encourage them to even attempt this. So I guess, let me just say it again for that making the the call for the let's say, the virtual consultation is that 188 SBS number four NYC is that it okay, you talk to me directly. I left my contact information in the chat. You can certainly reach out to me directly and I can make that make the arrangements. Okay, great. I wish I had a better answer for you. Unfortunately, I do not I wanted to add hi. This is tangila, so I understand you know things are constantly changing for businesses and we just want to let everyone know our agency. You know Department of Health Small business services. We all work closely together and we do want to make sure that businesses have the most updated information. So we do encourage business owners to call our the hotlines or visit our website for the latest guidance and in addition I wanted to mention. There's the office there's the mayor's Office of night life, that is a resource for restaurant bar establishments, and we have direct contacts with them and they do have a lot of great resources, for you know restaurants and bars with the reopening and guidance on their website, and we can definitely following up on this meeting connect. You know, connect you guys to their office, but they are also a resource but definitely reach out to our respective agencies, and we do work closely together to do a lot of virtual outreach as well as field outreach as well, and they do not. You know, there's just a lot of like information right overload right now in regards to indoor dining and I you know, we have to follow New York City guidelines right where you know we are city agencies, but we do want to make it easier for businesses and also wanted to mention like a lot of our materials are in the top. You know 10 languages, we do. We are city government, so I understand it can be tricky navigating, especially if there's like a language barrier and we do have language access. We do have materials in multiple languages and if people call us you know they can ask for an interpretation if they call like our hotline numbers as well. Thank you. Well, that's great tangila, I do not know, will colleen have her hand up again. I just want to give her an opportunity if she's there to follow up. So I have a question. I know that somebody who is dealing with a very difficult situation, you know since there's so many storefronts empty and commercial spaces empty. You know some one restaurant owner may put tables in front of the empty storefront area and then that landlord that owner is asking for money from the restaurant people per day per table and their guests. They go online, read your menu prices and they go and calculate how many people and how much they're probably doing in sales and then they're asking for a percentage every day. How do you deal with that? When I understand the landlords are also hurting because they do not have a commercial tenant anymore because they probably closed up, but then to go to the one that's trying to survive and then asking them for money. What do you recommend for those friends that are dealing with that situation? Well, first of all, to my knowledge, of conducting business outside of your property line is not legal, okay, yeah. So, okay, we're not enforcement agencies, so I mean okay, yeah, okay, very good! Thank you yeah. I just wanted to cry for so you're asking about like other merchants within the restaurant like outside the restaurant conducting business. Is that correct one? Second, she is muted again, I'm sorry! Yes, I guess you know like there. Maybe they have three four tables out in front of an empty storefront, so they're actually yeah in front in front of someone else's property yeah, but when they start asking for money, I just just to pull their theirs away and that's it well, obviously, they're not very cooperative. I mean I know. I know that I mean, I think, every everybody who's walking up and down the upper East side has seen a lot of tables in front of empty storefronts, where there's a restaurant adjacent to it and the cases that I'm aware of it's been a very cooperative relationship. Yes, I feel that you know the property owner is correct. I mean you can't be on their property without the consent. Yeah. Sorry, it's pauline from the health department, so I'm on Dot's website with regards to open dining or outdoor dining, and it says under adjacent properties. It states. The city will allow restaurants to expand seating to the frontage of adjacent properties. As long as adjacent property owners formally agree to the use of the space for a specified period of time and commit to a no charge fee for its use, so they should not be charging and the agreement should be formalized okay. So what that means in terms of foreign? What it means is that you need to have their consent. They can't charge you for the right to use the property, but my original answer remains the same. You can't do it yeah. I guess the situation is the those property owners know that they have you, because if you need it to make your business survive and say they said yes and then, although they're saying now they're saying well, I did say yes, but I'm just saying hypothetically, we did say yes, but now you're going to have to give me money. Well I mean, then you can take the regulation that pauline has just told you or do you write it to your friend and they can put it in front of the landlord owner and say. The only way you can agree is, if you do not charge me any rent, so are you in it or you're? Not in it right, that's yeah that story yeah. They can either agree or not agree, but there has to be a rent- free arrangement. So, okay, maybe that will persuade the landlord that what they're asking them to do is you know illegal and right. Okay, thank you sure. Okay! Is there anybody else who has a hand raised? I do not yeah, marco and coz both have their hands up okay. Well, we have not. We just cause. You want to finish up, go ahead, yeah as far as the adjacent I mean some time ago, we asked DOT and DOT said no, an inspector came out and he said fine. As long as your name is on the lease to the building next door, you can then DOT says no. As long as you get formal agreement, you can so you know three different people, three different responses. Now the latest thing. Yes, you are allowed to go on the sidewalk on the street without paying rent, so the landlords that are charging. Theoretically, you could report them. I mean they're, you know judging you because you have to have the formal agreement. No, I agree yes, okay, but they can not charge you right exactly theoretically, you know so tonight I've heard yes, you can! No, you can't so I mean even tonight three different people, we've heard through or two or three different results. So would it be possible for the cba to put a website somewhere or somewhere online, one location that we all get the right information? I do not want to go to DOB dohfdny, the state, the city, the this. The that and everything else and you got to different sides they're all different. The main site you should visit is the one that we just shared and we actually included all the new information that was added to this page in our last e- blast. If you're not subscribed to our e- blast, you should about adjacent properties, about heating, about tents and about the roadway changes that were recently announced pauline. Do you remember when that was like a week ago? I'm not a hundred percent sure, I'm sorry, it's okay! I put you on the spot. Sorry, it's! Okay! Thanks! Well, can you sorry? This is pauline again to your point. It's now written on Dot's website that you are able to use the adjacent property with their consent in a formal agreement and without charge. So if an inspector were to come and give the restaurant owner a hard time about adjacent property, they can pull up the dot's website and say it's right here in black and white. We can do this. We have a formal agreement. Here is what it is. So I think in the beginning there was not any like formalized. Faq on that, and so now it's definitely on the internet. It's out there, it's pretty clear. So definitely if you're hearing that inspectors are not adhering to that, you should let the mayor's office know or if it's a state inspector, let the governor's office know that their inspectors are not. You know they they're not following what the guidelines are right. The only thing I would say there is that the restaurant needs to have that formal agreement easily accessible to show the inspector when they come on the grounds, and this way they can just say, here's the formal agreement and that's you know that's that should end it. But okay, Marco did you have one more question. I do. I think it's more than final information right here, the Small Business Administration I used to have DOV together working and different in restaurant projects. I used to file a lot of projects through the Small Business Administration and I think they just separated about seven or eight months ago. So you have the infrastructure. You have the connection with the planet examiner with DOV. You should be the leading agent that put together these two of these two organizations and since you have a person knowledgeable person in restaurants, that's what you used to have. He can easily go back to your place and probably since you are offering loans, some kind of financial situation, you probably you can finance some of the expenses for this business, having DOB resolving the technical issues and the financial situation, you can resolve right away too, because you used to work very well. I do not know why you stopped, but no more is not allowed anymore, the connection, the DOV with a small business administration. So I think that will be a great move for all the restaurants that usually they can go directly to your place. Eric and your place, you resolve everything, and then you also have connections directly with D.O.T. So what cause was mentioning is exactly what it is. You are. You have the solution and that's my point of view right here. Thank you, yeah. Thank you, marco. I think a lot of the next 30 days is going to be a lot of trial and error. Hopefully, the infection rate stays at a point to allow the next 30 days to create this sort of experiment period. To see what happens because I know like there are a lot of restaurants on the Upper East side that, though they're small, like they're the front of their restaurant literally opens to the air, and so I would think at some point. The guidelines would allow for them to have more than 25% capacity if, in fact like their entire front door is open and you have complete open- air exposure. I mean I would think that would be one of the things that the Department of Health and whoever is responsible would be looking at in terms of. If you have open air- and you have a very small location, then maybe you can go beyond the 25. I mean it may not be as warm, but you know these days who can who knows how long we're going to be at 65 degrees? I mean if you're indoors and it's 65 degrees and you've got body heat and a will to sit there and eat it. Could it could work out well for everyone? Okay, are there any more questions, because I think it's supported. We've we've been very lucky tonight to have these three representatives from these city agencies, and I really appreciate the fact that we have had some restaurant owner participation tonight and Eric. We are going to give up that phone number a lot to our friends in the restaurants, on the Upper East side, to encourage them to get out there and and make sure they can be a success. Absolutely the information is changing so drastically and so quickly, and so forgive me for misspeaking about the the adjacent property issue. I mean it's just so hard to keep up with all the information that's happening and it's being rolled out constantly. So we completely understand- and we just are very appreciative- you know for everybody on this call. It was not more than like, 48 business hours ago that we reached out to the three agencies to see if we could get people and they responded very quickly and we're very pleased that we could have them here tonight to answer questions and I'm hoping that this is the beginning of a dialogue and that we can keep in touch with questions that come to the Community Board Sarah. Do you want to add anything now, just to echo your gratefulness to our city, partners and state partners who are here tonight to help us work this through and to take direct questions from the community? It's it makes such a difference to have you here and for our community folks to be able to ask you directly about problems, so we can help facilitate and they can get answers, especially on issues where they may get three different answers and so having you all here. At the same time, we saw an example of how useful that was tonight that that it it's kind of like one stop shopping tonight, so it was we're so lucky to have had you all here tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you guys, Valerie before you go, can I ask a question? Oh yeah sure thanks. I just wanted to ask as long as we have and thank you for being here, the government reps is there any move for retail stores that are interested in using sidewalks to be able to do that. I know that there has been a lot of resistance to that, but since this is small business and includes retail, I thought I would ask other community boards have the same question about availability of sidewalk space for Retail. I do know that department of Transportation was discussing that during the open streets program, but I'm not sure what the outcome of that conversation was. I mean it would make sense that, in order to help New York as a whole economy would be to kind of include those retail businesses in the sidewalk in the use of sidewalk for commerce, but I know additional information on that at this time. That would definitely be a determination made by the Department of transportation if we find out any information regarding that. Certainly we'll share that with the public as soon as we possibly can and as soon as we get updated information on that. Thank you that's great. Does anybody have any other business they want to bring up or anything that needs to be discussed tonight while we're around? So if you have items for the agenda for next time, please let us know again. This is a very fluid situation and we're all out there hoping for the success of our local businesses. Restaurants and small businesses alike support them as best you can, and let's hope that our thriving what's the opposite of a ghost town whatever. That is that's what we are, we're a people, town we're a people, town come and visit former residents and all okay on that happy note I'll, say good evening to everyone and Happy October tomorrow, bye everyone. Thank you very much for participating. Thank you.",
            "summary": "It's a pretty busy night in New, York City as we open our indoor dining.\nYou know we're going to hopefully have some good suggestions for both restaurant owners and diners, but because people are in the middle of trying to keep their businesses.\nWe're going to think about maybe scheduling a time, maybe earlier in the day, maybe a morning meeting at some point to shake it up a little bit see week that might encourage some of the or not encourage, but allow a lot of the small business and restaurant owners to participate before they open their doors.\nSome of the people on the call from the city agencies will be more aware, but there will be 400 enforcement personnel walking around to to make sure that the guidelines are being followed and that's along with my understanding, a state police task.\nYou know, movable partitions in your restaurant in the indoor state in the indoor space so that you can accommodate more people at a table and move it around and another thing that this rockwell group has also thought: about.\nToo, is: If you have a hostess station inside your restaurant, you might be better served to move that outside of the restaurant, to minimize the number of people indoors and also to keep one of your employees in the fresh air.\nThank you for joining us tonight, and anything that you can share with respect to on the Department of Health's involvement and what's in this reopening program, and then once we hear from the three agency members, we can open it up to the floor.\nYou went through really great over a really great overview of the guidelines that the state has set forth for New York City in terms of indoor dining.\nCertain communities within the city, and I think it's really important for all of us, as we continue to move forward and reopen that we all take responsibility and follow all of these social distancing guidelines, because we can see that when there is no adherence to those guidelines, cases will go up and rather quickly, and so we really just want to remember- If, you're, sick, wear face covering wash your hands frequently and there's one more, but It's off, I can't remember off the top of my head: What is it stay home if you say oh and maintain physical distancing?\nBut you know the health experts have always indicated that indoor space is potentially more conducive to the virus being spread and transmitted, and so this is the reason why the governor and the mayor have decided on these particular rules and then also just keep in mind that again, as we continue to open.\nSo in terms of the health department and indoor dining, I think the most important role that our agency has in this particular part of reopening obviously would be around inspections.\nIf your restaurant is scheduled for an annual inspection, where you receive your letter grade, now, restaurants will be notified beforehand for to give them a period of time in which to expect an inspector before they would just show up at your business, but now they're, offering that time frame so that you can prepare your staff so that everyone has proper PPE and that you know you are able to follow those social distancing, guidelines.\nAs indoor dining continues that you know the restaurants are following those rules.\nWe have a ton of information on our website entitled restaurant reopening guidelines, which has information from the state as well as Department of Health and mental hygiene, and some other city rules and regulations.\nWe've been partnering with our with our sister agencies in providing the the most up- to- date, information as to how restaurants can open within the guidelines that was set forth by the state.\nTake any questions that you may have pertaining to the indoor restaurant guidelines and how else we're playing a role in helping businesses understand those rules and regulations.\nAs, you know, my colleagues mentioned limit occupancy to 25 maximum capacity and also you know, designate separate entrances and exits for customers and employees where possible, taking a temperature of every patron at the door and also collecting information, full name phone number and address from one member of each party for contact tracing purposes, and also you know, closing indoor food service at midnight and just social distancing.\nYou know, businesses would have to go through DOT , I guess to apply for the open restaurant program, but we can follow up with you in terms of any updates on the star.\nI was not quite sure what you and Valerie were referring, to, that there are 400 people Is, That from the mayor's office from the police, department, from what Department of Health that's going out to enforce, Is it for like public plazas and how does that work?\nThat's for those neighborhoods in which we're seeing that uptake in cases with regards to the indoor dining enforcement of all of the social distancing guidelines, those will be made up of multiple inspectors from different agencies and the state, and so I do not have an actual number of how many of those people it will.\nBut at this point, I believe the mayor's office of special enforcement or the mayor's Office of operations is pulling together inspectors from all the agencies that have inspectors so that they're all trained up on indoor dining regulations and that they will be the ones dispatched out to restaurants to make sure that they're all following the state's guidelines.\nI'm guessing that DOH is incredibly strapped right now, but are there either DOH or other agency staff that could be doing that kind of enforcement or education in the same way that the mayor's office is taking inspectors from other departments to train them on restaurant inspection?\nSo, if they're, very close together does a partition work instead of the distancing and are there specific guidelines about cleaning things like condiment, bottles, salt and pepper shakers I know, people are really concerned about safety, and sometimes it's the little things that make a difference.\nAll businesses have to read and affirm that document before they can reopen- Or you know, have indoor dining.\nWe used to have a lot of people, pre- theater and after theater that would come and even sit at a dining table and have like a glass of wine and a dessert or just have a glass of wine or an after dinner.\nSo, there's a lot of gray area, and if you could help us understand that And if, whenever it's going to go back, that people could actually sit and have a drink without eating, because you know that is all new Certainly I think you know we're following the New York state guidelines , the you know, that's the governor issues.\nI did not know with regards to inspections, so they're done by the state and also there's the mayor's office of special enforcement that also handles, like business, reopening complaints and inspections.\nYou have like state level and also city level, but regarding indoor dining- And, you know resuming like service right for bars.\nThank you, Pauline is that a health department concern I, mean, I think, The it's more of a question for the state in terms of guidelines around ventilation and then requiring businesses to then purchase different ventilation.\nI'm, not 100, sure what that would look like and how that would work for businesses that are already struggling, but definitely get the the point that Marco was making about the fact that there needs to be fresh, air.\nYou know: Department of Health Small business, services.\nRight now in regards to indoor dining And I, you know, we have to follow New York City guidelines You know we are city agencies, but we do want to make it easier for businesses and also wanted to mention like We are city government, so I understand it can be tricky navigating, especially if there's like a language barrier We do have materials in multiple languages and if people call us I know that somebody who is dealing with a very difficult situation, you know since there's so many storefronts empty and commercial spaces.\nI know that I mean, I think, every everybody, who's walking up and down the upper East side has seen a lot of tables in front of empty storefronts, where there's a restaurant adjacent to it, and the cases that I'm aware of it I mean you can't be on their property without the consent.\nThink it's more than final information right here, the Small Business Administration I used to have DOV together working and different in restaurant projects."
