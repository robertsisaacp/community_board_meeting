Here, for the first time, the business license and permits committee makes recommendations to the full board which meets the first wednesday of the month, which will be in september very early.
So welcome carrie and let's go now to item number one which was 149 west 14th street jamaa, mama they're, applying to use their backyard where you are as they call it, the yes, the rare yard.
So I am zara lucas of elky hoffman law and tamara the owner of the establishment, shama mama, I believe she's here she's logged in, but we can't see I'm here, my dear I'm here hello and we so we appeared last month to present kind of two parts of this application or for this applicant, and so the first one was the temporary approval of the backyard space with all of the current covet exceptions and then to permanently amend their license application so that when these exceptions do expire, that they would be allowed to continue to operate in the backyard.
The extension for the sla's backyard exception actually didn't happen until probably after 5 p.m. The day of august 5th, we sat there just waiting with baited brass wondering when the sla and whether they were actually going to extend it and they did and they extended it through september, and now we, where we're you know we're gonna, be playing that game.
I believe now until the warm weather season is over, but we do want to move forward with the application, and so, during the last few weeks, what has happened is tamara has continued to do outreach to the community.
Tamara also did she reached out to a local acoustic company to get a proposal about what she can do with regard to the backyard and to limiting the noise and how you know it extends and affects the neighbors and how they can dampen sound, and that proposal was also sent over to the committee, and I guess pretty much.
She is agreeing to you know the community board's recommendations in terms of hours.
Your recommended hours right now, she's closing at 10, and if I you know we'll touch a little bit on what was in.
Possibly you know trying to find ways to reduce the sound from that coming and going with the staff and yeah, I think tamara has you know she's doing her best right now.
A lot of her regulars are from the neighborhood, and you see that in the petitions you see that in the emails, and so we do hope that we can get your recommendation of approval for this permanent alteration based on you know, the work that she's willing to do to you know be a good neighborhood business, so I gather you'd agree to a stipulation that you'll implement all the suggestions in the acoustic report.
Actually so it's already there we're working on the carpeting or the rubbering on the floor and we'll make sure that it will be installed also right away and the next things were acoustical panels and also what professional, acoustical professional told news that right now we exit the door right in front of the neighbors windows on the 15th street and what we will need is we basically have to have the awnings that will be more of a fabric and we can close that exit and we can have a different accident [Music] throughout the wall, but the cane that has to go through the ob, the department of buildings.
Also which his community, so he course that noise, but he needs some time to make sure that we do it in the right way.
The atmosphere is a quiet one, okay, bert any questions from committee members yeah who went to see this frank?
We went right yeah, so I've seen the pictures and it looks like it could work and there's a lot of support from the community.
One was for testimony and then the other one was the regular stuff, all right, I'll look for it, but if you guys have looked at it, I'm fine with that I mean for me: there's a lot of support from immediate neighbors.
I'm I'm very impressed with this applicant seems like she's going above and beyond, and I think this is the type of applicant that we want our community.
Second, all right, let's just to summarize so the steps will be that they're going to implement the recommendations of the acoustic report and then I'd like to carry over three from our temporary letter.
Doors really are to be closed, except when used for entering and exiting, and all patrons must be seated you, okay with those and the recommendations of the acoustic report, will be implemented you tomorrow and yes, absolutely, okay.
26Th, okay, the other thing I'd say so you don't keep coming back to us and we can include, as part of this motion, is that our temporary approval continues to be extended, as the sla extends your ability to use the very art.
If you look at the front of the restaurant out front, yes yeah they have a table and then they have the sidewalk board even out farther the a-frame and then the benches, none of that's legal at all.
So what don giovanni is trying to do right now is it is going through some sort of restructuring based on the covet period, as you can imagine most places along 10th avenue, I'm sure you've seen you know, closed signs or for sale signs, so don giovanni is trying to adjust that by upgrading their license to a full liquor license to be able to serve their patrons.
Also they have a full liquor license, so we want to be able to match the two up so that they can provide the same services the same goods to the patrons, not only uptown but also in chelsea, and, I think the uptown location.
We decided basically after 30 years that we wanted to file for a different class application because, first and foremost it's been our restaurant was hit.
My 44th street location was broken into twice and we had to open and close and we were looted, and I can't even begin to tell you how much that cost us in expenses, but we decided that we thought that we really needed some extra income because we don't think we'll survive and although the chelsea location remained open throughout covid for delivery, we now see that a lot of the clientele from empire diner who's, my next-door neighbor.
Their patrons were always coming there for alcoholic beverages, including dining, and they were coming to us thereafter, looking for another place to have an aperol spritz or whatever they were looking for, and I couldn't provide it, and I realized that I was also losing a lot of clientele and because of that you know I decided to file for to apply for another class of application and we're there 30 years.
Nor did I ever care to have a liquor license for 30 years, because we were fine with wine and beer, but we are suffering right now and we are trying to do anything to add into our income.
You know, we've been a very vital part as a matter of fact to the neighborhood and to the community doing a lot of different kinds of contributions throughout our 30 years, and so I mean, I guess, that's all right.
I just wanted to make sure you understood that the way we the way we deal with closing hours, it's the time the place is empty of patrons.
You know, I'm not gonna have my guys hang around if they could get on the train and go home quickly, yeah, but this will be a permanent change to your license and hopefully we'll see the other side of covid someday.
So post covid, you're, okay with are the customers being gone by 10 or 11, or if you want to make it 11 across the board, we can make it 11 across the board, but I will I do know I'm going to be closing earlier because, regardless of anything, I'm still also paying hourly.
So first as the committee member I'm totally in favor of this application, and I think you might want to bring your hours up to the weekend to 12 park at night.
You do not have to stay open, but if you do two years from now, you can so don't limit yourself that way, I think thursday, friday saturday, you may want to stay later and you don't.
I was just suggested by london, terrace association and the community board that I should probably think of extending thursday, friday and saturday to 12 p.m, and I think she's right because I don't know what's in the near future, and if these the this turns around, I might be stuck with hours that I might regret- and I do agree with her, although I tend to be shy from those hours I'd like to have some leeway, if you don't mind that I make that change right now, nope, not at all so.
We've been getting a lot of questions from the community about whether liquor licenses can be transferred if the entire business is being sold.
You know in the community board and in the neighborhood we really love our neighbors and we're not in it about.
My family is not about that, but to us it was always about our neighbors and the community, and you know a day like today, just so sort of shows us and my family, what impact we've made, and you don't always hear it every day until you know you have this moment that you're in a group and wow, you know it really means everything all the hard work and coming together and sandy and any catastrophe that we've had.
If you could unmute brandon faye, you hear me unmuted, okay, great, thank you so we're a small italian restaurant.
Our hours of operation are going to be monday to friday, 11 45 to 1 am and saturday and sunday 10 a.m to 1 a.m. There'll be light ambient background music from an ipod or an ipad in the background, no open windows or doors, and we have no outside seating.
I have any questions from committee members hinga, sorry I mean so you do a lot of takeout and I know it's a small space.
I was actually in the neighborhood for about 20 years, where I worked and operated another restaurant for close to 20 years and then moved to open up this little small, intimate restaurant and so just to answer your question about bikes.
Oddly enough right after the pandemic started, I fed the chelsea fdmy the emts on 20 third street off of I think that's off of whatever is that ninth, I believe between 10th and 11th, maybe that emt station yeah so yeah a lot of my experiences with intimate locations these days and dealing with really culturally rich, like neighborhoods.
Okay, I mean you can apply to the city christine's, not here or she would be telling you how to apply for a bike corral in front of the restaurant, because there are a lot of bikes chained up to everything on that block.
Okay, great thanks, so you might want to apply for one in the street and what that is.
Can I ask a question yeah just to take a moment to educate myself and if it's inappropriate, please let me know, but does the 500-foot rule apply to an establishment like this or a request because you are 500, foot rule does not apply to beer and wine licenses.
I asked because it's next to liz lizzie and there are a number of things on the block that are yes, okay, thank you, an appropriate question, your first question on the committee.
Through thursday, would they be willing on maybe lowering that to like 11 or 12 on monday through thursday and then sorry sunday to thursday and then thursday, friday saturday doing 1am it and plus it's never had a liquor license there yeah I mean absolutely.
We usually do thursday friday saturday for the weekends, okay cool, and there are a lot of other bars and restaurants there that are take out and open late.
Bye. Okay, the last item on the agenda other than what we're going to talk about transfers of licensing is item number four again a new liquor license.
So they're gonna follow what this neighborhood is used to and what they want, except they're, bringing a very good restaurant here and I'd like to turn it over to mr joaquin martinez just to introduce himself.
You hear me now: yeah hi, my name is joki martinez and I'm the owner of this new place, we're really we're trying to open.
Given some information about mr martinez and the landlord is very satisfied with his background and the background of the people that he works with and so we're waiting on actions of the liquor authority, because without their approval we can't even if we wanted to, cannot get a license.
I cannot tell you, okay, I think we do not, and you probably know this george.
The place across the street is grandfathered in because the law changed about ten years ago and mandated the three-foot service aisle, so that's possible and the sidewalk cafe would yours wouldn't be grandfathered in, because there's been this gap of you know, whatever the rules will be, we will follow okay, but for purposes of this application it would simplify things if we eliminate it that doesn't prohibit them from participating in open restaurants and all that that's a complicated.
Okay, appreciate that this place also has the peculiarity of having a sort of separate smaller doorway establishment on 44th street right operated, as usually as a pizza place.
Yes, in the concept that we were opening, we were serving empanadas familiar with the turnover appetizers and we want to do like a big list of empanadas and a south america style street food, which is very interesting to sell it to grow okay, but it's got to be separate.
We will do something great, and it's going to be a great restaurant, where you know everyone can come okay.
They want the our usual stipulations about doors and windows closed whenever there's music inside and by no later than 10 p.m, 11 p.m. They asked for an acoustic study, no illuminated signage on 44th street or on the corner, inga christine's stipulation about a storm enclosure and that you attend block association meetings.
So my personal feeling is, you know, I'm never against the 4am, but for a new establishment with new owners and if they had a 4am I would go for it, but I would want to do the hours that were previously licensed.
Then they stayed open there yeah I'm 2am and midnight, but I wouldn't want to increase from what was already there until they've shown that they're good neighbors anybody else on the committee.
If they could be shut anytime, there's music or just really anytime at all, and then I agree: it's a new business saturday, friday 2 a.m. Let them show that they're a good, neighbor and then come back and extend the hours.
Anybody other committee members know anyone from the community have their hand raised.
The back room has was a pizza for many long time here, right until the last, even the last people used that for that purpose and what was said before, if I understood it, I wanted to make it clear that the license here applies to the whole premises, including the back and that's why they have wine beer, you know and whatever they conserve, they can serve there in the back.
That's the way this restaurant has been set up right yeah.
Fine, it looks like the consensus of the committee would be for to give you the out the hours for the main operation of midnight monday to thursday 2 a.m, friday and saturday and 1 a.m on sunday, okay and then for the 44th street side establishment you close at 11 p.m, monday to thursday and midnight friday and saturday, it's okay and again, as you heard from their earlier discussion, this means closed and vacated of patrons sunday through, for you said monday, close sunday at 11, 2, decide aside, we I think it was.
It doesn't work if they're open you're going to hear the music yeah.
Has that kind of a frontal structure and has music every applicant agrees to that, because whether I'm sitting on the edge or standing right next to the outdoor window, you can't stop the music from going outside if the doors are open.
Okay, george, do you have any sense when you're gonna hear from the sla about the two-year thing?
What's going on it's hard to really get too much information, but we're hoping it'll come sooner than later, so you're going to wait to file until you hear no we're going to file first here, all right, we'll take that chance, okay, so everyone's okay with all those steps, I read yes, yeah!
If I want to get out of the business, I can, you know maybe sublet the premises, I can sell the furniture, but I cannot transfer the liquor license to a new proprietor.
You know several places in the alcohol law says no license shall be transferable or assignable, except in certain changes of corporate form [Music].
So it's never really a sale of, and you can only get a temporary if you've applied for new license and if the place had been open within the past 30 days right.
You pick up a lot of debts that you don't want to know about so, but you can theoretically buy the corporation and the license does stay with the corporation, but the new people have to be approved by the liquor authority and it had- and it goes be, it goes to the board if eighty percent of its sale of more than eighty percent eighty percent or more of the shares it goes to the community board, it has to be notified, that's the current rule, but that's still.
