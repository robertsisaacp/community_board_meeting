And I guess we're ready to go well. Let me welcome everyone officially good evening. My name is lowell kern, I'm the chair of manhattan, community board 4, and welcome to our small business support and reopening forum back in march. When the pandemic first hit and governor cuomo shut everything down in new york city. There were a number of forms that were held in late march and early april by other community boards and by elected officials about how to navigate the shutdown, but nobody was doing anything. I realized in early june about reopening, and so I asked the chair of our small business working group, bert lazarin, to reform his working group and try and see what we could do to help out the small business community in our neighborhoods chelsea, hudson yard, sales, kitchen and citywide. The task force met throughout working group, not a task force met throughout june and july, which resulted in this evening's forum. The focus is to better understand what resources and initiatives are currently available for supporting small businesses and they as they reopen and to highlight what needs improvement. I know we have some representatives of our elected officials on. I saw a couple of names. I saw someone from senator hoyleman's office, hi maya, so they will be aware of what the small business community needs as well, and if legislation is needed, we can help push that through at least try to push that through along with tonight's event, we are going to be distributing a survey. The information for the survey will be listed in the chat and on the cb4 website, which you can find very easily at mcb4.nyc. That url will bounce you over to the official site. The event and the survey, however, are not the end of this working groups work, but will rather act as a road map for what will be recommended to the board and the elected representatives, and if there are more actions that we can take as a community board to support small businesses, we will do that. I want to thank bert and the rest of the group for holding the meetings and putting together tonight's forum and with that I'm going to hand it off to our district manager, jesse beaudine, to explain tonight's agenda and how the event will run jesse. It's all yours good evening, everybody, I'm jesse, bowden district manager of manhattan community board for this forum has been recorded and transcribed and streamed live on our youtube channel it'll run as follows. We ask that everybody. Besides this, the speaker or presenter, stay muted throughout the meeting and when you're called on you'll be able to unmute yourself once you're done speaking, please remove yourself. So therefore, any background noise doesn't interfere with the next presenter. This is in webinar format, so the only people that you'll be seeing on the screen are the panelists. The public are an attendees. An attendee mode. Attendees are able to submit questions through the q, a tab to the panelists, which is or by if or by raising your hand your virtual hand. In the participant section, the q, a tab, is on the bottom of your screen and the your virtual hand raising function is under the panelist section, if you're by chance, calling in through the phone line that you want to do star nine for raising your hand as you will not be able to type in a question through the q. A the agenda goes as follows: introductions by lowell kern manhattan, community board, chair review of agenda and forum format by district manager, a brief presentation by nyc small business services, followed by a another brief presentation by business improvement, district association, then there'll be a a panel moderated by bert lazarin and then a public q. A portion of the of the event then handed back to bird for action items and thank yous. [Music] attendees are welcome to begin placing questions into the q a section by pressing the q a tab at the bottom of this screen, as they roll in chris lebron and dolores rubin from our board will be putting those together and getting ready for the q a portion. The chat function should be used for disseminating information out to the public and should not be used to ask questions of the panel that should be done in the q a and should definitely not be used to express any hostile or offensive commentary. If that is done, we will provide a warning if it continues we'll have to remove that person like chair well, kern stated. The focus of this forum is to better understand what the resources and initiatives are currently available for supporting small businesses while they reopen and highlight the gaps in support. But, however, we are very much aware of the recent increase in quality of life and public safety issues in the district. So while it is not the focus of this form today, we want to make sure that this is one of the. If this is one of the reasons you're attending the forum, you have some resources available now for any non-nypd related city service needs, such as sanitation, transportation, consumer affairs department, environmental protection. You can contact me at my email, I'll put it in the chat it's j, beaudine, v-o-d-I-n-e, cb.nyc.gov and for any nypd or crime related concerns. We always recommend that you attend your precincts community council meeting and also make contact with your precincts neighborhood coordination officer supervisor. I will be posting the link to the nypd precinct map website, which gives you all of that information. If you are currently having difficulty getting a response from one of your precincts, I can help with you connect to connect you with the right contact at the precinct, so I'll be putting those both in the chat and with that I hand that it over to small business services for their brief presentation, followed by the nyc bid association good evening. Everyone and thank you to community board 4 and my fellow panelists for having me here this evening. My name is eric parker and I'm an outreach liaison with the department of small business service services. Excuse me, I have a short presentation and after which time I will take questions if you have them pertaining to your business, if you currently reopened or you're in the process of reopening I'd, be more than happy to answer any questions you have jesse. Do you have the powerpoint up? I do give me one moment. I just realized I'm on the wrong screen. Sorry, I apologize how's everyone doing tonight. I hope everyone is well and safe, very good. Okay. There we go okay again, my name is eric parker and I am an outreach liaison with the department of small business services. My team is responsible for promoting and marketing the programs that we have at sbs, which includes over 50 services and programs offered to small startup and operating businesses. Since the onset of covet, you can go back to the beginning yeah since the beginning, since the onset of the covert and the quarantine we have transitioned to a remote access and to we were providing remote services to small businesses next slide, please I'm just going to give you a brief overview of the services that we are still providing here at sbs. First of all, we are the department of small business services and we provide assistance to job seekers looking for work, as well as small businesses who want to start and operate a business, and we also support neighborhoods throughout the five bowls. So in all aspects of economic development, sbs is there to help individuals, small businesses, as well as neighborhoods, I'm going to go over some of the brief briefly, some of the programs that we're offering at sbs or we are continuing to offer at sbs. Since we transitioned to a remote to remote access, we are still providing business course assistance more now than ever. Since the onset of covert many small businesses were not prepared to start an online presence, so we're providing training in that area. For those businesses who were not up to speed on marketing their businesses online, we continued to provide financing assistance. Aside from the assistance that was being provided by the sba, which is the small business administration not to be confused with sbs, we were helping to promote the ppp program as well as the idle loan program, but we also continue relationships with over 40 micro lenders to help those small businesses get the financing they need to restart open and expand in the area of recruitment. We got it an exorbitant number of requests from from small businesses who are looking for skilled staff. Our first one sentences are still remotely helped place over 600 jobs in the last few weeks to over 160 small businesses at reopening. So in that area, we're still I'm going to provide assistance to those small businesses that will be need for staffing, you're breaking up a lot. I wasn't sure if other folks are hearing or having the same problem, I'm sorry is it better? Now, I'm so sorry yeah. It sounds like this sounds a little bit better, but you might want it to slow down a little bit too. Okay, I'm sorry yeah I've been having some glitches with my sound system, but I will try to slow down and be more yeah. Okay. So again, so we have been partnering with other regulatory agencies in providing assistance to small businesses in a number of different areas when navigating to the government buses. We are also providing information for small businesses that want to sell the government contract opportunities are more than ever now available to small businesses that are looking to do business with the city of new york next class. So, as information is changing very rapidly, you can text code to 69262 for up to date, information as things have changed, or you can go to my website, nmic.gov with 19 biz, to get a full list of all the services that we are offering at sbs for information or assistance on getting health guidelines. You can go to the department of health's website, which is nyc.gov, slash, coronavirus next line. Please, during the phase of the openings, we will host a string of webinars for specific phases, one phase two place to meet businesses. Many businesses have signed on to our to get guidance on best practices to reopening safely. The state, of course, has deadlines in each business sector, some safety mandatory, potentially opening your business typically. So in the last few weeks we were hosting phase one two and three workshops. In fact, we held one for the personal care industry and we had a very good turnout there, a lot of announcements and beauty, salons and other kinds of personal care industry, businesses on learning guidelines from us, as well as from the states okay. So we will continue to roll out phase reopening, whereas we will continue to host these australians, where we get partners here all agencies to join us to provide updated information on the services that sba is providing, as well as the other city agencies. I have a colleague with me tonight. Are you here good evening? This is microphone from sbs pleasure to join you all this evening. Okay, mikey I'll finish up in two seconds. Next slide just want to make sure you're on board: oh yeah, okay. So again, I can't stress enough the importance of filing safety tips, which includes social distancing. Of course, personal protective ppp ppe is very important to keep this disability from the spread of carbon virus health screenings, as well as hygiene and communications. We're stressing those points when small businesses are starting to transition to reopening. If you need assistance from any of our representatives, we have launched a hotline. Michael fung is a representative from our hotline he's also one of our compliance advisors he's going to talk a little bit about some of the services that sbbs is doing all right. So thank you eric so again, thank you all for inviting me to join this webinar meeting. My name is michael fong, I'm actually the director of compliance and growth from sbs. So thank you eric for the introduction. So what happened during their pandemic is that we have adapted to a new program which is the sbs hotline, so this hotline is primarily designated for to answer business owners questions when it comes to reopening, as well as the ppe, finance and assistance legal assistance as well as recruitment. So we have broken down into these five categories. So these are the primary questions that open time when business owners are calling, they try to ask us for questions so going to the financial assistance, so people are trying in the past try to apply for different programs and they struggle to get the loans and grants. So we you know sbs also has a business solution center, where we refer these businesses to speak with any financial experts. In order to do that, they have to go on to our website to sign up or to fill out the workform so that the financial expert will be reaching out to them. That's one of the main questions that coming from the business owner. The second question I mean second category that we come across will be the reopening guideline, so there are still currently some businesses that are not allowed to open this. At this moment, for example, restaurant businesses are still currently allowed to offer delivery. Dining I mean dining is not allowed, except they apply for open restaurant seating programs do dot. I also am in charge of the program in terms of offering virtual consultation for these businesses who try to stay in compliance when it comes to open restaurant seating program. So that's another service that we offer the consultation is done virtually. We also have a team of compliance advisor who can speak multiple language. I personally speak three different chinese dialects with with my other team, who also speak russian spanish and haitian creole. So this is another service that I would like to introduce to you guys, which came live since last week and also when it comes to legal assistance. Just so let you know that small business services used to offer commercial lease assistance program. However, due to the big budget constraint, it's no longer over commercial lease assistance. However, sbs is able to connect business owner to non-profit organizations such as city bar justice centers, as well as legal aid society. So when business owners are asked seeking for help when it comes to dispute between their commercial landlord and the tenant, we oftentimes refer them to these two organizations. When it comes to ppe, which specifically face covering, we also have an interactive map which allows business owner to look through their map to identify the nearest business improvement. District location for face covering our city government also maintain a website which allows business owner to access in terms of cleaning supply, sanitizer and other equipment. So there is a website available and I will be more than happy to share that information with you all. Also. We sbs also has the workforce one center, which allows employers to seek for qualified employees or if there are any workers who are seeking for job opportunity, they can actually reach out to us and it is available on our sbs website where they can access their information. So these are the main categories that open time our hotline group team are mainly handling these questions from business owner on daily basis. So with that said, I'm going to take a pause here and eric. If you have any comments or anything would like to add, feel free to do so. Thank you, michael. Thank you. So much next slide. Please just want to give you the hotline number. If you have any questions about the services mentioned today, you can certainly contact our homeland, which is 888 for nyc, with questions you opportunity of the services of programs we spoke about today and we'll be happy to take any questions now eric. I think, we'll hold on questions for the panel discussion and then the q a at the end, if that's, okay, very good, okay, thank you very much for the presentation move on to the new york city bid association. Can everyone hear me I can hear you. I believe everybody can hear you: okay, good, I'm bob benfatto, I'm the president of the hudson yards hell's, kitchen alliance, which is a bid, and it's in the hudson yards house, kitchen area between 42nd and 30th street, roughly speaking from 9th avenue, both sides of ninth to the north side, the north to the east side of 11th, it's which includes primarily hudson yards, and, I guess the southern tip portion of hell's kitchen. But bids do a lot of you know work with businesses and in areas we do a lot of we maintain a park. We do a lot of work on sanitation, supplemental sanitation work, but we have a contract of sbs new york city sbs. So one of the things we don't do with an individual bid is advocate or lobby, but there is a bid association of all 76 bids in all five boroughs that represent about 93 000 businesses and the association does advocate and lobby for things, and I happen to be one of the co-chairs of the association along with a woman, jennifer talcik, who is the head of the jerome gunn hill bid in north bronx. Recently, we issued out a statement from the bid association on ways to go forward to help small businesses and the city's economy, and that's there's nine pieces to it. I guess you can go to the next slide. Yeah, there's! That's in a nutshell: the nine, the first one is to have some person instead of having all the different agencies working separately on some of the same things that have one person overseeing the thing who can call all the stuff together and you can have more of a streamlined leadership. Second piece is to have some sort of rent and mortgage relief to the commercial corridors. You don't really give it a recommendation on what we suggest: public funding, mediation, eviction, moratorius, rent and tax relief and there's more to open up a discussion going forward. I mean it's a touchy issue, because the city of new york needs real estate taxes because that's pretty much what funds the city budget. So it's a tough issue. The third one is: we want to expand the open restaurants, not so much just because it's all restaurants. Now we want to expand to other retail, to let all the retail go out and maybe set up in front of their stores, things that they could sell, and you would need to allow that to have to go deal with the stoop law of the city, because you're not supposed to sell and exchange money outside of the store like that, and you would have to get if you did do it right now. It's like 3 200 a day in permitting fees, you'd have to give the city, so we would want to see that rate waived. The fourth one, as you can see there, is that maintain existing siting criteria for mobile vendors and enforce current regulations. The problem with vending right now is that city of new york took the nypd off of regulating vending and when the vending thing was first started, nypd was never supposed to actually enforce the rules and regulations. She just ended up going that way under this under the city code. All vending goes through consumer affairs unless it's food and then it goes through health and those are the agencies that give you your permit and, as a result, those are the agencies that have the power of enforcement. So you don't necessarily need the police. You could just have an enforcement unit in consumer affairs or in the health department doing the job. Also what's as of right now, no one's doing it. The police were told not to do it and no one is empowered. Although they have the power, no one's told them to go out and enforce it. So we don't have a negative effect on it yet because, for the same reason why restaurants are hurting, there's not a lot of people on the street, buying street food or buying stuff, but it will become an issue when and if we start to get back to larger numbers that are walking around the street buying things, the fifth one, probably not exactly a favorite one for a community board, is to streamline the straight liquor authority process to make it easier to get your liquor license and to also allow some temporary more temporary licenses for people who want to do stuff outside if they get approval from the city. The sixth one is to activate a sales tax exemption. It's a similar like the clothing one they have. When you go back to school up to a certain amount, there's no sales tax on it. That would be for the state to do it wouldn't be the city. The state would have to do that. We hope to push that actually in late august, when the federal government, as we know now, is negotiating between the two parties as to what type of stimulus backers they have put together when and when that's done and the state sees how much money it gets. The state will probably regroup and meet again legislatively up in orbiting, probably the end of august early september, and that would be the time we would start pushing that and if the seventh one is the city should support non-profit organizations who want to create markets and pop-up venues, primarily we're looking to do that in parks or in plazas. Those are city properties and if there's any revenue involved in that normally you'd have to go to fcrcs the franchise commission, which I did for my job and it took two years or you have to pay a large sum to sappos. So we want to don't have to do that. Do something more like weekend walks and you allow certain activities in parks and plazas that they normally wouldn't have been a temporary basis. The eighth. What the eighth part is make patrons responsible for their own actions and not the business owner. There was a, I think. That's the state liquor authority announced that if anyone is found with a drink within a hundred feet of a restaurant, they would they were gonna, find the restaurant for it. But there was no guarantee that he got the drink from the restaurant. He was 100 feet away. He could have got it someplace else, so we wanted to try and make it so that patrons are responsible too, for what they for their actions. And the ninth is our usual, continue review and revise outdated and burdensome rules and laws. I know a ton of business bid, execs that are in talking forever and which rules and should be revised, but we won't have to get into that, but just trying to look to ease the regulatory burden on small businesses, and that was our statement. We got some decent press coverage, even if we even got a daily news op-ed out of it- and you don't have to like all nine, but I hope people like some of it. I'm happy to answer any questions and look forward to the panel. Thank you, okay, I'd like to thank bob and eric, and now I invite you to join the full panel. All six and any questions will be coming to the panel both from we have some prepared questions. I think you might have seen some of them and then we'll have some q a that dolores and chris are coordinating you've all met bob. You all met eric. We now have four other panelists I'd like to introduce wendy gonzalez I'd say where she is on my screen, but I have no idea if she's in the same location on your screen, so I'm not going to mention where I see her, but you can raise your hand wendy. I think you just did wendy gazelles is the small business marketing manager for google she's, been with google for 10 years she's, also on the board of the manhattan chamber of commerce and we're lucky to have her on manhattan community board, for we also have nathaniel garber there he is, he is in the family. Business gob is hardware it's in chelsea. It was not originally, it was in the village, it's been around for five generations: family owned. That's an amazing history there to have a family business for five generations, because most family businesses, usually after the third they implode, the siblings, can't get along. We also have maya, joseph from sullivan street bakery she's, the co-owner of the sullivan street bakery, which we're lucky in our community board district to have two locations, one in hell's kitchen and one in chelsea, and then we also have without six is the co-owner of the chris chase hair salon mitch. Where are you mitch there? He is there. He is raising his hand, he's almost been 30 years. He lives and works in chelsea and with the hair salon, which is also chelsea, 9th avenue between 21st and 22nd. I want to welcome you all in terms of the panel we're going to throw out some questions. Remember. Our focus here is on re-opening during this, at least in new york, at least at this time of year, the waning of the pandemic. We don't know what november is going to be like we only can talk about now. I'm gonna say self-regulate, we're only six, just don't talk over each other respect each other and we can go from there. I just like to start how this reopening is going. What are the biggest challenges you have of small businesses? What are the biggest challenges you have in reopening? What are the challenges you might see coming up that you haven't yet met, and I just want to remind you. I hope it's the last time I'll have to remind you when you start speaking, unmute go for it hey. I can start challenges. Well, you know. As we know, businesses have many challenges during this reopening phase, but I think one of the biggest challenges that they're facing now is the limitation on occupancy. As we know, small businesses in the city of new york really thrive on high occupancy customers coming into their places in order to realize the profit right to meet the monitors, and I think the limitation on the number of people that can actually come and actually come and to enter a business at any given time is going to really be a hindrance to businesses, realizing a profit going forward. Going in the near future, I think, even when these regulations start to lighten up and lift, I think public's confidence in gathering in the public is going to still linger and we were really kind of concerned about that aspect, and so for that reason I think we're trying to do the best we can to educate small businesses early on taking those safety precautions to really really flattening the curve and keeping the levels down of the kobe 19 virus. I think what points you're raising eric is very important because most street businesses [Music] small businesses at street level, retail restaurant bar those kinds of businesses depend upon densities of pedestrians density of people around and the model that most small businesses have had in new york is based on that model and now we're confronted we're all confronted with something different. How does that work like for the bakery maya? Well, we see it in two different ways at the bakery, because, where we have two retail businesses, but the majority of our business is wholesale. So in the retail business we still have a relatively high volume of people coming in, but now we're turned into policemen, which is really stressful, because we are suddenly responsible for making sure that there's only a few people in the store at a time that everyone's wearing a mask that everyone's socially distant, that everyone's actually wearing their masks correctly, which is incredibly difficult for a lot of people and that act of policing throughout the day is really difficult. On the whole. Sorry go ahead, so this is one of the challenges we're facing. I saw nathaniel, you were shaking your head. Yes, yeah it's so you know my business is essential, so you know, fortunately we were not forced to close at all, although the first couple of months of this it was you know, a ghost town, but I can say that throughout this entire process from the beginning, when there were only a handful of people and up till today, you know maya is 100 spot on it's such a huge, it's so stressful and on top of on top of just dealing with clients, you know we all have employees that are on the spectrum of how paranoid they are about contracting the virus themselves. It's hard to it's hard to give customer service when you have to be confrontational to every third person, that's coming in, not wearing the mask, and then sometimes clients will have issues with how I'm wearing a mask or how one of my colleagues is wearing a mask. It's a it's very fraught to say the least. You know you want your people to be. People are going to spend money if they're comfortable. You know I may have someone in the store that we're comfortable with each other, but we don't know who's going to walk in the door any at the next moment and like if people are all over the map on this, and I think new yorkers for the most part are respectful about doing it. But it's not people are not. They don't have the habit down yet I mean I've seen people walk into my store wearing a mask just to take it off so like breathe in the cool recycled air from the air conditioning, which I fully get the instinct to do that. But then you just shake your head or I've. Had someone pull their mask down to sneeze, I mean it's. What do you do you just let it go and then they put their mask right back on, but it's very it's real tricky and it's unprecedented, and I can't imagine any of my fellow panelists have any answers, but I'm sure you all share that experience mitch. You have a business where there's more than myo and nathaniel, we have very intimate contact with your customers. Yeah mine might be a little different in the mine's by appointment. Only so I don't have just random people, you know coming into shop really so they're all told ahead of time every bit of the regulation, so they come knowing they're getting their temperature taken. I'm asking all the standard questions so a little different than having just a straight up retail store yeah, so the policing part of it is literally is asking the gender the questions taking the temperature and having them wait until you know when it's time, so I'm a little different. I've been a little a little. I don't know it's just a different kind of a setup than you guys have as far as retail goes. I very little are probably know just walk in you know: business people just walk in to get a haircut or get their hair colored. It's an intimate, it's a more hands-on thing, so you know I haven't had as much of the policing or that being an issue. I've had more of an issue of people just being not just scared. Just fear of you know of being that close to something having someone touching them ditching their hair. So but that'll you know again. Hopefully that will get to a point where that'll pass and that'll you know so yeah. This is a major challenge of how to navigate the new health new health, self-imposed health rigs. Wendy. Have you come across any of this with people that you're in contact with what I've heard from other small businesses, some of the same? What the other panelists have talked about. I think there's also just a general confusion, so I think with regulations changing, I think also regulations are different city state to state, there's just general confusion. So what we google talks a lot about, is just the importance of communicating to your customers and over communicating to your customers. So what's on your website, what is on your social media? What's on your business profile on google, about the expectations you have for customers coming into the store? It's not a perfect system, but at least you can do some of that expectation setting right from the start so that you have maybe fewer surprises and can have fewer of those kind of policing moments that some other panels have talked about bob yeah, it's one of the bigger complaints we get from the businesses in the bit in my bid district about having to police behavior of the patrons, some of whom don't behave. Well it. I know that other bids have the problem when they do outdoor dining and they do out in the street, they close the street. You can't close the street at 10 o'clock. If you want to because people will not go home, they have a lot of problems with that. So, yes, the self-policing is a is a big issue. So that's a major challenge in opening up and maintaining this as you go forward, any other challenges or anything you see as you going along that might be coming up on the horizon. Well, we're we never closed. We've been open the whole time, so we you know it's we've just been continually expanding slowly, but now we're at a place where we're wondering if we're going to have to close again. So it seems like everything we do. Is we look one way and say well, we could expand this way and then we had to look the other way and say, or we could just have to shut everything down in a month, and it would be really helpful to have some kind of guidance about if there is another shutdown what it would look like and how we could plan for that yeah. That sort of slides right into my next question about resources and services provided by the city in this state. I mean: what are you finding from the city in this day or from the bids or from other private groups like chamber of commerce? Are you providing? Are you finding that resources, or would you like more from them from the city, the state, the other agencies, to talk about guidance? I was able to get some good guidance from the chelsea village chelsea chamber of commerce. When I had legal questions, especially when it was came down to all the different loans that you know, sba was putting out, you know, can I apply for this and that what if I get approved for this and that it was really helpful to be able to, you know, call someone knowledgeable and they directed me to two different people. I sent a couple emails I mean within a couple days. I had the answers to all my questions. You know thumbs up for that. That was great and of course, funding is, you know, is always nice, but in this situation is so much bigger than the money we've seen that I've seen available like from the federal level down, although every dollar is appreciated, I mean the rents, we all pay the kind of density we need to. You know to just to break even it's extensive and like the real estate in the city, like is already maxed out to squeeze every one of those dollars right out to you know to property owners, and you know the people that are that own the leases. So it's certainly a challenge so like the money does help, but you know when that ppp came out the even the division of where funds are allowed to go. I mean every new york business owner, you know, scoffed at like oh great, like 40, probably wouldn't even cover a month's rent, and that's where you need to help. If you're going to stay open, they're employees, you need to be able to maintain. You know your core expenses of what your rent, I'm sure it's number one yeah this is. That brings up right if a core issue, I think, for small businesses rent lease a mortgage, if you own your own space, have you three of you who have you have your own business or right up front or wendy or bob or eric? Have you heard about modified leases, modified rents, going into renegotiate, saying you know this is the way it's going now. Our lease was based on the density a year ago, and now we don't have it anymore. We don't has anything changed in between you and your landlords. A lot of I know from on the bid side, a lot of land. A lot of landlords have been negotiating these renegotiating leases. Some have also have been terrible, but the vast majority have been renegotiated, especially in the commercial thing, because if they throw a tenant out, it's not getting replaced by anyone anytime soon, so it's more in his interest or her interest to cut a deal. So what can you give me and then it is just to leave the place by itself, because I'm not going to find anyone to render right rented to at this moment, we've had good experiences and also have heard that there are landlords willing to negotiate, which has been helpful both for us and for our wholesale customers at our restaurants and need to renegotiate with their landlords to survive. One of our bakeries, we own the property. So we need to negotiate with the city of new york, because one of our single biggest operating expense right now is property taxes. How do you negotiate over property taxes? Well, we don't, but in for in terms of things that would help that's the thing that would help the most. You know our sales levels are down by a six from their normal amounts, and our fixed costs are not that property tax issue would help. I think, most of us because the you know one of my stores, the property taxes are up like from my most recently signing property taxes are up, I don't know like 30 or 40 percent. I mean oh, my property tax liability in that lease is more than one month's rent and that's for our west village location, which is probably the most per square foot. You know in the city, and it's outrageous you know like if the city wasn't so dependent on property taxes revenue, they could maybe offer a rebate to the landowner that you know to the property owner. You know in the event that they say have to pass on the savings directly to the tenant. You know like maybe the city should be rolling back their tax base to the year that leases were signed so that renters aren't paying the differential, which is the boiler plate in just about every commercial lease, but differential. We pay is outrageous and that's not the landlord. That's the city steadily, raising this property taxes on that particular property every year since 2015., so that would really work for all of us. Open needs might be some kind of property tax. I don't know what the word would be re, not a rebate, property tax, temporary reduction change in valuation, because correctly, if I'm wrong, a lot of that increase in the property tax is not from the property tax rate, necessarily it's from the valuation of the building and that valuation of the building is where your increase shows, and now your the buildings aren't as valuable. I'm making the argument, the buildings aren't as valuable because your business is less than it was before you're talking about an abatement innovating. Thank you bob. Is that one of your nine? No, but we wouldn't be opposed to our tax effort. Oh, is that maya, I'm sorry who is about but wendy has something to say no go for my. If the city were willing to work with small businesses, there are also property owners or the landlords to small businesses on property tax issues. That would be really helpful. Yeah 100 agree. This is a major issue here. I think a lot of this is going to rest on the funding the state gets because I saw today and then on gothamist that cuomo said or has basically like threatened to raise state property taxes statewide. I don't know how that affects the city. You know of what relief the city could give on their end, but you know I don't know it might be moot, but it would be the single like in a broad stroke. The city could do a lot to help every single business in the city. If there was some kind of blanket abatement or task force to deal with just that issue other than taxes, which is major, are there other impediments to fully open that you're coming across because of city or state rigs? The enforcement of outside dining is making a lot of our wholesale customers really nervous because there are a lot of good operators out there and there are a lot of bad operators. You know and people are going crazy outside the restaurants, and so all restaurants are feel the threat of an imminent closure from the governor and that's for restaurant operators- terrifying, because that's all they have right now. If they have that- and you did say you have primarily now a wholesale business, not a walk in retail. Well, we we've always had both, but the majority like 95 of our business is wholesale generally right now most of our customers aren't open and the ones that are doing you know 10th, maybe of the business they were before and all of that is outside dining. Almost all of it. I'm sorry, but it feels to those of us who are out on dealing with the outside dining stuff that there just isn't a lot of enforcement like we're missing that from the city from the state from anybody. Do you mean enforcement on the way patrons interact and gather in clumps or on like the structures that, because I understand from the instructions, the structures I've heard a lot, there's a lot of enforcement on structures? Yeah, it's crazy thinking like mitch. Do you have any interaction with health department in terms of a salon and hair cutting or anything like that? You know we haven't yet and honestly I wouldn't mind if someone did come through just to make sure like I'm doing everything that you know dot gov nyc.gov says to do, but you know: there's been no one's come in, no one's had any kind of right. Now I've heard of other salons where people have come in, but not from the city or not from the state or whatever that and have reported salons not doing a proper job which that's just self-regulatory. I guess, but I've had no one come through from the health department or anything like that. So I'm yeah, you know I hope I'm doing all I need to do, but I don't know I hope. Maybe someone will come in. We haven't done any outdoor. We haven't clients. Ask we can do outdoor styling and coloring, and it's just we're not doing that, but I can see where some people are too scared to come back in. So that was one of your nine requests bob, if I remember that not only should restaurants permitted be permitted to do business outside, but retail and I never even thought like, but mitch. You just suggested getting my haircut done on the street, but I can understand. Yes, you won't be afraid to go inside yeah. It's also it's tough to cut hair and do color like that outside. If there's a slight breeze, it's kind of a mess so but yeah, you know going back the business model we referred to before you know built on pedestrian density and people walking in off the street. So your customer base in some ways is changing and it may not be changed only for them for these couple of months it may be for the next two years. Three years you know people may be afraid to walk in to get their hair cut, but people may be afraid to be in any kind of environment where there's more than one or two people. How have you changed your marketing and are you doing more stuff online or how are you? How are you changing your model and who you're looking to as customers and when the involvement you have many business interactions? Have you heard or eric? I can briefly jump in here. So we've seen a ton of creativity in how businesses have responded. A couple of the things that we've seen kind of across the board. One is reliance obviously on digital tools, but specifically video becoming more and more important, so a lot of businesses where you've required kind of a one-on-one kind of consultation. So even things like personal training right, which is such an in-person kind of business, we've seen that shift to video online on google we've actually now added a way on your business profile on google, which is just what shows your local business information you can now, as a business owner, add a direct link to have people sign up to do those kind of virtual classes or consultations whatever it may be, with you to rely on video we've also seen people do creative things by relying on gift cards and making that easier. So you can also add a direct link to buying a gift card or to go fund me things like that. We also see businesses doing interesting things like moving entire classes, even for kids online things like that, and then, of course like doing more to create appointments time. So if you still require something where someone's coming in whether it's a salon or whatnot, to make it very clear that you don't accept walk-ins at this time, which means communicating that online and making it easy for people to send sign on appointment time. All of that we've seen a lot of small businesses across the country doing and we've you know, developed some additional tools to make that a little easier as well. That's a lot. The creativity has been amazing. You know at a very challenging time it's been really inspiring to see what businesses are doing and then, as we now look forward and we're seeing these different phases of reopening, I mean I'm very curious to hear what my other panelists have said, that they've done. You know personally for their businesses or what they'd like to do, because I think that's. What we're also seeing is that there's so much room for innovation, so we'd love to hear that we run and maintain the park and have a number of things we used to do in the park like yoga and exercise and stuff. We ended up doing it all through zoom, virtually as opposed to in the parking. Actually at one point we had more people than we normally had when people were going to the park. I don't know if that would work with a hardware store, though yeah you know, we there's, you know even internet and phone hardware. Stuff is it's? Oh, it's always been a challenge, you know, so we haven't, I mean we're as accommodating as we can be. Certainly you know we will work with people that don't want to come into the store on the street or over the phone knowing they're right outside, but for the mo for the most part we I haven't noticed that either of our locations, especially our village store, which is so spacious, it's got these really tall ceilings and these big glass windows and when you're in there you don't feel as claustrophobic. So we as far as that we haven't, had to innovate too much. Although all kidding aside we've, I've been kicking around the idea of making. You know my father and my uncle, who would be like the old man, a hardware store guys making them available by zoom once a week for an hour just so. If people wanna like talk to the guys that, because they can't safely come back to work in any time in the near future, pre-existing conditions they're in an age demographic even without it that would be risky, but I'm certain that they've got the time and it might be nice just to kind of offer that I would set an ipad up here in the store for that. I need to talk to them about it, but other than that. The thing we're trying to do, which isn't necessarily an innovation but we're trying to make things as normal as possible, and I have had people say it's nice to do something that feels like a thing that I used to do before covet. Even if it's just a 10 minute. I need nuts and bolts, and I have a few random questions before I go like make a mess at home, and you know I think, there's something to be said for that. I wish there was more. You know in the virtual space for us to explore. I just don't know that it matches for the logistically for the kind of day-to-day client interactions we have here. Well, if we wanted each one of you wanted to leave us with a sentence or two of maybe what you've learned and what you still need. I think that might be helpful. You don't have to it's. I think it might be difficult. You know to condense, but if you could, maybe even we said what you've learned from up to now and what you still need, I mean I don't know what the solution is for this, but I can tell you that I've learned that way more new yorkers than I would have guessed are willing to up and leave. I was I'm shocked at the sheer numbers of people that, like would have told you beforehand that they're die hard new yorkers they're I mean I sell moving supplies non-stop the past few weeks. I am shocked and disappointed a little bit in my fellow new yorkers. I mean I like to get out of the city as much as the next person, but it's been really surprising. So I've learned that a lot of people that consider themselves new, yorkers and call themselves new yorkers were not fully committed, so yeah there's that that's a little depressing. I know, but it's I mean, I'm still surprised on a day-to-day basis and how many people are just leaving they're just packing up and they're gone. So what I think what I think what new york needs is a like an enthusiasm campaign, we're not the worst place in the country to be right now. I think we need to start reminding new yorkers that the place you were going is the next hot spot, and at least we had our act together from the beginning as much as humanly possible. Like that's. The message I would want to spread around is just wait, a minute, we're sorting it. Okay. Thank you. Anyone else! Oh no, along the same along kind of the same thing is. It is an interesting seeing how people different people react, and I really thought again. I thought new yorkers would be a lot more. You know, especially because it did seem well organized from the beginning of the state. I thought cuomo did a great job, I'm not sure it may affect the different businesses differently, but yeah. I learned a lot about people in the in their in their, I guess their nature, and how dealing with this with this has really affected them, and I just I didn't think that it would be. As I thought we would be a lot busier right from the beginning and we have not been as we've been okay, but I'm just saying I thought it would be a lot busier. I thought we'd have a lot more, just a lot more business. I thought, but you know it is what it is and we'll ride the wave until we can't ride any longer and yeah. So that's it learned a lot about sanitizing kind of about sanitizing. So we do is fog and spray, and you know that whole thing, but anyway, that's it. I think I would add is that, in addition to learning all sorts of new things about sanitizing and viruses, I've been like. I said I've been so impressed by so many small businesses and just being thrown into an unimaginably challenging time and how they've pivoted, how they've been resilient, you know and none of which they wanted to be. So I think what I've been very impressed with, along with you know, new sanitization processes and whatnot. I've been impressed. How many have been able to also jump into what may have been some uncomfortable waters even around just like digital tools and things like that, a lot of businesses that relied on foot traffic that just went away almost overnight and how they had to reach customers in a new way. So you know, I guess my one sentence summary would be. You know that there are resources and trainings that are available, whether through a company like google or whether they're chambers of commerce, through small business services, people who are experts and want to help and so to continue to reach out, because we one maybe have a resource to help you now and if we don't, we can build it, we can figure it out together. I'd like to say, I certainly think more conversations like this between agency representatives and the public small businesses is definitely something that can you know this is an unprecedented incident. This coronavirus, it's been lingering for a long time. It's having a lasting impact on small businesses and the city as a whole. The country is old, and I just think that more conversations like this can only help kind of help us understand what small businesses need and how we can better help small businesses so anytime, you want to have future meetings and future discussions be more than happy to come on, speak about more topics, talk about more solutions, talk about more programs. We have a new commissioner janelle dawes and he has a vision for recovery and which he'll be rolling out soon, and we have confidence that his vision is gonna, be going to take our best shot in helping small businesses recover during this economy. During this time, thanks maya bob well, I think one of the most surprising things for us in our position right now is that we're sort of desperate for enforcement and policing and guidance from city and state agencies- and it's we've always had you- know the existing rules and regulations that we know to follow and they're good, but now we're in a position where we kind of feel like we're making it up on our own. You know like we follow everything that we get, but we don't get that much so in terms of letting people into our store or employees sick policies, we feel like a lot of that is left to us, which we can do, but we'd feel a lot better. If we had someone telling us exactly what steps to follow and it's kind of the same thing with reopening and the possibility of a closure we're going with it, you know we know how to operate our business, we'll figure these things out, but we're it would be so nice to have more guidance, which is an unusual position for us guidance from city and state. Yes, okay, bob, I would say I learned that you don't need an office, you can work from home in certain jobs, it's easy to run a bid from home. I still need my operations guys to be in the district, but I only have to drive it once a week really. However, things have functioned. I never would have thought that before and the thing the other thing you need is that I think there could be more city coordination on things. I know the city is trying. I have every monday morning. I have a call with sbs and with d.o.t to go over how the weekend went with open street dining and they are trying to address know the problems that come up they are trying to address. The problem is the city's kind of driving blind in this. Also, they know about as much of it as we do so, it's kind of making it up as you go along. So that's part of the problem. Well, I want to thank the six of you and just to let you know, you're not off the hook, because we have questions and answers coming coordinated by chris and dolores for the next half an hour or so, but jesse would you want to say something about the poll that will be happening or sure so we're not doing a live poll on right now, I'm gonna put into the chat the link to our survey and we'll send it out to everybody that had signed up rsvp'd for this event shortly and then we'll have it on our website. But it is a very short survey and we would love to hear your responses and your thoughts about it and what again like what lol said, was it'll give us the board, and this task force some real insight as to how where we should focus our energy and so yeah, and this is a poll of people in the audience people who are out there yeah, I mean again it's for everybody, that's attending right. Now they can click on the link and or they can like. I said it will blast it out to everybody at rsvp, then put it on our website as well, so it'll be open to almost everybody, but I think obviously, the folks that have showed interest in this issue will have their okay, dolores and chris yours evening. Everybody, thank you bert. Thank you, panelists. Thank you, everybody for being here today. Thank you, jesse. My name is chris lebron, I'm an mcp 4 member and I live in hell's kitchen, and I will be your moderator for tonight's q. A we received a number of questions regarding independent small theaters, while the panelists were speaking and I'd love to direct a few of these questions over to sbs when you're ready. First question is: what do you think city hall is doing right now, specifically to support small theaters, independent theaters, eric you're, muted hi? Thank you for your question. So we get daily updates from city hall regarding specific business related issues. I have not yet heard anything specifically on theaters at this time or small theaters, we're more than happy to circle back and get some answers for you with regards to any plans to assist the small theater district yeah. Can you I'll share my information with you if you'd, like a specific answer on, what's being done about that, I'd be more than happy to circle back with you and get that information for you certainly that'll help out that question came from caitlyn cassidy public participant of this and let's follow up there. So that being said, do you think jesse that maybe this is something that the cb4 can take up as an action item moving forward when we meet or reconvene in september or october yeah? Of course, I think you know we have a arts and culture education committee, and we have that committee is, has focused on small theater support and in its budget yearly budget priorities so, and I think that the theater industry itself is obviously is a. I believe it's phase. Four is that is that correct eric yeah? Okay, so I think you know looking forward. That's a that's! A phase that you know we need to focus on, and obviously it's such a huge component of our district and especially the small theater. So I yes, the short answers. Yes, excellent! Thank you jesse. Thank you. So much joint question for bob and sbs. These two come from lori kaplan and mcb4 member alan oster. First question what resources are available in regard to storefront rent and then the second question is: will the city be reinstating the lease negotiation resources for our small businesses? So please bob or eric by all means whoever I would pass that to sbs, they would know best. Well, we had a program called the commercial lease assistance program. I think that's what they're referring to as of late. I believe that program is on hold michael, can you add any context or any more information about the commercial lease assistance program? Absolutely just want to share the information with respect to the commercial lease assistance program, as I stated earlier due to the budget referring sbs is currently putting their commercial lease assistance on pause earlier on. Someone asked a question regarding if there are any additional resources that will be available, I have include a resources over the chat, which is the silly bar the centers, so we sbs s off you know. Currently we are referring business owner to refer to city bar justice center as a referral source and then in addition to that, there's another so non-profit organization called legal aid society, which I will also share that information momentarily in the chat in respect with respect to the questions coming from chris is that I think there is a development that both, which is the office of administrative and trial and hearing, is trying to do something to offer. You know mediation between the commercial landlord and the tenant. However, this information is yet to be clarified. So once we have to update the information, I will let eric know and eric will share that information with you all, there's an august 2nd meeting on that. Yes, thank you question for maya and wendy. This is also coming from lori kaplan. It's not the lori kaplan show. I promise you. There are many more questions, but I just figured this would be the best synergy right now. How can our community-based businesses support and promote each other maya? Have you had any practices with that during this crisis and wendy? Have you seen any best examples: maya, you're, muted, thanks? Sorry, so we've been reaching out to all the neighborhood restaurants we can find because it seems like the perfect time to work with our neighbors. You know and keep things in the community and it's been great to and we've always had some restaurants that buy bread from us, but it's been great to find others and work with them so that you know we can help them and they can help us. We try and be friendly with all the local businesses. We've always talked about selling some of their stuff and they'd sell some of ours, but it's easier just to refer people to them, because they're so close, you know a couple of things that I've seen that I think are pretty great one. I mentioned before people creating links to things like gofundmes or selling gift cards or having other kinds of fundraisers. So I think just asking other people, whether they're local businesses or just other people, you know in the community to share those on their social channels just help so much to get the word out. I think, if you have a you know a special offer or if you're doing something really interesting. If you know part of the open streets program or whatnot again, sharing that out and asking people to share out, I think consumers right now are actually very much in a place of I want to help small businesses. I think, there's a lot of confusion as to you know, as we talked about tonight, about how to do that so also reaching out to your existing customer bases, whether it's through your email list through your website, social media, whatever it is to say, hey. This is what we need, or this is what ways you could help is huge and I've seen that happen quite a few different businesses, both in new york city and across the country. Thank you both following questions. There's been two questions that have come or a number of questions that have come up regarding quality of life, so I guess this one is for district manager, jesse boudin. When it comes to sanitation and shelters, could you do you have a moment to talk about what the district is doing sure? Well, I'm sorry and I didn't see the depth of the question I think you know when I can speak to it broadly in terms of sanitation and then the homeless, shelter situation separately. Obviously, what we have contacts with our soup, the local superintendent for sanitation, so we can obviously address any particulars. You know site issue that has to do with anything. That's a city service as probably maya and nathaniel and mitch all know and bob as well, that commercial businesses don't get picked up by the city and so they're. You know usually picked they're picked up by a commercial carter, and so that's a different agency that sort of handles those issues. So we can obviously also follow up with them if needed. But we've had good history and good a good history working with both of those both the business, integrity, commission and department of sanitation, so feel free to follow up with me directly about the specific issue. Listen, I think the reality is the budget cuts have taken a huge hit, taking a hit out of the sanitation budget and particularly around the basket pickups, and we're going to see that in our district alone we were we had. I think we had about six trucks on a rotation. We now have yeah it's on down to two, and so suddenly with no sundays, and so we're going to see you know those long, weekends, those hot those holiday weekends. So we're going to see a lot of like build up of trash from the baskets and we're going to have to see how we can work together in terms of either advocating for the for the money to be reinstated in some way or by working with the existing programs that we have in place like adopt a basket in which a commercial establishment or landlord can take control of a basket and basically manage it themselves. They'll get the bags and things like that, or working with the business integrity commission to sort of come up with some more creative ideas in terms of the the shelters you know. I think that is a very difficult situation. You know. So you know the department of homeless services was given the mandate of reducing a number of their existing shelters all over the city by nearly 50 percent, and having to find that relocating them, the their clients to them temporary situation that resulted in a number of the commercial hotels being used in the air. In our district we have. Our zoning has just a number of allows for hotels, a lot, and so midtown and midtown west is just a huge amount of hotels, and so that's where they went that in long island city, and so this was not done with consultation with us, obviously, and with very little notice, meaning we were notified on friday that they were being placed on friday. So what we are doing now is advocating on a sort of a two-pronged approach. One is saying: okay, that was the emergency we've gotten we've done, you've done the move, it's happened now we have to find a way of actually being sustainable, not only for the district for the residents that are exist, the residents have been there forever and for the store owners and all of that, but for the folks that are the clients of the these providers and making sure that they're. This is a bet. This is the best place for them. I mean one of those situations we have is a 36th and 37th street, which has nearly I believe, 800 beds placed in it. So that's just that's a huge impact, and so we think there needs to be a reduction across the board, obviously a safe and reasonable reduction, but at the same attempt at the same approach, we obviously are where we are and we need to mitigate the current situation. So we are meeting with all of the providers we're advocating for additional security additional services. Obviously anybody that this plate, placing somebody in a in a private, closed door. A hotel room is not the right place for everybody. If they have, you know issues with mental health, anything else along those lines where that's just not a good setting for them. We are advocating for those folks to be transferred, so we have met with a number of the providers we continue to meet with them. We continue to meet with dhs and advocate for reduction. The board has just recently approved voted on its second letter on this topic, and so we'll continue to work on this thanks jesse, and I think that kind of segues, naturally over to bob. What's the bid doing right now to respond to quality of life issues, but we do this, we do supplemental sanitation work and we do have security in the park and we're looking at. We have some. We have a presence, some paid detail on 9th avenue because of the homeless issue, trying to keep them from congregating around in the canoe, the plaza that's called the canoe, and we might expand that up between 37th and 38th street. The pay detail only works so much it's. A presence. Cops are not allowed to engage in homeless anymore, even though even if they're paid detail, they can still only do what they can do when they're on their job, so they can't really engage unless they see an illegal activity that occurs, we're not allowed to give businesses money. We can't just give grants to businesses it's because we're assessed money from the building. There's some legal reason why you can't that assessment can't go back to the business, can't go back to the business, but so we try and do a lot of marketing for them and things of that nature. For a while, we were quiet with the marketing, because you know you won't even come out to hell's kitchen or come to. Hudson yards wasn't really the the type of thing he wanted to be saying. At the moment, we've gone back into a gingerly so far with the reopenings and we're working a lot on the outdoor dining stuff. You know it's hard. Some of the business was just someone to come out and take a picture and say that it's out of compliance you have 24 hours to fix it and then send them the picture, but not tell them. What in the picture is wrong, so they have no idea what to fix. So then you gotta, you know you gotta, go find someone at dlt and you gotta get people to talk, so that takes up a lot of our time. Also- and I just make a comment about that: the sanitation you know you know the budget is bad, but the budget that was passed in june really was only a budget to get us through the summer to the end of september, because no one knew what the receipts were going to be come july, 1st as to the tax money. So no one really know how much money the city is going to have. The old idea is really to get us to the end of september and do a budget mod over october and vote for it in november. So and just a warning, if we think things are bad now, wait to the budget. You're really going to see cuts, they didn't see anything we're pretty much just floating right now, and so we figure out how much money we have thanks bob that's unfortunate and I feel like there's a lot of small businesses looking for resources very similar to the bid, and so this next question goes to our three panelists. It's a it's a collective question from inga machenko, a former mcb4 member. Have you found utility or have you begun, reaching out to your local block associations and tenant associations to announce your openings? And if you have you seen any changes in your response rate as it relates to your sales numbers, your net sales numbers? Well, we haven't reached out, but we also didn't close, so there hasn't been much that has changed in terms of reopening for us, but we talked to the block association. All the time on the block association, I've seen you on a few of the zooms yeah. Actually, I actually my I actually saw one of the local public agents had announced that you were open and I had responded them well, no sullivan street bakery has been open this entire time. Most of the community doesn't know. So I guess that goes to the point that, like having those resources made available- and I believe we have those contacts with our district manager- is that right, jesse yeah. So what's the best way to jesse, do you think small business should be utilizing tenant, association, email list and block association email list? Well I mean, I think you know meyer is a perfect example. I mean you just show up right. You participate, you know you get you find out. If there's a, if there's a bid, I mean, if there's a block association or a significant tenant association on the block, and you attend the meetings. You know you show up and you say hello, you know, I think that's always what's worked, you know, and you know right so some you know the chelsea is fortunate because it sort of has an umbrella organization. You know and the ccba, and so folks should definitely you know if in how they attend the meetings going forward. You know attend those meetings and we can obviously provide those contacts. If anybody needs them- and you know, hell's kitchen is actually still organizing itself as well into sort of larger group associations of block associations. So that's always helpful too, and you know- and maybe, as bob mentioned- and we have definitely seen with our meetings with it's a lot easier just to click on a button and have to get out off your butt and go down a few blocks or jump on a subway to go to a meeting at night. So we're seeing a big, you know a significant increase in our public participation, and so I'm hoping we see an increase in those block association meetings as well, but obviously anybody that any particular store or owner would like to have a contact for their block association or they just don't even know. If there is one we have a running list, there's no official list, it's not something the city man you know has or anything we just keep it and try to keep it fresh and accurate every year. So more than happy to help. Thank you. Jesse. There was a question that came in two questions. Actually one from greg lynn, one from katie savage, I'm going to combine the two together and make this kind of an open question to all panelists. What's the benefit of forming a merchant association or a bid during this time, and then second, how can that translate into providing restaurants and other small businesses in chelsea and hell's kitchen organized closed streets for outdoor dining? I would say I would say I would do a merchant's association, because the starter bid is going to take at least two years, so you won't really see the immediate effect. I mean it's not a bad idea. I wouldn't advocate not doing it, but I'm just saying you're looking for something more immediate, a bit is a big process to put together it's like at least two years, but emerson's association. You could you can get up and running at a quicker manner in two broad strokes. How would small businesses go about doing that like they're? What's their first two steps, the first two steps talk to the local businesses around them to see. If there's any interest talk to the community board, local elected officials or even talk to an existing merchant's association that formed and asked them what they did, how they did it. Thank you, nathan. Is there anything like that where you're operating currently you're muted? This is the mutual sorry, I'm not sure we're, not part of a merchant association. You know, like I said we are members of the chelsea grand village chamber, but other than just you know being familiar with. You know most of our my neighbors around here and hopefully they all know. You know for anything, I'm available for anything. I can do to help. We don't have like an official association. You know, but it does. I do feel there's a sense of community down here on 9th ave for sure, especially after, if we it was a little hectic last month. You know everybody was doing whatever they could to help people clean up the messes and get on with this so sure and mitch. You said you had a very unique circumstance where you were not seeing the foot traffic that you had anticipated once opening. What steps have you taken to begin increasing that that message that you're open and that you're providing sanitized and experience for potential clients, sure yeah so ours I mean we don't the walk-in traffic, of course, is not it's pretty much non-existent at this point, which makes kind of sense, and all we do really is just keep in contact with our client base emails, pictures photographs instagram like crazy, instagram models, all the stuff we're doing just to make them feel more comfortable coming back, and you know I think they will come back it's just like. Can we can we hang on there until they do come back? Is the issue so yeah? That's all that's all we can really do is just it's. Just keep them informed, just more and more information, whatever we can give them and when they're ready, hopefully they'll come back so yeah so mitch. What are your social media handles that everyone present can go and jump on chris chase chris chased that salon on instagram on honestly, okay, great and is there any way digitally for them to do appointments? Oh yeah, on our website on chrissalon.com? You all need to help you get your hair done. You know we're at eight o'clock now. I think this kind of brings us to an and jesse if you'd like to, can I just jump in really one quick question and before we close out, I just want to touch on the topic about the merchants association or being part of a chamber, or something like that. We have found- and maybe wendy can speak to this as well, because I know when you and I have gotten around in circles, sometimes trying to help out small business in our in our district that are affected by numerous different things, one being all of the all of the ddc street projects that take up all the frontage. In some small restaurants, you know is that it really does help, and I think it also helps with sbs services. Tell me if I'm wrong, eric and michael that, if a group of restaurants or a group of owner small businesses are part of an association that can receive funds they can receive, it gives them a lot more access to either funds from the city directly or grants, or things like that and certainly does allow. I think, some level of help from something like google that from google too. So I would just say that in our my experience, that is true that, if it might be a little more extra work on your guys's at small business ends because got a lot to handle, but it does when it comes down to something like how to you know how to quickly get that access to those programs. I think it does help. I appreciate it yeah, I think I would add to that, is if you are a non-profit or if you choose to create an organization or an association. That's a non-profit that opens up some additional just resources and tools from google that are either free or come at a reduced cost for non-profits. All of that program is through something just that's just called google for non-profits. If you do a google search for it, it'll show up, but it can be a great way to have a collective voice and then open up some additional resources to help just kind of run that the logistics of running an association or an organization, the other just quick like resource that I would throw out there with regards to just kind of training and getting a better sense of how to navigate a lot of these different digital tools. We do have a program totally free called grow with google on air and those are digital training, so you can just do a search for grow with google on air and those are trainings on a ton of different topics. We bring in experts as well try to do a range of topics, mostly digital tools, but sometimes some other issues and we're constantly thinking of new ideas. So if you have ideas for trainings you'd like to hear about, let me know and see what we can do. It also gives you the chance, once you've gone to a training, to set up time with a person one-on-one to chat through some of those issues, so a helpful resource for small businesses, but then again, if, if you're, an actual association with a merchant's association or a bid to be able to learn a little bit more about how to communicate. Since we are just living in a life where we can't rely on foot traffic anymore, you wendy, and I think that kind of I want to ask everybody to give their last pitch and any shout outs to their businesses or businesses that they know and need. So, let's start with nathaniel, please! Well I mean I think all businesses are in need. I don't know anyone in particular that's worse off than anybody else. You know, if anything like maya, I feel fortunate that you know I wasn't. I wasn't forced to shut down only felt the effects of the shutdown same thing. All my restaurant and event. Clients are still putting the pieces back together and that has an effect on our bottom line as well. So yeah I mean I I'm not I'm not sure how to best close this out. I mean I I'm optimistic for this for the future of the city for sure I just feel like what I think is really absent is something that we talked about earlier, which is that there's been no. I think there needs to be some positive messaging for new yorkers, like I haven't seen anything saying: hey you're still here like good for you like you, this is a it's. A good thing stay in stay in new york. The people are, what make new york great. You know and right now all the people of new york. We have less fun stuff to do, but it'll be back, and I really feel like there's like an encouragement gap that I'd love to see some just like in some kind of like positive attitude. Promotion out there for people that shouldn't be scared to go into chris's salon, we're all aware of. What's going on where everyone's taking the precautions they need to be. Taking I'm not sure how to reach people in that in that regard- and I would love to see you know movement in that in that direction, like you know, kind of like emotionally rewarding people for sticking it out and encouraging them to continue to stick it out and do the best they can to patronize their local businesses. Yeah, I mean in a few words I guess mitch yeah I mean it's gonna, probably all be the same kind of stuff, but it's for us. I mean just remaining local here and getting to know people right around here. Some of you, I didn't know maya, I'm gonna have to go to the bakery. I've been in there many times, maybe you're, not there. I don't know but nate, I know use from the from across the street. Well, first, I want to say quickly is I want to thank you for doing this and letting me be involved in this study actually learned a ton. I need to be more involved. I think, because our setup is a little different and where, by appointment I don't rely so much on the. I guess the community and more I and I and I'm gonna- I plan on doing that. So I appreciate you guys doing that and again yeah, it's just the it's just it's the walk around getting to know people more around here that I will do more of and through venues like this. I appreciate you guys all being on this and letting me be a part of it so yeah, that's it maya any last words before we close up and wrap up. Well, I think I'd like to second daniel's point about positive messaging, really feels like new york is one of the safest places in the country right now, and I think we've done an amazing job getting here and we don't make enough of a big deal about that and then in terms of restaurants, because those are the small businesses that I know best, I don't know any that are not operating at a loss right now, a huge loss and an anticipation of future losses, just in the hopes that things are going to get better people are sticking it out. So I would just hope that if anyone is brave enough to go out to a restaurant right now be really kind, you know if people don't have what you're expecting what you want. If things aren't great be nice because everyone is trying so hard. Thank you, maya and just a reminder for everyone participating today and everyone in the public session there will be an email going out. I hope you do fill out the survey we desperately want to know what's going on and want to know, what's important to you, this is going to help our elected officials. This will help sbs. This will help the community board put things as priority issue items. That being said, thank you so much for coming today and spending your time with us and we look forward to continuing the conversation. Have a good one. Everybody thank you take care, I think, do you want to close this everybody? I guess we're closing out thanks for having me. Thank you, maya, hey thanks again, I really appreciate it good job doing the task force. Thank you. Panelists thank everyone on the task force and just to say reiterating what chris said. This is a process we're not. This is not the end. We're gonna continue and we're gonna be still communicating with all of us, so we'll be in touch and let's stay in touch and be safe, be safe, stay well. Thank you. Everybody. Thank you.
