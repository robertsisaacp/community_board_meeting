I saw someone from senator hoyleman's office, hi maya, so they will be aware of what the small business community needs as well, and if legislation is needed, we can help push that through at least try to push that through along with tonight's event, we are going to be distributing a survey.
If you are currently having difficulty getting a response from one of your precincts, I can help with you connect to connect you with the right contact at the precinct, so I'll be putting those both in the chat and with that I hand that it over to small business services for their brief presentation, followed by the nyc bid association good evening.
So in that area, we're still I'm going to provide assistance to those small businesses that will be need for staffing, you're breaking up a lot.
So what happened during their pandemic is that we have adapted to a new program which is the sbs hotline, so this hotline is primarily designated for to answer business owners questions when it comes to reopening, as well as the ppe, finance and assistance legal assistance as well as recruitment.
So these are the primary questions that open time when business owners are calling, they try to ask us for questions so going to the financial assistance, so people are trying in the past try to apply for different programs and they struggle to get the loans and grants.
The second question I mean second category that we come across will be the reopening guideline, so there are still currently some businesses that are not allowed to open this.
Just so let you know that small business services used to offer commercial lease assistance program.
I think, we'll hold on questions for the panel discussion and then the q a at the end, if that's, okay, very good, okay, thank you very much for the presentation move on to the new york city bid association.
Recently, we issued out a statement from the bid association on ways to go forward to help small businesses and the city's economy, and that's there's nine pieces to it.
Now we want to expand to other retail, to let all the retail go out and maybe set up in front of their stores, things that they could sell, and you would need to allow that to have to go deal with the stoop law of the city, because you're not supposed to sell and exchange money outside of the store like that, and you would have to get if you did do it right now.
So we don't have a negative effect on it yet because, for the same reason why restaurants are hurting, there's not a lot of people on the street, buying street food or buying stuff, but it will become an issue when and if we start to get back to larger numbers that are walking around the street buying things, the fifth one, probably not exactly a favorite one for a community board, is to streamline the straight liquor authority process to make it easier to get your liquor license and to also allow some temporary more temporary licenses for people who want to do stuff outside if they get approval from the city.
The state will probably regroup and meet again legislatively up in orbiting, probably the end of august early september, and that would be the time we would start pushing that and if the seventh one is the city should support non-profit organizations who want to create markets and pop-up venues, primarily we're looking to do that in parks or in plazas.
I think you just did wendy gazelles is the small business marketing manager for google she's, been with google for 10 years she's, also on the board of the manhattan chamber of commerce and we're lucky to have her on manhattan community board, for we also have nathaniel garber there he is, he is in the family.
As we know, small businesses in the city of new york really thrive on high occupancy customers coming into their places in order to realize the profit right to meet the monitors, and I think the limitation on the number of people that can actually come and actually come and to enter a business at any given time is going to really be a hindrance to businesses, realizing a profit going forward.
I think what points you're raising eric is very important because most street businesses [Music] small businesses at street level, retail restaurant bar those kinds of businesses depend upon densities of pedestrians density of people around and the model that most small businesses have had in new york is based on that model and now we're confronted we're all confronted with something different.
So in the retail business we still have a relatively high volume of people coming in, but now we're turned into policemen, which is really stressful, because we are suddenly responsible for making sure that there's only a few people in the store at a time that everyone's wearing a mask that everyone's socially distant, that everyone's actually wearing their masks correctly, which is incredibly difficult for a lot of people and that act of policing throughout the day is really difficult.
Yes, yeah it's so you know my business is essential, so you know, fortunately we were not forced to close at all, although the first couple of months of this it was you know, a ghost town, but I can say that throughout this entire process from the beginning, when there were only a handful of people and up till today, you know maya is 100 spot on it's such a huge, it's so stressful and on top of on top of just dealing with clients, you know we all have employees that are on the spectrum of how paranoid they are about contracting the virus themselves.
You know I may have someone in the store that we're comfortable with each other, but we don't know who's going to walk in the door any at the next moment and like if people are all over the map on this, and I think new yorkers for the most part are respectful about doing it.
It's not a perfect system, but at least you can do some of that expectation setting right from the start so that you have maybe fewer surprises and can have fewer of those kind of policing moments that some other panels have talked about bob yeah, it's one of the bigger complaints we get from the businesses in the bit in my bid district about having to police behavior of the patrons, some of whom don't behave.
That was great and of course, funding is, you know, is always nice, but in this situation is so much bigger than the money we've seen that I've seen available like from the federal level down, although every dollar is appreciated, I mean the rents, we all pay the kind of density we need to.
I mean every new york business owner, you know, scoffed at like oh great, like 40, probably wouldn't even cover a month's rent, and that's where you need to help.
So what can you give me and then it is just to leave the place by itself, because I'm not going to find anyone to render right rented to at this moment, we've had good experiences and also have heard that there are landlords willing to negotiate, which has been helpful both for us and for our wholesale customers at our restaurants and need to renegotiate with their landlords to survive.
You know like maybe the city should be rolling back their tax base to the year that leases were signed so that renters aren't paying the differential, which is the boiler plate in just about every commercial lease, but differential.
I think a lot of this is going to rest on the funding the state gets because I saw today and then on gothamist that cuomo said or has basically like threatened to raise state property taxes statewide.
Well, we we've always had both, but the majority like 95 of our business is wholesale generally right now most of our customers aren't open and the ones that are doing you know 10th, maybe of the business they were before and all of that is outside dining.
If there's a slight breeze, it's kind of a mess so but yeah, you know going back the business model we referred to before you know built on pedestrian density and people walking in off the street.
So even things like personal training right, which is such an in-person kind of business, we've seen that shift to video online on google we've actually now added a way on your business profile on google, which is just what shows your local business information you can now, as a business owner, add a direct link to have people sign up to do those kind of virtual classes or consultations whatever it may be, with you to rely on video we've also seen people do creative things by relying on gift cards and making that easier.
All of that we've seen a lot of small businesses across the country doing and we've you know, developed some additional tools to make that a little easier as well.
You know at a very challenging time it's been really inspiring to see what businesses are doing and then, as we now look forward and we're seeing these different phases of reopening, I mean I'm very curious to hear what my other panelists have said, that they've done.
You know personally for their businesses or what they'd like to do, because I think that's.
Certainly you know we will work with people that don't want to come into the store on the street or over the phone knowing they're right outside, but for the mo for the most part we I haven't noticed that either of our locations, especially our village store, which is so spacious, it's got these really tall ceilings and these big glass windows and when you're in there you don't feel as claustrophobic.
I need nuts and bolts, and I have a few random questions before I go like make a mess at home, and you know I think, there's something to be said for that.
I said I've been so impressed by so many small businesses and just being thrown into an unimaginably challenging time and how they've pivoted, how they've been resilient, you know and none of which they wanted to be.
You know that there are resources and trainings that are available, whether through a company like google or whether they're chambers of commerce, through small business services, people who are experts and want to help and so to continue to reach out, because we one maybe have a resource to help you now and if we don't, we can build it, we can figure it out together.
I'd like to say, I certainly think more conversations like this between agency representatives and the public small businesses is definitely something that can you know this is an unprecedented incident.
The country is old, and I just think that more conversations like this can only help kind of help us understand what small businesses need and how we can better help small businesses so anytime, you want to have future meetings and future discussions be more than happy to come on, speak about more topics, talk about more solutions, talk about more programs.
During this time, thanks maya bob well, I think one of the most surprising things for us in our position right now is that we're sort of desperate for enforcement and policing and guidance from city and state agencies- and it's we've always had you- know the existing rules and regulations that we know to follow and they're good, but now we're in a position where we kind of feel like we're making it up on our own.
If we had someone telling us exactly what steps to follow and it's kind of the same thing with reopening and the possibility of a closure we're going with it, you know we know how to operate our business, we'll figure these things out, but we're it would be so nice to have more guidance, which is an unusual position for us guidance from city and state.
Well, I want to thank the six of you and just to let you know, you're not off the hook, because we have questions and answers coming coordinated by chris and dolores for the next half an hour or so, but jesse would you want to say something about the poll that will be happening or sure so we're not doing a live poll on right now, I'm gonna put into the chat the link to our survey and we'll send it out to everybody that had signed up rsvp'd for this event shortly and then we'll have it on our website.
First question is: what do you think city hall is doing right now, specifically to support small theaters, independent theaters, eric you're, muted hi?
Currently we are referring business owner to refer to city bar justice center as a referral source and then in addition to that, there's another so non-profit organization called legal aid society, which I will also share that information momentarily in the chat in respect with respect to the questions coming from chris is that I think there is a development that both, which is the office of administrative and trial and hearing, is trying to do something to offer.
We've always talked about selling some of their stuff and they'd sell some of ours, but it's easier just to refer people to them, because they're so close, you know a couple of things that I've seen that I think are pretty great one.
So I think just asking other people, whether they're local businesses or just other people, you know in the community to share those on their social channels just help so much to get the word out.
If you know part of the open streets program or whatnot again, sharing that out and asking people to share out, I think consumers right now are actually very much in a place of I want to help small businesses.
I think, there's a lot of confusion as to you know, as we talked about tonight, about how to do that so also reaching out to your existing customer bases, whether it's through your email list through your website, social media, whatever it is to say, hey.
This is what we need, or this is what ways you could help is huge and I've seen that happen quite a few different businesses, both in new york city and across the country.
They'll get the bags and things like that, or working with the business integrity commission to sort of come up with some more creative ideas in terms of the the shelters you know.
You're really going to see cuts, they didn't see anything we're pretty much just floating right now, and so we figure out how much money we have thanks bob that's unfortunate and I feel like there's a lot of small businesses looking for resources very similar to the bid, and so this next question goes to our three panelists.
So I guess that goes to the point that, like having those resources made available- and I believe we have those contacts with our district manager- is that right, jesse yeah.
What's the benefit of forming a merchant association or a bid during this time, and then second, how can that translate into providing restaurants and other small businesses in chelsea and hell's kitchen organized closed streets for outdoor dining?
What steps have you taken to begin increasing that that message that you're open and that you're providing sanitized and experience for potential clients, sure yeah so ours I mean we don't the walk-in traffic, of course, is not it's pretty much non-existent at this point, which makes kind of sense, and all we do really is just keep in contact with our client base emails, pictures photographs instagram like crazy, instagram models, all the stuff we're doing just to make them feel more comfortable coming back, and you know I think they will come back it's just like.
We have found- and maybe wendy can speak to this as well, because I know when you and I have gotten around in circles, sometimes trying to help out small business in our in our district that are affected by numerous different things, one being all of the all of the ddc street projects that take up all the frontage.
In some small restaurants, you know is that it really does help, and I think it also helps with sbs services.
Tell me if I'm wrong, eric and michael that, if a group of restaurants or a group of owner small businesses are part of an association that can receive funds they can receive, it gives them a lot more access to either funds from the city directly or grants, or things like that and certainly does allow.
So I would just say that in our my experience, that is true that, if it might be a little more extra work on your guys's at small business ends because got a lot to handle, but it does when it comes down to something like how to you know how to quickly get that access to those programs.
It also gives you the chance, once you've gone to a training, to set up time with a person one-on-one to chat through some of those issues, so a helpful resource for small businesses, but then again, if, if you're, an actual association with a merchant's association or a bid to be able to learn a little bit more about how to communicate.
Since we are just living in a life where we can't rely on foot traffic anymore, you wendy, and I think that kind of I want to ask everybody to give their last pitch and any shout outs to their businesses or businesses that they know and need.
Well I mean I think all businesses are in need.
You know and right now all the people of new york.
So I appreciate you guys doing that and again yeah, it's just the it's just it's the walk around getting to know people more around here that I will do more of and through venues like this.
Well, I think I'd like to second daniel's point about positive messaging, really feels like new york is one of the safest places in the country right now, and I think we've done an amazing job getting here and we don't make enough of a big deal about that and then in terms of restaurants, because those are the small businesses that I know best, I don't know any that are not operating at a loss right now, a huge loss and an anticipation of future losses, just in the hopes that things are going to get better people are sticking it out.
So I would just hope that if anyone is brave enough to go out to a restaurant right now be really kind, you know if people don't have what you're expecting what you want.
