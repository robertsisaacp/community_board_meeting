Here, for the first time, the business license and permits committee makes recommendations to the full board which meets the first wednesday of the month, which will be in september very early. I think it's september, 2nd, that's right september, 2nd labor day is the latest it can be, and our community board is the earliest it can be in september september 2nd. So we make a recommendation to the full board, the full board either adopts or modifies our recommendation and in terms of the state liquor authority, liquor license applications. Our recommendations go to the sla. The sla has the authority to give licenses or withhold licenses. We do not have that authority, we make recommendations so welcome everybody. We have a reduced agenda or a limited agenda. Let's say that way. We had actually three applicants who were originally on the agenda and they have withdrawn or postponed item number five on the agenda, as we has postponed to a future date and items. Six and seven applicants under six and seven have withdrawn, so we only have four. So, let's start with number one, that's the best way to start. Oh, I! No! I don't want to jump into starting because my co-chair frank has something to say well first, I wanted to welcome our new committee member kerry, keenan who's new to the community board and new to this committee. It's our first meeting tonight and just to remind everyone of the procedure. The people you're seeing on screen are the committee members and the applicants and their representatives. Everyone else is only what's called a particip attendee and is allowed to observe, as we call each agenda item. If you would like to speak on the item, please use the raise your hand function in the at the bottom of the screen and nellie gonzalez. Our assistant district manager will move you into the meeting for that applicant. So you can speak. Anyone can speak on any applicant for up to two minutes and that's all I have. Thank you frank thank you. So welcome carrie and let's go now to item number one which was 149 west 14th street jamaa, mama they're, applying to use their backyard where you are as they call it, the yes, the rare yard. So I am zara lucas of elky hoffman law and tamara the owner of the establishment, shama mama, I believe she's here she's logged in. But we can't see I'm I'm here, my dear I'm here hello and we so we appeared last month to present kind of two parts of this application or for this applicant, and so the first one was the temporary approval of the backyard space with all of the current covet exceptions and then to permanently amend their license application so that when these exceptions do expire, that they would be allowed to continue to operate in the backyard. And so last month when we appeared there, there were some concerns expressed by members of the by a few neighbors who are on 15th street and the committee to an extent at their request, because some neighbors being out of town and not necessarily being able to attend the meeting recommended that perhaps we we hold off and the the temporary approval was granted through until october. Considering that things right now are kind of fly by and we're getting like. The extension for the sla's backyard exception actually didn't happen until probably after 5 p.m. The day of august 5th, we sat there just waiting with baited brass wondering when the sla and whether they were actually going to extend it and they did and they extended it through september, and now we, where we're you know we're gonna, be playing that game. I I believe now until the warm weather season is over, but we do want to move forward with the application, and so, during the last few weeks, what has happened is tamara has continued to do outreach to the community. I submitted I emailed over to nelly just about 200 additional signatures, petitions that she received, and I believe some were emailed directly to the community as well. Tamara also did she reached out to a local acoustic company to get a proposal about what she can do with regard to the backyard and to limiting the noise and how you know it extends and affects the neighbors and how they can dampen sound, and that proposal was also sent over to the committee, and I guess pretty much the the questionnaire details. The number of seats in the backyard, the maximum occupancy back there is 45. she'll, try to maximize the seats there as much as possible, and so you know right now about 20 to 22 tables and about you know, maximum 44. that that would vary. You know, depending on the layout and what's not, and if I can talk about- and let me just mention, because that was something that came up last month- she is agreeing to you know the community board's recommendations in terms of hours. She won't be operating past. Your recommended hours right now, she's closing at 10, and if I you know we'll touch a little bit on what was in. I don't know. If all of you got the opportunity to see the proposal, but I know since sound was a major concern for the residents on 15th street. Some of the recommendations of the and tamara can can speak about her conversations with the acoustic company, but they detail what their recommendations are based on. The current exist. The current conditions of the backyard, which pretty much is, is there's a lot of. There are a lot of hard surfaces and there there isn't other than some shrubbery a lot of of barriers to sound and so what they recommended were outdoor carpeting. Some things that she can do pretty quickly is adding additional shrubbery, which I tamara can speak to whether or not she has been able to acquire those, and then long term would be to order some acoustical tiles and have those installed, and those obviously will take some time. She had some plans to replace the doorway, which current currently now how it's constructed. It's kind of like there there's noise emanating a staff like come in and out, and that was something that they that they noticed and make a recommendation and made a recommendation to her about. Possibly you know trying to find ways to reduce the sound from that that coming and going with the staff and yeah, I I think tamara has has you know she's doing her best right now. The the only operating space that she has like most businesses in new york is. Is that backyard and and it's it's keeping her above ground for the time being, whether it's even whether she's able to meet all of her expenses during this time and how long that's going to continue is really you know a large concern and- and hopefully, when some of you know, we've gotten past this current hurdle that we're we're in and and she's able to, you know, operate fully, there's a lot of recouping that's going to need to happen and and having those additional seats in the backyard is going to be super important and so, in addition to making sure that her business stays in operation, she she's she's. Obviously you know gonna ensure that her neighbors are not disturbed, because she is a community establishment. She is a neighborhood place. A lot of her regulars are from the neighborhood, and you see that in the petitions you see that in the emails, and so we do hope that we can get your recommendation of approval for this. This permanent alteration based on you know the work that she's willing to do to you know be a good neighborhood business. So I gather you'd agree to a stipulation that you'll implement all the suggestions in the acoustic report. Yes, yes in as much as as as it is possible and then most of their recommendations are you know these are because of in the current state of you know. Everything is, is really unstuck everywhere and taking some time things like acoustical tiles will take, will take a little bit of time for her to acquire in terms of you know, factories being able to provide those those things in a timely manner, production and what's not but everything else in the like the shrubbery- and you know she can, you know, find some some carpeting and stuff to put back there. Tamara is definitely willing to do that and tamarkin can can hop in and you know, speak to. You know what she's done and what she's able to do in the interim. We're assuming that you know she'll be able to continue to operate. She's already made some some some moves. You know by putting the plants there, you know increasing the height of her fence, which was a recommendation or concern expressed by one of the neighbors and so she's already in the process of doing these things. So, yes, she most definitely will tamara. Do you want to jump in and talk about what you've done? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you sister and thank you community. So what what I've done is I've reached out to three most established outdoor acoustical companies? Consulting companies and I've had all three of them at the backyard of charma mama and we diligently learned how the noise travels in the backyard and, as czar said, we've already sent the proposal to the community board. What was very interesting is that we could cure some issues right away, which are some evergreens and we've already installed 19 of them two days ago, monday morning. Actually so it's already there we're working on the carpeting or the rubbering on the floor and we'll make sure that it will be installed also right away and the next things were acoustical panels and also what professional, acoustical professional told news that right now we exit the door right in front of the neighbors windows on the 15th street and what we will need is we basically have to have the awnings that will be more of a fabric and we can close that exit and we can have a different accident throughout the wall, but the cane that has to go through the ob, the department of buildings. So that's a more of a longer cure, but this should be done in the next week or so and then, like the consultant, told me he needs to come and see every time we install the short-term solution. So you can obviously it's very hard to get those acoustical panels in a week or ten days, because those are for pre-order and they need to travel some from overseas to make sure that he basically told me that he has done many concerts throughout the community also which his community, so he course that noise, but he needs some time to make sure that we do it in the right way. So I'm willing to do anything and everything to make sure that community is happy. My staff is happy, my guests are happy and of course I'm happy too. So. Thank you so much and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you, as was made available to the committee, that five more letters of support came in since we considered this last month. I just want to summarize them briefly in case people didn't get a chance to read them. One person says I reside at 140 west 15th street. For the past 12 years, mom has been an exceptional new neighbor and a wonderful addition to our neighborhood. I have two large windows that face their back garden: dining area. Not only have they beautified the space aesthetically and kept it well manicured, but they brought more kind. People into the community by way of hiring staff that has always been courteous and welcoming the environment is ochrama. Mama is one that is more refined. I trust your mom as a place. I can enjoy quiet meals and would not have any concern that it may be a place that would ever be loud or create any kind of disruption, I'm so happy to have them as backyard neighbors. They're. Truly a welcome addition to the space tucked away between our buildings, someone who lives at 149 west 14th says our apartment faces the backyard of the building we're going on in the third year in the apartment. We really love, champa mama we've never had any noise issues with them being right downstairs since the time they opened to 2019. We hear channel mama recently opened back here. Dining we're excited to try it out. Someone else lives at west 13th street how difficult it is for restaurants to survive on 14th street. We're delighted when they opened staff is always friendly and comfortable. I understand you must be judicious about outdoor dining you're. Balancing many needs all the same with so many restaurants struggling. I think it's important to help places only challenges survive. Someone at 149, west 14th as well. The volume of noise is at a minimum. The atmosphere is a quiet one. Okay, bert any questions from committee members yeah who went to see this frank? Did you go with christine? Who went to see this initially frank and I went and nellie? I think he was there too yeah. We went right right right, yeah, so I've seen the pictures and it looks like it could work and there's a lot of support from the community. I we didn't get copies of any of the acoustic log or acoustic reports. I don't know, do we have those yeah it came in this afternoon, nelly, put it in the drop box and send a reminder to everyone to to check the app it was late in the afternoon around 5 30.. You may not have seen it. I didn't see it in the drop-off but okay nellie. Can you send that to me when you get a chance? It's the same document. That's in dropbox. I replaced it with it's at the end of the document. Oh yeah! No, I'm not seeing that at the end of the document. So, okay I'll send it to you at the end of the application. I see the pictures and the diagrams and that's it it's after the pictures, yeah there's this and the petitions yeah so mine ends. I see the letters that you put in the dropbox, but I don't see anything other than the pictures. So I just it's. It's two separate links. One was for testimony and then the other one was the the regular stuff all right, I'll look for it, but if you guys have looked at it, I'm fine with that I mean for me: there's a lot of support from immediate neighbors. Usually we don't get this. I don't know it's 14th street. Are they allowed to have restaurants on the street on 14th, like the other street restaurants in front of the street? The issue with 14th street is that first lane, where you might want to put a table shuts the bus lane. That's okay! That's what I wasn't sure of okay, so that eventually they may have to move that someday and reconfigure it for other restaurants that don't have a backyard. But for me I'm I'm, I think they're trying and I think we have enough support so I'm in favor of it but I'll. Let everyone else speak and the public nellie has anyone signed up? No one has a raised hand from the public. I'm I'm very impressed with this applicant seems like she's going above and beyond, and I think this is the type of applicant that we want our community. I make a motion to approve. Second, all right, let's just to summarize so the steps will be that they're going to implement the recommendations of the acoustic report and then I'd like to carry over three from our temporary letter. There'll be no music or amplified sound in the rear yard. Doors really are to be closed, except when used for entering and exiting, and all patrons must be seated you, okay with those and the recommendations of the acoustic report, will be implemented you tomorrow and yes, yes, absolutely! Okay. I agree. If also, I I didn't see attached to the application, a floor plan for the postcovid full rare yard, could you get us one of those? Yes, we can get you a final lady. In other words, the way it'll look yeah. What's up how it will be laid out, yeah, okay, nelly, what's the deadline for that, I will tell you right now hold on one. Second, I will need it by august: 26th, okay, okay, the other thing I'd say so you don't keep coming back to us and we can include, as part of this motion, is that our temporary approval continues to be extended as the sla extends your ability to use the very art. So if they extend it beyond october 1, you know our approval will continue in effect, and you don't have to thank you keep coming back to us. Okay, so we have a motion and we have it seconded all those in favor all those high. Thank you rob all those opposed. Abstaining president, not eligible okay. Thank you. I just say one thing. I noticed in the pictures that they have benches outside, which are nice but not allowed. I'm not going to say anything about that, but then there's a table and then sandwich boards. I just want to make sure they're not taking too much of the sidewalk, because none of that's allowed as long as you're being so there's enough room for people to walk. If you look at the front of the restaurant out front, yes yeah they have a table and then they have the sidewalk board even out farther the a-frame and then the benches, none of that's legal at all. We don't enforce it, but so just be aware of that and try not to hog up the sidewalk. Thank you absolutely hey. Thank you. Good luck. Moving on. Thank you item number. Thank you. Thank you. Tamara mark, 214, 10th avenue don giovanni. This is an alteration of an existing liquor license. This is an establishment that has been there for many years. It wants to upgrade its liquor license to on-premises full service bar. That's correct hi. This is marcos, codobatras we're the attorneys for don giovanni and kim cohen she's, the principal of the business, I believe, she's. Also on kim, are you here. I see she's participating, but maybe she has her nellie. Do you see her? I see her you're phone on mute, okay. Well, we want to thank the community board for the opportunity to present this. I'm sure many of you know don giovanni from maine. Oh my gosh, sorry there you go it's kimmy, hi hi, everyone so just like. Let me briefly introduce this and I'll hand it over to kimmy, to tell you a little bit more about it. So what don giovanni is trying to do right now is it is going through some sort of restructuring based on the the covet period, as you can imagine most places along 10th avenue, I'm sure you've seen you know, closed signs or for sale signs, so don giovanni is trying to adjust that by upgrading their license to a full liquor license to be able to serve their patrons. You know cocktails or anything other than wine, beer and and cider which they currently have. So this is the this is the main reason for the upgrade their uptown location as well, just to kind of give you an overview. The uptown location is also going through a restructuring currently and they're. Also they have a full liquor license, so we want to be able to match the two up so that they can provide the same services, the same goods to the patrons, not only uptown but also in chelsea, and I think the uptown location, I think I believe community board 4 is also under that or that uptown location is under that jurisdiction. I should say- and so I think you guys are familiar with that as well, so I'll, let kimi take it from here and add a little bit of color to this application. Thank you, everyone for having me today. We decided basically after 30 years that we wanted to file for a different class application because, first and foremost it's been our restaurant was hit. Both of our restaurants was hit very hard with covid. My 44th street location was broken into twice and we had to open and close and we were looted, and I can't even begin to tell you how much that cost us in expenses, but we decided that we thought that we really needed some extra income because we don't think we'll survive and although the chelsea location remained open throughout covid for delivery, we now see that a lot of the clientele from empire diner who's, my next-door neighbor. That was open from 78 1978 that had opened and closed several times. Their patrons were always coming there for alcoholic beverages, including including dining, and they were coming to us thereafter, looking for another place to have an aperol spritz or whatever they were looking for, and I couldn't provide it, and I realized that I was also losing a lot of clientele and because of that you know, I decided to file for to apply for another class of application and we're there 30 years. We never thought that we needed a liquor license. Nor did I ever care to have a liquor license for 30 years, because we were fine with wine and beer, but we are suffering right now and we are trying to do anything to add into our income. So we would really appreciate that you would review my application and know that we've never had any cases of inebriated people laying on my sidewalk. It's never been a party place. It's never been a place that people congregate at the bar for beers or wine. Everybody has always come and dined and ate and left and we've closed early we've never made any problems to the neighborhood. You know, we've been a very vital part, as a matter of fact to the neighborhood and to the community doing a lot of different kinds of contributions throughout our 30 years, and so I mean I, I guess that's all right. Thank you. I I wanted to clarify one quite one issue about your hours on your form. You have your closing sunday to thursday at 10 pm at 11 p.m. On friday and sunday, friday and saturday. What we mean by the closing time is the time your establishment's vacated of all patrons. It's not last call the last reservation, so I just wanted to make sure those hours seemed on the early side to me. I just wanted to make sure you understood that the way we the way we deal with closing hours it's the time the place is empty of patrons. Are you still okay with the 10 and 11? Or do you need? Well? Okay, I'm glad you mentioned that because I was talking to marco about this beforehand when we wrote 10, that's because of the new laws of covid in general. Had we had not had covid in place or any of this disastrous situation. We would be closing at 10, 30. everybody's gone except my kitchen who's pretty much there, maybe till 11, but no one's in there being served so and in general there's a most of the days. I mean at least in the summertime, from what I'm seeing, because it's been pretty barren for the most part we even close earlier. You know, I'm not gonna have my guys hang around if they could get on the train and go home quickly, yeah, but this will be a permanent change to your license and hopefully we'll see the other side of covid someday. So post, covid, you're, okay with are the customers being gone by 10 or 11, or if you want to make it 11 across the board, we can make it 11 across the board, but I will, I do know I'm going to be closing earlier because, regardless of anything, I'm still also paying hourly. So I get you know and we're watching every dime that comes out of our pockets right now. They don't. That would be perfect. If you could do that, sir yeah, you don't have to be open these hours. These are just the hours that are gonna. If this gets approved by us in the sla it'll be the hours on your license, that's fine leeway in wiggle room. I appreciate that. Thank you. I just wanted to summarize two letters we got. One is from alan oster who's, a cb4 member, but his writing in his capacity is president of the west 400 block association on 21st, 22nd and 23rd street says I'm writing in support to upgrade the license. This restaurant, which is within the boundaries of our block association, has been owned and operated by the same family for the past 30 years, they've been an outstanding business, neighbor, maintaining a clean environment and respectful relationship with residents. During the current pandemic, don giovanni remained open serving the public and keeping its staff employed. We have no cause for this application to be denied, and we have a letter from the greenwich village. Chelsea chamber of commerce from their executive director would like to express her strong support for don giovanni he's been serving the community and visitors for 30 years. John devon has been a community player demonstrated by donations to fdny local engine, 3 5 battalion 7.. Additionally, the restaurant was very helpful to groups within the community during 9 11.. We ask you to support this request. Is there a valuable member of the chamber of commerce but also an important member of the vibrant and unique culture of the chelsea community? Don giovanni participated in the chambers chelsea chew event where neighborhood neighbor businesses come together to promote the delicious and diverse food offerings of chelsea. They help stimulate the local economy and show to us all that they give back to the community right. Okay, a community member, okay committee, members, inga, I see your hand is raised. Yes, I'm going to speak as a community member and a board member, so first as the committee member I'm totally in in favor of this application, and I think you might want to bring your hours up to the weekend to 12 park at night. You do not have to stay open, but if you do two years from now, you can so don't limit yourself that way, I think thursday, friday saturday, you may want to stay later and you don't. You could close at nine if you want, but it's on your license. So I suggest you extend those three nights to midnight. That's up to you and again, as a committee member I'm in support of this as a resident, a neighbor and now, I'm speaking on on behalf of the london terrace tenants association. They are amazing neighbors. They support the tenants association. They support the local community. They are always friendly, anytime, I've ever called in the past. She picks up the phone immediately and is supportive of all of the residents and london terrace is huge. So on behalf of the london terrace tenants, association and myself personally, I support this. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Okay. Anybody else on the committee yeah I'd like to say something first, mike here, go ahead. Go ahead mike yeah! No everything about this application is wonderful. I wish every everyone was like this and as a somebody who lives right down the street, I can tell you this is one of the better places around in all respects, so I'm fully supportive of this all right. Thank you, yeah and I'll. Take my hat off as co-chair I'll. Take my hat off as co-chair and talk just as a committee member and as a neighbor, and I completely second exactly what inga and mike have been saying. I am a neighbor also from 24th street and 10th avenue and have been around as long as don giovanni has been around and I love it and it's a great addition to the community good neighbors. Thank you. Is it too early to make a motion? Let's see, first, rob, let's see if anybody has signed up from the community, nobody has a hand raised. Okay, rob you want to make a motion. Yes, I'd like to make a message. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you now you just one person, one person just raised their hands hold on one. Second, okay, sorry rob guys. Can you speak now? Yes, okay, I know I live on 43 and nine at manhattan, manhattan plaza and my wife and I go to don giovanni's all the time. I love these people. Their food is great they're, the nicest people you ever want to meet and man I'm all for anything. They want to do. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. Guy. Okay, rob I just want to clarify: was there an agreement for extended hours on weekends? Did the owner say yes to that? Does everyone hear me? Yes, I I'm I'm sorry. I was just suggested by london, terrace association and the community board that I should probably think of extending thursday, friday and saturday to 12 p.m, and I think she's right because I don't know what's in the near future, and if these the this turns around, I might be stuck with hours that I might regret- and I I I do agree with her, although I tend to be shy from those hours I'd like to have some leeway, if you don't mind that I make that change right now, nope, not at all so. Based upon that, I would like to make a motion of the new hours put forward to accept this. Okay, do I have a second second? Okay, all those in favor aye aye, those against abstaining present, not eligible, I think it passes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, two in a row with enthusiastic community support. That's great! I just wanted to mention at the end of the agenda. We're gonna have a brief discussion about a general topic. We've been getting a lot of questions from the community about whether liquor licenses can be transferred if the entire business is being sold. So we just want to talk about that for a few minutes when we get done with the published agenda. Kimmy. Good luck! Thank you! So much for all your support. I know I don't get to see everyone right now, but god I'm sending the biggest hug to everyone. You know in the community board and and in the neighborhood we we really love our neighbors and we're not in it about. I mean the end of the day. If it was always about the money, we would have liquor license in the first place. My family is not about that, but to us it was always about our neighbors and the community, and you know a day like today, just so sort of shows us and my family. What impact we've made and you don't always hear it every day until you know you have this moment that you're in a group and wow, you know it really means everything all the hard work and coming together and sandy and any catastrophe that we've had. We have the nicest neighbors in chelsea and in in hell's kitchen honestly, and I'm really proud of that. Thank you, you're, not just a great neighbor you're part of the family here in chelsea, as well as hell's kitchen. Well, that means everything to me. Thank you so much thank you and everyone please be safe. I appreciate it. Good luck, bye now, bye, bye, the next two applicants are for new. These are not existing restaurants. These are new applications for wine and beer and cider, as they say. The first one item number three is 180 7th avenue: that's for a beer wine, beer and cider license. This is 7th avenue between 22nd and 23rd street. It is called chelsea, chelsea pasta, though, as it's been pointed out a number of times the menu says chelsea pizza, but I'm sure we have an explanation from that. Okay, good evening. My name is robert callahan from michael kelly. Inc with me is the the owner of the establishment is also on nelly. If you could unmute brandon faye, you hear me unmuted, okay, great, thank you so we're a small italian restaurant. Basically, we serve pizzas and pastas very small. We have a capacity of 25 people in the establishment, there's going to be three large tables with 17 seats and that's all we hold so we're looking for a wine and beer license. Our hours of operation are going to be monday to friday, 11 45 to 1 am and saturday and sunday 10 a.m to 1 a.m. There'll be light ambient background music from an ipod or an ipad in the background, no open windows or doors, and we have no outside seating. If you have any questions, we'd be glad to answer them yeah. So is your doing this dba? Is it pasta by hudson or pizza by hudson? So how are you doing? Allow me to introduce myself brandon, really really nice to meet everybody yeah, to add to the to even more of the confusion. Yeah, it's actually it's pasta by hudson! Okay! Well, that's what you had on the farm the menu listed, mostly pizza yeah. You should have two menus. It's actually a nice even mix of both it's fresh pasta and fresh pizza yeah, but irish pasta has made it yeah. What I was referring to is this thing, which has the heading pizza by hudson, so I just want to make sure we have the name right. Yes, that's the pasta by hudson okay, and what do you there are several businesses at 187, which one are you replacing so I was. There was a burger place that used to be called cream line and that's where I would be taking the cream line space. Okay, it's a small, intimate space, a little less than 400 square feet, primarily in my business. We are currently located in columbus circle and we've been operating for about a year and a half, and we just do a lot of take out and delivery. That's all! I have any questions from committee members. Hinga. Sorry I mean so you do a lot of takeout and I know it's a small space. What are you doing with bikes and deliveries? Where are you keeping the bikes who are? You do have an outside delivery person, yeah, so great question? We will be using grubhub for any deliveries and their bikes, but a lot of our speaking from experience now, most of and actually because of covid were actually temporarily closed and we closed down on march 27th, but we're hoping to open up right after labor day when the market opens back up because we're in the turnstile market, but I've been keeping myself very busy since we've been closed, which I can go into later. If you want to know with that being said, we have a really nice blend of clientele. We do lots of kids in schools, which is going to be interesting in september. We do a lot of families, we do a lot of people that work in the neighborhood and then we do a lot of course, tourism, because it's columbus circle and there's the train stations there and a lot of foot traffic to the time warner center. So a lot of it is a pickup to the neighborhood. I was actually in the neighborhood for about 20 years, where I worked and operated another restaurant for close to 20 years and then moved to open up this little small, intimate restaurant and so just to answer your question about bikes. If any bikes are used would be through grubhub, but a lot of our food we really cater to the community and our pasta and pizza is best served fresh on the go or to a quick pick up. So it's a lot of people that are just coming home, getting off the trains or walking these days and swinging by and picking something up and usually living in the neighborhood. That's kind of my experience to date. When I spent 20 years at my other restaurant, I was really a part of the neighborhood and where I am now, and even actually coming to chelsea being brand new. Oddly enough right after the pandemic started, I fed the chelsea fdmy the emts on 20 third street off of I think that's off of whatever is that ninth, I believe between 10th and 11th, maybe that emt station yeah so yeah. A lot of my experiences with intimate locations these days and dealing with really culturally culturally rich, like neighborhoods, I'm also born and raised new yorker, okay, but so grubhub. They come on a bike and they park their bike. There's a lot of obstacles on you're between 21st and 20th, or 21st yeah, it's between it's between 21st and 20th, on 7th avenue. Okay, that's what I thought because you're farther down so okay! Now I'm gonna order food, I'm not walking over I'm on 23rd street between 9th and 10th, I'm not walking to get my pasta, I'm going to order it so someone's going to come with a bike drop it on the sidewalk or tie it to a tree which they're not supposed to. I don't think there are any bike corrals around there. So if you're doing a lot of business, people don't tend to walk to the restaurant to pick up their food, they have it delivered. So you're gonna have a lot of bikes on the sidewalks, the grub hub people coming in and out. So you might want to figure out a way to keep them off the sidewalk. I know there's working in front of you maybe apply for a parking bike corral. I don't know I'm taking notes by the way. Okay, I mean you can apply to the city christine's, not here or she would be telling you how to apply for a bike corral in front of the restaurant, because there are a lot of bikes chained up to everything on that block. So it's sort of like an obstacle course yeah brandon my office has that information so we'll be able to provide it to you. Okay, great thanks, so you might want to apply for one in the street and what that is. Is they put a bike corral out on the street and take up a parking space so that the sidewalk is nice and free? Because in chelsea we pay to go exercise, we don't walk to get our food. I don't know why! Other than that, I think it's fine. Can I ask a question yeah just to take a moment to educate myself and if it's inappropriate, please let me know, but does the 500-foot rule apply to an establishment like this or a request? Because you are 500, foot rule does not apply to beer and wine licenses: okay, okay, okay thanks! That was inappropriate. That was inappropriate. I asked because it's next to liz, lizzie and- and there are a number of things on the block that are yes, okay. Thank you, an appropriate question, your first question on the committee. It was appropriate anybody else on the committee. Anybody signed up. Nellie walker has his hand raised, but no one from public rob rob. You want to say something yeah, sorry about that it is a residential building. The only concern I have is the 1am on monday. Through thursday, would they be willing on maybe lowering that to like 11 or 12 on monday through thursday and then sorry sunday to thursday and then thursday, friday saturday doing 1am it and plus it's never had a liquor license there yeah I mean absolutely. I thought that I'm totally open and flexible can we can I request to do midnight sunday through thursday and then one a.m and friday and or whatever you recommend midnight on sunday through thursday and one am on friday and saturday yeah. We usually do. We usually do thursday, friday saturday for the weekends, okay cool, and there are a lot of other bars and restaurants there that are take out and open late. So true, it is an app it's packed. Do we have the new hours down frank? I don't know what the other feeling is, but I'm okay with the hours the original hours too, okay, yeah me too. You know, I don't see a change. There is necessary. I don't think so. I guess they're, not. Let's go back to 1am across the board. It sounds like yeah. There are too many other places that are open that late. How are you with that? Rob? Jason, okay? Well, we'll find out. I realized my mistake on this and I agree with you all. Okay, we have a consensus on the hours. Okay, I think that's the only thing holding us up from an introduction of a resolution. Anyone want to introduce anything just to say christine's, not here, so I feel like I have to do this winter awning outside. Yes, the awnings. You know those things that you put up like little tiny apartments on the sidewalk that are made out of claw for the winter to keep the cold out are the storm enclosures dormant closures. Thank you, you're welcome. They said they're not gonna. Have one good just make sure that if you change your mind, it is not wider than 18 inches. All the other ones are illegal. Yes, okay! That's it you very nicely channeled christine! Thank you. Okay! Now do we have a resolution? Okay motion, abstaining present not eligible okay. Thank you very much have a great day everyone. It's an honor and pleasure everybody seriously. Thank you very much. Welcome to the community. I'm really really excited. Thank you. Good luck! Good luck on your move to chelsea! Thank you! Everybody! Thank you! Bye, bye, okay, the last item on the agenda other than what we're going to talk about transfers of licensing is item number four again, a new liquor license. This is 623 ninth avenue at 44th street. It's a corporation called lotus west, but it will be doing businesses in popparia. The applicant george, are you the lawyer, you're muted george? I think okay hi good evening. My name is my name, is george carp, I'm the I'm, the attorney for lotus west and as as you indicated, this is on the corner of 44th street, and it's a former for those that remember was alegria for many years. I happen to represent him, although this is the people who are the applicant was keem. Martinez is involved, was involved with polka rear on 44th on 46th street and when they had one up on 84th street and second avenue, both of which, unfortunately, they had to leave because of problems with the landlord raising the rent beyond what they were willing to pay. So they would found this location and because they're in the neighborhood, and for that reason they would like to open up basically on the theme of palparia and for those that live in the this area. Pulperia has been around for about five years. It closed several months ago, but it had a very good reputation and was very well known, was a little smaller than this restaurant. I believe they want to open. Using that theme, betty the the manager of the is who is with us victor medina, is here, and he worked in that restaurant for for all the years it was there joaquin martinez, also towards the end, was one of the managers of the premises. He'd like to open up same thing, same motif, same style with many same menu as you saw that which was attached. The menu was the menu from 46th street. We he is here now. I think, if you have any questions about it, we we're looking for a wine of wine and beer and liquor and the hours that we requesting and for a certain reason, we're requesting for closing hours. We want to close at 11. Excuse me at midnight monday through thursday, but they are looking and and on sundays, but they are looking for 4 a.m, on the weekends and the reason for that is they've learned from their restaurant, which they've operated really without any issues with the community. As far as I know, the that the people that are that follow that restaurant, south americans and they have the tradition of eating and eating late, it's nothing unusual for people to walk in at one o'clock in the morning at pulperia and sit down and have a full dinner. So that's why we're asking for that reason. The restaurant is not that the bar is only nine people. It's not going to be a particularly bar crowd. It's a restaurant as alegria was run for many years. That was italian, but there was no problem with that restaurant, so they're gonna follow what what this neighborhood is used to and what what they want, except they're, bringing a very good restaurant here and I'd like to turn it over to mr joaquin martinez just to introduce himself. Thank you, hello. You hear me now: yeah hi, my name is joki martinez and I'm the owner of this new place, we're really we're trying to open. Despite all of this, you know hard times that we are facing and we hope to have your support. We have emailed earlier today a few cheats with the supporters of our liquor license in the neighborhood. Do we send it to mrs gonzalez and then we're counting on you? You know to to create jobs like the way I see it, because we really need to. This is what we do. This is our life. We've been doing, I think in the service industry for 20 years, the upper west side in pulperia, and now we closed the two restaurants. We had open website and 44 like our attorney set and then we're planning to have to to create. You know an income here with this. Is that we are, we are doing an extremely you know. It's very. It has been hard for us losing all what we had and then try to reinvent again what we are gonna be doing and we're counting on your support to get this record license and to open as soon as we can. Thank you. I have a couple technical questions. Maybe, for you, george, I noticed neither mr martinez or mr medina were on the prior poporia liquor licenses. Is that right? Those are in the name of the chef carlos barraz and anthony mayer jr. Is that correct? He muted again? That's my understanding. Okay, so have either of these gentlemen. Had a liquor license before no, no, this is their first, but both have been in the industry for many many years. Okay, I see mr martinez this spring got approved by community board. Seven, I think, to open a place at 226. West 76th is that west 79th? Sorry? Is that going forward, or is this instead of that? Yes hi yeah? We had that project earlier in the year and we had everything pretty much ready to go, but then probably came, and actually we were approved by the community, but unfortunately, we'd have to again lose money. So are you going to be opening that place as well? Or are you just doing corporate right now? Hopefully now, but now I know we have no sadness, because there is no there's no way to have fabulous outside. It was a private manhattan club. It's a very fine dining. Thank you. George. You neglected to mention that between now and lala gria we had a fairly infamous operator in this space that caused a lot of problems for about five or six years when it was intermezzo and galinero and carmia. I don't believe that it was that long, because I know there was a problem in the building here from some some prospective tenant, who did some construction, so this place was really out for a number of years, but I understand- and I know the group that you're talking about- and I know all the problems that came with- that they have no connection with them at all. I never met them. I do know some of them from the area, but these gentlemen, have nothing, never had anything to do with them, nor have they had anything to do with any restaurant they've ever been in okay, so we we can include steps that the gentleman's name was bessem cute qcad will not be involved in anything. Absolutely it's. My understanding that this license here had actually been revoked because of the prior actions, the land, the landlady, the owner of the building, has made an application for a waiver of the two-year prohibition. If that doesn't come, we don't get the restaurant but she's we've. Given some information about mr martinez and the landlord is very satisfied with his background and the background of the people that he works with and so we're waiting on actions of the liquor authority, because without their approval we can't even if we wanted to, cannot get a license. So we need them to do a waiver and that's in the process now how fast they will work under the current situation. I cannot tell you, okay, I think we we do not, and- and you probably know this george- we don't like to vote on sidewalk cafes until we have the approved dca plans and in fact, in this case, under the current I've talked about the permanent rules, not the open restaurant rules under the permanent rules. You can't fit a sidebar cafe on 44th street, so I hope your client knows that, because that sidewalk is only 11 feet, 8 inches, and I know that because it's about 200 yards away- and I just measured it and given that you need eight foot, pedestrian path and three foot service aisle that would leave you eight inches for tables, so it just doesn't fit well. It's had had tables for it's never had I've lived here for 15 years. It's never had a sidewalk cafe. Well, I that's not my experience and I did represent the owner for many years here. I got the original license as far as I know they had a license and I've seen it. I saw the you know that they had a license. They had two. They had two tables out in front. They had some tables on the side. Well, it's possible! You know. The place across the street is grandfathered in because the law changed about ten years ago and mandated the three-foot service aisle, so that's possible and, and the sidewalk cafe would yours wouldn't be grandfathered in because there's been this gap of you know whatever. Whatever the rules will be, we will follow okay, but but for purposes of this application it would simplify things if we eliminate it that that doesn't prohibit them from participating in open restaurants and all that that's a complicated. I would I I, by the way we put it in there as a courtesy just to let you know what we what we wanted. We understood it certainly is going to be the people who decide whether we get the license that we have to rely on, and we knew we had to be in front of the board when that happened. Okay, appreciate that this place also has the peculiarity of having a sort of separate smaller doorway establishment on 44th street right operated, as usually as a pizza place. I was curious as to their their plans for that space. Yes, in the concept that we were opening, we were serving empanadas familiar with the turnover appetizers, and we want to do like a big list of empanadas and a south america style street food, which is very interesting to sell it to grow okay, but it's got to be separate. I mean there's, there's not going to be a connection inside for patrons right. No wait! Wait! What's that question, there will be no connection for patrons to pass through from one establishment to the other. Is that they right connected through the kitchen will only be empanadas so empanadas. You know who knows you know what if we have a beautiful recovery? Okay, okay, I didn't say anything about music. I assume it's only background music. Just background music yeah. I want to introduce interject here a second the reason we're asking specifically about the music. We did come upon a review of the second avenue establishment, where the reviewer strongly suggested that it would be very difficult to have a conversation after I know it was 5, 30 or 6 30 in the afternoon, because the decibel level was so high. I assume you're not going to replicate that here on correct. It's not going to be the same in operating side. We, you know we tried to do a little bit more like festive more with the music. It was kind of a small space in the back, so we decided to turn off that the system in the back and we also had a good reputation. After all, you know. Never we had a counselor. It was a great review for the food. This was in forbes magazine a couple years ago, but the reviewer said after even after the chef agreed to turn the music down, it was still, he still measured it at 90 decibels inside which is pretty loud by the way. Guys since you're talking say to you is that you know every every issue they might have. We always address it in order to become a better, a better part of your community saying that we have friends, we have a lot of friends and family. You know the reviews that we have online. They can. They can say that you know we have a good people coming to dang with us, and I'm very you know positive that in this you know this particular place. We will do something great, and it's going to be a great restaurant, where you know everyone can come okay. So just just to finish off with this stuff, we have a letter from the west 44th street, better block association, which is obviously centered on this block. They say they welcome the prospect of a restaurant coming into the former intermezzo space based on earlier experiences. We request the following stipulations: they ask that the hours be monday, thursday to midnight and sunday to 1am, which I guess is what you asked for, but they'd like you to close on friday and saturday at 2 a.m. They say if the side establishment is used, they'd like that to be closed at 11 p.m, monday, tuesday, 12 midnight friday through sunday. They want the our usual stipulations about doors and windows closed whenever there's music inside and by no later than 10 p.m, 11 p.m. They asked for an acoustic study, no illuminated signage on 44th street or on the corner, inga inga, christine's stipulation about a storm enclosure and that you attend block association meetings. I think most of those are probably uncontroversial, except for the hours, but I just want to get that out there and we can have the committee discussion now. Okay, I see anger, your hand is raised. It's been raised for a while anybody else on the committee will have something to say: first inga, okay, I have two things. I know you have french doors. So when you have music on and you have the doors open, you cannot hear the music outside. You have to keep it so low that when I'm walking on the sidewalk, I cannot hear your music if the doors are open, basically, no music. The second thing is frank: what are the hours of the previous? What what have they been licensed for? Have they had 4 a.m before no, it's it's midnight and 2 a.m. I believe yeah. So my personal feeling is, you know I'm never against the 4am, but for a new establishment with new owners and if they had a 4am I would go for it, but I would want to do the hours that were previously licensed. I wouldn't want to increase them until they show that they're really good neighbors and nothing as a practical matter. Nothing. There has been open later than midnight, yeah. That's what I saw on some websites, so they're not losing business, because the neighbors are open till four. So I don't, I think, even the other. According to their website, the the 46th street culprit was only open until 11 at midnight, so 2am is actually a lot longer than they. Then they stayed open there yeah I'm 2am and midnight, but I wouldn't want to increase from what was already there until they've shown that they're good neighbors anybody else on the committee. Anybody want to say anything about the hours yeah, hey. I just retouching upon what was said. There are two french doors on each side of the main entrance on ninth avenue if they could be shut anytime, there's, music or just really anytime at all, and then I I agree: it's a new business saturday, friday 2 a.m. Let them show that they're a good, neighbor and then come back and extend the hours. That's it thanks, rob anybody else. Anybody other committee members know anyone from the community have their hand raised. Can I add something and I'd like to correct something so that there's no misunderstanding about the back? The back room has was a pizza for many long time here, right until the last, even the last people used that for that purpose and what was said before, if I understood it, I wanted to make it clear that the license here applies to the whole premises, including the back and that's why they have wine beer, you know and whatever they conserve, they can serve there in the back. Usually it was wine. There is a connection. It cannot be closed up. It's also a fire entrance exit, so I just want to make it clear, but although it's not a there's, no doorway, there's no sign. You know telling people to go to the back of people to go to the front. It's the way. It's always been for the last 20 25 years. That's the way this restaurant has been set up right yeah. We appreciate the the clarification and, yes, we understand that the liquor license will apply to the entire premise, including including that side. I just wanted to make it so no misunderstanding that we've said something: that's not true chris evening, everyone just about the the side storefront. Do we remember when that was operational, maybe like three four tenants ago, how long that pizza was open to whether or not it was that feature has been there since 1995. That's when I got them their license. It was in place at that time, the time of operation when you cease operations in the evening at that pizzeria location, chris, the immediate prior owners, but it was about 10 years. It wasn't. It was really a takeout and two or three people sat at that time. They had a counter where they had some stools, but now that we're not having that the prior operator there agreed to close that side space at midnight nightly, but it was again never open that late, yeah generally not yeah yeah we're suggesting 12 o'clock on the weekends and 11 o'clock during the weekdays to close the back. It means no one interested, I don't I'm not talking about the interior, I'm talking about that takeout yeah! Okay, all right! I think. That's that's what you're, referring to chris right that'll, be fine! The takeout! That's correct! That's correct, bert, okay, okay! Anybody else have their hands up nelly, no okay, so george and miss martinez. If we could go through these steps, orderly to make sure we're all in agreement. First, we're going to say this: application doesn't apply to a sidewalk. Cafe, correct, doesn't mean you're not going to get one, but it's not covered by this application. Fine, it looks like the consensus of the committee would be for to give you the out the hours for the main operation of midnight monday to thursday 2 a.m, friday and saturday and 1 a.m on sunday, okay and then for the 44th street side establishment you close at 11 p.m, monday to thursday and midnight friday and saturday, it's okay, okay and again, as you heard from their earlier discussion, this means closed and vacated of of patrons sunday through, for you said monday, close sunday at 11, 2, decide aside, we I think it was. We had it for 1am. The block association asked for 11 p.m, monday to thursday and midnight friday through sunday for the side, yeah. Okay, I figured if, if that's what they want, we can go. May I just ask something in terms of closing the back. I mean this: it's part of this restaurant and if someone came in here and they were filled and they needed something in the back, they could seat someone. But long as it came out of the front not out of the side, it won't be yeah. The goal is to have the the doors on 44. not used for entering in exits after those times. Thank you. Those hours don't have anything to do with who's sitting down and eating getting food from the front coming in and out, okay and then in terms of the doors and windows and and george, this will be a change from your stip form. We want the doors and windows to be closed whenever there's any amplified, music or any amplified sound or any music inside, and then even if there's no sound inside closed at 10 p.m. Weeknights and 11 p.m, friday, saturday. So so man is it the understanding that, on a nice day on a on a weekend, we have they have brunch and they have some background music. They cannot keep the doors open that that is what's being asked windows I mean yeah yeah, those seriously noise travels through those things incredibly to those french doors. So we're not saying you can't have them open you just can't. Have you can't have music? Well, you don't want to hear the music on the sidewalk. Well that I could understand all right that that's different than saying that we have to close it. Yes, the music can be lowered, but you will have to agree to that, but but I don't think that having no music, I think that's kind of hurts their business. It doesn't work if they're open you're going to hear the music yeah. I think someone mentioned the same thing before they said that the music will not be heard outside, but they're not giving up giving up the music. No everyone everyone tonight has agreed to. These are our standard stipulations and everyone ahead of you has agreed to them all right. I don't think I heard that, but okay, these are not unusual stipulations. This is almost on every single applicant that intends to have. Has that kind of a frontal structure and has music every applicant agrees to that, because whether I'm sitting on the edge or standing right next to the outdoor window, you can't stop the music from going outside if the doors are open. You just can't okay, and I guess, if you're, okay with that, I'm willing to forgo the acoustic report that the block association asked. For I mean it's, it's been operating for a long time. I'd leave that to my clients, if they're there, okay, as long as the music is low, it doesn't mean that we don't have to have music. It's like very low, like just the ambience. You could have as much music inside as you want, but if there's music, it can't be heard outside on the screen, so the doors and windows, your choice is to have music and the doors closed or no music and the doors open, yeah cause your neighbors will walk by and call every time you have music with the doors open, even if it's for brunch or like lunch any time. Okay with those, are we fine with those steps? Then, because, if we are yeah, we got a lot more to go. Oh okay, frank they're, easy from here on in though there'll be no illuminated signs on the 44th street side or on the corner of 44th and 9th yeah. You mentioned that already you're. Okay with that, okay, any storm enclosure- you know it's that plastic thing around. The doorway that incas talked about won't extend more than 18 inches from the building that that's also the law. The best thing to do is just put something on the inside some nice heavy velvet curtains on the inside. It's you. Otherwise, people can't get through the sidewalk if it's cold, yeah, okay, the owners and managers will attend block meet block association meetings as requested okay with that and the phone numbers of the restaurant managers will be provided to the block association and any residents who request them. Okay and then, as I said before, and you shouldn't care about this, the former operator of this location, bess and qcad will have no involvement whatsoever in the applicant's operations, whether as an owner manager, consultant or employee, so no financial connection, and then also that he has no involvement or ownership interest in your corporation, the lotus west, corporation, okay and last thing. I think this is obvious, but we've been having a lot of problems with open restaurants, there'll be no music whatsoever outside live amplified and no music in the sidewalk cafe or on the sidewalk, or anything you. Okay with that right, george and the last thing. If we could get a actual floor plan for inside he's, you're muted, you muted it could be handwritten. But just someone who shows us where the tables are right right nelly said her deadline. Is the 29th of august 26th 26th? What was that the deadline to get the plan to the office? Okay, sure you'll, have it well before? Okay, george, do you have any sense when you're gonna hear from the sla about the two-year thing? No, that it's with? What's going on it's hard to really get too much information, but we're hoping it'll come sooner than later, so you're going to wait to file until you hear no we're going to file first here, all right, we'll take that chance, okay, so everyone's okay with all those steps, I read yes, yeah! Okay, now I'm asking y'all george and the applicant you're. Okay, with all that. I'm sorry did you hear that? Did you say that again, all the steps I just read, you're we're okay with all of that, it's as best as I could hear them. Yes, I'd like I'm just going to ask nelly if you could get me a copy of them as soon as you can, you might be able to email them to me. I'd appreciate it. Thank you, okay. So we have a resolution. Do I hear? Yes? Okay, all those in favor aye opposed abstaining present, not eligible. Thank you guys. Good luck! I'd like to hear what you said. What you're doing on that note, I'd like to hear what you're going to say about the transformations right, so don't run away, don't run away stay with us. I'm gonna wait! Okay! So you know, as the restaurant industry gets bleaker and bleaker, we've been hearing a lot about restaurants that are trying to transfer ownership entirely, in other words, transfer the lease transfer, all the fixtures and everything and we're getting a lot of questions about whether liquor licenses can be transferred. So I'd like to address that briefly, I want to remind everyone that this meeting's being being recorded and will be available so I'd like to keep the discussion on the level of general policy and not start speculating about whether this may be happening or not in specific places, and I also want to be clear that what I'm going to summarize is the law as it stands now, who knows there could be some emergency order that changes this? I don't think anyone ever expected. There'd be all these to-go sales, but at the moment the law is clear that a liquor license is specific to the individual or entity on the license and the location. So if I get a license for 44th for this place, stay in the corner here at 44th and 9th avenue that license is only good for me and only for that location. If I want to get out of the business, I can, you know maybe sublet the premises, I can sell the furniture, but I cannot transfer the liquor license to a new proprietor. The new proprietor has to apply for his or her own liquor license. Similarly, if I wanted to move next door, I can't take the liquor license with me. I have to get the sla's approval even to move the liquor light, my own license from one spot to another, so the license is very specific to both the individual, who gets it and the place where he or she gets it and the law. You know several places in the alcohol law says no license shall be transferable or assignable, except in certain changes of corporate form. So a license is issued to any person for any licensed premise and shall not be transferable to any other person or to any other premise or to any other part of the building. The sla also forbids this practice called availing, which is, if I have a liquor license. I have to remain in charge and responsible for the premise. I can't step away and say bert's going to take over and run the business and I'm going to have nothing to do with it, but bert's going to run it under my license. It's called the veiling. It doesn't work that way. Similarly, I can't bring in a new partner like inga, say and say you know: you're gonna run this place with me and I'm gonna give you half the profits. An owner cannot share revenue from licensed business with someone who has not been disclosed to the sla, so the protections are pretty strong that under current law, that would say you cannot simply sell or transfer a license along with the rest of the restaurant. I think people here know about the southern hospitality place at 44th and 9th who tried to do that. The sla actually brought charges against them for availing, and there was a hearing scheduled just as covet erupted, so the hearing got adjourned, but the sla is definitely looking into the availing situation there, where basically southern hospitality turned into janesworth. Without you know, anyone having any any say about it. George, do you basically agree the the current law is that a license could never just be transferred the purp. What happens is when, when you sell a business, you put your own license into safe keeping and that allows the new person to get his temporary license if they, if the liquor authority grants it to him. But at no time do you ever really sell your license the only when on a transfer, what you're doing is just agreeing to put your license in safekeeping and then when you his license finally comes, and he gets his temporary then his full license. Then your license gets cancelled and then new person takes over. So it's never really a sale of, and you can only get a temporary if you've applied for new license and if the place had been open within the past 30 days right. So it's really a short window. But again all this is still contingent on the new operator applying for absolutely absolutely new operator has to be, and everybody in it has to be told to the authority. Otherwise they, as you say, unveiling, occurs and that's that's a tough one to get caught on that. The reason we're having this informational piece by frank is a number of people in the community have raised grace concerns to us about quote unquote transferring of licenses and questioning that. So we wanted to be clear to everybody. What exactly is the process and what is within the parameters of the process and what is outside there might be. There might be people on the committee that have questions or statements or people here and right. We should also welcome chris lebron, who made a comment on the last application and is a is a member of the community board for, although not a member of this committee, so welcome. Thank you. I actually did have a question and this can go to george or frank or inga. So right now we're seeing a commercial rent. Landlords are unwilling for rent for restaurants and bars and small businesses if they are willing to lower it, they lower it. That's what percentages there's no real forgiveness on there is. Is there any legality to a landlord finding a third party and offering an outright buyout of an operator? It's like soup to nuts everything inside the restaurant. All the bottles, all the fruit foods and a liquor license to hand over to that third party. The only way you can, if I may, is, if you buy a corporation and very very few people want to do that. You pick up a lot of debts that you don't want to know about so, but you can theoretically buy the corporation and the license does stay with the corporation, but the new people have to be approved by the liquor authority and it had- and it goes be, it goes to the board if eighty percent of its sale of more than eighty percent eighty percent or more of the shares it goes to the community board, it has to be notified, that's the current rule, but that's still. The new owners still have to be approved, absolutely they're with rds yeah. Basically, the liquor authority insists on knowing every individual who is who is selling liquor and that's one of their bedrock principles. So as a practical matter, a landlord or an existing operator cannot sell a business complete with the liquor license. The liquor license just does not transfer that way and even if they want to sell the liquor from the other one, if he buys the corporation you can you get the license with it. You got to be approved, but it stays with the corporation yeah, but it's still, it still has to go through the sla and you can't even sell the old liquor from the old of the old establishment unless you get what's called the liquidators permit. Not if you buy that, not if you buy the company okay, but again, we've we've discussed that that's a rare right. Yes, of course it is yes. Second question: this is the final ones. If there are small businesses being harassed, hey I'm only receiving 20 of your rent every month. I have someone willing to come in at this price point, and they want to buy you out. Is that a form of tenant harassment and, if so, who should they go to within the community board or bureaucratically to the city, so you're saying that the landlords are doing that hypothetically well, that I really haven't come across? I know that some difficulty in getting them to work with the tenants, that's a big problem that they all have, but some have been cooperative and I must say they they really have, but I have not heard of what you've said as happening, but I wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me if someone was doing that yeah so so, who would a corporation small business owner go to if they're approached by a landlord with such? I guess it's it's beyond. I notify the liquor authority that it's not a true deal. If it isn't. I don't know the other thing chris, it's probably on my expertise but legally done or whether it's a sleight of hand of somehow getting it from one to the other yeah. The only thing I can think of chris would be to have them go to the small business services to see. If you know they, because I honestly don't know what the what the law is, if you're in arrears on a commercial lease, I just don't know what your rights are. I would also go to the other local electeds. I would go go to your local elected because there are businesses that can't pay their rent, even if they don't have a liquor license, say it's a clothing store or a small store. The landlord says: okay, you're out, I will buy what you have and put someone else in, so they yeah they need to go to their elections. I would involve them. Definitely because this is a process right now. This is a process that really is not it's hard to define legally. If it's, if it's, what is wrong legally, you know with what's harassment at what point, I don't think it's really defined between paying rent a commercial owner, a commercial renter- it's certainly defined in a residential context, but I don't think it's defined in a commercial context. I could be wrong, but I don't think so. No, it just happened to a friend of mine in the west village flagging something like this is really important. Our number is about 40 loss of small businesses in new york city by the end of this pandemic, possibly up to 65. So I I make sure that small businesses in hell's, kitchen and chelsea understand that they have a layer of protection from something increments like this know that there is anything like bird said, I don't think there's anything to find like some businesses they'll if you're renting, a commercial lease or or retail, you may have to take out a letter of credit for a year. So, if you're, if you signed your lease and you took out a letter of credit and you stopped paying, they can draw that letter of credit and kick you out and they've got a year's worth of rent. So there are a lot of different things. You just don't know, but I would if they feel harassed, they should contact their local elections. Definitely yeah. I want to thank you for the time to ask these questions. I appreciate it, unfortunately, I'm being forced out, but thank you, everybody and good night. Thank you good night, george. Thank you. Is there? Anybody with a hand raised that you see who's, not visible morgan. Did you have your hand raised before? Okay? Okay, so I think we're done welcome to our new member. Yes welcome.
