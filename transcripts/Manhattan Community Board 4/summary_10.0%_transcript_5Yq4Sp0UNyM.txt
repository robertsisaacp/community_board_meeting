Here, for the first time, the business license and permits committee makes recommendations to the full board which meets the first wednesday of the month, which will be in september very early.
So welcome carrie and let's go now to item number one which was 149 west 14th street jamaa, mama they're, applying to use their backyard where you are as they call it, the yes, the rare yard.
But we can't see I'm I'm here, my dear I'm here hello and we so we appeared last month to present kind of two parts of this application or for this applicant, and so the first one was the temporary approval of the backyard space with all of the current covet exceptions and then to permanently amend their license application so that when these exceptions do expire, that they would be allowed to continue to operate in the backyard.
The extension for the sla's backyard exception actually didn't happen until probably after 5 p.m. The day of august 5th, we sat there just waiting with baited brass wondering when the sla and whether they were actually going to extend it and they did and they extended it through september, and now we, where we're you know we're gonna, be playing that game.
Tamara also did she reached out to a local acoustic company to get a proposal about what she can do with regard to the backyard and to limiting the noise and how you know it extends and affects the neighbors and how they can dampen sound, and that proposal was also sent over to the committee, and I guess pretty much the the questionnaire details.
You know, depending on the layout and what's not, and if I can talk about- and let me just mention, because that was something that came up last month- she is agreeing to you know the community board's recommendations in terms of hours.
Your recommended hours right now, she's closing at 10, and if I you know we'll touch a little bit on what was in.
Possibly you know trying to find ways to reduce the sound from that that coming and going with the staff and yeah, I I think tamara has has you know she's doing her best right now.
Is that backyard and and it's it's keeping her above ground for the time being, whether it's even whether she's able to meet all of her expenses during this time and how long that's going to continue is really you know a large concern and- and hopefully, when some of you know, we've gotten past this current hurdle that we're we're in and and she's able to, you know, operate fully, there's a lot of recouping that's going to need to happen and and having those additional seats in the backyard is going to be super important and so, in addition to making sure that her business stays in operation, she she's she's.
Actually so it's already there we're working on the carpeting or the rubbering on the floor and we'll make sure that it will be installed also right away and the next things were acoustical panels and also what professional, acoustical professional told news that right now we exit the door right in front of the neighbors windows on the 15th street and what we will need is we basically have to have the awnings that will be more of a fabric and we can close that exit and we can have a different accident throughout the wall, but the cane that has to go through the ob, the department of buildings.
So you can obviously it's very hard to get those acoustical panels in a week or ten days, because those are for pre-order and they need to travel some from overseas to make sure that he basically told me that he has done many concerts throughout the community also which his community, so he course that noise, but he needs some time to make sure that we do it in the right way.
Okay, bert any questions from committee members yeah who went to see this frank?
We went right right right, yeah, so I've seen the pictures and it looks like it could work and there's a lot of support from the community.
One was for testimony and then the other one was the the regular stuff all right, I'll look for it, but if you guys have looked at it, I'm fine with that I mean for me: there's a lot of support from immediate neighbors.
I'm I'm very impressed with this applicant seems like she's going above and beyond, and I think this is the type of applicant that we want our community.
Second, all right, let's just to summarize so the steps will be that they're going to implement the recommendations of the acoustic report and then I'd like to carry over three from our temporary letter.
Doors really are to be closed, except when used for entering and exiting, and all patrons must be seated you, okay with those and the recommendations of the acoustic report, will be implemented you tomorrow and yes, yes, absolutely!
What's up how it will be laid out, yeah, okay, nelly, what's the deadline for that, I will tell you right now hold on one.
Second, I will need it by august: 26th, okay, okay, the other thing I'd say so you don't keep coming back to us and we can include, as part of this motion, is that our temporary approval continues to be extended as the sla extends your ability to use the very art.
If you look at the front of the restaurant out front, yes yeah they have a table and then they have the sidewalk board even out farther the a-frame and then the benches, none of that's legal at all.
So what don giovanni is trying to do right now is it is going through some sort of restructuring based on the the covet period, as you can imagine most places along 10th avenue, I'm sure you've seen you know, closed signs or for sale signs, so don giovanni is trying to adjust that by upgrading their license to a full liquor license to be able to serve their patrons.
Also they have a full liquor license, so we want to be able to match the two up so that they can provide the same services, the same goods to the patrons, not only uptown but also in chelsea, and I think the uptown location, I think I believe community board 4 is also under that or that uptown location is under that jurisdiction.
We decided basically after 30 years that we wanted to file for a different class application because, first and foremost it's been our restaurant was hit.
My 44th street location was broken into twice and we had to open and close and we were looted, and I can't even begin to tell you how much that cost us in expenses, but we decided that we thought that we really needed some extra income because we don't think we'll survive and although the chelsea location remained open throughout covid for delivery, we now see that a lot of the clientele from empire diner who's, my next-door neighbor.
Their patrons were always coming there for alcoholic beverages, including including dining, and they were coming to us thereafter, looking for another place to have an aperol spritz or whatever they were looking for, and I couldn't provide it, and I realized that I was also losing a lot of clientele and because of that you know, I decided to file for to apply for another class of application and we're there 30 years.
Nor did I ever care to have a liquor license for 30 years, because we were fine with wine and beer, but we are suffering right now and we are trying to do anything to add into our income.
You know, we've been a very vital part, as a matter of fact to the neighborhood and to the community doing a lot of different kinds of contributions throughout our 30 years, and so I mean I, I guess that's all right.
I just wanted to make sure you understood that the way we the way we deal with closing hours it's the time the place is empty of patrons.
You know, I'm not gonna have my guys hang around if they could get on the train and go home quickly, yeah, but this will be a permanent change to your license and hopefully we'll see the other side of covid someday.
So post, covid, you're, okay with are the customers being gone by 10 or 11, or if you want to make it 11 across the board, we can make it 11 across the board, but I will, I do know I'm going to be closing earlier because, regardless of anything, I'm still also paying hourly.
Yes, I'm going to speak as a community member and a board member, so first as the committee member I'm totally in in favor of this application, and I think you might want to bring your hours up to the weekend to 12 park at night.
You do not have to stay open, but if you do two years from now, you can so don't limit yourself that way, I think thursday, friday saturday, you may want to stay later and you don't.
Yes, okay, I know I live on 43 and nine at manhattan, manhattan plaza and my wife and I go to don giovanni's all the time.
Guy. Okay, rob I just want to clarify: was there an agreement for extended hours on weekends?
I was just suggested by london, terrace association and the community board that I should probably think of extending thursday, friday and saturday to 12 p.m, and I think she's right because I don't know what's in the near future, and if these the this turns around, I might be stuck with hours that I might regret- and I I I do agree with her, although I tend to be shy from those hours I'd like to have some leeway, if you don't mind that I make that change right now, nope, not at all so.
We've been getting a lot of questions from the community about whether liquor licenses can be transferred if the entire business is being sold.
You know in the community board and and in the neighborhood we we really love our neighbors and we're not in it about.
My family is not about that, but to us it was always about our neighbors and the community, and you know a day like today, just so sort of shows us and my family.
If you could unmute brandon faye, you hear me unmuted, okay, great, thank you so we're a small italian restaurant.
Our hours of operation are going to be monday to friday, 11 45 to 1 am and saturday and sunday 10 a.m to 1 a.m. There'll be light ambient background music from an ipod or an ipad in the background, no open windows or doors, and we have no outside seating.
I was actually in the neighborhood for about 20 years, where I worked and operated another restaurant for close to 20 years and then moved to open up this little small, intimate restaurant and so just to answer your question about bikes.
A lot of my experiences with intimate locations these days and dealing with really culturally culturally rich, like neighborhoods, I'm also born and raised new yorker, okay, but so grubhub.
Okay, great thanks, so you might want to apply for one in the street and what that is.
Can I ask a question yeah just to take a moment to educate myself and if it's inappropriate, please let me know, but does the 500-foot rule apply to an establishment like this or a request?
Through thursday, would they be willing on maybe lowering that to like 11 or 12 on monday through thursday and then sorry sunday to thursday and then thursday, friday saturday doing 1am it and plus it's never had a liquor license there yeah I mean absolutely.
We usually do thursday, friday saturday for the weekends, okay cool, and there are a lot of other bars and restaurants there that are take out and open late.
Bye, bye, okay, the last item on the agenda other than what we're going to talk about transfers of licensing is item number four again, a new liquor license.
You hear me now: yeah hi, my name is joki martinez and I'm the owner of this new place, we're really we're trying to open.
Given some information about mr martinez and the landlord is very satisfied with his background and the background of the people that he works with and so we're waiting on actions of the liquor authority, because without their approval we can't even if we wanted to, cannot get a license.
I cannot tell you, okay, I think we we do not, and- and you probably know this george- we don't like to vote on sidewalk cafes until we have the approved dca plans and in fact, in this case, under the current I've talked about the permanent rules, not the open restaurant rules under the permanent rules.
The place across the street is grandfathered in because the law changed about ten years ago and mandated the three-foot service aisle, so that's possible and, and the sidewalk cafe would yours wouldn't be grandfathered in because there's been this gap of you know whatever.
Whatever the rules will be, we will follow okay, but but for purposes of this application it would simplify things if we eliminate it that that doesn't prohibit them from participating in open restaurants and all that that's a complicated.
Okay, appreciate that this place also has the peculiarity of having a sort of separate smaller doorway establishment on 44th street right operated, as usually as a pizza place.
Yes, in the concept that we were opening, we were serving empanadas familiar with the turnover appetizers, and we want to do like a big list of empanadas and a south america style street food, which is very interesting to sell it to grow okay, but it's got to be separate.
We will do something great, and it's going to be a great restaurant, where you know everyone can come okay.
They want the our usual stipulations about doors and windows closed whenever there's music inside and by no later than 10 p.m, 11 p.m. They asked for an acoustic study, no illuminated signage on 44th street or on the corner, inga inga, christine's stipulation about a storm enclosure and that you attend block association meetings.
So my personal feeling is, you know I'm never against the 4am, but for a new establishment with new owners and if they had a 4am I would go for it, but I would want to do the hours that were previously licensed.
Then they stayed open there yeah I'm 2am and midnight, but I wouldn't want to increase from what was already there until they've shown that they're good neighbors anybody else on the committee.
There are two french doors on each side of the main entrance on ninth avenue if they could be shut anytime, there's, music or just really anytime at all, and then I I agree: it's a new business saturday, friday 2 a.m. Let them show that they're a good, neighbor and then come back and extend the hours.
Anybody other committee members know anyone from the community have their hand raised.
The back room has was a pizza for many long time here, right until the last, even the last people used that for that purpose and what was said before, if I understood it, I wanted to make it clear that the license here applies to the whole premises, including the back and that's why they have wine beer, you know and whatever they conserve, they can serve there in the back.
Fine, it looks like the consensus of the committee would be for to give you the out the hours for the main operation of midnight monday to thursday 2 a.m, friday and saturday and 1 a.m on sunday, okay and then for the 44th street side establishment you close at 11 p.m, monday to thursday and midnight friday and saturday, it's okay, okay and again, as you heard from their earlier discussion, this means closed and vacated of of patrons sunday through, for you said monday, close sunday at 11, 2, decide aside, we I think it was.
It doesn't work if they're open you're going to hear the music yeah.
Has that kind of a frontal structure and has music every applicant agrees to that, because whether I'm sitting on the edge or standing right next to the outdoor window, you can't stop the music from going outside if the doors are open.
You could have as much music inside as you want, but if there's music, it can't be heard outside on the screen, so the doors and windows, your choice is to have music and the doors closed or no music and the doors open, yeah cause your neighbors will walk by and call every time you have music with the doors open, even if it's for brunch or like lunch any time.
Okay with that right, george and the last thing.
Okay, george, do you have any sense when you're gonna hear from the sla about the two-year thing?
What's going on it's hard to really get too much information, but we're hoping it'll come sooner than later, so you're going to wait to file until you hear no we're going to file first here, all right, we'll take that chance, okay, so everyone's okay with all those steps, I read yes, yeah!
If I want to get out of the business, I can, you know maybe sublet the premises, I can sell the furniture, but I cannot transfer the liquor license to a new proprietor.
So it's never really a sale of, and you can only get a temporary if you've applied for new license and if the place had been open within the past 30 days right.
You pick up a lot of debts that you don't want to know about so, but you can theoretically buy the corporation and the license does stay with the corporation, but the new people have to be approved by the liquor authority and it had- and it goes be, it goes to the board if eighty percent of its sale of more than eighty percent eighty percent or more of the shares it goes to the community board, it has to be notified, that's the current rule, but that's still.
I want to thank you for the time to ask these questions.
