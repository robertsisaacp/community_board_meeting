Marty hello said John Dreyfuss behind that beard, it's the shelter in place, I'll turn face, but looking good. Definitely looking more Hemingway like by the day. I, don't know if you guys know each other, I mean I don't know. I I've met Kevin. This is Marty I'm, joking and nice to meet you John and none architects for the compensation part. The project I thought he was a writer yet John Hemingway is that Jeffrey trying to get on hello, Jeffrey, says you're connecting to audio. Now it says your music there we go, looks like you did it. Didn't you hear me okay, loud and clear, my computer's being ornery. It thinks it's a Monday when really at the Thursday, though, isn't everyday kind of the same me. It is know, what's a weekend like that, is it isn't that what the grandmother says on Downton Abbey? What's it, you can sorry I missed that phone call yesterday, Jennifer, Ian and Janine - up so Terry retarded burglar, just joined also she's, the landscape architect for the project, hi Terry, all right nice to meet you all, okay, see you again, oh I think probably saw some of you remember yep. You can change since then yeah. Please tell me if you hear a lot of wind noise behind me, because I have various air cooling devices going near me. If, or you are hearing us, yes, hi everybody we're gonna, be waiting for a quorum to get started. Hopefully it's just a few more minutes. It's still before 6:30 we'll run through protocols and introductions and all that stuff once the meeting get started. So thanks for being here this evening, [Music] hi Tina waving is good like the queen. So now we have a queen and a writer on all we have. We have the Queen of England and Hemingway. Vide has grown a little bit. We have more team members, so our quorum I'm doing a count on all second count: Gwen twice, which I don't think I should, with one more. We can get started, but we'll give it another couple minutes and in typical fashion, poof we have a quorum. I want to pull up my notes from the agenda okay good evening. Everyone welcome to the waterfront parks of Environment Committee of community board, for my name is Jeffrey la Francois I'm, the co-chair this evening, along with my other half and co-chair Marty de cat waving his hand. This is not our first go-round on zoom' for this committee, nor I'm sure for any of us, but I just want to go over a couple of the protocols and rules as we run through them this evening. We would greatly appreciate it if everyone, besides the speaker and the presenter stays muted throughout the beating, so as to prevent any feedback. Members of the public who have joined through the online link can ask questions and if they need to make a brief statement after stuff has been done. We maintain these meetings as our typical process, in which we have a presentation or a discussion on the given item on the agenda. The committee then has the right to ask questions and have a discussion. We then go to the public, and then we bring it back to the committee for any final points, perhaps the vote or discussions around the letter is taken. If you're dialing in this evening. Let's see you need to raise your hand through the phone you use the star nine function and to mute. You do star six I, think that is the all the technicals of the evening. I'm Janine you're, going to be the driver seat this evening for the presentation correct I can maybe it took me I can't hear you. Can you hear me yeah, okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna put it up now you everybody else can hear Jeanine except for me: yeah, okay, huh, I'm, gonna, we're gonna, call out names of the committee to introduce yourselves while I try to figure out why I can't hear anybody. I will start with my co-chair Marty, please say hello and then kick it to somebody else on the committee please hello, I did I did exactly as you asked. Let's go down the list on the co-chair happy to be, and whereas Jeffrey gets his Sam, so he can hear people you will be chairing tonight's meeting and the list I have is when you there went to the top of my list when may not be hearing and if he is shall cut in how about Tina. I am Tina, Dee, Felicia Tony. All right Sally saw her you. She needs to unmute if she's going to speak, how about David hi I'm Dave a loca. Thank you David! Sorry, did you hear me when I spoke? No, just now is the first time I heard: okay, sorry yeah I'm having trouble with this I'm, not home, so I'm having trouble but I am on and I can hear you guys. Okay, but now you can hear me right. We heard you loud and clear that time. Okay, sorry I say something about yourself: oh I'm, a public member water, fun park and environment. Thank you, Blake hi, I'm, Teresa, I'd lake, you didn't say anything about yourself: either, never mind Chris! Thank you! Chris Jeffrey you're gonna speak in a while, like I can hear you and I hope. You can hear me now -. Yes, we can sorry Jeffrey. What was that? Are you serious that you didn't hear him just kidding? I heard him all right, that's what I was afraid of Chris thanks for your help. Man appreciate it come on Ellen Austin good evening, all right who did I miss who's on the committee Leslie burgers, you Murphy Hell's, Kitchen resident good evening, Sarah, Appleton, Chelsea, Rosa, sorry, Sarah, didn't see you and I didn't see you Leslie, so we do have over you, Jeffrey Thank, You Marty, all right with that. We will move to the first item on our agenda, which is going to be a presentation from our friends at thousand of her Park Trust regarding the Chelsea waterside park, design, progress, gosh, it's been but two to three months since we last heard on this. So, looking forward to these updates Kevin are you gonna be walking us through this today, I'm gonna, introduce it say a few words and I'm gonna turn it over to Terry burger who's, a partner at table dates and butts. Landscape are dangerous and John Dreyfuss from CDR architects will be presenting the building. Okay person three-person job here, sing it away. Thank you, okay. So you know a lot has happened. Obviously, since November only last when we last met, but in regards to this project, things are going pretty great I. Think you're gonna, like the design that you're going to see but I also have some pretty good news and that, thanks to speaker Johnson, the replacement of the synthetic turf field is fully funded, so that is now officially part of the project. So we are really happy about that and let me give you a little talk on process. So next slide, please and then the next one. So just a brief summary, we last met November in 2019 to give kind of an introduction of the team. That's when you made a belated bus for the first time and then we also had a smaller group with mr. Oscar and dog users in March in my office, just to get some thoughts on how the dog run could be improved and then we've been having kind of random interactions with other people and gathering information and working with ABB quite a bit, and so it's all come together. So next slide and I just wanted to touch on some of the goals of the project. You know the trusts were always interested in sustainability, so we wanted to, for this project increase the native plantings there we wanted to buffer the West Side Highway make it a nicer place. We definitely want to reuse a lot of the materials that are currently in place. There's an awful lot of granite, a lot of like great materials that we think we can reuse in the new and the new design. We want to look at some green features for the comfort station, that you'll be seeing some green roofs and photovoltaics, and we also need to respect the flooding situation because, of course, we're right on the river. So we got to be cognizant of that, so the main design goals for the project. We want to reconfigure the park, because we just feel- and we've heard this from a lot of people- that the park is really more of a pass-through park. It's a it's a place where people cut through to get to the main park and we feel that's a missed opportunity and we'd really like to develop this park into a proper kind of park in itself. So we'd be creating a more of a inward focus, part that you can go and relax. There will be a new comfort station, a picnic area. The Overlook area will be absorbed by the synthetic turf field area so that it's actually used a sensor, a central, flexible area with grass that you can Sunday picnic there, we're gonna in response to some of the community members who I met after we opened the playground, we're gonna. Do a better job with the stroller parking and integrate some formal stroller parking actually inside the playground and we're gonna just increase the planting quite a bit and decrease the pavement quite a bit and then we'll also be enhancing the dog run. Basically, making two dog runs one for big dogs, one for small dogs and just increasing the size to accommodate both of those dog runs and I. Think with that I'd like to turn it over to Terry who can actually walk you through the design based on those goals, next slide and Kerri, take it away so we're meeting today in the orange space and from this point incorporating whatever feedback input we get from you today we're going to move on then to design development. We anticipate having you know, meeting with you following that, and then we're going to be moving into construction, documentation, fitting a warrant construction and then towards the park. Opening at the moment, we've been talking with the trust about probably us spring 2021 start April construction is what we're looking for, and we think that's achievable at this point next slide. Please let me just say: when we the next time we come back, I'm sure everybody we know we want to start in the spring. We think we can do it and everybody I'm sure is interested in how long this is going to take and what's going to be closed. While we do construction and whatnot when we come back the next time, we'll have a construction phasing schedule and be a lot more clear on how long things are going to take and in what areas will be under construction. We want to be sure we have the design right before we actually be particular about scheduling. It just wanted to say that so continue today. Thank you. So the next few slides are really document some of the significant findings that we've had and that are going to continue to form the designs we progressive next slide, please. So this really documents just our understanding of the parking context of the other public, open spaces and recreational areas. You all know your Park very well, I, don't need to go into the details of this, but for us it's just informative to see what the other amenities other public open spaces are. You know within a reasonable radius of this part next slide. So, as Kevin mentioned, obviously further paper maps or the FEMA maps, the site is wholly within the a zone 100-year flood zone, and what that really means is that we have to be very cognizant how we design the park so that we're taking into consideration issues associated with potential flooding. But very specifically, we have to consider building code requirements, make sure that they are met for the comfort station, which requires us to be above the base. Flood elevation, which is set by the FEMA maps and when John Dreyfuss goes into his presentation on the conversation. He'll touch on this and explain it a bit more for you next slide please. So this really just identifies major program elements that exist right now in the existing park. Again, you all know it very well. It also identifies what the limits of this project are, with the - Orange Line. So, within the dashed orange line, that is our work area for this project next, so this is one of our site, analysis, slides, I. Think. The important thing of note really to mention here is obviously the impact that the west side highway route 9a has on this, particularly with regards to the southern area of the site. We're currently programming is very close to the edge of the highway. So that's something that we're going to because as we develop time- and the other very important thing is that right through the middle of the site, there is a deep concern. Now we have to just be cognizant of that as we develop the design. Yes, it certainly was important to us when we are considering the siting of the confrontation it want to be over that sewer line jurisdiction over that. Now, it's not going to impact us in a big way, otherwise, because it is quite deep, but it's just one of those things that we have to contend with next, please. This slide just indicates by color, yellow being my portion of the site and the coolest colors, even the lowest portion, as it exists right now. So you start to see, and we started to see that there were some very clear indicators as to where the appropriate siting for the conversation was relative to both proximity to who program elements, as well as the elevation or topography X. So this was a tree analysis that we did. We identified all of the existing trees and philemon airily reviewed their condition. We've identified several trees that were subsequently several columnar trees near the sports hill that have to come down and in the dawn run area. There's one tree. That is not in good health that we are recommending calm down and then there's one other tree that we're we taken down for design reasons and you'll see why that is when you see the design and then I, but they overlooked. There are three believe: they're legit, CEA's, honey locusts, which, as that becomes more field area, those will have to come down as well next slide. Please and this one really didn't sort of distilled what the considerations were, that we had as a result of sort of the inventory and the input that we got from booth trust and from the community. So he started the lower left of the screen priority to end the dog run. Take a look at. How do you reconfigure is that names are up there? Reconfigured the circulation have better sight lines for crossing purposes when you get to the highway. Take a look at the relationship and proximity of where the new picnic area should meet and what's the right location for the conversation as well as how do we repurpose that overlooked area? Next, these photos really just document what the existing conditions are. You know the central path as Kevin alluded to it, feels more like a mix apart feel more like a pass-through and less like a destination, the central planting on the right. There are some lovely ornamental material there, and that's something that we want to take you from. When we develop our planting on the lower left, there were benches, which we think the supports for which are stainless. Steel may have potential for reuse with you, know new bench seats and backs and we're gonna look at ways to repurpose those kinds of things. Next dog ROM in the upper left corner there. In our conversations with the community, there were lots of things about the dog round that did work and things that the dogs take advantage of, like the mounds like the boulders, and then there were things that didn't work so well like the water situation, the seeding, and so we were going to incorporate what works and look for other ways to address the things that aren't working on the upper right side. The seeding steps again, as Kevin mentioned this area due to its elevation, it's really disconnected from the rest of the park and it, although these are intended for like feeding and I, assume spectator seating, they aren't the greatest position or not the most appropriate position for viewing the sports field. There is, however, some material here, that's a potential for reuse and lower right again. The Overlook area, which is elevated and you'll, see as part of the design. We look at how we can change the elevation of that to be more on the same elevation as the rest of the park. Next slide, please. This is an analysis of some studies that we did. We were primarily interested in seeing how buildings be built which by now, maybe is I, don't know I now, maybe complete. They don't know what their situation was during this, but this fun shape study does take that into consideration. So you can see that we've got good sun exposure for the prime seasons when the park would be used exit. This is a relational diagram really of based on input that we got from you and the trust about the spatial relationships of the program, elements where shouldn't certain things be abusive to other things, and how do they relate to one another? So, for example, the picnic seating area really needed to have a strong facial relationship to the playground and end to the conversation, as well as the synthetic turf field needed to have a strong relationship to the comfort station, also next, okay, so now we're really going to get into the part of it. So, although a little screen back here, so you can see what the program elements are proposed, which I'm going to take you through in the next several slides. This identifies both the new programming in the hands, enhanced programming and their uses. As you can see, the design incorporates a more organic curvilinear approach to the circulation, eliminating that very dominant through the park in favor of favor of a meander which strengthens that overall facial piece of national park, but also offers more contiguous, green usable spaces and continuous planting spaces. So I intended to deliver a new open space. That's really more park-like and less positive, like that was something that we heard a lot in the early part of the design efforts. So, let's just run through quickly program areas, so again, dog run, which we'll talk about a little bit more, the central lawn area with main circulation through it. So there is still a pretty direct route to come from 11th Avenue go through the part and exit at the Westside Highway at the same location where you enter and leave the park currently within that major assumption launch area. As a new picnic area and then to the right of that picnic area as a secondary pathway, which takes you to the synthetic turf field area bypassing and giving you access to the playground and then also in the comfort station next and there you go, you get to see it this whole color. What this slide does. Is it really besides showing you the rural plan and the relationships along with the elements together? If you see there are some red dash lines on this planet, and that really indicates what the previous or existing limits of those program areas were previously. So you get to see how high and/or expanding those areas. So when we're left or south end of the site, where we have the dawn run, you can see that it's getting expanded over to the right. The playground area, if you look at the south edge of playgrounds or plan, left portion of the playground, we're not really touching the playground very much we're really just affecting that front edge of the playground in part. Two things one is to provide enough space, get organized and define stroller parking in adjacent to the entrance, but it also gives us a little breathing room so that we can include some nicer fencing at the front and along the side of right now. It's chingling facts I think we're looking to potentially upgrade that fencing and then, if you shift up north and west to the sports field, you start to see where the limits of the sports field were previously, and you can see now how we're starting to incorporate the overlooked area to a space that then becomes contiguous with fields at the same elevation and offers the opportunity for a new practice area. See over to the left are the increases the dog run combined. This is nearly double large and the small dog areas is now double the size of the existing run was and the synthetic turf field, although we are see right at the lower left corner of the sports field, which we'll get into but we're taking away a little bit of space there from the from the sports field. We're actually increasing the overall size of the synthetic turf area, even though we're feeling that warmer there by adding the area just to jump in just to say the striping shown here is what it currently is. We're gonna go back to the ball field user groups and see if there's striping makes sense we haven't. We haven't done anything about that yet, so this is a place of it. Great thanks, fellas for clarifying amendment picnic areas in the order of 2,000 square feet and at central lawn area, which is the light rain color there that's about four thousand square feet next slide, so this just really highlights what the circulation is through the park, so the heavier blue line, the major circulation on the secondary circuit. It's worth noting that all of the access points into the park will remain or not, we're not reducing those at all and that access into the dog run is increased, so we're essentially maintaining the existing access into the dog run of the southern coast. We're adding another entrance which gets you into the small dog run and access to the large dog run. That's a bit north on 11th, Avenue and then within the park on the left side, the northernmost now another access point which is to access and maybe also you'll, see in more detail. But the conversation is configured in a way that you can pass through it. So that is actually the formal entrance into the synthetic turf area. Tough to see in this plan, but you'll understand a little own little down the road here. Ok, so let's get you a little closer to what's going on of the nuance of the design program areas and how they really relate to we're gonna dive into the bog Ranieri on the conversation, a little bit more and you'll see 3-dimensional sketches of the picnic area as well. So I think the thing that's really important to note here is on the main circulation path. We do have seating along the southern edges of that when you arrive and enter the park on 11th Avenue, you really have the fuel across the landscape. There's some land form there at the front of that central green space, which, where we're looking at that number 14, which says, planted bread, you see there's a little sculpted landform there and we're looking at having out being more of an ornamental type of planting. So you're looking over that and looking beyond that into the bigger landscape. Weird, like I, said we're going to get into detail with the other areas. So I won't talk about them right now, but, as Kevin said, you can see that secondary of pathway that goes to the right of the central green space and past the playground. If you take a look at where the number two is, that gets us, there's an ad, an accessible route that gets us up to the confrontation and s Kevin mentioned then you'll see a little bit more clearly. Thank you through this. The building configuration as your gateway to sorry Terry, but just to jump in one more time also worth mentioning I think is, if you look at number 10, which is just off the entrance of the 11th Avenue entrance of the park. That's an area that we're setting aside for a future concession kiosk which would serve like coffee, non-alcoholic drinks, pre-made sandwiches and it's about a 8 foot by 12 foot box. That is not the concession itself is not part of this design team's effort. We would RFP that later with a to get a concessionaire and I'm, pretty sure you guys have experience with how this works. We reach out to a concessionaire, get somebody in and work with them to design that box, but that's kind of a placeholder for it and I think it's important for you to know where we anticipate putting that Terry. Hey thanks, yep next, but this gives you a little bit about an aerial view of all the way to the left. Number 8 is the large dog area just north of that number, nine is a small from the area. As you can see, there is buffer planted in which the dog runs and a sensible area of the park got a big green space in the center of the park and within that green space, Pacific area, just opposite the playground. We are anticipating a some level of tree. Canopy within that picnic area to provide shade and then I think this starts to give you a good sense of how the conversation overall spaces, with just a little vignette of a picnic area so start seeing that we've got this tree. Canopy working this central zone that there's a little bit protected, we're looking at doing seat levels around the two sides. In order to do couple things, one that's to help us adjust some of the topography, but we really do want to. You need to be very cognizant of how circulation is working and some of the topography changes that we're doing is to help us direct circulation through the park in a way that will help the landscape to be sustainable and help these areas to be better decline, start to see that this is a place where we're going to do some specialty, like one of the ideas we have is to do this sort of best student lighting. That would be strong above and probably some under lights and in the seat walls, and also worth mentioning that the furniture is also kind of a placeholder. We haven't selected furniture at all for this, so I when it comes time for the members of the community board to offer comments and what I definitely be interested in hearing your thoughts on what type of furniture you would see here and do you like picnic tables and that type of things please put that in your brain for later yeah? No, that's really good. We would like to hear there's one of the heart thoughts was to include picnic tables, some that are smaller length, but we also have this idea of doing a bigger community like a harvest table. That's a bit longer that would accommodate sort of bigger gatherings, so we'd be interested in hearing what your vlogs are not for sure next time. Okay, so now we're going to take a look at the dog run next time, something a little bit more detail. I have alluded to with dividing up this space into the large table on the South, smaller dog area, on the north separating the two. We are anticipating reusing, some of the different granite walls that exist, repurposing them and then we're actually using that wall to help define and separate a water feature, one for each side of the dog run kind of analogous to the other water sprayed pool areas that you have we're thinking. There can be ground sprays and potentially some sprays off the wall and we're also looking at creating some blocks to do a little bit more play value within the spray basins. As I mentioned earlier, there were certain things that we know we're really late about, so we're looking to incorporate a similar kind of feature. Another element that you see identified as number one: it's tiered seating, so that gives bones or the two legged. If you're a fan of Pluto online you'll know that expression, the two legged sin, the four legged anyway, the two legged a chance to get up out of the fray. But it's also a place where the dogs, you know, can jump up and play and get a higher Vantage for you as well. We will be creating protection around the trees similar but different. We're looking at doing something that's a little bit more substantial and we met with the dog usergroups took back the comments about making sure that evening that we were providing was directed in the right orientation so that there or blank lines, while those anymore tensions across the dog ones, help reinforce the users of monitoring their dogs. I. Think we effectively done that in addition to the tiered seating, there are some other students at the edges, but all of the seating is facing inward and it's all directed towards sort of the usable play spaces within the dog runs all of the entries into the background are the double gates and fencing here will be all new we're looking at using in some locations, particularly where we have the tiered seating. We have a fencing that is a bit higher and we will be looking at potentially developing some decorative features within those fences, probably associated with tiered seating, as we get further into the development of the design. Just one last thing to talk about the amenities we will be providing a drinking fountain with dog bowls and will be trash receptacles beyond that. We will be including we know that there's a hose reel, a box, that's utilized in the playground that seems very effective so that this becomes a space. That's easy for everyone to maintain excellent, and then this is just a very preliminary vignette. We've got a long way to go here, but you just you start to get the idea of the elevated seating and how that relates to the existing treaties that we are going to be preserving next furnishings that we talked about with the dog user group and I. Think that pretty much mentioned all of them previously excellent thanks and then these were some precedents that we were looking to work sort of exponentially, but also surfaces and the idea that we think there's an opportunity to incorporate some really fun graphics. So that's going to be to the next level of our development as we go is how we get some of this more detailed or detailed elements into fine at this point. But we think that we're going to be able to do some fun, paving treatments and other fun elements within the dog run. In addition to what we've already talked about next ok, so let's talk about the comfort station hi thanks everyone we're looking forward to getting comments and feedback. If we could have the next slide, please. This is just a view of the approach from the park side and, more specifically, from kind of the trajectory along the playground, the playground, if we get the next slide a little more detail. So, on the left-hand side, you see the site plan and one of our first moves was to pull the two bathrooms apart to create what Kevin was speaking about the Gateway, which can be secured with a side, coil and grill. It frames the entrance to the point playing field, but also flying connects the playing field more directly to the park in general and then another key design. Consideration is just clear visibility from both sides of the comfort station and especially from the playground and the picnic area. Next slide. Please. The plan on the left shows the women's bathroom is on the upper left, men's bathroom or right. There's a box area for the side, : grill, which we think will be easy to maintain and easy to use all these elements, including the mechanical room, are lifted above the floodplain and then the mechanical area to on the lower right is, at the level lower level for easy access for the park. Employees also above the mechanical Ivy. Sorry, the maintenance storage is a mechanical well to conceal any kind of units that for heating cooling. The plan is situated along the points of intersection of the two fences which are existing and it Nestle's in the southeast corner of the playing field. We also have bleacher seating for putting on taking off cleats or soccer shoes on the field side and then next slide. Please and sustainability have been a key factor in the way we're thinking about this project. We have incorporated solar panels which have a double function of creating a Sun, Shade and change. You know ever-changing shadow play on the cladding and the ground surface between the two little buildings. Also, we have a berm, the grass roof, which has a function of protecting the solar panels from errant soccer balls. We do think it's pretty far away from the playing field, but we just want to make sure there's kind of a buffer between that activity and the panel's the entrances are clad in weathered steel, something warm we think and durable, and we think that the ladies were sorry. The women's room could have a bulletin board for community events if that's desired. We have clerestory windows for natural light and we're excited about the possibility, and we consulted with the masonry consultant to reuse the granite, knee walls of the existing park, to cut them and reconfigure them to give a I think an attractive cladding, but also, as importantly, a very durable one at that. So I think that yeah. We welcome questions and comments. Thank you very much for that. As our protocol we'll start with the committee and go around from there, if everybody could use the raise hand feature as expected, mr. roster, with his hand up first and then Janine I know that 11 is here, tell us see what has had park Association. Maybe if we want to bring her over, certainly want to welcome her into the conversation as well. Alan, if you want to kick us off Alan, are you there I'm? Sorry, thank you. No thank you. Jeffery Thank You Terry Kevin John. Thank you very much, I. Think it's a wonderful presentation and I want to compliment you for coming in on time. As you said, you'd be back June July, and here you are and I think that says a lot to the whole team. I'll take the landscaping in the northern part of the South northern part of the section. I think it will race out very nicely the compensation, the overlook, the meandering and I'm sure you know down the road. We'll have a chance to talk about more about. Maybe the seeding and everything else going on, but I think the general picture of it looks real good in terms of making it more interesting and keeping people in the park rather than just- and he said just as a pass-through. My question in the picnic area is there shading there now that you're working with all those trees there now or you need no trees? Or will the folks in the park need to put on brothers in the furniture for shading until things go away, so those will be new trees and we are talking about trying to source some larger trees to go in just that particular area, because I think it's important that you know they have a little bit of a head start because you're absolutely right. You know we want to. We want to have some shade sort of sense of canopy and enclosure right at the beginning, so we were successful in doing that. Another area- that's not terribly dissimilar from this years of installing the large trees, so we'll shift down to the main focus from a lot of folks in the audience and the dog run. Are you taking down the existing mounds and putting in new mounds are you're working with the mounds of existing? Now you know sprucing it up working and then taking everything else down, maintaining those large trees and starting fresh. So the mounds will be new, so we can adjust them to be. However, you know: what's that's you know, we already got some feedback from the dog user groups about what works and what is summer, I. Think the separation of the large and small dogs will help us sort of you know manipulate those Heights appropriately, because my concern right now between the bench and the mounds is only about four feet of runway of asphalt. So looking at the design, it looks like you've got more space between the new seating and the mound, which is a good thing because it gets kind of crowded if the dogs are in about a 4-foot space that that's in there now personally, I'm, not I'm, not a great fan of stating seating I think it could be a problem with dorks going up and down falling that sort of thing there might be people who want to be sitting there and that want to be bothered by someone else's dog kind of like running up the step. You know all those sets so and that's something the dog owners could chime in on going forward. Can you tell me what the projected no space is going to be from what you know of an end of the drug run? Now what the expansion is going forth before you go into the small dog area, I mean right. Now you it's about eighty two feet from the north end to the corner to the south end. Approximately so can you it gives me a better idea, a better feeling of how much more space we're getting in terms of incorporating into the into a logical is measuring right now, so he's going to tell you it's about a hundred thirty feet from that corner of West Side Highway, an 11th Avenue to the outer edge of the small dog run, and then you have that planted buffer between the small dog run and then the main circulation of the park, good space, good space. So when we met back in March I think most of the folks I won't speak for mostly but I think there's a perception that you really need a small dog run, because all the dog owners are going to go there and then would probably be the case. If there's a new dog run right now, everybody's in there and did small dogs have big dog friends- and you know all that kind of stuff and I think the small dog area might be scaled back somewhat to give the larger area some more space, because the people, some of these folks have large dogs and a small dog and the folks who've been using these dog runs for the last X number of years have been bringing that small dogs into this space. So if this was a new dog woman from scratch and you set up space, the small dog people would gravitate to a small dog area, but you know you know I, think we sort of talked a little bit about the camaraderie in terms of the folks who are using the door grown now. So that might be something to look at in terms of maybe giving more space to the larger area at some point. So in that sense, again, I think it's a wonderful design, I think considering the shape of this space. It's not a rectangle. It's not a square I think you did a good job in me. Conforming make a figuring the issues there and I'll just yes, it is my mic on to someone else at this point, but thank you for thank you and thank you, Alan Blake. Thank you presentation. You don't want to echo thanks and I appreciate incorporation of the feedback, so just a couple of thoughts, one is you know, is interested in the east side of the meandering path. That's you know. Now the path is more of a functional walkway from one site to the other and I love. The idea that it's becoming more of a you know, meandering more of a park feel I would just want to think through the plantings that are on the east side of the space in the middle. Just so that we don't get a situation where people are continuing to walk straight through and creating. You know like an area in the grass that's trodden, and you know if they continue to use it in the same way that it's being used. Currently, the second thought is, you know: I'm, not a huge fan, the bathroom area, the comfort station I should say being the kind of gateway into the Plainfield area and I think you know in the concept drawings, it really looks great and you know I think at the outset, it'll be really nice. I would just want to make sure that you can. As you know, the maintenance is maybe to a varying degree, upkept of that comfort station that it's still you know a nice entrance point into the playing field, and so you know if we are keeping it as kind of a gateway into the Plainfield area. You know I want to do what we can architectural. It's a make it easy to upkeep. You know, for example, you know maybe letting more light through the ceiling, or you know just making that space feel a little. You know more like a public opening, rather that's welcoming rather than you know, like a bathroom space, and the third thought was just on the UH. The furniture which you know I know you asked about. I think my preference would be, for you know, picnic type tables with individual chairs, just discourage. You know, folks, from taking up more than one seat by using it as a place to lay down. So thank you again, good comments. Thank you. Blake Leslie, hey guys, Terry and John. This might be a little bit of a love fest. That was amazing. I. Think it's really thoughtful, really I! Think I. Think the comfort station is thoughtful. I think the stroller parking is thoughtful. You even have entrances on 24th Street right directly to the field. So when we pull up with our huge soccer goals and all of our bags, we can just dump them right there into the field. I thought that was great I, like that there I think the northwest part of the field. Is you just there's nothing there, it's empty, which I like too that's really thoughtful, because when teams are waiting or families are there for their turn, I think you don't have to fill up every little space people can kind of congregate there and I thought that was great. There were a few things. I do agree with Blake that maybe as nice as the comfort station is it shouldn't, be the only gateway into the field, because then people will Trek back and forth back and forth through that kids will be running if it was just over to the side, and there was a separate entrance way. It might be a little better flow and Geoffrey you're gonna you're gonna love this, where the bike racks the great question Leslie. Thank you bike rack. If there's somewhere for bike racks, I think so people can just they can park their bikes inside the park. I think that would be helpful and I just had one more question about the solar panels. Was that just to power the comfort station, or are there going to be night lights for night field play or I wasn't sure how far the solar activity was going? What I'm hoping to do is similar to in my prior life, I worked on Washington Square Park solar panels on the roof of that building. It's a net metering arrangement so as much juice as those panels put out during the day it will go into the general grid of the city and then at night, we'll pull power. I mean it's a possibility that the plans you have for the solar panels in that limited space could power the lights of that Park, full time or not. I just got I, don't know the metrics that well yeah, so probably not, and the other issue with doing that is that you need a bit more infrastructure, because, if you're going to use it right, if you're going to use it, you need to have your own inverters. You need to have story like battery storage. So doing it this way as Kevin s adjusting is a sort of much friendlier easier way to do it. A much more sustainable, actually I think we've done it both ways and in the future we happy to have like our electrical engineer. One thing we could do is take a look at the maths. You know how much power we use versus how much the panel's produce they may not necessarily feed them at that. At the same time, or whatever, but overall net we'd like to reduce our or draw yeah that'd be great, and if you are taking comments or suggestions about picnic that the big long harvest table is great, because when we're done with our soccer games or whatever the kids are, gonna go and we're gonna all eat together. Hopefully, when this is all over with we'll all eat together, but a big table, one of them would be nice. Thank you really guys. That was awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you. Leslie David, hello, kheh. Thanks for the great presentation, I have a few thoughts. I agree with Blake that it might be nice to have movable seating in the picnic area rather than benches. Recently I've been sitting at the tables in Madison Square, which are very nice and I noticed. The chairs are very heavy I, don't know if there are any moveable chairs in not some River Park, but the ones in Madison are they're, so heavy that it would just be exhausting to try to steal one. But it's very nice if you can actually kind of create your own seating area and that harvest table sounds great, but you know for more intimate groups of people. It would be nice to have smaller tables I'm wondering if it would make sense to create sort of a shade canopy in there as well, that it might also hold solar collectors and speaking of the solar collectors, it seems to me like the ones on the roof of the comfort station, along with the green roof and the different materials it just feels like. There are a lot of parts there, and maybe the sum of the parts isn't a hole, that's greater than the parts themselves. I realize you're still going into designing development, but I think maybe that could work together, better and I'm wondering also if it seems like there's a fair amount of space there. If you might not, instead of having doors to the men's and women's rooms, I have vision, locks, you know more circuitous routes in, so that people don't actually have to touch it or to go through and they might feel safer once inside. Of course, there would be doors at some point to lock the things up at night, but they would stand open, otherwise and I wonder if you actually need steps outside that the comfort station, presumably you've got a path of like a slope of five percent or less for the adaa access you know, could you simply eliminate the steps in the interest of having universal design access and maybe have that the area where the steps are given over to planting it would be a less to maintain in the winter of less of a hazard I also, you know, notice the water feature and the dog run. Could there be one on the maybe the picnic area as well? Given the proximity of the highway, a water feature they created, some noise might distract from the noise of the highway. Just to thought about that and the garland of Lights I think is a really nice idea going back to Madison Square the area around Shake Shack, it's a very simple thing, but it creates a really kind of elegant outdoor space, especially in the evening just said, and is there any chance that our food concession could be a shade traffic, so second I? Second, that I don't know that takes that would run a 12 by 8 space and then how much line could fit. You know around the new proposal, mr. co-chair Marty. Thank you. I want a third fourth and fifth sigh I. Think it's a lovely design. Thank you for your work. I'm, going to start with my most difficult question in this period of kovat, which I don't think is going to end all that quickly. Have you considered a design that would accommodate social distancing in a space like this and then I have two more questions? Maybe I can minute yeah, Kevin or Terry I'm, not sure, generally speaking, I'm so expect the answer to be no because nobody's doing that. Yet we haven't your social distancing, but my gut says we're going to be social distancing for quite a while and I'm just wondering if you all who do this design work. I'm, not a designer, have thought that something like the ability for a court to permit social distancing with relative ease might be something that should be at least thought about in the design of this space. I can say that we are prevent providing opportunities for it for sure you know. There's a lot of space on the benches are well spaced you can, you can choose to sit with somebody on the bench or you can or you can choose not to when it comes to the conversation which is kind of a key touch point for people we're going to design it, so you can get in and out without touching stuff. The door comment raised by David earlier is a really good one, but the fixtures everything will be will be touchless motion sensor type arrangements- you know synthetic turf field is, it is what it is. We can allow density or it's. You know it's hard, it's hard to design a field to allow for social -, for social distancing, but there's no dense clusters, I guess maybe I'm fumbling, for my words, because it's a really good question and I think in particular the picnic area. We should probably take a hard look at that, but the rest of the park, I think, is pretty easily spaced, so I think we can accommodate it as we have in the rest of the park operationally we're, certainly not doing anything that prevents social distancing. Let's put it that way. If you have any more ideas, I'd love to I'd love to hear them well, I'm new to Cove. It is the rest of you and I'm, not a I'm, not a designer, so I. My gut says that you as designers are stuck with thinking about this for quite a while to come, and that's why I raise the question on the other two questions I have are: is it really necessary to take down those trees? That's one and two sort of following up on what David was talking about a minute ago. Is there? How are you going to do the math on maximizing the power that you get from the solar collectors and maybe taking over the green roof space covering that as well and thinking of green, the solar house in starlight Park in the Bronx, the Bronx River alliance's house has siding that's using green lines to keep the building itself cool and that would not be a good place for solar collectors, but the roof certainly is a good place for solar collectors. So there may be some more juggling to be done there. So I can take the tree question. It I think it is. It is absolutely necessary to take the tree down for the reprogramming, obviously and I think it is prudent to take the tree down the one tree down in the dog run, which is not in good condition. The second, the second tree in the dog run the reason we are taking. That down is because of the location, and it was I'm pretty sure it was either right in the location or very near the location of the water play area, and we picked that spot because it was sort of the sunniest spot. You know, as you know, that area is well canopy, so if we thought that water play area really needed to have some sun exposure, so that says those trees are that one tree is pretty mature and we are looking to the movie park, speeding like the replacement value or size of those trees that were taking out with new trees that we would be installing. So, although we're taking you know we're taking that one tree out lets you could that's the only one that I would say is maybe questionable in terms of renewable, but we're going to be, as you know, installing new trees that are going to well exceed what we're you know we're moving in terms of in terms of the actual spa Oh tree well. I certainly agree that a tree that is not as sound as it should be might be taken out, and this is a good opportunity to do it. Makiura trees are kind of valuable and I'm. Sorry to see one go and I hope you can figure out a way to think around. That I can speak to the solar panel question. We did look at options where we could total coverage there is. There was concern expressed about the proximity to the playing field with all the panels, and so that's why we're trying to make a berm buffer, so balls could roll off back onto the fields so, but we definitely explored adding more panels. If that's something that is decided to explore further I think one other thing worth noting in terms of lighting is: we are looking at taking the existing sports field lighting and converting that to LED, so that will give you some energy efficiency and I'm, not sure if Terri touched on this, but we are proposing LED pedestrian scale lighting throughout the park to match the playground as well. So, while the solar panel effort is there we're looking at other ways to you, know improve the environmental integrity of the project, which is to say that any energy you use will be used in the most efficient way that you can and we D be one of those choices. Thank you, I've. Just two comments. Then I'm gonna kick it over to thatl to see. If she has anything and I know, we have a question in the Q&A regarding the dog run, which I will read through in just a second I recognize and I've come to understand the concerns around the bathroom and the Gateway to the field. I wonder if you can tell us how wide it is, if you're, to walk through there, what the width is between the men's and the women's room just spatially to understand if that is a gateway, and it is something that kept. How wide is it I appreciate this design tremendously, because there's a beauty in the practicality, it's an extraordinarily efficient use of the space. It's multi-purpose, much of the design provides for that and I. You know echo everybody sentiments, but I am just delighted. It will no longer look like it is a continuation of 23rd Street through this park. It is a human-scale walkway, not a roadway as it currently is, and the only thing I regret about the design is that it doesn't eliminate entirely the West, Side Highway. So really just my question about the width of the gate and then we might not have it specifically, but you said construction could begin in 2021. What do we think? Is this an 18 24 month package once we've got shovels in the ground consumed? We think all construction from start to finish it about a year. Yeah, okay, I, don't want to give the impression that the entire park will take a year and a half to build we're gonna do one piece open another and try and inconvenience people as little as possible. Yeah play bundle mm-hmm to answer your question about the width. It's around 17 feet wide, that's fairly! That's fairly wide! Okay, Sarah I just saw your hand to go up yeah, just a quick ball question, given the first of all. I think this is a beautiful design. So thank you again for all the work you clearly put into this. Given the response you just had on the construction time, would you envision or have you thought about this yet like? If kovat is still, you know as big of an issue as it has been in our community and the need for social distancing is still very intense? Would you consider delaying beginning this effort at all, so that open space would still remain available to members of the community who might need to use it for exercise or to have again more space to access the outdoors in the safe manner? I, don't think we would slow down the bidding of it, but we would probably make that decision, though me when we get to it yeah. This is the law head of the game. I was just curious, given that length of construction time when the park would effectively be off limits. That's a good question and I could say. We would definitely consider that before we put shovel the ground for sure, as we do with our current construction projects, I know I mean, but one of the factors in delaying construction is likely increased construction costs the longer you delay the more it costs. So that is a prime reason why? If there is money, it is a lot of people's interest to kind of get it done. Wow so I mean that's I. Think a principal reason for Kevin's initial response. I can totally appreciate it. I was just curious if this was on your radar, which I imagine is faster. Thank you Sarah a question in the queue a regard the material of the flooring of the dog run can do we do you have a proposal of what that's going to be there's concerns. Many of our dog runs are asphalt, which is not good for puppy paws, and is it a soft material and do we know specifically what material it might be? We haven't definitively determined I would say that we would worth thinking really consider asphalt, but if we used as well, we will do some type of color coating on it, which is a you know, makes it a smoother like the old type surface. I understand the question about asphalt can be rough. It really depends on what that top course is like, and ideally you wouldn't want it to be black because that's why go absorb heat and not reflect heat? So we're still going to consider it consider certain options around. Basically, we've had a lot of positive feedback from the Tribeca dog run area and the area right outside just north of Pier 40, which is exactly what Terri is talking about. It's asphalt underlayment, but as a steel coat on top of it to make it a little smoother and definitely cooler. So that's what we're planning on doing but again we'd be interested in hearing any comments. I'll add them prior to those treatments, particularly at Leroy. We used to get a lot of complaints about the dog run surface and now I can't remember the last time. I got a complaint about the dog run surface. That Leroy is Lee and Leroy is newer than try back at the pier 41 right. Yes, okay and then the other item has been raised around Allen's point of having to be some kind of commingling of the large and small dogs faced as a small job. Whatever this is kind of alarming to me, I really appreciate their being separate spaces for my dog that doesn't live with other big dogs and some big dogs, not recognizing the strength that they have over little dogs. So the convertible proposal is interesting if there the way to have them gene your comment in the QA is perhaps useful, but I would raise a major flag on it being just one dog run, as opposed to two to any other committee comments as well. You're here do you've anything to add or questions or concerns to raise Thank You Jeffrey, it's asel, and they don't. Thank you. Thank you, everyone for the extremely exciting presentation and thank you for putting the picnic area near the playground, which I think is genius and we definitely need umbrellas or some kind of shade component, so people can be there in all kinds of weather. Thank you David for addressing lighting in the park. It could be subtle, but it has to be everywhere because we've had instances of plant thievery, and hopefully this will not happen again, but we've had many rose, bushes, stolen and other plants over a certain period of time. I was also remembering Jeffrey had mentioned an open space for gatherings or functions, and I presume that's on the 23rd and 11th Avenue side is that is that still part of the plan it seems like an open space would be considered more of the lawn area we can sort of proposed as taking up what is now kind of a the middle Plaza faith. I would think. Thank you and I know this is down the line, but is there a maintenance plan for the comfort station and is it self-cleaning? Will there be a monitor there or I'm just worried about the maintenance and [Music] who goes in and out yeah just start on the statement that I cannot imagine that we'll be able to afford a monitor for the comforts yes I. Imagine so, and also that there is no comfort station that is self-cleaning throughout the park. We have. Confrontations are cleaned several times a day depending on the season and they use and I'm expecting that the maintenance protocol would be similar to what we do at other locations unless something radically changes in terms of budget pros or cons. But you know it's important to have materials and fixtures that are that require as little maintenance as possible. I mean people steal, toilet seats. People you know, do a lot of things that you would be surprised at and so having as robust a structure and every single piece of it means inside is as important to our team as it will be to you and that's very much something that we look at with the design team as we're building structures. Thank you thanks. Geoffrey sure thing. They look good that glad you joined us, any other comments. I, don't see any other hands from the public or we've addressed the issues in the QA. It does sound like considering some of the comments we are seeking a little bit of change. We might want to bundle this up in a letter head nods. Do we think a letter is appropriate here, I'm, considering some of the issues that have been raised, so we are looking for perhaps a widening or reconfiguration of the gates, an entry to the field regarding the comfort station, analyzing seating and making it perhaps both seating for four individuals. Experiences as well as the group seating, the harvest table. What a beautiful look that was I, particularly like Blake's point of making sure that the planting, which you guys think you guys described, is a berm make it so that folks have to stay on the path and they won't end up. You know trekking through the lawn and having there be a path of dirt as opposed to lon explore the idea of a convertible or sort of convertible dog area for a commingling did I miss anything there. Yes, don't forget the bike: rack, Thank, You, Sally and bike parking, anything else, yeah, maybe a reconsideration or a reconfiguration of the seating inside the dog park. Instead of the stadium, seating and Thank You Alan you I forgot, I, didn't I, didn't start writing right, I started it right after you said that so the reconfiguration of reconsider the stadium seating actually as a dog as a dog owner and a frequent dog Parker. We like stadium seating, a lot because we find it very easily accessible to go up and down or but I mean I think that 6 and 1/2 doesn't in the other. If we can get clarification on that like is, it is like, should it just be two tiers or no tears, and you just want regular benches because I do know it's a popular style of seating and other dog runs so I just like to know I think I think perhaps maybe two tiers I think maybe that might be a better idea rather than I think I. Think for us to control the amount of drug activity on those stairs. If there's only two I think it's a possibility. I'm just concerned number one for the dogs running up and down when they may not be that many people sitting there there's a lot of folks sitting on the on the steps, then that might prevent the dorks who thinking they. You know this is just another dog mount and I could see dogs tumbling down hurting themselves, maybe with two it might be a little bit easier might be a better plan because it doesn't seem like his room for a lot of other seating. Since you have you know the water, the water feature on the north end there, which they were seating there before, and you don't have any seating on the 11th Avenue side. So my concern about maybe a little more seating, if possible, for the dog owners and Khepri. If everyone is open to it, I would state you know the SiteLock square, the entrance to the comfort station rather than doors. What would that? What would that Damon if everyone's comfortable with it I, would have site locks at rather than doors at the entrances to the comfort stations? So you go in and you turn a couple of times you don't actually have to touch it to once. You're inside you, private I'd, like to mention something about the benches that we do have. If we could have I'd like to suggest divided benches versus you know, one contiguous bench at this particular time. It's getting more and more difficult, no matter which park I go to find a bench where somebody is not laying across it. So if we can have the separated benches, I think that would serve us better. Proceeding, Jeffrey I have a question is John from CDR? Could you clarify your first comment was regarding the opening of the gateway? I wouldn't change a thing I really like it, but you know I want to reflect the committee's interest. I do think 17 feet is very wide. I, don't know if folks hearing 17 feet if people feel more comfortable with that idea and I would I would also recall that there are more than one entrance to the field. I'm not mistaken. There was another entrance to the field just bit further west. Then the comfort station was and then again to the north from 24th Street, so I really like it, but there was concern from the committee, so I guess I'm, going back to the committee to see when you guys hear 17 feet. Does that allay some of the causes? The concern that you had raised? Yes, thank you likely I love that I'll just chime in quickly. It's 17 feet at kind of the smallest point, but it does open up to about 22 feet, there's also a gate that CDR has designed as part of the comfort station to be able to secure the field secure the comfort station simultaneously. So just I think there were some other concerns, but you know for your consideration. That's also being then designed as part of this comfort station. I would also add that gate is designed to basically be where the solar panels end, which is porous so we're not creating a shade or rain canopy after hours for people to camp out in either it's there's no protection area for somebody to camp out and they'll be secured, which is probably a concern. Also. Oh man. Okay, I'd like to include maximizing solar collections. That's right! Thank you, maximize use of solar and consider it for other lighting in the park, not just power of the bathroom Jeffrey. If I can ask just one listed in regards to the CD, so we have the picnic area and then I recall you had seating coming into 11a of you. There's like a row of seating along the pathway. Is there other snow, scattered seating throughout and some of the other areas, or is that excited notice on the plans that there were, like you know, a little scattered tables chairs? Is that an idea in order to keep people in the area sitting using the using the area as a place to common sit? And you know instead of eating at the picnic area? Maybe you know small tables people coming from work just want to grab. We sit down at a small table somewhere? Is that a does that fit into the scheme of things? We looked at some options, but it sort of meant increasing paved areas, and we understood that was less desirable. Generally speaking to the community, so I think it's something that maybe the trust should respond to you about how they see it operating as well. Hmm luck! If you look throughout the park, we've had the cafe type. Seating is concentrated and we have bench seating elsewhere and, that's not to say you can't eat a sandwich on the bench, but the cafe style, seating is centrally located which helps us maintain it. So it's not scattered throughout the park. It's concentrated, mmm, there's also I, don't think. We've mentioned this, but we're also putting in security cameras in the park. Also, we can monitor certain areas, so this area in particular monitored than others at the picnic area. So this design has the concentrated kind of tabletop eating area in one spot, which is the picnic area, but then there are also benches all along the south side of that windy. Central path, right, I, think, there's I want to say, there's almost 20 benches I'm okay, which is pretty significant. Okay, Kevin those monitors are they live. Are they being watched? They're not gonna, be watching, live or watched? Okay, a lot oh they'll be watch live, but that doesn't mean that someone can get there at the moment. Something happens so you know so all of your questions about sight lines and everything else like that matter, because it's a long part, but it just on the benching factor. I love, conversation chairs and they don't allow for laying down, but they're, really a distinct, and we don't see those in a lot of our parks, so I think they're, quite wonderful, sister. Throw that option anything else. Thank you on that I think we've clarified on the benches to have additional and has sections. Thank you for that Sally. There is a concern that too much space is being designated to small dogs, but I'm, not sure we know a census of large and small dogs in Chelsea, but typically - as - I. Don't know good unequivocally state that, especially if we're going to consider finding it to be a convertible faith in some manner or another, which I think would be a first of its kind of could be interesting. No okay, I just wanted sorry to interrupt, but I know Sri president. We thought quite a bit about convertible space and talked to some of our operations. People it's really difficult to police, that for lack of a better term. So we really weren't comfortable having a gate that some dog owners can open and they want their dogs to play with each other and other dog owners. Don't it creates a point of conflict, I'm, not saying it's impossible and we definitely want your point of view on this. But we thought operationally it's a really difficult thing to implement agree with Kevin, but I think when we spoke, we thought perhaps, when you configure the defensing that if down the road you found that the small dog space was underused at some point in time you could you could bring that into the lowness dog run, but not to me I, just wonder if you, if you're comfortable with your small dog being with big dogs, you just put your small dog in the big dog run area and that protects those who are not necessarily comfortable with their small dogs mingling with big dogs off a leash right. But then you need more space in the large area. So I think what we talked about was some way to not make the conversion back. You know, converting back. The large dog run a problem if it's just a matter of changing the gating at some point a year from now two years from now is that, oh, you know we're not really getting that much activity in the small dog run. Let's get this space over I think that's what we were sort of hint at that meeting, but definitely not to make it where oh I want to go into this one. Now, when I close the gate and come back and that wasn't a viable alternative, knowing what you gonna add something a moment ago, I was gonna, make the same point you just did for sure and I get what you're saying Ellen. Thank you for the clarification I do think that dog ownership trans change over time, people- you know different dogs become more popular or not. So you know I think that the basic principle of like what kind of dogs do people have now might not be the same answer in five years and so on. So you know I think that you're, basically asking for flexibility as much as possible, which is I, think something that we can try to look at. You know we'll never know exactly what the right mix is. Probably for this question scarlet agrees, and could somebody call the question or actually could somebody make a motion? So I can call the question Marty. Thank you everything. You said absolutely I. Have it already. You want to say it's easier to ask if there's any objection to the letter as proposed abstention or present not eligible great hearing, nothing that passes unanimously. Thank you to the trust from Terry and John. This is fantastic. This is really exciting yeah. So thank you all with that. I want to move into the next item of the meeting, which was something raised by Brett a month and a half or two months ago, and we recently talked about the Chelsea Park additions that he was looking for and he also wanted to talk through underutilized public space along Hudson, River, Park and specifically the Greenway he's not here this evening. So I'm going to summarize what I understand to be his concern, this slide shows Chelsea Piers. If those of you are familiar with it, you know website highway will along those trees, there's the Greenway and then there's three lanes of roadway for access point to Chelsea, Piers I. Think if we jump to the next slide, you mean it zoomed. In a little bit there we go so I'm the right, West, Side Highway. The picture is taken from the Greenway and to the left. You can see Chelsea Piers in the access road. Let's see the next slide again. This is showing you the space on in front of Chelsea Piers, that's dedicated to I, believe use of the spear that pierced, America, I, know, I, think you're here still, so we'll definitely bring you over for this discussion once we were in the point of it and Noreen you're here as well, but Brad wanted to bring all this stuff because we have been, you know, looking at more ways to create space for the Greenway for pedestrians. Generally speaking, you know the board sent a letter along with boards 1 & 2, asking furling of the West Side Highway as a means to expand more space for the Greenway and pedestrian space, and she identified this location and then another location to the north on the next slide. If you want to jump to Janine, thank you along the cruise ship terminal here. This is in Hell's, Kitchen, piers, 88, 90 and 92 next slide, just north of the intrepid, and you can see here that wall on the left makes it extremely dangerous for pedestrians, and this all came out of security concerns, post 9/11 and a unfulfilled promise from a developer to create more public space within the terminal as well. So he's not here to elaborate on it, but I did want to have the bit of a discussion this evening, given the trust, presence and Erica being here, and you know, Noreen I'm, not sure if you want to share anything from the start on this and Eric, are you here? Yes, you are okay, so let's start at Chelsea Piers, you know it was flagged because there's three lanes of roadway there that Brett saw, is being very underused and would love to hear from you an explanation of that roadway, what its utilized for and how you see that faith. Well, if you scroll back to the photos like the next one yeah, this is when we were closed. This is drink Ovid. So this is not a very accurate depiction of what the roadway looks like on a day-to-day basis. The we had the studios were all dark because the state had shut them down. All the facilities were dark. All of the businesses were dark, so I am more than happy to send along photos of during operations. What this roadway would traditionally look like law and order, and the studios have trucks on this roadway that service there are film studios. The boats and all of the shipping have cruises that are coming in and out the businesses. The golf driving range is already reopened, which has generated some business already, an activity and hopefully by the end of July Kovach pending and how that plays out. This will become operational again. There are more than 2,000 people who are employed and work at Chelsea Piers and that doesn't include the guests and visitors. There have been multiple studies, demonstrating a lack of confidence like Pew and Quinnipiac, both put out studies, noting a lack of confidence in public transportation, so I think our traditional traffic, which was very reliant on the bus and subways may actually turn a little bit more to vehicular traffic. So can you explain so it's we see three lanes here. Can you explain the structure and youth of the lane they are passed through and a lot of it also eliminates queuing on the West Side Highway, because there's a small queuing space before the turnoff at 24th Street, and so, if it backs up at that intersection at the north end of the complex where pedestrians, bikes and cars and buses all interact. That is a stop and we have a person. They are posted that actually directs traffic. Everybody's probably seen him or her that person will stop traffic to prevent collisions and to keep things going as smoothly as possible. When that happens, the queue before it backs up onto the West Side Highway is not that great. So these lanes also help assist in through traffic. When there are events boat cruises, the studios are operational and shooting episodes of law and order and customers as well as employees coming and going to and from work. It's a pretty large number of employees that work in this area. Okay, so you'll frequently have in the most Eastern Lane or on the left of the screen. Frequently you'll have some schools dropping off if the studio is doing something, if it's a school, it will drop off on the sidewalk side. Although I don't know if we'll have school again, but let's hope I don't want to go back to teaching high school, they would drop off on the curbside. Clearly, so the kids don't have to cross the street, so that would then stop traffic there. If it's a studio, you know whether it's a production truck unloading, whether they were off shooting in Washington, Square, Park, a murder or what have you they would be unloading their equipment, and that would be on the eastern side of that roadway, and so that and in effect would eliminate one of those two lanes temporarily. But the problem is, it would lead back up onto the highway I as I say, I'm happy to send photos of what this looks like when it's actually operational versus closed, okay and then there's a third lane is that's just sort of another youth if the other two are blocked up to sort of provide through lane for uber for lyft for taxis for all kinds of for traffic. If you come here on a night prior to kovat, you will find you could wait ten minutes just to get out through the traffic light on the south end. It will be completely blocked and we will have four traffic people along this roadway, helping to get the you know the person hops out in the middle of everything out of there uber just like we see all over New York who's, just like I'm gonna get right here, and you know they start unloading. You have that all along this roadway, just like any city to any Street in New York. So okay also is the queuing space for emergency vehicles and police and ambulances, and all that sort of thing fire trucks I mean this comes about for a number of reasons, not just identifying the need for additional public space. But that is a really sharp that's curve on the Greenway we died. I could not agree with you more on the North End yeah. Very much against that curve. We always have been we've been very vocal about. It actually is straighter than it once was right. It used to be you had to slow down, or you would just fly right off the and the design where it was in pot when it was a real s, was functional. Cuz everyone slowed down. So a conflict is not at a high speed and a high speed conflict is always worse than a slow speed conflict. We were completely against it being strained. It's now, much more, very smooth that you can take it 2030 miles an hour and we are not a fan of that, but we at state do tea. That's not us! We also should note that there is a huge indoor and outdoor walkway that is very popular on the water that we maintain. We have planters, we have benches, we welcome people, we don't like skateboarders, because they tend to boards flip out and hit people, but if you're biking, if you're, not racing biking, you can beyond that it's. So there is another pedestrian walk area that I have to get the footage but I'm guessing it's probably 30 35 feet wide and once that part of it is covered, and so, if it's rainy, it's oh you know the garage doors go up, but you don't get rained on and one part of it is outside. So there is that also that runs north-south and then the tips of the piers are all open that you can also walk so in terms of separating bikes and pedestrians or strollers or little kids. They all tend to go over there, because the kids like the bikes and looking in the water and all kinds of stuff, so they already are over on that area. Okay, thank you for that. I see some hands David. Let's start with, you know it still is free lane and you know: I've been there before Cove it, and there are a lot of times when it's largely empty and it's right adjacent to a lot of interior parking. I. Just wonder if you know there isn't a more resourceful approach that couldn't have couldn't find some way of making this more available to the public and that's what we want to either think about. It suggest talk through and see. I think it'll be useful for Erika to provide additional pictures, recognize that, obviously it's not 24/7 that way, but that's thank you. We want to have the conversation anything else on that David Ayer Eric. Could you tell us if any of that interior parking space could be given over to say the law and order vehicles they are in there and they have a lot of employees also Park in there the right used by them. The trucks can't you know, can't fit. It would they're too long for parking places, and you also have to that where they could perhaps park is the very tip, but then that eliminates firetruck access, which is a violation, had to be able to make a turn at the end of each pier a fire truck. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. David all right, Sarah, yeah, hi Erica. Thank you for your offer to share some additional photos. Do you guys also actually track data on? You know the number of cars that are coming through on the number of emergency vehicles number of school buses. Yeah. Do you have any of that information you could share with us? Because, again, you know, photos are gonna, be very different right from tens. Yes, we do have data and traffic studies and David who, unfortunately, he doesn't usually go to community meetings, and he didn't realize how long they run you didn't bring dude. It was a big item one this evening. So apologies for that it was a big one for it, but he did. He indicated that we do have data and studies and information that we can share. You know, prior to copan that all the COPE and dad is gonna, be you know completely different right yeah. If you have any of that data, you could share with us. That would be very helpful, unto us having an informed discussion. Okay, thank you, Thank You Sally. So we are immediate salya, muted, Valley, okay, sorry, but that okay I have the little screen. Okay, I, don't know if you were gonna bring this up, but the s-curve reminded me of the point that I had brought up when Brett made. These observations was the stanchions that came to be in the bike lanes, I, guess around 911 or to keep cars off of the bike lanes. I find them. I mean I ride the area all the time and when you have I slowed down to go through those stanchions and because of the electric bikes and the speed bikers when you let they come, they come to those stanchions and they cut you off to go through. They go around them. I just think they're, dangerous I know that they serve a purpose and I had proposed. The question: is there another way to situate them that they they'll protect us they've been designed to protect, but that we won't have to go through that narrow passageway? When the bike is bike, when the bike lanes are crowded, the people coming up around you know at 30 miles an hour or just cutting you up. I, don't know if there's any information on accidents that have occurred because of them, but I find them very intimidating. I mean Noreen is the expert on these, but the those were put in I mean I haven't been on the bike way now in a few months, but those were put we're talking about those huge barricades they were put in after the terrorists. Right I know: I know what the function I know. What the function is right and I'm just asking if they could be repositioned south still solve the problem, but prevent everybody having to come into this narrow pick and that there are so many of them. So it's constantly happening, and you have all these racing. Bikers and now, electric bikes and just shoving you through that pushing you through that area, uncomfortably I couldn't agree. More I've run on that and I always try and get to the water at any juncture when it's shared, because it is now but I mean Noreen, can talk to this I believe it's state, a combination of state, do T and Homeland Security or somebody Doreen right, isn't this out of all of our jurisdiction or counter-terror, and my PD counterterrorism. It might be. Yes, that's one of those 30 groups. Terrorists drove down the bike way many people almost instantaneously after that this state, the city counterterrorism, like every agency, basically decided with it within a matter of two days. There were temporary barriers, concrete barriers put in and then the State Department of Transportation is who has been installing the current system. My understanding is that all of those agencies collectively looked at the smallest vehicle size that could possibly fit between certain gaps and believe it or not. There are some very small ones. They also looked at the footings, all kinds of other things like that, so I'm. Frankly, we cannot control. This I will say that we report accidents and other things when we find out about them to the states so that they are aware of the situation. I. Think they're, probably you know, balancing different forms of risk in making this decision. I do think that, to the extent that community has observations about particularly dangerous ones or you know whatever I think it's always where, if you are making that known to people besides us, because I think that your eyes are on the this area, you know more than maybe some people's, but really it's not something that we can control I would suggest. You know I and I appreciate that and I definitely understand that, but I also believe that something just said and I mean, of course remember when the cars came on and how horrific that was. But there was an immediate response to putting something down to protect bikers and pedestrians, which is what they did and I'm just wondering if, when they put them down, they really thought about the design or just wanted to put something down there to protect us. So the question that I'm raising is I definitely realize we need something, and if you have any input at all, can they look at it to see if there's a better place, to arrange them and put them so that they satisfy what they would put there for without creating a hazard zone which I'm and again know what Johnny week we can make that request. It will not go to the trust it would go to like we mentioned state, d-o-t and I believe in my PD counterterrorism and whatever state authority oversees that as well and I, think it's a completely separate item. But it's something we can certainly a pine on, because I find it just. You know so offensive that you know I, think we're three or four years later and they still have just sugar cube all along the Greenway. Imagine if they drop sugars, you've done a highway. You know how ballistic people would go. She's, not people, car drivers would go so yes, a separate item. Thank you. Pain, okay, as well I've been hurt. Okay, any other Allen I saw your hand up a second ago. Did we lay that concern? I? Wasn't you saw I was just trying the question about who runs the bike. Weight was answered in terms of that and I believe the stanchions are primarily at the entrance ways where people do cross coming from the east side of the highway into the part, and if the stanchions help slow down the traffic on the bike way, I think that's a good thing. Yeah they don't. They are placed completely out of the way of cards, actually not very much I'm, not talking about the cause. I'm talking about the stanchions are in the bike way, basically right. So if bikers and it's not, everybody could be, some are just gonna keep going as faster there, but thank you, Sally for slowing down and the stanchions help people cross their bike way, because some people will slow down because they have to maneuver around the stanchions. But that's all okay, Thank You, Leslie I've, walked along that waterway. That you're talking about it's great. It's really is there a natural entry and exit point from the Greenway to there? So people do you know what I mean. So yes, but you can't go around, so we don't even have to worry about. This might be a non if they have the pathway back there or is it or is that a totally isolated area? Oh no! It's me it's a huge walkway right along the Hudson. It comes right out of the linden miller, gardens on the north end. So if you come straight well, if you just stick along the Walker, it just goes directly. If you're coming, if you're going north, you would veer off left obviously and go behind if you are coming north and you're on your like in front of your 57, where it gets right wide over there between 57 and 59, you can turn onto the dock and there's a double big double door, and you just go right through there and you're onto it or you could go around the whole perimeter. If you want a more scenic route, the path all connects, or you can drive into the parking lot and just go in right there down the road on. If we have a big space there, isn't it just directing people left or right instead of do you know what I mean, if isn't it just kind of more traffic, bicycle and pedestrian traffic, yeah I think it's a combination. I mean the pedestrian area is very separate from you know it's very much it's on the western. Far on the other side of this, you can't see it from here. There's no connection for the Greenway to that pedestrian area. I, don't know that's or advocating, for it's really just identifying as much space as we can as much as we asked for the lane of the West Side Highway. We recognize that's going to be difficult and I think breath. You know visualization was well. What's all this? Is it necessary and you know I, don't I don't mean for any of this to be an attack on the operations of Chelsea Piers, because they're, critical, integral and essential to the functions of the city, but I think that the whole everybody as a whole is looking at. How best can we reanalyze the space that we've long accommodated for cars to use for production purposes or just through traffic, and is there a way that we could make this more efficient? I don't know, but that might be one of the things that we toward a request and I. Don't know that we can do that without a better understanding of the data, but I think the whole point of this conversation was to really just start. It begin to understand what this space is used for and what might be done differently to make it more to make it safer and more public accommodating yeah. There's also and you'll see this photo on the right side, a sidewalk that I don't know how many feet that's pretty wide. As a runner I mean I traditionally end at Chelsea Piers, but wonder why I know I take shower, but that is a very popular you'll find people. There are runners who run on the bike way and I know they're, not they're supposed to be. On the other section. There are runners on the bike way in this area of the park. I find the runners are on this sidewalk because I, so they tend to as you get to the north end or the south end of our complex. The runners veer on to this walkway, the bikers veer on to the left's, though, what eastern side runners are on that Sidewalk and everybody with a stroller or something has meander it over to the to the water side. Usually, traditionally, that's the traffic pattern. We see and I have studied it, because I use the bike way and I run so I'm moving slower than the bikers, so I plenty of time to look around and I've worked there for 18 years, so there's so well, I would I don't. If the committee indulges me I, don't want to take any action on this evening, considering Erik is willing to share photos and some data and I think that'll be really useful for the next day of our discussion. So if everybody's okay- with that, that's what I'd like to request at this time of Erica for this area in terms of the photos and any data that you can share, we would love to take a look at that. And could you do this conversation, probably at our September meeting, because, like good New Yorkers we're gonna try to take August off because we haven't been off since March sitting right yeah, so that would be really helpful if you could share that with us, it should be that the committee send it to you or to Jean I've, even senator Janine, and that way she can share with the committee. That would be great, perfect. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Any other comments on this item. Around Chelsea Piers from the committee Erica. Sorry I actually have one more quick question on the alternate pedestrian route that you mentioned. That's like on Chelsea, Piers property. I know what you're talking about used it before it's great I know. So it was locked one of the gates. The other night. Can you just confirm like? Are there typical hours when it's open to the public and when I am not a hundred percent on arc ovid overnight operations, traditionally I would have to ask because I haven't been there during kovat tradition, there is a gate on the north end and the south end. Traditionally, those are always open north-south 24 hours a day 365 days a year, always opening I, don't know if during Kovac, based on staffing or some other reason. If those two have been closed, I have never seen that happen other than after sandy, and that was based on safety that we had to. You know it was flooded. I do know the perimeter walkways. We close the gates traditionally that go out to the very western tips because we have found that activities at night late on those tips is not really very productive and it seems unnecessary to leave them open and have sort of bad things happening out there. So we leave them open, usually they're, pretty late I think they close them around 10:00 or something. But then once we get into the wee hours of the night, we have somebody go out and do a perimeter check and close them down just because you were fine, you know needles and bottles and things out there that weren't, really yeah I just noticed a couple weeks ago, the northern gate was closed and never in my life had I seen that. So that's just why I asked so that actually seems to gel with where you're saying yeah I can ask. It could have been based. It's as I, say: I co. Kid has created all new rules and every where, in my life so another moment in that, no we're close during sandy I do know that, because we were doing massive construction on the rebuilding of the facilities, and so we had machines and such out there, and sometimes the outer walkway in the dead of winter is closed because there are sloped roofs and so when its melting stuff could slide off, and so we do also sometimes close. If you see a perimeter closed in the dead of winter, it's so nothing falls on your head, but then the interior walkway is still open because it's protected. Okay. Thank you, sorry for butting in Geoffrey. Thank you not at all. Don't worry that was important, Thank You Erica for being here and talking us through this, and we look forward to sort of continuing the conversations that our understanding thanks. The next discussion is going to be short and sweet and I'm doing it for two reasons. It's 8:30 and also because unfortunately, EDC who has jurisdiction over the cruise ship terminal, could not attend this evening. Even though Janine and her good due diligence invited the agency- and they said they couldn't make it- which is ironic since we go to these meetings from home, but it's a real typical situation, because Homeland Security has identified the site of being a target for terrorism, and so it's really treated sort of Airport style impenetrable, but it makes it extremely dangerous for pedestrians that are just looking to go north from basically the intrepid to get to Clinton Cove to get to Riverside Park, and you know who want to stay within the confines of the Greenway. And, ideally you know in Hudson River Park see if we can go back a slide. Is it let's see yeah? This is just I mean the glaring example. The person with the dog on the far left I mean even the dog recognizes. It has to walk single file, so I would I would like to send a curt letter to EDC, expressing our you know being upset that they couldn't attend this evening to really give us some of the facts as to why this is this way and send a note to our electeds requesting sort of a push on this as to why it is that for almost 20 years now, there's what four or five feet of access way there and I won't fold this into the vornado issue around the promise public space from them. But I do think it's worth it to shake our to shaky DC and to flag it for our elected officials. Any questions from the committee or the public on this one. So with that Sally, would you like to make a motion on your Greenway ballers Maureen had her own Orion I'm, sorry with forward Noreen or one before this, when you were first showing the area I think that the site plan with the piers? No, maybe it's after sorry, yeah the site plan there we go yeah, so I just wanted to kind of point out. I think what you were kind of saying here so way back when I, probably work for community board for I, don't know the area kind of near the loop between the intrepid and puréed and then continuing on through out there. This state actually built that water sidewalk way as a pedestrian path and then September 11th happened and MARSOC levels happened, and everything that you just said, Jeffrey I, think is accurate in terms of like the just treating it like an airport, but one thing that you might want to maybe congressman Nadler or someone would be helpful for explaining, like what does Marc's tech level mean in this day and age at this point and are there nuances of MARSOC levels? Just for anybody, like you know, is there ever greater access or just really, because this is effectively a major transportation facility? Is it kind of all or nothing from the from the federal transportation perspective? That might be a good kind of gatekeeping question just to understand for context, because I do think that it's like I, think this area is subject to marsac levels. Just the same way, I was like an airport is I, yes, I think that's part of the struggle we have here, but I think that's a really great place to start to really begin to understand it. Other questions or comments about this one. Okay, I'm janine, would you mind I'm closing out the presentation, so I can see the committee again in terms of all the Hollywood Squares of wpe, so Sally, would you like to make a motion on your Ballard letter for the Greenway I think you said yes, I'd like to make a motion? Yes, I would like to make a motion. Thank you. Is there a second on Sally's motion with regards to requesting perfect I'll? Second, it and you know, I hate those things too and they're too close together. It's not a matter of yeah I've actually witnessed accidents caused by them. You know it's not a that. They make you slow down too much it's that they are as er dis, especially for people who just started riding a bike there and there are a ton of them, so I wish that they could rethink them and maybe spread them farther apart. Thank you, dude I'm, yeah I mean I, think yeah I. Think again they were just put there to save us without thinking about the best way to do it. Yep any objection to this letter present not eligible or abstention. The tweaking is scarlet but I'm. You know I'm gonna vote in favor the letter so hearing. None of that will that letter passes unanimously and then, with regards to the public space along the Manhattan cruise ship terminal. Would somebody be willing to propose a motion for perhaps letter to EDC expressing our dismayed upsetness that they couldn't come this evening and our converted a lack of public access to the space and then separately a note to our elected regarding this as well see here for other reasons as well. We want to do this cruise ship, my electric power yep. They have to come in front of us or I. Think a few things right yeah have to, but should so Lesley can I. Take that comment as your motion on these two letters. No, you want me to write too much. No just the motion and I'll. Second, it I can't make motions as the chair of the meeting right now to that you know: I'm the one moving it along, usually so Thank You, Leslie, Thank, You Sally. Any questions on that objections present a tileable or extend abstention. Hearing. None that letter passes unanimously any new business or old business. Alan I should I mean I, think always right, Alan right, it's not helicopters, it's actually environmental. You know we had this system in New York, City of alternate side parking, which has been no here in there. The last couple of months, however, as much as open side parking helps us clean our streets and also an impacts environment that the people living around there, because in the wintertime people are sitting there in their cars for about an hour and a half running their cars, so they stay warm in the summertime so that they can stay cool. So usually the state 22nd Street, where I am between either Deveny, starts at 9 o'clock ends at 10:30 oftentimes, the sweeper comes down at 9:15 9:20, everybody moves back and they sit there till 10:30. Why do they need to sit there? Till 10:30 I once got a response to that from sanitation and they said well. Maybe the guy wants to come back around again to make sure you clean your Street properly, so I'm waiting for him to come around two times, but that's never what happened so for future reference and this might form into a little bit with transportation, also because it's so obviously the street, so maybe for a future discussion or something we can maybe see about trying to get the city to improve its or third side which they've been hammering around with this. So it doesn't matter if it's one day or two days, it still impacts the community. Why should people be sitting there? Maybe we can get these street sweepers to have cameras there, so in case somebody is blocking it for some reason they can take it to person. But once the sweeper comes by people should be able to move their car back and go home and get on with their lives. I think it's a very point Allen and it speaks to the efficiencies as a whole that we need to be making as a city I'd, be happy to raise it to the transportation committee, which I think it would make a bit more sense coming out of, but they could recognize that it was requested by their colleagues on wpe as it relates to the environment if you'd like sounds good. Thank you, okay, yeah! It's a great idea and I noticed with a cyclist that often the people who are waiting or fucking a bike lane -. Thank you for that Allen anything else from anybody. Well with that I. Thank you all for being here this evening and continue to stay safe and try to enjoy this summer as we have it. Our full board is at the end of this month, and then we will not be meeting in August. We reconvene the beginning of September for a full board meeting and restart our regular schedule in the first Thursday of the month thereafter. So it's nice to see you all. Thank you good meeting, James everybody. Thank you much Thank you Thank You Janine,.
