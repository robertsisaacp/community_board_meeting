I'll be alone reading, so I'm very grateful for all of you for signing in how you doing Sarah good okay. How are you doing I'm just you know, just have no trust for any public official from the top down. That include us. No we're appointed we're, not elected I'm, a public member, so I'm, not even official. No, it's a bad situation. The neighborhood's not doing well yeah you're, aware of what's going on in 36 right now, I'm sure what well you know that DHS has moved over 515 shelter residents in to the two hotel two of the hotels on West 36th Street, and it is overwhelmed the neighborhood considering you know we already have substantial supportive housing and social services, and so our block is to send it into complete chaos, and it's spread out on to 8th and 9th, unfortunately, yeah first Street as well, but the police are doing a great job of protecting their precinct buildings. Can you share which hotels, yes they're in the Doubletree Hilton, which is on West 36th, between 8th and 9th Avenue and they're in the Marriott hotel, also on 36th Street, between 8th and 9th Avenue? That was the former Christ Church that we worked on preserving the facade and you know the issue is that Hell's Kitchen from my understanding has received 2100 shelter, individuals from outside of our district being moved into 2800 it's up to 2800. Now, okay and like I, said they're 515 on my block and on 37th there's another I can't get the answers right if it's one or two hotels on 37th Street, but overall, its overwhelmed the capacity of the neighbourhood to handle it and unfortunately, as you know, the 30s has its share of problems and the shelter residents aren't helping the situation. Many of them I've BRR, are gonna fall prey to a lot of the issues in our neighborhood, if they're not already participating in them, but as residents in my building, many of which who have been there for 25 plus years they've. All said this is the worst our street has ever been. This is more dangerous than it wasn't 90s and many of us you see in the eighties, like eighties program beyond its beats. Well before that this is well beyond that. I mean this. On 51st Street, we have 202 doors for me, 200 people have been put into the WJ yeah. We don't have. Political leadership. Is the mayor having too much fun with Hell's Kitchen? That's really what it boils down to, but we have to have some cloud. We need people in this neighborhood who represent us. The community, there's gotta, be some leadership I, don't just throw it up to the mayor something's missing here. This is a gap here, less respectfully we do have the representative, who is chair of the Health Committee in Albany in the assembly and I, haven't heard anything from him either so you're right there is leadership, he's missing, but I mean it's not for nothing. We do have the Speaker of the City Council. These contracts are being signed through emergency order and it's not up to the speaker to review them. The mayor has emergency authority to do so currently they're being signed months a month, but the expectation within City Hall within the mayor's office is that this goes into 2021 I believe the individual who is negotiating inside of these contracts. So it's like the guy who ran against the mayor when the mayor ran for a second term is City Council like they're chums like this is this is executive I want to remind us all that this is being recorded and transcribed, so you always want to be careful. What we're saying not anything to be worried about much with apologies, JD I was late he's what we're discussing one of the topics for tonight's meeting just checking evening. Everybody I want to welcome everybody to this meeting. Our monthly meeting I have to say a few words I'm JD Noland I'm, the chair of the health kitchen, Clinton Land Use Committee of Manhattan Community Board before, as you all know, according to the executive order by the governor two. Oh two point one or something like that. This is it's going to be recorded, it's going to be transcribed so and we I don't know. Janine, if we have any member of the public calling in we may or we may not, there are two people welcome everybody. The way we work is that we have our presentation. It's not much of a presentation, I'm really going to do the talking and then the committee might have some questions to ask some clarifying questions and then we go to the public and make your comments or your questions. We welcome those say whatever you want and so I'm gonna start the meeting very quickly. First of all, thank you all for coming for attending this meeting the basically we have to talk about, or we don't have to talk about, but what's on the agenda is the Western railyards infrastructure project, they're, doing I think you all looked at that scoping video is about 17 minutes long. This is the e is the environmental impact statement they have to go through. The environmental impact statement looks at impacts on the built environment or the natural environment as they're building this structure. What is the structure? It's basically a platform over the western rail yards. It's something like nine point: eight acres, it's extraordinary a platform of steel and concrete. That's the first thing. The second thing is a passageway for a potential future trance Hudson passenger rail line. So those are the two things we have until July 31st mr. light to make comments. The public does too it's very easy to make comments. You can write to them or you can go online to www-where stern rail yards infrastructure calm and make any comments you want. We can make comments tonight or we can ask Jesse to write an administrative letter. We've discussed this and are these are our concerns if we have any I'm sure we'll have concerns about the impact of construction on nearby residents. Sometimes we have a Jessie works with a group to coordinate problems to solve problems. Jesse can only just write a letter about that. If we want, if the public has questions, we can put those in a letter if the committee wants to which we could present to the full board in July at the end of July, forget what it is. So that's basically what we're here tonight for the platform over the western part, so they can put up buildings I, don't know what we're worried about. Bob said the mold people who lived there. We might be concerned about that. So he can raise those issues if you Marty, that was a joke. You guys are great audience really. So are there any we're all you, okay, unmute! If you raise your hand, if you put on a comment and make questions, ask questions yes, Brian, oh I thought I thought you raised your hand Brian, no okay. So if they're know, if there's no, if you have comments, you can always send them to me during the week. We can always get them in a letter if you're worried about that. I really don't know what to comment on this beyond the concerns about noise to the surrounding community. Anybody else, which is in the scope already, which is in there already yeah noise mitigation journey. Pardon me come does noise mitigation is in okay. Iii was saying if we want to set up a group of residents and the board to solve any problems that arise. Sometimes we do that Jimmy. Does anybody in the public would like to speak? I, don't see anything if anybody wants to speak, please use the raise hand feature and then we'll call on you. As you come up, there was a mention in the chat room about road blocking for constructions. So I don't know. If there's anything that needs to be mentioned about that yeah, it was mister, hey, yeah, Kenneth, caster, yeah, there's certainly going to be a lot of I. Think we should in the letter that the administrative letter we should raise concerns about the staging area and how that impact on road access. There's a question JD from sin aid laws worth: is this project prevailing wage I? Think it actually it's a union project all right. Well, no aggression question is a prevailing wage. That's not a union! There is two separate questions. One in the Q&A asked, if is prevailing, wage one in the chat asks you. Those are two different issues that same individual, but is this committee also in the habit of asking constantly for local hiring on all projects, I mean I. Think that's something we do across the board of them. Everything is that in this already I think we can certainly ask anything we want to Paul. The main thing is the impact on the environment, the built environment and the natural environment, our archaeological or historical, but I think we're gonna exactly want to ask and certainly throw it here so bite, -, WWE, arts infrastructure, calm with any concerns you have. Normally, the scope doesn't cover those things, but as of now, my understanding is we're late in the unions they're having an issue, they were suing each other, but they resolve their issues and I'm no longer suing so that and have an agreement through the building Congress and going forward on the west and Mario's be the case a year or so from now, when yeah they're discussing- and maybe we've talked about before and funk forgetting I apologize. What is intended to be built on top of this and I know. That's not specifically part of this scope, but it might be important in terms of how they're preparing this surface. Well, it's the commercial residential park development that we've all agreed to nothing as far as I know about that has changed. So my only concern and I again apologize that I didn't do a deep dive. If you were gonna put a park in and there's a lot of soil, that's going on there and then it's being watered and then it needs to drain somewhere that I, just I would be concerned that you know if it's being optimized for structures. Is it also able to handle a park? We can look that should be in the scope. It's not really a park at. Second, it's a plot, a green plaza as I recall in the zoning it's 80%, residential and 20% commercial and there's supposedly a school to go there yeah in one part, we can check it out, James and there's a probably happen 16 years from now. So if there's some motion right, an administrative letter too [Music] say that we've had a hearing and we're concerned about the staging area and the traffic, and we want to make sure, there's good communication, something like that. I'll link the motion to the sentiments of that suggestion. A second okay! Thank you anything from the public Ginny. Okay, that's the end of that hearing. The only other item we need to talk about very briefly is that the Penn Station development redevelopment empire station complex, it's mainly inboard, five across eighth Avenue 34th Street for five, is having a joint committee meeting Monday the 13th. Is it the 13th? Yes at 6:00 p.m. we are welcome to join in that meeting. I think they want us to register you contact Jesse, Paul I. This has been traditionally its kind of Hell's Kitchen. There's a piece on the west of 8th Avenue that belongs to us. This redevelopment. We may want to be concerned about that. It means and it affects it's Hell's Kitchen, but it's close to Chelsea. So we may want to pay attention to that and kind of know. What's going on, Paul is your committee? Yes, so if there is one block from the south between 30th and 31st, which is clearly in Chelsea and the transportation issues of Moynihan station are concerned to the transportation committee, so we are actually going to do a joint meeting with transportation and Chelsea land use on the 15th, which is when transportation was already scheduled, because Chelsea land use would typically be scheduled on the 20th, but that's the night of the ESD hearing itself. So we wanted to have people to be able to go to the 13th meeting for community board. 5 had the opportunity for community board Ford to have a Kim structure, opinion on it and then have people have the opportunity to attend the public hearing at ESD on the 20th, so Chelsea menus and transportation committees of cb4 will be holding a joint meeting on the 15th, so people, okay, it won't come to that and Bob. This was traditionally Hell's Kitchen, because yeah the house kitchen but affects Chelsea, so Lee always was the person who went to the cv5 meetings. [Music]. Yes! Well, you keep us informed of this committee about what's going on? Yes hundred percent, that's fun, okay, the only other thing everything's been on pause. As you know, construction, but according to Jesse, things are going to get up, probably September, maybe October, where we're gonna have a lot to deal with so be prepared. It's my hope. We don't have to have a meeting next month. Unless you all want one I, don't see any enthusiasm, I'd be fine, so long as there's some sort of email that goes out with a summary from Jesse I. Just I just have one question, because we were talking about at the start of the meeting, there's. Obviously a lot of issues regarding the temporary moving of shelters into the hotels within our district. There are, of course, a lot of rumors flying around in public amongst residents, neighborhood neighbors, and concern that these temporary, these hotels that are acting as temporary shelters will become permanent shelters and the best I've been able to answer. People regarding that is I think they would have to modify the zoning on that I. Don't know if there's any answer: they don't they don't they could? No, they don't know, and it's something that was being considered. What I was a policy director and council was murmurs of potential. You lurks if a hotel was built and then it's alternative purpose was to be a shelter than it should go in front of a community board for vote and then go up through full City Council, but that hasn't come to fruition yet. But that is something legislatively that light could be done. That's true, but a committee would is to get notice if a place is gonna, become permanent I'm in the wreck, but we're talking about its actual change of use and commercial services. If the city went to put something permit in the area, the community board would be notice notified why it would be no, it would be notified, but there's also a legislative opportunity to change that and say no. This has to go up in front of City Council I'm agreeing I'm just saying that, if even if they don't do that, we still have no, we still would get notice ahead of time, sound likely we'd wake up in the morning and all of a sudden there's permanent right, which would look terrible in front of all depressed because we'd be against a shelter and it would be shocked and it just it's just not something that like really works historically and the benefit of a community board. So this is why I'm saying there's a legislative option. It just needs to be considered and analyzed looks like anyway. Thank you for that. Any other questions, new business, old business, I, hope, everybody's wearing a mask and taking care and keeping their spirits up. I have one follow-up question on the shelter issue, sure or anything in the statutes. That indicates when something goes from temporary to permanent, because I mean who makes that determination when it's triggered, because you could say it's temporary and go month to month. But then, three years later, it's like. Oh, it's still month to month when the emergency order is lifted so from when the state lifts its emergency order, the city and yeah, essentially the state and city would work hand in hand, but it's when the emergency order is lifted. Okay, so if I correctly, once the emergency or is lifted, then they would have to either remove people to permanent facilities or let me go correct, okay, but once again, if they want to make something into a permanent facility, all they have to do is give us a heads-up and they do it anyway. But what does a heads-up mean? Does that mean the public has an opportunity to weigh in and comment or no it's just there's good notice. You just get because look. You know that changed the entire demographic of my street alone, the whole neighborhood I mean you know. Oh you're gonna lend up losing a lot of your current neighbors, because we've already lost yeah, we just don't feel say, knocking out of dozens or percentage points in terms of residents and constituents and in this area Brian we've been abandoned by our electeds. That's as simple as that. It may be an emergency, but there's no excuse in an emergency not to handle this in a more systematic and logical way. What we're seeing is evidence of no planning in real time, and you cannot tell me that we don't have talented enough people in the city of New York to think about how ridiculous it is to move someone out of Queens or out of Brooklyn or out of Staten Island into Manhattan, because they need to be in a ho tell. This is silly for many reasons, but one of the things that's really going to be a problem for this community overall is, as we are, witnessing the quality of life issues here, even though this is temporary, when folks could move back to their permanent shelters once the emergency is lifted. They've now made new contacts within our area, which means most of these folks will have a reason to come back and we've now made our streets uncomfortable because there are folks here that may not be able to get access to services they need in order to help them not be frightening to other citizens, and it's as much as we are tolerant and we want to be helpful, there'll be more people who will just say no, and then we don't have solutions for these problems overall, I think what we all need to do and again. This is not, as maybe the community board, because the community board has been very vocal and written letters, but we could need to continue to press upon the electives that are there now to say they need to hear the voices of every single citizen that is impacting from both the social services side, the folks that will not speak for themselves, not realizing what they do not have in this move, but for the folks that also are not living on safe streets, because some of our blocks really at this time are not safe. Here I haveno at night: it's getting really rough, I'm well. I go out late at night and I moved here in 81 and it's 81 again as JD said, and I used to live on, 48th Street before JD did, but it seems to me that there's a lot of police cars down here, I don't want to approach the cops, but we have a new dealer. As you said, Delores who set up shop in front of the butcher shop on 9th Avenue between 44 and 45 I walk in the street I got a gloves on I got a hat. You know, you know whatever masks on I. You know just a little walking one and I'm a little frightened again yeah paulette poseidon's available for email he's the owner, presiding, greek bakery and his email is available on his instagram. It's actually Paul episodic bakery calm he's very. You can reach out to any time to discuss. What's going on next door at that at that butcher, shop, cuz, he's just as concerned he's actually decreased his hours at it's his exposure, and we can't have that right. Additionally, there are tons of cars. You know squad cars on 9th Avenue on July 5th, around 1:00 a.m. there was a senior with dementia that I actually went over to a squad car over at the Duane Reade and found out his address and everything to get him away from there. He was actually looking for Sacred Heart at 1:00 a.m. Midtown. North was able to get him a courtesy ride back to his home in Spanish Harlem, but like this, you know like these guys are busy with a lot of qol calls that we haven't seen in this volume in a generation and in like it calls the question whether or not we as residents of the neighborhood, not as members of a community board, should be looking to actively be present safely in the streets to make sure that our NCOs in Midtown, north and other precincts are aware where we are and what is going on. Just you know, I, don't know how aware everyone on the board is, but you know I know this. Friday is a follow up, call that I will be on I, believe Marie, Ortez and Joe Rasputia and Lowell with DHS and several of the shelter providers on West 36th Street in West, 37th Street and some commercial tenants and some residents the neighborhood, because over night that neighborhood transformed and we are overwhelmed residents- do not feel safe, walking out their front doors. Commercial tenants, don't feel safe, reopening their businesses, and you know we had one call with the shelter providers so far his baby I might have been joined on in the last call, but they were supposed to come back with comprehensive changes on this next call and they haven't dead, implement. If you haven't seen any improvements on our streets and our neighborhood but I don't know shitty my reach out to Jessie and see if more members of the community are welcome. On that call or I mean it was a big call out comments. There were 30 participants on it, so I are interested I think it I know that we're talking to shelter providers in the 30th but I know that a lot of people were referencing issues that were occurring all off. Ninth Avenue, all of eighth avenues and well into the 50 and talking about what's worked with some of the shelters that have moved into our neighborhood and what's clearly not working with a number of the shelters that have moved into the neighborhood, but I think the lorises point that made a minute or two ago. Dolores is very concerning, as he said, that we've now moved shelter residents to our need of social services. We're gonna need a continued social services into a neighborhood that they are now making new connections and in the thirties. It's new connections with you know: drug dealers, unfortunately, and once you know chris, is a temporary measure and the shelters and moved out next month to move out six months from now. At that point, the groundwork has been laid and this has become their community -. And what do we at the community do to curtail that? And you know, I, don't know if it's something that land uses any opportunity to comment on or if it's something that we continue hammering our elections who are seeking higher office. You know and have them put pressure on be at that. You know any solutions are welcome. Thank you, Brian James, the frustration is palpable I agree with everything Delores and Chris and Brian are saying and Morgan's concerns as well. I just want to mention that I'm also on HHS I've already composed a letter. You know this isn't really you know within the purview of land use. In my estimation, JD you're, the final arbiter of that, but without a doubt like this is issue number one with HHH s committee and it should be number one on the full boards radar and if there's anything, I can do as a member of land use for all of us can do. We should be channeling that energy to whatever that initiative is, but we need some sort of strong statement from the full board for immediate action by the electeds and Chris to your point, I understand that it's a executive issue, but at the same it doesn't mean that you know Cory's powerless. It can be a legislative thing, which is what I had suggested. You know like we can say once these emergency orders and anything permanent needs to go through a Euler process, and it cannot just be a formal like hey. This is now permanent. No, it has to go through the full City Council. It has to go through committee and cetera. I want to take it a step further than that and what, rather than wait for a leg for the legislative trigger, it's Corey's ability to take advantage of the bully pulpit that he has like you know, even if he doesn't have any formal, he can bring some influence there, and this was I. Would James I would say that he is either powerless or he has chosen not to be vocal about this issue. His entire staff is working tirelessly on every single one of the issues on each of those blocks. We hear them at the meetings they're here, they're active I, don't know that I've heard Corey's voice, so we either have to assume that he is powerless in this or that he is choosing not to be proactive and I'm, setting that publicly and being on record, because it is a problem we have voiced, and almost every committee at police precinct council meetings that we are in dire straits as a community we've tipped the scales. This is very frightening and I think that there we are at the point of no return where we can feel comfortable in the way that we were three months ago within our district, and this is not a good thing. I agree, I'll, agree on two percent doors: I have started a movement called defund. The politicians defund. The polls I went to my block meeting last night and I ranted and raved I'm madder than hell and Brian every block up here. Every block Association is going through the same thing. It is so frustrating and I, don't feel I think we should express the Land Use. Committee cannot write a letter, obviously, but each of us should go to our block meetings and just raise hell and we should defund the polls defund. The politicians I said that in my block meeting I know it's silly, but on the other hand it's very upsetting it's very goodie. We have you, we have an issue with a resident right across the street, formerly homeless residents. They don't wear masks, they hang out, they don't wear, masks simple thing: we've asked: okay, have them wear masks, we ask our representative. The answer was well, we call and we ask them- we haven't heard that help us out and I. Don't feel we're getting it up here anyway. Very disheartening and quite honestly, sorry name is awkward. I, assume is awkward, I mean all the residents, for my bills are sheltered in place for many months and because there are approximately the Javits Center, the hotels had been inhabited by the National Guard's that was, and healthy aid workers that worked working at the Javits and one day they moved out. The hotels were empty for a day and then literally school bus load after school bus load of shelter residents came in and like that, the neighborhood changed overnight. It's just it's incredible, so I think that elected really need to own. The fact that this and DHS is down the fact that this has had a great impact, and until that happens, because when I go to the meeting, even a lot of conversation, everyone brings up on there all these other pre-existing issues, and there are all these other issues pandemic and the economy, and all that is true, but noticeable change occurred when the shelters arrived them are our three and you know III, think you know our three already is compassionate. Our neighborhood has existing supportive housing on our block. We have, you know, experienced down the street gifts of a methadone clinic within a two-block radius, so we're aware of social services and the issues that they present, but this is at a whole other level, and it's heartbreaking that the city has done this and that the neighborhood is has, as the Laura said, reached the point of no return in the span of like it feels almost like a month from up here. People in the 1980s that have been working on block associations on the community board to try to turn things around and I. Just don't think they're gonna want to engage anymore once again, when the city is letting them down. Well, JD. You know this. It I think this speaks volumes about the failure of DHS right here in our doorstep. We've been talking about it time in and time out that when we place people who are without home and if they need Health and Human Services, they should be provided Health and Human Services right, regardless of whether or not there's an emergency. This should be something on DHS is mine, the entire time if these individuals who are contracted these organizations that are contracted to serve our city's most vulnerable they're, doing them a disservice and in some factor they're doing us a disservice because they deserve a right not only to be sheltered but to return to society as sheltered and working people are functioning people in their own capacity. This is not anything against the homeless of New York City. This is 100% a failure. Dhs I appreciate that you've allowed the conversation to go to what's really important for the community, because the truth is this is what the community is concerned about right now, and obviously this land use issue is a non-event, but I think that for each of us on the call and JD, if you don't mind, if I just make a suggestion again, the board is voicing very strong opposition and trying to work with our electeds on a solution. But that seems to be failing. I would say that each of us individually needs to, as JD said, find our block associations. If there isn't one forum one, we need to create more voices that are all speaking to the same thing, because for some reason our elected seem to be unfocused on this concern that is literally creating havoc in Hell's Kitchen I. Don't know if maybe because a little bit further south in Chelsea they're not feeling this in the same way. But I know that they're, probably other communities around the city that are experiencing the same thing. The concentration in our district is too high and it's in a very small area within our district and we're not getting that attention. So I know that personally, I'm gonna put pressure on not wearing the community board hat but as resident of 55th Street to say that this is an issue. This is important. This is what I vote on and also. This is how we actually would like to help solve these bigger issues by providing the services that Chris was talking about and being supportive of them in any way that we can. But we can't have this concentration in our neighborhoods at the expense of the safety of all residents, including shelter residents and folks that are already in supportive housing in our in our community. Thank You, Dolores I think it's an important issue because it is everybody's safety. It is a issue and it is a safety issue for all of us that walk on the street. For heaven's sakes, I want Bob and father Bob are you there did we lose but I've been tried? Oh there, you are Bob. Can you hear me there? You are Bob, yes, I, hear experience when you when you were DM. Yes, there, anyway, the Land Use Committee after this discussion to draft any kind of a letter expressing some of these concerns, even though it's not primarily a laughs. It's not the land users. Zoning matter, yeah, whatever you want to write on the board, could reject it by saying it was beyond your purview, but the canoed right in whatever it wants them. So we could we I move. We express some of these concerns about the buildings, the structures and the land use of these areas that are now without social services. For these new residents. I think that we can it's a stretch to say it's land use, but I think that we've expressed enough concerns and issues here to write a letter to all of our electives about how the reuse of the buildings in our area that don't allow for the social services that help these folks that are creating unintended consequences for not just them, but also for the residents, also tired, so the concern of will it become permanent, as opposed to temporary, which could ultimately lead to a land use issue. We actually I hear an amendment, some fall, so I can make the discussion point I have on that too so I. Second, the motion and I'd like to suggest that we include language as Bob was talking about that. We make it a letter specifically about the EULA process required to change a hotel from its usage of a hotel to a shelter and that we want to notify the city in advance of any when the emergency order is lifted, that this should go through Euler process, and this committee should be active in that decision process. I agree, I, second, that amendment that allows you to not allows you to go on talk about the problems that are going on in the area. Dolores. Do you accept double? Second, it I double accept it I think I think I mean I, think that's great, because I think you're, all under playing or some are under, stating that this is a land use issue. So I, don't I, don't think anybody needs to be apologetic about this committee. Taking this on, it's land use we're talking about a change of use. Thank you David. Yes, it's some help to commercial hotel use right off. It's the land use issue. It doesn't mean it's only a land use issue, but it certainly is a land use issue. Three years of the building is a land use issue. We want to be notified when the emergency order is lifted, that we are involved in any decisions on any of these hotels that change the use of the building, and we want to see a vote. We want to see it through committee, maybe first to ask what exactly is the procedure and have them get back to us in some way? You'll wait three months for them in the respond yeah, the procedure is rather simple: I requested the death, tactically open up the door to Oh community board for is amenable to discussing. Turning these into permanent shelters, I mean. Does that open up? That no depends. Are you word the letter, but I doubt JD's gonna word the letter, we're sweat problem, sure I vote for it and I'll send around a draft once I do it next week, so we can have it for the full board. Delores. Did you ever comment? No I said I vote for it, and I just wanted to note that there was a comment in the chat saying that Chelsea is experiencing the same issues. It's going on. It's around the city, it's in parts of Queens, too they've taken over all of Queens Boulevard in Queens and turn all the hotels there into temporary shelters. It's hard, Long, Island, City yeah, it's a big problem all over the city. It's not just you all in favor of the letter that was proposed. Anybody opposed to this letter. Frank.
