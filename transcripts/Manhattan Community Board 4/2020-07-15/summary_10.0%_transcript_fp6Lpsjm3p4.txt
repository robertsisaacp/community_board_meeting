The neighborhood's not doing well yeah you're, aware of what's going on in 36 right now, I'm sure what well you know that DHS has moved over 515 shelter residents in to the two hotel two of the hotels on West 36th Street, and it is overwhelmed the neighborhood considering you know we already have substantial supportive housing and social services, and so our block is to send it into complete chaos, and it's spread out on to 8th and 9th, unfortunately, yeah first Street as well, but the police are doing a great job of protecting their precinct buildings.
That was the former Christ Church that we worked on preserving the facade and you know the issue is that Hell's Kitchen from my understanding has received 2100 shelter, individuals from outside of our district being moved into 2800 it's up to 2800.
Now, okay and like I, said they're 515 on my block and on 37th there's another I can't get the answers right if it's one or two hotels on 37th Street, but overall, its overwhelmed the capacity of the neighbourhood to handle it and unfortunately, as you know, the 30s has its share of problems and the shelter residents aren't helping the situation.
Our monthly meeting I have to say a few words I'm JD Noland I'm, the chair of the health kitchen, Clinton Land Use Committee of Manhattan Community Board before, as you all know, according to the executive order by the governor two.
First of all, thank you all for coming for attending this meeting the basically we have to talk about, or we don't have to talk about, but what's on the agenda is the Western railyards infrastructure project, they're, doing I think you all looked at that scoping video is about 17 minutes long.
The main thing is the impact on the environment, the built environment and the natural environment, our archaeological or historical, but I think we're gonna exactly want to ask and certainly throw it here so bite, -, WWE, arts infrastructure, calm with any concerns you have.
Normally, the scope doesn't cover those things, but as of now, my understanding is we're late in the unions they're having an issue, they were suing each other, but they resolve their issues and I'm no longer suing so that and have an agreement through the building Congress and going forward on the west and Mario's be the case a year or so from now, when yeah they're discussing- and maybe we've talked about before and funk forgetting I apologize.
If you were gonna put a park in and there's a lot of soil, that's going on there and then it's being watered and then it needs to drain somewhere that I, just I would be concerned that you know if it's being optimized for structures.
So if there's some motion right, an administrative letter too [Music] say that we've had a hearing and we're concerned about the staging area and the traffic, and we want to make sure, there's good communication, something like that.
Yes, so if there is one block from the south between 30th and 31st, which is clearly in Chelsea and the transportation issues of Moynihan station are concerned to the transportation committee, so we are actually going to do a joint meeting with transportation and Chelsea land use on the 15th, which is when transportation was already scheduled, because Chelsea land use would typically be scheduled on the 20th, but that's the night of the ESD hearing itself.
5 had the opportunity for community board Ford to have a Kim structure, opinion on it and then have people have the opportunity to attend the public hearing at ESD on the 20th, so Chelsea menus and transportation committees of cb4 will be holding a joint meeting on the 15th, so people, okay, it won't come to that and Bob. This was traditionally Hell's Kitchen, because yeah the house kitchen but affects Chelsea, so Lee always was the person who went to the cv5 meetings.
That's true, but a committee would is to get notice if a place is gonna, become permanent I'm in the wreck, but we're talking about its actual change of use and commercial services.
This has to go up in front of City Council I'm agreeing I'm just saying that, if even if they don't do that, we still have no, we still would get notice ahead of time, sound likely we'd wake up in the morning and all of a sudden there's permanent right, which would look terrible in front of all depressed because we'd be against a shelter and it would be shocked and it just it's just not something that like really works historically and the benefit of a community board.
This is silly for many reasons, but one of the things that's really going to be a problem for this community overall is, as we are, witnessing the quality of life issues here, even though this is temporary, when folks could move back to their permanent shelters once the emergency is lifted.
They've now made new contacts within our area, which means most of these folks will have a reason to come back and we've now made our streets uncomfortable because there are folks here that may not be able to get access to services they need in order to help them not be frightening to other citizens, and it's as much as we are tolerant and we want to be helpful, there'll be more people who will just say no, and then we don't have solutions for these problems overall, I think what we all need to do and again.
This is not, as maybe the community board, because the community board has been very vocal and written letters, but we could need to continue to press upon the electives that are there now to say they need to hear the voices of every single citizen that is impacting from both the social services side, the folks that will not speak for themselves, not realizing what they do not have in this move, but for the folks that also are not living on safe streets, because some of our blocks really at this time are not safe.
North was able to get him a courtesy ride back to his home in Spanish Harlem, but like this, you know like these guys are busy with a lot of qol calls that we haven't seen in this volume in a generation and in like it calls the question whether or not we as residents of the neighborhood, not as members of a community board, should be looking to actively be present safely in the streets to make sure that our NCOs in Midtown, north and other precincts are aware where we are and what is going on.
There were 30 participants on it, so I are interested I think it I know that we're talking to shelter providers in the 30th but I know that a lot of people were referencing issues that were occurring all off.
Dolores is very concerning, as he said, that we've now moved shelter residents to our need of social services.
We should be channeling that energy to whatever that initiative is, but we need some sort of strong statement from the full board for immediate action by the electeds and Chris to your point, I understand that it's a executive issue, but at the same it doesn't mean that you know Cory's powerless.
It is so frustrating and I, don't feel I think we should express the Land Use. Committee cannot write a letter, obviously, but each of us should go to our block meetings and just raise hell and we should defund the polls defund.
We have, you know, experienced down the street gifts of a methadone clinic within a two-block radius, so we're aware of social services and the issues that they present, but this is at a whole other level, and it's heartbreaking that the city has done this and that the neighborhood is has, as the Laura said, reached the point of no return in the span of like it feels almost like a month from up here.
People in the 1980s that have been working on block associations on the community board to try to turn things around and I.
Dhs I appreciate that you've allowed the conversation to go to what's really important for the community, because the truth is this is what the community is concerned about right now, and obviously this land use issue is a non-event, but I think that for each of us on the call and JD, if you don't mind, if I just make a suggestion again, the board is voicing very strong opposition and trying to work with our electeds on a solution.
But I know that they're, probably other communities around the city that are experiencing the same thing.
So I know that personally, I'm gonna put pressure on not wearing the community board hat but as resident of 55th Street to say that this is an issue.
Yes, there, anyway, the Land Use Committee after this discussion to draft any kind of a letter expressing some of these concerns, even though it's not primarily a laughs.
