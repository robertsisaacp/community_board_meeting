We will be bundling all of our items when we vote into a roll call vote, basically looking for everyone to signal which letters they agree with or disagree with, and that's our process, so we're going to start with a presentation, a public hearing.
I would like to let everyone know that I got some really nice emails from the chair of cb5 vicki barbaro complimenting all of the cb4 speakers, but with that who am I giving this to jeffrey?
Thank you so, as lol pointed out, the new york state urban development corporation, also known as empire state development or esd, is proposing a transit oriented development surrounding penn station through a general project plan or gpp which supersedes the city's euler and overwrites current zoning we're at the stage in the process where esd is determining the scope of study for the environmental impact, study or eis.
Thank you all very much all right we're going to go into our public session.
My name is jeffree lafrancois, I'm the first vice chair of manhattan community board for this evening I'll be running our public session as we do each meeting those that have signed up in advance.
A number of letters of opposition and support to a particular liquor license on the agenda of a place called the spot that will be talked about in detail during the business section of the meeting by the co-chairs of the blp committee, and we also see the number of we're letters around concerns about the homeless issues we're facing in largely in hell's kitchen, but in the district as a whole, and one of the things to lowell's point is: if somebody says something before you your time at the microphone.
Unless they have signed in a different name, got it so with that we'll go call amir cot cobbed all right, we have a mirror from okay from the new york public library, I probably pronounce their name incorrectly after that is donna, may dipola, and then lisa wager amir.
I want to check, in with you all, with some updates on some new things going on the library I'm going to get right to it, because I only have two minutes so the first one is that we have reopened.
However, we know that not everybody has internet access, and so one thing that my team has been doing is distributing physical book kits to students in different parts of the city, and now, while my team has concluded these efforts, we worked with a lot of elected officials.
We will have some people in limited capacities in the residence halls, we're all looking forward to getting back to doing the fabulous public education which leads to terrific creative employment in new york city and throughout the world, and also the black students union about a month ago put up a really powerful and beautiful and very cool mural that they chalked on the outside of the buildings that face seventh avenue.
In the last four years I've been living here in hell's kitchen and last year, and I think this is relevant and worth noting I was the head of hr for breaking ground, which is the largest supportive housing network, probably not only in the city but in the united states.
So I've seen up close how to manage housing for the homeless and it's a cause that I feel very passionate about and in all that being said, I've noticed that there are three homeless shelters that have popped up on 36 and 37, and in this particular case the management doesn't seem to have control over the issues or the tenants, and it appears that the decision might have been a quality of life and a public health decision for the tenants of these shelters and they would say, without regard to the quality of life.
These are poorly managed, pop-up facilities appear, the quality of life has decreased overall, and I might add that the tenants are smoking and drinking in large groups in front of the hotels without masks without social distancing, and it's something that the governor has shut bars and restaurants down all over the city to the exact same violations.
I've been personally asked to give money to a tenant milwaukee in the street when I refused, he threatened to spit on me, as the residents no longer feel safe or comfortable going out to eat or shop.
Two years ago, when the department of buildings issued a june 2018 summons for jamming 600 people in his space permitted for only 75., these operators, who claim to be good citizens, have historically been two of the worst operators in hell's kitchen's history.
Yet they speak to you and tell you for the fifth time that they are reformed and you believe them, john and ted have always been the rules misinterpreted the rules broke the rules or ignored the rules, and the community board has proof of everything that I just said.
I want to remind the board that detective mike dugan, head of community affairs at midtown north told me that in two that in 2020 rise bar six, three one violations all happened in the beginning of the year.
I've lived in the piano factory at 45th and 10th for the past eight years and within hell's kitchen for nearly 15 years now, as a community, we had many issues with martini previously in the neighborhood which, in my opinion, operated very much in the style of the proposed spotlight in the spot club.
Sorry, in their later years, from my experience within the immediate vicinity of the proposed bar, my neighbors will have issues with noise pollution coming from the spot bar itself, as we have found living in an older building coupled with the spot guests who will congregate, as the previous speaker said, outside the bar, it was the latter that proved to be the biggest issue for us living through the martini years.
I've ran nightclubs for many years and I want to make clear that ryze ball operates as a local bar and far from a nightclub which requires a completely different business model like much larger capacity.
Most of our guests are from hell's kitchen and we actually know many of them by name most consider rise as their local cheers, because we do provide a safe environment for our guests staff members and our surrounding neighbors.
It's just doesn't fit in with the landscape of the neighborhood any longer, and I think we need to be mindful of that and just in all the children walking to school every morning, there's going to be tons of garbage.
I also want to emphasize to people that we've got 20 plus new hands going up, and so, if you're speaking on the spot, I'm going to be limiting those comments to one minute.
I'm here, can you hear me hi, okay, great hi, welcome everybody nice to see you hope, you're staying safe during this difficult time.
I know it's a very difficult time, but I just feel like to kind of let this slide by a half million dollars during an economic crisis is really irresponsible.
I don't think it's a good way to manage public funds, particularly given that cuny's public and it's facing 150 million budget shortfall, so this money would mean a lot to a lot of different people in the community, and so I would really like someone to reach out and we could figure out a way to go forward with additional support.
If you want to send a note to our board office, this sounds like something we might be able to look at in one of our committees that relates to this type of stuff.
So thank you, brian weber, bruce mccaffer and then sean riley, hi, all it's brian weber, I'm a public member of cb4 land, houston zoning committee and I'm also a resident of west 36th street between eighth and ninth avenue, and I'm calling with regards to the temporary homeless shelters that have moved into west 36th street and west 37th street.
I've spent the past several afternoons, walking the streets with eric bocher from corey johnson's office and members of dhs, the shelter providers, and what is evident is that we have too many residents too little space, two little resources and separate providers, and all we will be provided with is additional phone numbers and there's no way out of this until we reduce the density of the shelter population, either removing two or more of the shelters from this immediate vicinity.
This is a change of operation so understand this is an existing 4am le 4am permit and we're and ted's just looking to move into the same space same size, not increasing size, as as pointed out in the blp lan, you know, ted has dj's lansdowne road had ddjs.
I just want to thank the blp committee for their decision and encourage the full board to vote with them on resolutions.
I also think that in this time, right now, when we're dealing with so much blight, that's happening in the city, because people are literally leaving the city in droves right now that we need to be as friendly as possible to businesses, especially businesses that have proven like rise bar has that they can operate like responsibly.
I think the underlying issue that we're missing is how much safer it is when a block is lit up, especially a bar when I walk home at night and bars are lit up or dormant or outside and, let's just be honest, the whole neighborhood is outside right now and it's going to continue to be outside for quite some time.
I will tell you, as of this week, three bars three queer spaces are closing and announced in the neighborhood, and I'm really shocked that people do not want that block to be lit up.
If anything, this will bring safety to the area, get the homeless out, and I will tell you that I helped to get letters and many people that I got letters from have small little children who live in my building.
You know the patron second restaurant than the people that are currently wandering around, so I'm in total favor of this place.
Now, I'm so sorry that the young gentleman didn't go to a meeting to be heard on this very important issue, but the fact of the matter is over the years the this community board has taken the plus attendant association's word that they represent the tenants and they do by law.
They want to call the police anyhow, that's just something I wanted to talk about all these homeless shelters going up in the area, they're not managed somebody's doing something wrong and I don't know who it is, but it's really start to destroy the neighborhood I've been in for 30 years.
The other thing I want to talk about is the new spot bar I'm totally in favor of the spot bar, I don't know, does melissa.
These aren't just businesses or jobs for people in our communities and at the last full board meeting when they were trying to get the spot at the location next door.
Second, now is the time to approve the spot and help restore hell's kitchen they'll, make the block safer and provide jobs to those in our community.
I live above rise on the I guess when facing the building on the left side above the bar area, I'm here to talk about the noise outside I'm in support of the spot bar they've had the outdoor seating this whole entire time.
I've been a resident of the neighborhood for about 25 years and a community leader for about a decade, and you know I really appreciate hearing all the perspectives, so I just wanted to give one of the perspective on the spot bar.
So I think one of the concerns that I'm hearing from the community is that the spot bar will have an outside impact.
Many apparently lived outside of manhattan, so landstown road was a quiet, local pub that had an exemplary operational record 15 seconds and one of the clear things that a petition like this tells me is that even the owners understand that spot bar is going to have an outsize impact on the on the community.
I've just been very thankful to work for tracy, teddy and john as being one of my first managers and for one of my first jobs to make money in new york city so that I continue so they can continue to work and live here, they're, incredibly responsible and strict when need to be, and with my time at rise.
I just wanted to say that the open restaurants plan has been overall promising for our street from having like a couple hundred people on our street to smaller problems.
Smaller gatherings, I just want to note, there's been a related problem and we could really use the help of the community board and our local officials to kind of you know, put a little pressure for law enforcement to come together and visit the block a little.
So people have been bringing portable sound systems stereos and playing music on their car to like really late hours of the night and like I don't want to blame any specific restaurant or bar but contacting 301 and 911 has not helped, and I've spoken to a lot of neighbors about the same issue.
I know councilmember consanity's brought a lot of attention to the issue in astoria and there was a lot of attention about how big those parties were going and it really helped bring the sla over and a lot more law enforcement attention to that area, and so I know carl from the speaker's office is out of town, but I'd love to do something with the neighborhood, as well as the community board and the speaker's office to maybe do a walk through to see just kind of some of the related problems that are still sort of manifesting, because we could really use some help in that area.
I'd like to basically echo everyone's statement in favor of the management there at rise, and the only thing I will add in addition to that is throughout this pandemic and quarantine and bars, opening and shutting down.
That's what rise does I think my coach, like my peer, said with gotham cheer rises up this race over thirty five thousand dollars for homeless, lgbt youth at the ally, new york court coat drives and trinity place shelters, but the larger piece is a as a black gay man going into hell's kitchen, it's great to go into a bar.
Thank you darren just so you know folks, the last speaker that I'll be acknowledging this evening, because hands just keep going up repeatedly is artists cacklin.
I wanted to take the two minutes to address some of the issues that were raised by the residents first, my past involvement with bartini over the last 11 years.
I want to let the people know that I was the reason why I closed and I was reported the business of the sla and got the license cancelled.
First off I'd like to say, ryzebar has only had five noise complaints in three and a half years, 33 out of 40 tenants that live above rise of our support, the rights application and due to living directly above in terms of noise, we are having the appropriately security guards bartenders certified to make sure that they are over, seeing people are not drunk and I'm giving my daughter we're going to move on to the next speaker.
This is alan azarki and I I'm an architect at building violation services, and I truly want to put my support behind theodore he's been he's been a pleasure to work with, in the last couple of years, trying to make everything legal and the most safest for the health, safety and welfare of the public at rise bar, and I look forward to working with him on the spot.
Not only is it quiet and peaceful and the public is protected, but making sure everyone is safe and with the limited issues with the neighborhood and the community, I think he's one of the most upstanding individuals.
I've worked with in the hospitality industry, so I do want to put our entire office's support behind him and his venture he's been a pleasure to work with him yes and he's an utmost standing citizen that would do right by the community in that area beyond just keeping it safe and protected for the community.
Okay, also, folks, just to just to clarify, continue seeing new hands going up is guy with us nice to be with you.
We hear you go ahead great, I'm the president of the manhattan plaza tenants, association, that's over 3, 500 residents, so you know, 800 units in our building are across the street from the proposed location of the spot.
The owners have shown an inability to control their patrons as they wait to enter or when they come out to smoke at the previous establishments and have demonstrated that they have no plan to control their crowd at this one, either they've sent people from outside our neighborhood to gather petitions from our tenants describing their program as including poetry, readings which is misleading at best, no matter what the description of the operators.
I don't know who has me on I'm going to jump in for one second here: the manhattan plaza has a tenants association that is elected by the residents of the building.
420 of those are south of 48th street in hell's, kitchen 329 are above 49th street 137 petition signatures are from manhattan, plaza in addition to that, we've obtained eight letters independently from residents of manhattan, plaza 33 of the 40 residential tenants that live in the rise of our building are in support of this, including the two residents who live on the second floor above rise bar.
We took their advice, we thank you for coming back to lansdowne space, that's been licensed for 15 years, and we look forward to your support.
They're all coming over now, jeffrey okay, I saw them disappearing, so I wondered if they wanted to see their time michael you're, up no very distant.
I want to tell you that also add value to our community by hiring people that live in the neighborhood.
I talked to ted arenas yesterday and he told me that they got the homophobic people living in the manhattan plaza and they don't want gay bar in our neighbors and they got 140 people from the manhattan plaza who support gay bar and the neighbors, and I think it's really good for our community.
I think it's going to be a really good opportunity for our neighbors, and I want to tell that television has created a really nice bar it's not loud and it's they do everything to keep everyone quiet and make do the streets safer.
First of all, yesterday we submitted testimony on the empire station issue and I just want to thank board four and board 5 for helping us frame those issues and I think we're all in agreement on what needs to be happening with the scoping, I'm a homeless in the hotels situation, we've been hearing a lot about it.
I don't think it can sustain that and we look forward to working with board for with our fellow elected officials with the city to try to clear up this situation.
Is that part of the reason we have so much so much trouble in this city with housing and behavior that that stems from people with mental problems that are not getting assistance and a whole list of other things is that for a couple of decades, new york has been operating on an austerity budget and we've got to break that and I'm not suggesting that people who live in this community, the vast majority, I'm not suggesting our taxes are too low, they're too high.
Increased last thing I want to say the assembly health committee, which I chair, is going to be having public hearings in august on on the covet epidemic and its effect on nursing homes and adult homes and home care, and on our hospitals.
Thank you very much, mr chair, and I want to follow up 51st street to talk to john mandel.
I want to say thank you to board 4 and board 5, because you had wonderful hearings on this topic is really important because it's like the center of our city in many ways.
420 000 new yorkers have left so those are hard to chase and for those of us who are here, we need to fill out the census, I'm not going to say more, except if you want us to come with an ipad and you have a group of people.
Now it's gone in terms of pickup with an nyu group and others there's a whole year-long study on organics, and hopefully you can bring it back so community board members or the public is interested in working with us.
4 has an amazing history of understanding, affordable, housing, perhaps more than any other board, and so we're going to try one more time to list at least for the bar of manhattan.
I want to just say in terms of black lives matter, there's lots of discuss, but we did do a mural that I was part of on foley square center street between reed and and if you have a chance to see it, it's really gorgeous department of cultural affairs worked with us.
These are schools that are more less traditional and they said you know if a child hasn't learned in the past and temporary housing is overcrowded and wants to come in five days a week.
So I know it's not the number one issue, but if we can figure out open space for these schools, you have a lot in district.
I think everybody gets it, but if there are people who are listening, who don't just know, it's really a fabulous newsletter.
If you know the ulip timetable is now going to be opening up again with the city, planning, commission and again we'll be working together on all those many issues.
So many of the issues with homelessness with mental health there's in our community we've got the issue with the hotels that I'll talk about in a minute, but there's the closure of the subways and the libraries and other places that street homeless people spend their time.
So we're really being forced to see in right in front of our eyes a lot of problems that were there for a long time and we've always struggled with these issues during the summer.
So we have to work on getting these providers in line and then de-densifying these neighborhoods, where there's too many on one block, we had a meeting today on 36 with brian weber, who lives on the block and christine bertay who lives a couple blocks away and the owners of tovola and all the operators of these hotels, and it was very clear to us who was doing a good job and who wasn't so.
One of the major issues with this ban was that it was depriving refugees and lawful permanent residents from the right council upon being detained in american airports, and I know that jerry actually went to jfk to see the chaos firsthand and to understand really what it looked like.
It's a chance to speak to your elected officials and ask them questions and kind of hear some of the stuff that they're working on two other quick things.
The second thing is on opening schools going into the fall, which I think some of the work we're doing dovetails well with the letter the committee for tonight.
So we'll, let you all know as soon as we hear more about the mayor's plan, I would appreciate any feedback you all have about how that's going to get rolled out over the next coming weeks and months.
We as frequent attendees of this meeting, know we rotate the elected officials again letting them speak on alternate months, but I do want to recognize that maya burlo from senator brad hoyleman's office is here eric overton from assembly member linda rosenthal's office is here.
So we reconvene the hudson yards construction task force with the support of the mayor's community affairs unit and speaker johnson's office, and we had got dob and dep to agree on a set of construction hours across for all the major developers in all hudson yards, including manhattan, west, and those from my understanding.
As already mentioned previously, the district office has been responding to a very high number of complaints related to the increase in the temporary hotel, hotel, homeless, shelters and continues to advocate, with for the department of homeless services, to lead a monthly service meeting with all providers and community stakeholders until the temporary health shelters are closed.
The district office is also receiving a high number of complaints about homeless encampments and is working with department of homeless services and other stakeholders, such as the port authority, to hope to resolve some of these encampments, and I just want to highlight this is this- is something that I find particularly concerning, which is the result of the nypd no longer involving themselves in homeless issues.
Sorry so, regarding the our office, space, we'll be happy to know, we are, was we're all still working remotely, but our office equipment and files have been moved to our new district office.
I've got a lot tonight, but I'm going to start, as many of you know.
As we announced back at the june meeting, we formed a social justice working group that group met every tuesday in june and july and have drafted both a letter to the mayor and a number of recommendations which we will be dealing with in the business session.
I want to thank katie, stokes and veren again for co-chairing that working group most effectively.
There are a lot of things in those recommendations that we are going to pursue going further, one of which may be keeping that working group intact to address public safety issues going forward.
Thank you to bert and the various committee chairs that make up that working group, chelsea land use and transportation held a joint committee meeting and, as I mentioned earlier, provided testimony yesterday regarding the empire station complex eis, there was a letter about that for the business session.
I want to thank blake actually because without blake, probably this letter wouldn't be half as good as what it was anyway.
Obviously what the experts recommended we touched upon that, but what parents and residents in our district going back to school were most concerned about, and we gave recommendations off both of the experts and what parents and educators told us one was which is a big deal for if everyone knows is, live remote learning and the desperate need for it.
So we know it's a moving target with that, but we would like a little more communication on what the options are and the fourth which luke also mentioned is one we haven't learned yet from the doe is to release a plan to parents and caregivers on what happens.
We also, you guys see, mentioned two particular vulnerable student populations and we stress the needs for them, and I think the tone of the letter is really we understand.
I had one thought: having talked to some parents, that there's great concern about parents who need to work and irregular scheduling in terms of you know, days of the week or hours or like kids go in the morning, but then they come back home in the afternoon or something like that, and whether or not that's a factor that you came across or not it's just the effect on the schedule for parents.
The same way we've been doing here, we're gonna, do it at the end, we're gonna people will call out if they want to vote against a certain letter.
So we're going to be attaching both of those letters to what we send to the sla any questions, any questions on the chipotle letters or anything other than item number six you want to okay, the spot.
I was also one of the people against and exactly for the same reason as frank, which is we have had a horrendous history and with these applicants where they have consistently misrepresented one part or another of their operation and or not executed what they were supposed to do, and you know whatever they are saying they are going to do at this point.
The second thing I want to point out is that generally I like to rely on the people who live right around an operation and our goal is to really make sure that those people coexist and cohabit with the operator in a good way and therefore, if the people right around the corner are not supportive, I would have a tendency to be to go with them.
In this case, we have a lot of confusion about the numbers, etc, but even if I take you know the 800 petition and compare it with the 3200 people at manhattan, plaza, who are representing by represented by their official board, I mean essentially tells me that 80 of the population in our district is not in favor of this operation being located at that location, and therefore I felt that it's we should deny it just a follow-up.
So, but, like I said, I don't want to get into the numbers this many that many we come up with our own decision from a whole wait a minute.
What you were saying I'll come back to you christine and jd, but I do not want to relitigate the commun the committee discussion here.
Neither do I and I just want to say that I think that track record from those first two places was horrible and if they only came in with those two places behind them, I would not have voted for this, but the last operation, the most the current operation, that ted is involved with rise, has had very little currently not saying when it started out.
All right, I'm going back to jd quickly, yeah quickly, always the nut of the situation is, if we vote against the letter of the stipulations, don't apply frank.
If there is such you know a ground swell of support to send a letter to the sla with a recommend, a straight denial, so we will be still be on record lowell.
Yes, I think the numbers are important, because if you have 100 people at manhattan plaza, you still have 3 200, which are represented by the block, as was the tenant association, and even if you have 800 number in the petition, you still have 3 200, so we're still like 80, not in favor.
We have written many letters or few letters where we have denied outright and then we went on to say if the sla felt that they really wanted to approve it, then we would appreciate the following stipulation, so it's not an either or we have already done that and that works all right, blake yeah.
I just wanted to reiterate what I said the last time about this applicant since I happen to live pretty close to the rise bar and do patronize that establishment of pheromone.
So I was wondering if you know there was any concern about things that were not followed as to what we had recommended last time, so you're asking if there have been complaints that, where they're not following the stipulations for ryze bar yeah, it's more of a question around.
There was also some unresolved issue about whether it was even properly zoned for commercial space, but the other path that we heard at that time was that a place like the spot with its method of operation was unsuitable for this block and would likely change the character of the block, and that is still true and those arguments were made with respect to the prior location and took up about half the letter we ultimately sent to the sla.
It seems like this was a bar space before going to be a bar space now yeah, but it's on the same block and I think the concerns.
This is the letter regarding the hotel, shelters, I'll jdlet you present and then, since we're going to fold this in with the hhhs letter I'll, let joe and maria add something if they need to sure can I be heard now a little better joe?
One of our main concerns was that these hotels do not become permanent homeless residents without a full discussion community board.
It's a bare bones letter because we figured everybody's going to add all kinds of things.
I just want to note that in combining these letters we need to update them because from the time we met to now, there have been additional homeless facilities open that we've not noted the letter, so we should list them as much as further as I spoke to jesse today, there's yet a new hotel on west 48th street that is now housing homeless, singles that was not disclosed to us at all.
It is unbelievable what is happening directly related to the shelters, being poorly managed and the degree of mentally ill chemically addicted singles that just cannot in our last meeting with dhs, which was last week right last thursday or something yes.
Would you like me to share about sorry the letter or just give my two cents, because I do have some two cents I'd like to add your two cents, please, my two cents is basically this that yes, this has been a very trying issue.
I want to make clear that we, as a committee and a community board, understand it's not a crime to be homeless.
We all know that it's a fact that most people who are homeless are not mentally ill, and we know that we have a moral obligation to help others and in fact, in this particular community we have several shelters and we have several buildings of supportive housing, so we're open to helping others.
The second point I wanted to mention is that dhs's position seems to be that this is all going to be temporary and trying to figure out the street homeless versus residents from the shelter I you know.
And the third point that I want to make is that this letter that we have number 23 is basically about density and safety from harassment and violence and, dare I say, common sense, there are some blocks in our community where they are inundated and overwhelmed and overburdened, and it's an untenable situation and in the letter there, brian webber actually emailed joe, and I some amendments and some friendly amendments which I would like to put into the letter am I getting.
Okay, so brian webber mentioned we need to fix the number there's a paragraph that says how many residents there are on 36 and 37th street.
The other amendment was fixing a sentence saying that we strongly urge dhs to rectify the issues towards the end of the letter, which I think was a great suggestion.
I know I went through that really quickly and I apologize basically, the letter is just saying that the solutions should be reduced density security and a safety plan for the nonprofit providers.
I have never seen this as such a degree and they're all new people, they're, not our street homeless whatsoever, all right, there's a board member who is not identified, who raised their hand some whoever that was.
I mean I've been living with this over saturated saturation for a very long time- and you know there is something called the homeless industrial complex and there are not to speak badly about nonprofits, but you know there are a lot of people making money off of the homeless, and you know I think that we need to take a holistic view.
The problems that you guys are facing is one of the offshoots that has, you know, been consistently happening here, at least in my neighborhood for a good eight years or so, unfortunately, I'm not surprised because we still continue to suffer from from these sort of social ills.
I'm gonna to the people who have their hand raised, I'm only looking for comments on the letter we've had these discussions multiple times at committee hearings in meetings with dhs, it's all been taken into an account, I'm looking for comments on the letter alone, not on the underlying problem.
Then I would just say you know, obviously as a board member, not only of the community board for but also of brc, that I thank people for acknowledging that they're really good providers out there doing their very best, but this is a really tricky situation thanks.
I would request that it be explicitly made clear- and I think the letters attempt this, but it just needs to be made explicitly clear that dhs is facing a mismanagement nightmare and there are too many times where we reference the pandemic and try to pit the homeless issue against the pandemic, as if they're separate and competing the bottom line is the pandemic is not an excuse for mismanagement and in fact a pandemic is when you need your best management, and we should be doing your very best job, and I just hope that that's explicitly made clear you are channeling me james.
At the same time, I think we also need to be clear that we are not a community.
I think it can be with both and all right thanks.
Okay, thank you paul all right.
Yes, there are four letters to the parks department requesting a replacement of the track at chelsea park, one to hudson river park, trust regarding the chelsea waterside park, redesign of which we're all very excited about, but provided some important critiques and comments, a letter to the city's economic development corporation and our elected officials regarding a lack of public space and a very dangerous situation around the manhattan cruise terminal access way, I'm including extending the invitation to them at our september wpe meeting and finally, a letter to nypd state dot and parks around on the hudson river greenway and the placement of the what sugar cubes and how they pose overdue danger, an overdue burden and danger on cyclists that need to be permanently addressed.
Could we also request a study on the possible changes or recommended safety concerns on the entrance crossways into the park where folks have to cross over the bikeway, sometimes having to scamper across there wait for a good period of time before someone actually stops, and I think some of the problems that occur on the bikeway is that some very nice and good bike riders do stop for the pedestrians, but then you've got people that just try to run right around them.
I would be happy to take it up at the next video and it sounds like a an issue that we actually want to really drill in on what we're looking for on those intersections, because it's not just about the people and folks using it.
all right hearing, none we're going to go to the joint transportation, chelsea land use letter regarding the empire station, complex eis, who's.
So, given these baseline adjustments and for the second portion of the letter, we then went through and identified 23 specific tasks for the study that need to reflect concerns from our community and those include traffic, pedestrian use, community facilities, business and residential displacement, open space, historic resources, water insurances and energy issues, amongst others, as well as questioning we also unquestion the underlying funding mechanisms for the entire development and then in the third step.
It took three weeks to get together than I think I could have imagined, and I want to point out like the this was a joint work team effort.
So if people have comments other than minor typos and want to talk about substantive issues, I think we're going to work on some master plan.
So, let's I don't know who wants to joe and then bert good job yep.
Anyway, I had to look up those sub districts they're, not because they're not on our board, but I remember that okay yeah all right.
Thank you joe thank you joe and we'll definitely accept that as friendly amendment all right, bert yeah, you got to do the mute thing too, bert, yep, sorry about that counting how many times I say that tonight I think it's a really good letter well thought through many of the perspectives are important that we're bringing to this.
Yes, the access to grand central is the idea that a lot of people which are going to penn station really want to go to grand central station and we are not suggesting how to do it.
Okay, thank you all for addressing that jd had a question now, I'm going to say it again and james says I see james and christine thank you good job, everybody, jeffrey and paul, and betty and christina my question was about madison square garden.
We don't want it moved over on top of moynihan station or wherever they're going to move it have any of those issues come up.
Okay, because I don't see that in the plan they didn't put that in there it's not in the letter, so their regulatory agreement always require vouchers, because by the way you are required now by law, you cannot refuse a section 8 tenant if you're rent stabilized they do it all the time right.
But the letter is addressed to the mayor and speaker johnson, asking for the creation of a commission that would include a representative from each community board to provide input to our elected leaders, about feedback concerns and suggestions and best practices about policing in our communities, and we think that it's really important that we have something at that larger level at the higher level and with our elected officials, so that it's not just about you know at each at the precinct level.
Our plan is also to circulate this to other community boards to encourage them to think about asking for the same thing to get on board about it, and then we also explain: we've added a paragraph in there sort of explaining the work that we did for the last seven or eight weeks yep.
Yes, so let me just get over to the recommendations on my computer, so the recommendation so the way our task force worked was that we invited everybody to just start, throwing out suggestions on any topic to advance this issue, and then we ended up with a really long list, and then we said okay, but let now we have to start thinking about you know what can we do in the short term and what can be most effective and we ended up sort of focusing in three areas.
Okay and then before you go on just to clarify it's not a task force, it's actually a working group yeah, that's true, and we are hoping that it will sort of translate into a more consistent working group or a task force or even a committee, and the second thing I just want to quickly point out is that, following what happened to george freud and the events of the sort of movement that sort of followed that occurrence, thank you all for actually suggesting formation of this group and for actually 20 other people from within the community board four to have come together and really get this going.
There, third, is to ask for more training for the nypd focused on de-escalation and implicit bias and, frankly, specifically for all officers, not just for new hires and number four under nypd is to contact the mayor and city council and request that a commission be formed with every community board.
You know to focus on community policing practices, and so that's the letter that was number 25.
all right, I'm going to take comments, but I want to preface it this way.
If you have specific comments on the recommendations that have come out of this working group, now is the time to raise them, but I don't want to relitigate everything here, I'm going to start with jeffrey.
I think this is an excellent start to something that I would support becoming a more I don't want to say permanent, but part of the board over x amount of time going forward.
I think the intention is, of course something we all want, but my feeling is this is a community board.
These are set of recommendations for the board that we're going to you know, vote on to see to take forward.
It come about through a number of sort of much longer list of recommendations, and just to your point, jd cb4 is not insulated from rest of the city and the folks come in and out of cb4 as well, and they also actually form part of the community yeah schools in the neighborhood where people come and some schools, students come and study.
The community board's voice with the rest of the city and that's what this working group is all about.
You were yes thank you for starting that, but I also just want to mention that some of these recommendations are definitely community focused based in cb4.
So there's a lot of focus that we're doing specifically related to cb4, while also branching out and trying to work with other community boards and seeing what other folks are doing in the city.
You know the community board has been offering like six or seven different kinds of trainings.
Please say: yes, all right we're going to here's.
Okay, so do you want to know the number for number six?
Please we have okay, so 11, plus 10 plus 5 is 26, knows all right.
Yes, is there a second on the motion back in all right, all those in favor say hi, wait what christine what I wanted to do an amendment on that letter.
Okay, just a suggestion, I think a lot of people were concerned about the four o'clock or whatever and whether we should you know change that end hour.
Okay, add item number 27, it's the new letter on number six and you have to enter that in your vote sheet with everything else, because we still need a written record.
Do we say the motion is to xyz and I say yes, so I think that's the part that people are asking all right letter 27 is a motion.
