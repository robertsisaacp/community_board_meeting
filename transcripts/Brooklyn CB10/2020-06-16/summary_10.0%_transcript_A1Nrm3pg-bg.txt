If you'd like to say a few words, do we have Justin, no okay, I think he wasn't elected on the roster to speak this evening that correct yes, also, senator Granada said he would be here.
If that's okay with everyone, so I'd like to move on to the public hearing, we have a review of a BSA special permit application.
You know enhancements to the fund, but overall the existing shell of the building looks like it'll stay.
You would like to you know: do it with the raise hand, feature because it's too hard for the administrators to follow the questions in the chat and answer everything?
Don't think she's here, okay, not here yet: okay, Steve, Harrison, hi, Thank, You Justin highest in favor of a job; okay, Jim, Johnson, she's, absent Habib.
Thank you comments that the zoning committee meeting was called to order.
Like me, where you know the leaders up top make big pronouncements, and then we have to kind of sort out what it means locally, but I do want to acknowledge that since we last met there were a bunch of protests in the neighborhood and they were all they were all very positive, and many of them were led by youth young people, which is very inspiring to see it's a shame that we have to put that peaceful qualifier before the word protest these days.
You know I think this moment calls for us all to dig deep and harness our compassion and our ability to listen to folks who have different experiences than we do and that's how we're gonna build a better city and a better nation.
This is continued in our city, so I appreciate I, appreciate everyone reaching out really just trying to do our best through this very combustible time, but appreciate seeing you guys and thanks for letting me come on and say, hello and I'll.
So as we progress, let's be sure that we, both as a community and as individuals, continue to do the right thing, and so what we're made of we continue to follow the laws and the executive orders for those reopening businesses trying to provide for their families.
We will return to something close to the old normal, but with a greater caring and respect for all, we will be working on extending the current right to continue to hold our meetings remotely, so we can ensure that we remain safe until it's possible, for all of us can even curse him again and I want to.
So first I want to thank Lori for your wonderful report and for your leadership this past year, as chair of the board, can't believe a whole year is gone by as well as officers who, on this evening.
So yes, as Laura said, you know, we are in a very challenging time in our city's history and together you know we will work and accomplish great things.
I want to give a shout out to the Arab American Association and our board member and co-founder Habib today, who invited me this month to help in the food distribution which was incredibly touching to see and really just incredible experience to be with so many good volunteers and meet and greet residents and our community, so grateful for the food distribution and services throughout our community I wanted to update everyone on some updates that were provided to the office over the months.
I wanted to also thank mark Moss for hosting us these past few months and truly helping us when we were thrust into the virtual meeting world.
Your training and assistance is very greatly appreciated and it looks like this is gonna, be our forum for some time the street activity permit office.
Many calls from local residents who are interested in having Street closures with social distancing as a way to just really, you know, get outside a little bit.
It's something that we're monitoring and working closely with the tbta and I certainly will keep you updated as we get announcements and if you haven't already and I'm speaking to new board members here to tonight, please, like us on social media.
We are up to two hundred cage likes we'd like to be up to two thousand by the fall, so hopefully in my next report, I can share that good word and we've gotten some valuable input from members of the communication committee.
So we're hoping that we can push this goal and our next general board meeting is going to take place on Monday, September, 15th at sure he'll, maybe, but most likely on I'm.
Okay, now we move on to the treasurer's report, which will be distributed with the minutes in the interest of time, so we're moving on to our police and Public Safety Committee report with our veloute Barbara.
You know this year at 7 p.m. on a zoom, and there was an application for a new liquor license for a weird wine beer and cider submitted for Luann's coffee bar Inc, located on the first floor of 7405 3rd Avenue.
Another resident participating in the zoom meeting stated that the noise, including loud music in karaoke, is unbearable well past 2 a.m. she also stated that the board is used to obstruct the view into the establishment from the outside.
In addition, she stated that you cannot see into the windows New York City Building inspectors attempted to gain access to the premises on February, 25th and 26th of this year.
The committee questioned her further regarding the repeated complaints, noise, promoted events, illegal use of alcohol and the need for police intervention.
To continually disrupt the quality of life of our community and to show blatant disregard to the essence of this family-oriented neighborhood in some in consideration of the fact that there is no certificate of occupancy for this building that we do not have photographs of what the actual establishment will look like, but the application submitted submission has not included the new york city building inspectors resolution to the construction without a permit.
Sorry, that's wrong for since September and the knowing illegal use of the establishment as a bar with the continued consumption and sale of alcohol without a license, including the need for 9-1-1 police intervention.
On several occasions the committee voted to deny this application and to send a letter to the New York State Liquor Authority.
Tracy Britain in favor, Jane capita, nachus in favor, Shirley, Qin, absent, I, believe, okay, Judy Collins, maybe we'll get back to Judy, maybe she's having trouble no audio okay, Chris Ellison in favor and Politico in favor, Carmen, Feliciano, I believe she's, absent, okay, Michael Festa, yes, Carmen I'm, sorry, Carmen be a muted Thank, You Diane Greene artists in favor, Steve goofus, he's absent, Judy, Grimaldi Judy's on but she's having trouble with her audio.
the district office reached out to the attorney numerous times beginning on March 9th 2020, stating that unless they complete the questionnaire and attend a hearing, a letter would be sent to deny this application.
They have never needed that there will be no smoking, and the applicant agrees that should it change its method of operation, it will give notice and meet with the community boarding committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change and the owner has agreed to all stipulations.
Maybe it'll move things a little more quickly, so Joe, okay, Tracy buttons in favor, shame capita Nagast, judy collins, you see a thumbs up either do melio favor, which a day Michael.
Therefore, the decided to delay this application and attend the CB 10 hearing at the police of Public Safety Committee in September, and that was just for informational purposes for you only since they were supposed to be part of that meeting.
2020 want okay, just because they were on the agenda as to items I'm just the committee met in quorum.
So because it's on the agendas to items I'll just do the review of the fiscal year 2020 budget, first, okay, so are there any questions?
It is important, so I would like to put the fiscal year 2020 budget on the floor, any other questions or comments.
My host muted me I'm in favor Thank You, Laurie Willis in favor, Michael, shade, okay for the budget, so that motion is on the floor.
During a meeting, we discussed ways that the committee can help support the work being done by the district office to keep these accounts active.
Even if you do not have personal social media accounts, you can still promote these pages by encouraging people you know to follow seed.
The committee will continue to work to support our social media efforts and look at other ways to promote the great work that we as a board to and that the community should be aware of.
So we don't need to vote I want to thank you for all of your efforts in getting and getting our Facebook page up, because it was something it was in a long time in the work so I.
I would like to thank the nominating committee by the way for their work and for their nomination and it's chaired by Judy Grimaldi, who are we still missing Judy?
Anyone, okay, Jude I would like everybody to know that she's with us, but she just has a faulty connection and can't do audio business.
If you've, you know followed on the police department's social media they do, is they really did a great job?
So maybe we can address that at some other point in time as new big thank you, everybody yeah become familiar with our neighborhood they've moved on exactly yes, that's some something and I want to speak about I jumped on this a little bit at the end of the last meeting when we were together, bob was driving along Fifth Avenue in the 80s Saturday night about 7:30, quite early still bright, light out, and at least two or three of the bars there had a like 20 people outside drinking having a party.
I mean before you know what you're gonna be getting calls three one as the summer continues of noise smoking people drinking in public?
Yeah I just want let Barbara no I mean right before there's no meeting say I did speak to the new commander, captain Tolson, who apologized for not being able to be here tonight, but he did say, he's doing outreach to all the SLA licensed establishments.
It doesn't have to be like you know it has to be an open dialogue constantly it shouldn't be that two years go and you're gone.
I think we need to have an open dialogue about how we can reform the police department within the community, and it doesn't have to be.
You know a comment on the policewomen I met with the new commander is a great guy to be changed every two years.
I missed in my report is that we learned that our former district manager of community boards had Mary sand pebbles passed away, so I just wanted to share that with board members, and we just really saddened to hear that news and if we get any more information about any memorials or remembrances I will be sure to share with the board about a month ago.
If you know this one, that's interested to my office into the Jill's point, this information, just as a point of information, not with any views on it, but the borough president last week proposed having community boards and community precinct councils they'd, be able to weigh in on the appointment of new police, captain's, never precinct as a way to empower and encourage community engagement on that front.
So we as a community board I support Jill, and we really have to either under the police of Public Safety, but we cannot not speak on this issue.
You know before we actually put it to a committee, but you know we're hearing, concern and so we'll work in that direction, so everyone 38 I, think we'd like to get moving on, even though this is our last meeting before I hate gonna, miss each other, but I would entertain a motion to adjourn.
