They were always asset and we're gonna keep on fighting for more and more and more economic assistance until we're out of this, you know the ultimately I think the pathway is a gradual opening of the economy alongside continuing to build our health care infrastructure, so we can allow for testing and contact tracing, while also making sure that people aren't going through economic distress, even more so than they already are now my office stands ready willing to assist anybody.
You know very concerned were seeing with some of the nursing homes in our area, huh in Bensonhurst, in Sheepshead, Bay, Brooklyn, really trying to elevate the attention that's being given to nursing homes and some of the stories we're hearing and seeing it it's frustrating because they call us whenever they need masks and then, when we call that's the question, it's like they forget who we are and I know.
My office is going hundreds of thousands of unemployment insurance issues with New York State's Department of Labor.
You know things like that, so, hopefully we can fill in some of the gaps that have been exposed in the unemployment safety net and then, lastly, I'm also working on legislation that is not ripe yet, but when we get through this, the big concerns going to be.
I want to wish all of you a happy Constitution day today, April 20th, 1777, New York State ratified its first constitution, so here's of New York state history of New York, just to echo what my colleagues that know by now I think we all know someone who is sick or someone who's died from the virus and it's awful there's no way to sugarcoat.
This meeting is doing the right thing and taking this the threat of this virus very seriously, and it's because of you because of me, the politicians or the doctors, it's because of you, the public, the people that we are turning the page and doing the right thing and hoping hopefully coming down the other side here, yeah I, think New Yorkers are famous for right.
You know a lot of people became essential, but they didn't right so they're out there every day, I think about them every single day towards getting out of this thing, there's a lot of people who are getting frustrated a lot of people who are getting tired of the social distancing measures, especially if you're feeling healthy and it's a nice day outside, but social distancing has, without a doubt prevented deaths.
It's good to see a lot of faces that I haven't seen in a long time like I, saw on the news today that the first case of the virus in New, York City, was 51 days ago.
Break-Ins commercial, storefront break-ins has become a big problem and the recent period you know, if you think, about Bay Bridge and like we probably have over a thousand commercial locations, the ones that are being targeted, the most are the ones that do not have the roll down gates so we're seeing a spike in these kind of crimes.
You know this is a very hard problem for the NYPD to combat, considering the fact that it's indoors in these buildings, one thing that we got a stress to people is in this day and age.
The first item is a renewal application for an enclosed sidewalk cafe at the kettle black, so darkness crews are chair for zoning and you will be reporting on this all right.
So it's the committee's recommendation to approve the renewal application for the sidewalk cafe.
Call the question: again: we have to do roll call vote, so okay, I mean so hold on everybody's, going to be unmuted.
The next item on the agenda is a new application to operate in close sidewalk cafe at one zero one, eight fourth Avenue for a Positano, okay, darn yep.
The motion was seconded before we proceed with any further discussion, and voting I would like to add some information that was not covered during the meeting, while the F conceded that he was now.
He says he was told that there was a change and he neglected to make that change on the application he was going to make it I just want you to know that bit of information.
It was during that time that the change in partnership with named okay I think we need to know who the ownership is before we go forward and I support.
Steve's suggestion for amendment and I think that should be a priority, an amendment that our approval is subject to changing the application to show the current ownership.
So now the motion is on the floor to amend the Committee's recommendation to include that the application would have to be amended to show the correct ownership.
Thank you very much and he's been plugging along while we were, you know, temporary, a mission Laurie, whoever Steven, X's and public hearing and now we're moving on to the chairs reports.
That really do mean a lot like reaching out to people we know and offering whatever support we can, even if the only support we can offer is emotional.
I just want to share that the district office is working remotely from home and we've been responding to residents concerns while we continue to receive routine service delivery calls this month we also heard from adults and seniors facing an unexpected need of delivered meal assistance, and we were delighted to be able to help connect those in need to services.
Who really was you know very helpful and stepping up as well as Bay Ridge cares and as well as the city of New York and the grab-and-go meals offered at the Department of Education several fights in the district, our emails, our e-newsletter, continued to grow in membership and has been a great way of communicating to residents.
Our Japanese fusion ink the premises located at seventy four zero, seven third Avenue: this is a new SLA application or a restaurant wine license.
It will give notice and meet with the community board committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change, and this applicant has agreed to all stipulations.
Yes, it is a new application for beard, tavern license for Rocco's Brooklyn bakery in business as pasta.
This is a new sa Li application for a beer tavern license for this establishment.
The applicant agrees that shouldn't change its method of operation it will give notice and meet with the community board and committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change.
The committee voted to deny the application and we request a motion to support the recommendation.
This is a renewal application for liquor, beer, wine and cider license for this establishment.
This blaze verbally told us that the hours of operation are Monday through Sunday 11 a.m. through 4:00 a.m. this new application did indicate that there was no license outdoor area.
Miss blaze stated that the front door is always closed, except when a person who was handicapped needs to enter the premise one committee member passed by the establishment on his way home from this meeting and took a picture of the garage door that was wide open.
This committee voted 6 to 1 to deny this SLA renewal license and therefore the committee requests a motion and approval from this board to accept this recommendation of denial.
The communication process takes a very long time and he, you know, they're not going to pull his license or take any action for that matter until those violations are adjudicated.
Everything takes a very long time to adjudicate and except for the SLA violation, the fact that he is using Rebeck yards, which are not part of his likeness premises.
So I'm gonna stand with the same exact thought process, as we did with one of the recent karaoke bars because of serious safety concerns for life and the city becomes reactive instead of proactive I want to make it loud and clear about our voice against this, because it's only a matter of time until something catastrophic happens and then we're gonna look back and the city is going to jump on there at that point, so you know again I'm in favor of the chair.
Doris I just wanted to let you know that we did notice for our department, sanitation violations were issued, Department of Buildings has issued violations and I believe a resident has made an additional complaint there as well, but we will, we will add the fire department 2018.
Because, if I have about five hands up, okay, Julie, yes, I was wondering I mean I have not encountered this before, and you know since I'm, one of the newer people on the board.
There were Department of Buildings violations which at past meetings you know members were very concerned about and what we could do is just again try to seek enforcement.
Well, we have many times actually just again, you know because the issue did come up again now with the renewal.
It's a question of how long it takes them to have the hearings to you know.
You know I, don't know that answer Julie I'll find out for you, because maybe we could get the Board of Health to close them down at this point was that this license came up for renewal, so it was not an initial incision and really those things are fairly pro forma with the SLA.
You know, get a board vote going on the renewal, but I do think that you know, including all of your comments and a response to the SLA, would be a good idea.
Would you like to call we're gonna call the question and the Committee's recommendation to disapprove this application, even though we know now that this was granted.
I would like to make an amendment offer an amendment for that motion that disapproval and I would also like to suggest that a letter go along with it to the SLA setting forth the things that we have documented that have gone on even since the committee's meeting Thank You Doris any more further I sent it in the chat I just asked if we could attach a petition to that letter.
We could put all the signs we want, but the people it's right, I agree with to Nick.
