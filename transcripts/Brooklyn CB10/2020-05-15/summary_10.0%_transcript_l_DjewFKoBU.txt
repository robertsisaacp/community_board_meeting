I can't remember section: 73-44 of new york city's zoning resolution to predict reduction of accessory parking for proposed building at 9201 6th avenue, also known for all of us as the kentucky fried chicken site, and I believe we have a presentation by the developer.
I have, I think, josie and I have the packet right, yeah, so todd I distributed all the materials you send to me to board members in advance, and I put some visual slides together for tonight and we'll see how those work mark has them he's going to share it now perfect, all right well between all of us, we'll get shared.
The zoning resolution and that allows a reduction in required parking for specific uses if you meet the criteria for the special permit, the uses must be either in use.
Therefore, no relief is required with respect to use the uses proposed are permitted as of right in this c23 district and as noted, it's currently developed with that seller in one story, eating and drinking establishment building the proposal calls for construction of a cellar and three-story mixed-use.
The second and third floor would be the community facility space, the medical offices, the total floor area proposed for this building is 19 958 square feet.
The special permit under section 7344 allows for a reduction in the required accessory parking spaces in this instance down to 25.
There is a section 3623 in the zoning resolution, which then allows any required amount of parking spaces that are 25 or less in a c23 district to be eliminated, so between the special permit and the waiver, the required parking spaces would be reduced to zero, but six are still proposed in conjunction with this development.
The last thing I will just say quickly is that at this time, because it's often asked there are no known specific tenants for the building, this is being built as a development project and they haven't even reached out to try and find any particular tenants, because we're still early in the process that noted it is expected that the tenants would be doctors who have medical practices in the area or professionals who are looking for office space in you know, in the neighborhood that said, I'm happy to answer any specific questions about the proposal or the findings or anything else that comes up stars before I open the discussion to the committee members and then other interest people I, since I don't live far from the site, I would- and I did one of the last times we met physically.
First of all, with the full requirement of 50 parking spaces and in the second scenario, with the special permit being granted, what form would the building take?
But if you were going to try first of all physically, I don't believe it would be possible to place 50 parking spots on that particular lot without creating some sort of you know: underground garage or seller config information for parking.
You know, inundated with a lot more either residents or building facilities coming and going in into this small little area that comes to comes to a head.
I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but I think if you keep putting parking spaces in that area with this development, with all the others that we will assume are going to happen in the future you're only inviting a lot more cars and a lot more traffic and it's going to get very congested over there and then you know.
I live in a block where there's not a lot of parking available and there are professional offices nearby and people feel it's a perfect right to park in front of a hydrant because they have a doctor's appointment and I think we are adding do not have a sufficient parking.
I think you know at this point this design was presented based on you know what is set forth in the zoning resolution with respect to the special permit, and you know the waivers that are permitted.
That said, I can go back to them and see if there were alternate designs that were suggested as far as increasing parking realistically based on the size of the site and the type of building.
That's proposed you're not going to get a situation where you would have 30 spaces, but it's something I can bring back to them, but I would also you know, bring up a point.
The second point is that, since there are no specific tenants that should this special permit be granted and the building is constructed as proposed, the property owner then, would be obligated.
You know they would be trying to find tenants based on what they've constructed and what they're, showing and a doctor or professional who wish to lease space in this building would need to assess the available parking at the building and in the area, and it logically follows that you're going to find doctors or professionals who are going to want to rent in the building who have practices where they don't believe that the parking situation in this neighborhood is going to cause them issues.
What- and I would just you know, pass that on, but with respect to the design I mean I can you know every time we come to a community board meeting.
You know we always like coming to community board meetings, because it's good for us to share our proposal, but also to get feedback.
You know from the community and we can pass it on to the property owner and, as I said at this point, this is the current design, but I can reach out to them and see.
If there were alternate, you know you know, plans or proposals that were considered say todd based on the current design.
I think that when todd talks about city planning's intent, there are two intents one is that the parking category respects that these selected uses generate less parking.
By putting that cut on 92nd versus fifth avenue noted I mean I can pass that again on, but that's the current design, I don't know you know just to confirm, I'm not sure if we had the plans that were available to share just to show where the parking was.
Probably I think that building, although much smaller than this has an open parking lot in the back.
I just confirmed that this type of special permit has been filed before you know and that's the current design that's proposed and obviously one that they're interested in, but I don't think that they're so intractable that they can't look at you know some possible solutions, so todd you're thinking that you're not going to have a scheduled date until september.
That's been set, and you know I my sense is: I don't want to speak for the bsa, but my sense is that they're trying to determine when it might be possible to have in public hearings again and that's why the calendar is a little bit on hold okay, so todd.
So if this special permit were to be granted by the bsa, there would be a condition which is actually written into the zoning resolution that would be required that the certificate of occupancy says that the uses must only be community facility use group, four medical offices or use group.
The second part of it, too, is that if somebody wanted to still maintain maintaining his professional offices or medical offices, you know consistent with the use, that's on the certificate of occupancy that if they wanted to make any physical changes to the building, it would then be required to go to the bsa to get an amendment to the special permit.
Did you discuss not just the six parking spaces, but the fact that there's going to be doctors offices, I don't know how many and that will have people looking for parking spaces at the same time, in other words, you're taking six spaces away generally going to be used by the doctors, but you haven't done anything to take care of the patients and the sales people and the other people that come into the building.
Those six parking spaces would most likely be assigned to the tenants as far as the patrons visiting and the parking requirements it's based, you know when they came up with these calculations.
If you look at an area that has a large number of doctors, I'm going to just say doctor's role anytime, I pass by there the fire hydrants have people parked on them.
Have we figured out yet what's going into the the other building across the street and when that's proposed- and you know what kind of traffic we can expect there I mean this is a.
If I can, I mean you know, I, you know kind of telling what michael said earlier I think parking is.
So parking is never ideal, but I think I, in this space, I'd rather commercial facility doing this type of community.
So the parking situation's not ideal, but you know I would be okay with voting in favor of something like this rather than what could be a worse alternative brian.
So what I'd like to ask todd to do is if there's any way that he can find to somehow restrict the drop-offs that are going to occur in a medical facility, and I think that's what we have to think about very carefully, because I agree with you I'd much rather see people taking the subway I'd.
But I think we have to you know also understand that there's a consequence to that when we still have cars that are really out there and that are making turns on that corner and right across the street, from the school etc.
Maybe you know give us a response to that, because I think it's going to be a real consideration, particularly if, with the other building going in whatever it is, you're gonna, you're gonna wind up again, because they'll probably try to cut back on the parking too and you're gonna in the drop-offs, and they were just gonna be insane.
Perhaps there is a combination of you know some of the parking spaces and some of the first floor area to create like a little u-turn, lane that allows for a drop-off that perhaps could relieve some congestion on either 92nd or 5th.
You said that the zoning requires 50 parking spaces and you're asking for six.
You know realistic, we're not going to be in hearing before august of september and if you want to schedule another, you know committee meeting, be it via teleconference or in person a little bit later.
I just didn't know if you were going to try and set like a specific date by which we had to get some information to you, but if you want to set another meeting in, I would say july.
