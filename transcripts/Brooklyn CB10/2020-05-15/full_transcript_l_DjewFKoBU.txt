The microphone does not work, it's going back, they had I, you know, I checked the walmart's site and they had a number of them. I just wanna select a different one. Not today. The camera part works great from the second I put it in, but the microphone just does not work. Did joe respond? No okay! I apologize my apologies for sending the wrong link life interesting first dorothy yeah. I know I must have gotten confused, but I thought I tried it. I'm sure I tried it. I don't know what I did wrong. Yes, we're still waiting on one. I think give me a second guys. I'm gonna go live okay to go ahead: okay, good evening, everyone! This is the may 14th meeting of the zoning and land use committee. It is our second virtual meeting- and I thank you all for being here- we're here- to discuss a bsa application. Number two: zero one, nine two, seven five b, two for special permit. So what person went to? I can't remember section: 73-44 of new york city's zoning resolution to predict reduction of accessory parking for proposed building at 9201 6th avenue, also known for all of us as the kentucky fried chicken site, and I believe we have a presentation by the developer. Yes, I'm the attorney for the property owner, todd dale from rothbruther inspector and we filed the application to the bsa, and if let me I can start, I can do a brief presentation. But to start, I'm not familiar with what materials you might have on hand. I don't know if copies of application materials were distributed electronically, not normally with these meetings, obviously were in different circumstances, but normally I would bring handouts or poster boards of key materials. So if you could just let me know what you have to start, if you don't have anything, maybe I can figure out something where I can do a shared screen for certain items. I have, I think, josie and I have the packet right, yeah, so todd I distributed all the materials you send to me to board members in advance, and I put some visual slides together for tonight and we'll see how those work mark has them he's going to share it now perfect, all right well between all of us, we'll get shared. What needs to be shared in case there's any confusion about plans or anything, but what I can do is I can give a brief overview of the application and then hopefully answer any questions that the committee might have so just to restate this is an application, for a special permit is section 7344. The zoning resolution and that allows a reduction in required parking for specific uses if you meet the criteria for the special permit, the uses must be either in use. Group four, which would be community facility, uses typically medical offices or uses in use group six that are within parking requirement, category b1. In short, what that translates to is medical offices and professional office space, okay, and just to give some background use. Group four's community facility will encompass all sorts of community facilities and use group. Six is sort of a catch-all use that includes office spaces, but retail and you know other common commercial uses. So this site, 9201 fifth avenue as noted, is the kentucky fried chicken site. It's at the southeast corner of fifth avenue and 92nd street. The lot itself is a square lot. Has ten thousand four hundred forty three excuse me: ten thousand four hundred forty three square feet: there's a approximately 116 feet: frontage on 92nd and 89.93 feet, frontage on fifth avenue, the majority of this site. It is a split zoning lot. The majority of the site 100 feet running from fifth avenue, is located in the c23 commercial district overlaid over an r6b zoning district. You can see there on that map that was put up there. You can see. The vast majority of the lot is in that c23 r6b district. The eastern portion of the lot is located in an r5b residential district. It would be the 16 feet easternmost lot to confirm. There's no proposal to develop that portion of the lot with any portion of this building the building will all be located within the commercial district. Therefore, no relief is required with respect to use the uses proposed are permitted as of right in this c23 district and as noted, it's currently developed with that seller in one story, eating and drinking establishment building the proposal calls for construction of a cellar and three-story mixed-use. Building the cellar and first floor would be commercial office space. It would also include mechanical space and an entrance lobby to get to the upper levels. The second and third floor would be the community facility space, the medical offices, the total floor area proposed for this building is 19 958 square feet. It meets all the bulk requirements of the zoning district, floor area, yards, etc. Now, the reason that relief is sought is that currently, six accessory parking spaces are proposed which are less than the 50. That would be required without the waiver and special permit. The special permit under section 7344 allows for a reduction in the required accessory parking spaces in this instance down to 25. what it really does. Is it- and it's shown right here- it allows for a reduction in the ratio of parking spaces. Currently what will be required without the relief is one per 400 square feet, and this special permit, if granted, would change it to one per 800 square feet all right in conjunction with the special permit. This waiver would knock it down to 25 parking spaces required. There is a section 3623 in the zoning resolution, which then allows any required amount of parking spaces that are 25 or less in a c23 district to be eliminated, so between the special permit and the waiver, the required parking spaces would be reduced to zero, but six are still proposed in conjunction with this development. Now the specific findings of the special permit are actually very limited. The first is, it needs to be in a district where it's allowed and in this instance it is the c23 zoning district it is allowed. The next portion of the special permit says that the uses must all be either use group six commercial uses that are in parking requirement category one or use group four uses their parking or category one. In this case, that is what is proposed, and then the last portion is that they must be contemplated in good faith and a condition must be noted on the certificate of occupancy and this property owner agrees to that condition. Should this special permit be granted by the bsa now just so, everybody knows that if the special permit were granted- and this were on the certificate of occupancy, this could not be a situation where the use could then change to retail stores or some other use that would be allowed in this district. Two-Fold there's two levels of protection: the first is the certificate of occupancy would have a specific condition on it. Limiting the uses to office space uses, but also anytime, a board of standard appeals grant is issued to a site, and there are specific approved plans if they needed to change those approved plans. It's required to go back to the bsa to get an amendment so in that instance, if that would include, if there were any sort of changes to the parking arrangement or an enlargement or change in the physical structure of the building, it would be required to go back to the bsa for an approval of that amendment special permit. The last thing I will just say quickly is that at this time, because it's often asked there are no known specific tenants for the building, this is being built as a development project and they haven't even reached out to try and find any particular tenants, because we're still early in the process that noted it is expected that the tenants would be doctors who have medical practices in the area or professionals who are looking for office space in you know, in the neighborhood that said, I'm happy to answer any specific questions about the proposal or the findings or anything else that comes up stars before I open the discussion to the committee members and then other interest people I, since I don't live far from the site, I would- and I did one of the last times we met physically. I asked everyone to check out the site and I would like to put my observations on the block of fifth avenue. Between 92nd and 1994. There are four driveways at least excluding the firehouse. There are three no standing zones. There is a bus stop on the southwest corner of 92nd street and fifth avenue, which is directly opposite location. There is a bus, stop on the northeast corner of 92nd street and fifth avenue in front of ps104 at that site. School buses pick up and drop off at the northeast corner of 92nd and 5th in the afternoon. Buses queue up early afternoon for 3m pickup and all of the bus stops all of the bus stop and I think the hybrid are used by school buses and the b-63 often has to just stop in the middle of the street. There is no parking on 92nd street from 4th avenue to gatlin place. 92Nd street from 4th ave from fort hamilton to fort 4th avenue is highly congested during the evening rush gridlocked and blocked intersections are common on 4th avenue. Between 94th and 92nd street, there was very limited parking because there are probably four between four and five driveways. So this is an area where there is very limited street market, and I would like you all to consider that, as we consider our discussion so now, I will open it up to discussion. We also have the bus that runs past there and the subway line two like two blocks away: correct. Yes, if this building is going to be offered to doctors and professionals, my experience with doctors in particular is they're not using public transportation to get to their office. They're driving and I think a lot of professional people do the same. So the proposal is no parking, which means even tenants that drive will not have a place to put their car. Maybe they should take the bus or the subway, though, instead of driving, I think I'd rather fight one battle at a time. We're not talking about behavior we're just talking about the existing reality. What would be the configuration of the building bulk and height wise if you were to comply? First of all, with the full requirement of 50 parking spaces and in the second scenario, with the special permit being granted, what form would the building take? This is todd, and I would just say at this point: we didn't provide any alternate design because that hasn't been contemplated. I'm not the architect, so I wouldn't want to misspeak about a design. But if you were going to try first of all physically, I don't believe it would be possible to place 50 parking spots on that particular lot without creating some sort of you know: underground garage or seller config information for parking. So I don't know I don't have an alternate design and it's not something. That's generally required for these types of special applications, but the best guess is. It would need to be some sort of combination of a raised building with first floor and a seller parking garage. That's my best guess anywhere else question mark. Can you unmute steve? I can't just let me find him hold on. No, I can't steve you have to do it. It's not letting me unmute you, which means you have you've, muted yourself, steve in your grid. That should be at the top and mute an unmute button in blue okay he's going to have to call back. He says it's frozen, it's not working I'll! Add something that you know. We obviously need to you know and dars. Thank you for that detailed analysis, and we also should take into consideration. Obviously, the other projects that we're potentially going to have to deal with once eulep reopens about either a hotel or you know, apartment building, that's going to be across the street and we've actually talked obviously talked about what you know. How ripe that area is. You know for redevelopment, so it's potentially in a small radius going to be. You know, inundated with a lot more either residents or building facilities coming and going in into this small little area that comes to comes to a head. There can, I say something: yes, yeah that hotel, if I recall that proposed hotel, they were not going to have any parking. Well, I'm going to say we need to look at this property on its own. It doesn't. That is our responsibility. We cannot look at proposals that might they have not. We have to look at this in its entirety alone. I disagree with that. I think we something's going to happen at that site, whether it's a hotel as a right or the residential facility. Something's going to happen there and I think, looking at the area as a whole- and you know I think we have to look at it all together. I agree: does anybody know the usage of the parking garages that are closer to 86? Aren't there two parking garages, I don't know if people use them or not. I do know that. I do know that the municipal garage is typically non-pandemic times at a hundred percent capacity, at least six of the seven days in a week, but I would just respond to that. Realistically. If I am going to a doctor's office appointment at 19th century and 5th avenue, I'm not going to go to 86th street and 4th avenue park, the closest option would be the harbor financial building which is directly across the street and has some parking. I don't know if they would, the developers would work at a pro something with them and I don't know how much available space there is. I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but I think if you keep putting parking spaces in that area with this development, with all the others that we will assume are going to happen in the future you're only inviting a lot more cars and a lot more traffic and it's going to get very congested over there and then you know. I know people don't like to take public transportation, but the fact of the matter is that when you do you have less cars in the road. If you put a bunch of parking spaces, it's going to attract a lot more people driving it's going to it's going to entice them. Well, I'm going to add a personal comment. I live in a block where there's not a lot of parking available and there are professional offices nearby and people feel it's a perfect right to park in front of a hydrant because they have a doctor's appointment and I think we are adding do not have a sufficient parking. We are adding congestion and circling in a very congested area and conceptually I agree with you, michael, but I'm looking at the reality. My concern with the parking is really not with people coming to the facility to partake of the people that are there. It's more that I just think. Doctors and professionals are not going to be taking public transportation to work so for them it might not be a bad idea to have parking. Anybody coming to the doctor should say anybody a lot of people coming to the doctors somebody drives, they drop them off. They come back when they're ready to be picked up again. But again my concern is with the people that will be occupying the any other facility todd. Would the developer we be amenable to increasing the number. I'm very sure I would say two things of this. I think you know at this point this design was presented based on you know what is set forth in the zoning resolution with respect to the special permit, and you know the waivers that are permitted. That said, I can go back to them and see if there were alternate designs that were suggested as far as increasing parking realistically based on the size of the site and the type of building. That's proposed you're not going to get a situation where you would have 30 spaces, but it's something I can bring back to them, but I would also you know, bring up a point. You know there's been discussion about doctors and you know typical use of the site. Two things. First of all, the special permit was established because, based on typical findings, they found that these parking recording excuse me parking requirement. Category uses that are in prc. One typically require less parking and generate less traffic, so it was something that was contemplated by the city planning commission and also when they established the zoning resolution. The second point is that, since there are no specific tenants that should this special permit be granted and the building is constructed as proposed, the property owner then, would be obligated. You know they would be trying to find tenants based on what they've constructed and what they're, showing and a doctor or professional who wish to lease space in this building would need to assess the available parking at the building and in the area, and it logically follows that you're going to find doctors or professionals who are going to want to rent in the building who have practices where they don't believe that the parking situation in this neighborhood is going to cause them issues. So I just you know I throw that out there and say that this is not a situation where, if there is a professional somewhere else in brooklyn, who knows that they need 40 parking spots for their business, this would not be an ideal site for them. You know, so it's just something to consider. You know, I understand, there's concerns about possible future parking, but the it's a situation as far as what leads. What- and I would just you know, pass that on, but with respect to the design I mean I can you know every time we come to a community board meeting. You know we always like coming to community board meetings, because it's good for us to share our proposal, but also to get feedback. You know from the community and we can pass it on to the property owner and, as I said at this point, this is the current design, but I can reach out to them and see. If there were alternate, you know you know, plans or proposals that were considered say todd based on the current design. Is there any number of prospective tenants that you know that you guys are thinking might occupy the building? At this point? It's really it's just. There hasn't been much investigation into any particular tenants at this point because we are early in the process just to confirm. So your community board knows this was filed at the board of standard appeals. But typically after it's re received, the staff will issue something called the notice of comments where they ask for revisions to certain materials. We did respond to that notice of comments at this point. There has not been a hearing scheduled before the board of standard appeals. You know, obviously, under current circumstances are limited. The physical office is closed. That said, they have been conducting remote hearings, but to this point those remote hearings have just been from manas that were already on the calendar or on the docket, so we don't have a hearing date assigned for this and because of that, you know realistically we're not likely to have a hearing date any time before august or september. So that's how far you know we are into the process. We really are at the start point of the process and it just hasn't made sense to move forward too much with any sort of tenant solicitation. Thank you. I think that when todd talks about city planning's intent, there are two intents one is that the parking category respects that these selected uses generate less parking. So that was one concept for city planning and the other concept was that when a project is a small project, little square footage less than 25 parking space is required. That's considered a small facility, so it's wave it's the double scoop of these two concepts that I don't think equal a generalized alignment with city planning's concept. It feels like that the numbers just and I have no problem with projects being beneficial to the developer, but it's a curious combination of two factors and to that point I would just say quickly understand the points that were made very clearly. There have been other. You know, applications that the bsa has granted in the past, where that special permit and the waiver both have been applied to projects just this is not the first project doing. It follows a history of other applications where this has been the case, but I would still add that this is a very unique location with very serious traffic conditions, and I think that must be considered. One question: do the six parking spaces all happen on the on the open air back end of the lot? They are. If you the lot from 92nd, they would be on the left side. So the easternmost portion of the lot there are a few that are located slightly under an overhang of the building and then then two that are there but they're all on that eastern portion. So they would be accessed from a curb cut on 92nd. It would be accessed from 92nd street. That's where the earthquake is no. There is also a curb cut on 5th avenue. You have to consider, I think every I'm everyone has to consider the volume of traffic on 92nd street. There are three bus strips that you use that it is the main axis from the 92nd street exit of the of the arizona bridge and to have ingress of egress on 92nd street. In my opinion, is not a good idea, let's put it bloodline, plus it's more narrow. It's a much narrower road you're talking! That's a hard turn on a bus on a busy street that people aren't necessarily paying attention to at that location or trying to rush to cast lights and make it up on the bridge, especially it's late, and you know, if there's a backup that that's a tough location, you're, probably gonna, be doing yourself a disservice. By putting that cut on 92nd versus fifth avenue noted I mean I can pass that again on, but that's the current design, I don't know you know just to confirm, I'm not sure if we had the plans that were available to share just to show where the parking was. Maybe I can share my screen. I don't know if that works, hello, oh there. It is which one do you want that the site plan I mean that shows the 92nd. I mean if you go back to that one so that yeah, I don't know if you have the site plan, but yeah that one right there. If you look at that the 92nd street elevation, that's when you face it, that's where the entrance would be. If you see right there right where the overhang is right. Above the number nine slightly to the left, so that would be the access talking about this yeah. So right there would be the entrance from 92nd and if you look at the key plan up in the very top corner, I know it's tough to see, but there's a rectangle there with a large rectangle and then a small rectangle that skinny portion right there. That's where the axis would be so it wouldn't be immediately at the corner of 92nd and 5th. It would be that's where the parking spaces would be located that are proposed will be about 100 feet into the block exactly and that's a street level parking. Yes, it's all at the ground level correct! It's not that different in feeling from the ent building, their bunch of eye, ear and throat, nose and throat doctors on is it 91st and 5th? Yes, a very similar building with kind of a similar foot traffic pattern. Probably I think that building, although much smaller than this has an open parking lot in the back. But it's just commentary: it's an open parking lot in the back that, I think, is mostly just for the doctors. In case I mean you know, I've heard the comments and I will definitely pass it on to you know the project architect and the development team, obviously we're still early in the bsa process. You know, I think the concerns have been made clear by this committee and I will pass them on, but you know just you know. I just confirmed that this type of special permit has been filed before you know and that's the current design that's proposed and obviously one that they're interested in, but I don't think that they're so intractable that they can't look at you know some possible solutions, so todd you're thinking that you're not going to have a scheduled date until september. I wish I knew you know. As I said, we found many applications of the bsa and just to give you some big picture, which you know this application fits into, is a piece you know. Currently the video hearings that they're doing are for matters that we're currently calendar to this point. Our office has not received any new dates signed for any applications that were pending this one for our particular office is perhaps one of the older ones. I think we filed this in february, I believe, was when it was initially filed. So if and when the bsa does start scheduling matters that have not been assigned dates, I would anticipate that this is one of the first currently so you know the bsa hearing calendar goes out, I believe, into the end of june. I think there's a few scheduled for july and at this point those hearings are all set as remote hearings, the teleconference hearings, there's really nothing late july or august. That's been set, and you know I my sense is: I don't want to speak for the bsa, but my sense is that they're trying to determine when it might be possible to have in public hearings again and that's why the calendar is a little bit on hold okay, so todd. Would you so then you're pretty much willing to go back to your client to bring back some of the feedback and return back to the board? I'm happy to talk to them and then you know provide some information. You know to them. As far as what was said. As I said, I don't know you know, since our office is very specific, with the special permit and the legal aspects of this. I don't know what the you know. History is as far as designs, but I can pass on that information back. Okay, so I guess I'll turn it over back to the committee. Then, if there is time if we want to consider that in our recommendation, oh did we lose doors no over here, oh okay, I didn't see you on my screen doors, I'm sorry it was running. I was keeping my mouth shut for a while any other comments from the committee. Are we contemplating for the developer to come back to us again before we vote on this? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, because it's very slow, I'm having a problem with my computer. Apparently I just wanted to know about the building and forgive me if I asked something when I was off okay, what happens if this building fails? What can it become? So if this special permit were to be granted by the bsa, there would be a condition which is actually written into the zoning resolution that would be required that the certificate of occupancy says that the uses must only be community facility use group, four medical offices or use group. Six parking requirement category. One offices which are professional offices, so that, if someone wanted to do something with the building, those would be the only uses that would be allowed. So it could not be a situation where two years down the road you could put a restaurant in or a drugstore or something along those lines. The second part of it, too, is that if somebody wanted to still maintain maintaining his professional offices or medical offices, you know consistent with the use, that's on the certificate of occupancy that if they wanted to make any physical changes to the building, it would then be required to go to the bsa to get an amendment to the special permit. That's granted because any approval of the bsa is associated with approved plans and approved plans say that you know, must substantially comply and form to those plans, and if you want to change it, the bsa has the writing responsibility to review those changes. If I can follow up on that again, forgive me if I was off what happens? Did you discuss not just the six parking spaces, but the fact that there's going to be doctors offices, I don't know how many and that will have people looking for parking spaces at the same time, in other words, you're taking six spaces away generally going to be used by the doctors, but you haven't done anything to take care of the patients and the sales people and the other people that come into the building. Is that considered? Is that going to be considered by the bsa in making this determination, because when you say that this is comparable to surrounding uses, that's comparable to the current surrounding uses, it's not comparable to what the surrounding uses will be. Once you have your building there with respect to parking requirements when you're dealing with offices and the zoning resolution sets forth those parking requirements, those requirements are set forth in a consideration both for employees and also patrons or visitors to offices. So you are correct that those six spaces would most likely again there's no definitive tenants, but, based on my past experience would build into this type. Those six parking spaces would most likely be assigned to the tenants as far as the patrons visiting and the parking requirements it's based, you know when they came up with these calculations. Zoning resolution includes both sides of the coin, so there's other doctors, offices that have similar situations where patrons visit and take public transportation or find alternate parking in the neighborhood, and I will comment that there is no other place for them to park. There is very limited parking in this area. Is there a enlargement potential beyond with this project? Let me take one check just one. Second, let me take a look here. Let me take a look at the zoning analysis just to consider. I don't think that there really is. Let's take a look not very much the floor area ratio. That's allowed in this zoning district for the use that's proposed is 2.0. This building as designed is at 1.91 thanks very much. If you look at an area that has a large number of doctors, I'm going to just say doctor's role anytime, I pass by there the fire hydrants have people parked on them. There's people double parked, almost all the time, not a lot, but just from the doctors that are there. It's obvious that you know there's some parking that would be required if we wanted to eliminate that double parking. This is in reference to doctor's role. Did you know that that's basically 75th street from 5th to 6th noted? Yes, I live in brooklyn, but I'm a little bit north of that. So not as familiar see. Anne's got her hand out. Can you tell us approximately what percentage of the building footprint at the first floor is dedicated to that under overhang parking versus how much usable interior space at the first floor? Yeah? Let me take a look here: let's take a look here so the first floor and where I'm going with this thought is, if we're going to start to be wishing there were more parking spaces, I'm wondering how viable the first floor plan becomes. They've got an elevator they've got exit stairs. The first floor has approximately 7 400 gross square feet. It does include an entrance lobby and mechanical space, but the rest is for proposed commercial space. To put that in perspective, upper buildings are like the top floor. The third floor is 8 200 square feet, so it is a little bit smaller, 10 443 square feet. Okay and the footprint is 7 000. approximately. Yes, that's the best actually closer to 6 800. Do we have the plans? I did send the plans, the original application. I believe that was it mark who was doing this. The screen sharing that you've got the floor, plans that are out there. I know I received them. I don't know if the full committee received- I'm not sure the small one okay. So that's the elevation of the sections in the building section, but you can see with the building section. That's the best way you can see how the second floor is the largest of the floors. The first floor does you know, there's a cantilever over there with the second floor, but then the third floor is a much smaller floor. Thank you. Have we figured out yet what's going into the the other building across the street and when that's proposed- and you know what kind of traffic we can expect there I mean this is a. I think this should be a big consideration at this particular corner, which is going to get wild yeah. I don't think we know yet, because I don't think we've had a chance to vote because I think they've, basically paused all the all the euler stuff, so they're still they're still in holding. So I mean it depends upon what we end up deciding right. If we decide to go ahead with the apartment building, it's one way, if not they're, going to build a hotel so either way there's going to be coming and going of you know people coming in and out of that location, I can confirm you lurkers on pause [Laughter]. We have a very large development across the street 9114 fifth avenue I can pass on again to the property. Again is, as I said, it's always good to have means, because we can share information back and forth and let them know you know obviously they're interested in their development, and you know, thought went into this design, but it's always good to take things into consideration and see if something can be done. Okay, I just want to add. If I can, I mean you know, I, you know kind of telling what michael said earlier I think parking is. This is always going to be an issue. There's never going to be enough. You know if we can start somewhere to move the culture into getting away from driving. I think should I think we have to consider that you know you know what what's the lesser of evils. You know is it commercial space? Is it? Would you rather than go euler processing and get housing and then you're talking about full-time people coming in and out of those locations? So I think we have to think about if we, if we come down hard on this, what could be the alternatives that they come back with and we'll? Could we end up being stuck with worse proposals than this, and it's not great thinking in what's the lesser of evils, but I think that's the that's the climate. What we're in we're not going to get everything perfect, so we have to think about what we're trading off for when we make our decisions and how it's going to be how it's going to affect and what the the chain reaction is going to be for future developments in these areas, whether they're going for special permits, whether they're going for europe changes and how the developers think and what we do and what we decide. You know the these applicants are going to are going to listen to and make tweaks. So parking is never ideal, but I think I, in this space, I'd rather commercial facility doing this type of community. You know locations rather than another apartment building, which I think we would definitely not want to approve or a hotel which we definitely would not want to approve. So the parking situation's not ideal, but you know I would be okay with voting in favor of something like this rather than what could be a worse alternative brian. I think I agree with you. In fact, I very much agree with you. The question I have here, though I mean because you're right all right, we I'd like to see people get away from parking, but, oddly enough, I'm not so much worried about the parking here I mean you put six spots there. I don't think it's going to hurt a lot if it's being used by the doctors and exclusively by the doctors. What I'm more concerned with talking is droppers right, because people come in and out there and what we're going to see is either they're going to drop them off in fifth avenue, which would be preferable or they're going to drop them off on 92nd street, which would be a disaster all right. So what I'd like to ask todd to do is if there's any way that he can find to somehow restrict the drop-offs that are going to occur in a medical facility, and I think that's what we have to think about very carefully, because I agree with you I'd much rather see people taking the subway I'd. Much rather see them taking bicycles, etc. But I think we have to you know also understand that there's a consequence to that when we still have cars that are really out there and that are making turns on that corner and right across the street, from the school etc. The congestion isn't going to come from those six spots. The congestion is going to come from the from the drop-offs and from and other uses in that area. That's all that's my concern and I would ask todd if he could. Maybe you know give us a response to that, because I think it's going to be a real consideration, particularly if, with the other building going in whatever it is, you're gonna, you're gonna wind up again, because they'll probably try to cut back on the parking too and you're gonna in the drop-offs, and they were just gonna be insane. Remember the school bosses come up around it. The whole thing is just really difficult from that point of view not from the sixth space appointment. I don't really oppose this particular request, but I'm saying that I it may be an opportunity for us to speak to the developers and make sure that they're fully conscious and aware of the of the major problems that I anticipate from from a different point of view. In other words, in a sense, the lack of the parking spaces. Okay for customers. Now, that's a good point. I will bring back again a point regarding the drop-off, especially if we're considering medical offices and possible alternatives at the lower level and perhaps converting some of the building floor area to a drop-off lane or some consideration. Because one thing to note is you know, I know parking's a concern. If this were to be approved, actually zero parking spaces would be required and six are provided. Perhaps there is a combination of you know some of the parking spaces and some of the first floor area to create like a little u-turn, lane that allows for a drop-off that perhaps could relieve some congestion on either 92nd or 5th. I will bring it back to the architect. You know I don't want to design on the fly, because that's not my side of the job, but I can come up with the ideas and let them work on the mechanics and see if there's an alternative. Thank you todd. Any other committee members. Do you have against me? I'm great. Would you like to add some comments? Frank yeah. I sure would I'm a professional driver. I spend all my time driving around the city. This is not going to be a carlos city because they haven't expanded mass transit, hardly at all, and what I've watched in the last 30 years is the amount of time I spend driving and parking has gone from less than 20 percent of my day to more than 50 percent of my day, the city's, not adding any parking spots on the street they're, removing them everywhere, and it's just it's just making a situation even worse. My building is a 1950 building with 86 co-op departments, there's only 24 parking spots in the garage. I waited 16 years for a parking spot at night. I look out the window. There's cars in the hydrant there's cars in the no parking zone. There's cars in the no standing zone. There just isn't enough parking and there isn't going to be for a long time, because the city just keeps removing parking which just makes the situation worse, and this is a really bad place for them to have less parking. Thank you frank. I would just like to go back earlier on todd. You said that the zoning requires 50 parking spaces and you're asking for six. That's an 88 reduction. I think there might be some room for negotiation or adaptation nope, and that goes into the collective information that I will bring back, but just to clarify 50 is what would be required without either the waiver. The special permit. The special permit portion allows for a reduction from the 50 down to 25, and then the 25 would be waived down to zero and six are provided where euro would be required. I understand all the factors I just want to make sure that the numbers are clear for everybody who is there for the community any additional discussion from understanding. What todd is saying is that sex is better than zero. One could say that I would never put words in your community word's mouth how's that, but yes, six could be considered better than zero. But again it's with these other alternatives, and you know I've heard concerns about the drop-off, and you know it. It's many factors that go into this and it's not just people drop-offs, but it's also deliveries and stuff depending upon what kind of tenants that you have right. So I mean again you're talking about. If the drop-offs tend to be around a certain time of day, if that you're talking about school, letting drop out next door if they end up going with the hotel route, you know you're talking about check-ins generally around two three o'clock in the afternoon, which is the same time as school drop. You know dismissal, so if you're doing delivery, dropo forget about just patrons coming in and out or users, that's going to be a big issue. So maybe your idea of the sort of the you know, an entryway and drop-off way might be beneficial, especially because you're not gonna, be able to do that on 92nd street and fifth avenue is gonna. Be tough, don't forget, you have the firehouse right there too, which could be problematic. Nope, and I understand- and I mean I live in brooklyn. I live near fifth avenue a little bit north of this site. I mean you know always up, but I understand everything that's being destroyed. Then I can pass that on. Thank you, but if there's any other questions about the plan, I'm happy to answer them. Other than that you know, I can bring this back, and you know I don't know what your community board might choose as far as adjourning and voting on this, but based on the current schedule. I think it would be. You know realistic, we're not going to be in hearing before august of september and if you want to schedule another, you know committee meeting, be it via teleconference or in person a little bit later. I don't know if your community board 10 takes a recess over the summer or not. We don't know what the schedule is. I don't even know if it's thursday anymore, you know, but I guess the short answer is you wanted to get a follow-up response? I can get a follow-up response and we can see whether that response is satisfactory or another meeting might happen before you do a full vote. I'm fine with that. I think it'd be great to get. Some personally would like to see that yeah. We personally like to see that that's fine, we're we we're agreeable to that and I'll just confirm it's not going to cause any bsa administrative delays. All right. So do we have consensus? I think that's a good point with that. Is there any kind of discussion? Would anyone like to make a question? Well, if we have a an agreement from todd, he has to go back, but I would move that we adjourn this to a further time to be determined by the chair and the district manager after receiving information from todd. Do we want to put a time frame on when we'd like to see the information come back to us? I think it should be before they make a an application. I will just say I can't I don't mean to interrupt with any procedural, but I can't provide at this time any guarantees as far as a time frame as far as information, because I'm not in contact currently with the europe he's not at this meeting at the property owners. I can make a commitment that will bring back this information them and ask them to review it and see if we can provide something you know either to just your community board or the community board and the bsa I just I wouldn't. I wouldn't want a hard submission date, because I don't want to commit to something. When I'm not the party who's going to be doing, it might be beneficial at the next meeting to have the architect present. I mean I don't particularly care either way, but it might help the conversation. I can ask okay todd, I'm not quite sure. I understand what you're saying, for example, what I'm saying is. It said if we said like september okay, because it's now may and then june, and we have kovid involved in the whole thing. Are you saying that, for example, if we said to you that we would do it in june or july, you can't commit to that now. No, I was, I was gonna, say another meeting, sure june or july. I just I was maybe I was mishearing. I just didn't know if you were going to try and set like a specific date by which we had to get some information to you, but if you want to set another meeting in, I would say july. That would be short. That would be great and I think it would fit with everybody's schedule. Then I would add that to my motion, okay, I would just say we don't normally meet in july, but is, if it as a committee, we would have to agree to be available for some kind of july meeting, whether it be in person or virtually. I think it seems to me that we can do it in july. Also I mean it's not much difference right. I just I'm just adding the normal scenario into it. As an optimist. Right I mean the issue with july is that we probably won't have a full general board meeting, but from what todd is describing it doesn't. Look it's going to be calendared by september. I would say yes- and I would say even august- would be fine for a follow-up meeting. Okay, realistically, I don't believe we'll have a hearing date before september, okay and how about we put it down for july or august after time, reports back to how's that perfect. Why don't we just say as soon as possible? Well, I think we need to quantify that not with any specific date, but a rage. I think july august is a good range, but not when available fine with me. We need a second for that I'll. Second, it could. I ask the motion being restated. Yes, I move that the and that the that the meeting be adjourned to july to a date in july or august, to determine to be determined after mr dale reports back to ms beckman on the availability of the developers and the architect [Applause] to a period depending upon the availability of the developer in the architects. Absolutely okay. We have a motion. We have a second, and now we have a vote jose. Are we doing a roll call yeah? We should all right circumstances. Yes, stephanie epstein, yes, steve harrison, hi, okay and abstain due to being close friends with tony cyan who's. The architect, you didn't take my vote. Oh I'm, sorry, I didn't see you there. Susan pulaski, yes, and I just want to recognize also on this call. As our chair, lori willis, always joined us hi, laurie. Okay, so thank you. Congratulations!
