The first is an application for a new liquor license for cider, which was submitted for Luann's coffee bar Inc, located on the first floor of 7405 third Avenue.
That may have been an era, since the music will outlast the designated hours of operation, the kitchen from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday, 8:00 a.m. to 2 a.m. music from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. the kitchen from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. you know, I'm just gonna pause for a moment, because I believe that the owners are present Josephine.
In addition, the application states that it acknowledges that the doors and windows need to be remain closed while the music is on and they need to follow the New, York, City noise regulations, photos of the interior were included and showed tables and chairs, which was stacked.
It is noted that a resident reported that the board was - was assumed to prevent anyone from looking into the establishment from the outside New York City building inspectors attempted to gain acts to the premises again: On February 25th and February 28th 2020.
There is adverse history for this premise: the New York City Open Data with three one phone calls from 2010 to the present.
Now that portion was from I just summarized the official police complaints which you could see some of it posted right now on the PowerPoint in some in consideration of the fact that there is no CFO for this building that we do not have photographs of what the actual establishment will look like that.
The application of submission has not included the New York City's building inspectors resolution to the construction without a permit from this February.
The disregard of the numerous 3-1-1 phone calls for the repeated complaints for noise for over a year and a half with no remedy and the knowing illegal use of a premise as a bar with the continued sale of alcohol.
Without a license, it leads me to have to bring this to the committee in serious consideration for us recommending this premise: louann's coffee bar to be approved for a liquor license so I open this up.
If he wants to comment first sure, absolutely captain we have to unmute captain what's going on, obviously running after their one of those was accurate, embellish, I didn't change anything because I will have to give a report to the official board at the official meeting, which will probably go over on channel 1 or whatever I.
Second, Maurice board was from September correct, yes, okay, but that's when these phone calls begin right after the noise Boyd was put up.
We are residents of the neighborhood they're, probably just like you are, and one of the things that we do is to make sure that every single business and business owner is a responsible person understands of the most and respects our neighbors, and so that we do nothing but quality of life.
You know person who has to run this meeting and I'm gonna leave this open to the rest of the committee.
I mean you sublet, the one person that gives you a problem, but now, but now you submerge the different people and you had problems with different people that doesn't help your situation here, because you have a very extensive business open if you want showing on you, they are gonna, have liquor and they are gonna have DJ music, which tends to get pretty loud and that could cause another problem here: notice that the DJ establishment very disruptive to nearby neighbors and community, it's okay.
May I asked the board what they would like to see a consideration that we do not have photographs of what the assemblage will look like that the application did not include the new york city building inspectors resolution for the construction without a permit phone calls for the repeated complaints for noise over a year and a half with.
No, whether or not it was sublet, the Garcias are responsible and stop in and knowing illegal use of a premise as a bar / light club, with the continued sales of alcohol with a license, and also that it was sublet to several different persons.
Thank you for coming and as part of the recommendation of this committee, this SLA lane license has been denied, so the Garcias, if they like their part of the meeting, is complete and they can sign out if they choose located 89 to third Avenue.
Only three one New York City open data, the community board office up until I believe this evening or this afternoon had not heard from the representative.
We just didn't want to submit it, and you know until we spoke to you guys and get the okay Matthew Bell I'm the contractor, and that would be working on this.
So I think that we'll be okay by the time that we, you know all of New York opens up.
Okay, you know like to see the floor plan and menu just to give it a once-over I think so we can without a doubt before Monday get that over to you guys for sure.
Okay, so on the record, I'm going to say that the Community Board denies the application to the SLA application to O'sullivan's Pub & grub.
