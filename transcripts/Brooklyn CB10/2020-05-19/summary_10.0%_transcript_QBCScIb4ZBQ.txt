and we start every meeting, as we always do with the pledge of allegiance, and this evening the honor of the pledge is going to go to nick nicholapolis, one of our longtime board members who will be leaving us.
As most of you know, he owns bay ridge, bakery which donates cookies to just about anyone who might want a cookie he's worked for.
I learned a lot about my community and the body about everyone here, and I also you know I was appointed by councilman gentilly and I continued on from councilman brennan, which I thanked for allowing me to continue this is it was really a pleasure and just my business, you know I opened another place in jersey and it's just getting a little tough.
Yes, second, thank you now to move on to the public session we're going to try going to attempt to limit each speaker to two minutes, just in the interest of keeping the zoom meeting short, and I would like to acknowledge senator andrew gonardis, who is here at our meeting.
First of all, I want to thank the community board and all you're doing and your dedication to continue the meetings as regularly scheduled, so we can discuss what's happening in the community and inform each other.
I want to first talk about how, during this time, many organizations, including you know, for example, not only your organization, but we saw organizations like bravo great community organizations that have stepped up, and I want to thank all of them for what they've done.
I was happy to work with them very closely and trying to get them supplies, but from you know whether it was lutheran whether it was manatees whether it was the va they all did their best, and I really feel that, as I'm sure all of you do that we owe them so much in terms of gratitude to thank them for what they've done during this difficult time.
So the first thing I wanted to say tonight was you know if you or if someone within your company or neighbor or friend, is still having trouble weeks later getting through to the dol system.
As I said, we've been able to help about 400 people so far and I think to understand the magnitude of what's been happening here.
You know in the vicinity in the area, and we want to prevent that from happening and get this information out to as many people as possible, and that number is 844 863 three one, four, eight four, eight six, three, nine three one four and the next phase and every day presents a new issue, a new problem.
On that I know, senator grenardis is also advocating for that to occur, and the last thing is, you know looking for ways that we can reopen our economy and get people back to work safely.
So I just want to start off by expressing my condolences to anyone here tonight who may have lost a family member, a loved one, a close friend, and I definitely want to take a moment just to remember all of the people here in bay ridge and southern brooklyn, who we lost, especially during the height of the pandemic.
I wanted to give people a really quick update, because I know that there are a lot of speakers tonight, but my office actually has been pretty busy from day one when everything was going on.
A lot of our seniors have not had access to food, so I just wanted people to know that we have been pretty busy signing up hundreds.
If anybody here has seniors who need to be signed up, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office, and I know I have some staff on this call.
Look for that information on my social media pages I'll, probably be in front of one of the supermarkets that has a lot of foot traffic and we'll be giving out hand sanitizers, be giving out masks and things of the sort we even got a really cool donation of, like I think, 500 or a thousand cell phone cases.
I hope that most of you here tonight know that my office is having a really important telephone town hall tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. For seniors, if you don't know, consider yourself notified and informed when I get off this zoom, I will make sure that josephine has the flyer and will ask if maybe the community board can share it on their page.
We're going to have people from the the new york city department for the aging, the new york city, food czar program, who's been coordinating all the meal deliveries, we'll have someone from hra and we're going to have a number of senior organizations in our district on the call talking about what they've been doing so from bay ridge.
I'm proud to have been there as a shoulder to lean on for the people of bay ridge, but I also want to give credit where credit is due and thank a lot of our non-profit organizations.
The union of arab women has been doing amazing work, delivering food to people at all hours of the night and there's also a group, the brooklyn immigrant support that has been raising a lot of money spending money out of their own pockets, delivering food to everybody, those in need which oftentimes includes immigrant families.
I got the news that my office in the last two weeks, we helped almost 350 people with their unemployment insurance claims.
No problems too big or too small for us we're helping folks every day, there's a lot of still a lot of grim news out there, but we do look like we're coming down the other side of the mountain and doing what we can here passed a bunch of good legislation last week to help our local small businesses doing everything we can to try to support them to make it through this tough time.
If you need me we're doing lots of mass giveaways in addition to whatever city hall is doing we're doing mass giveaways, wherever we can making sure our folks on the front line, still have masks and also we're getting our own public testing site starting the week of may 25th, which is next week, it's going to be at 85th and and fifth, which is the first, the ground floor of the municipal parking lot, and it's going to be coveted testing there.
The only way we're going to get ourselves out of this doing the best we can thinking forward about the summer figuring out, beaches and street fairs and that kind of stuff doesn't look like much of that is going to be happening, but we do need to think creatively, because, even though restlessness is not a metric, that the cdc follows, restlessness is a reality and you'll see more and more people out and about on the streets who are just fed up with this and they want to go outside.
I think we all know that we're kind of entering month three of this, this new reality, this new, normal and like justin, said we really need to start thinking about guidance for the next couple of months.
Two things I just want to highlight you know the need for food in our community is more dire than I ever thought.
So if you know someone who needs help with unemployment, let us know, let me know we're here to help navigate the system and the one thing I kind of want to put on the radar for the board, and I know what have a lot more conversation around.
Senator I'd like to now move over to the public hearing portion, and I invite doris cruz, the chair of our zoning and land use committee to present on the bsa special application, doris dorsey, might still be muted.
The committee met to discuss the bsa board of standard and appeals application, 2019 275 b7 for a building proposed at 9201 fifth avenue more easily recognized to us as the kentucky fried chicken site and the application is for a special permit.
In addition, on fifth avenue, on the east side, the closest area to the site between 92nd and 94th, there are four, maybe five driveways, thus limiting any parking on fourth avenue, then the application was open for discussion.
We have any questions, mark questions everybody's unmuted, okay, so we have a motion to adjourn the meeting and we will be discussing this further.
Okay, so I'll begin, a roll call vote and I will start with tracy britton in sabre jane, kappa tanakis in favor shirley chin in favor, judy collins in favor, doris cruz in favor, hi to the emilio in favor richard day, richard michael davis, favorite favor, yasmin, swedar and saludico in favor, carmen feliciano in favor, michael festa, in favor, barbara gurma in favor, diane grinardis in favor, steve griffith, absent, judy, grimaldi, steve harrison.
Zoning issues can be confusing arcane and if anyone has any questions, confused want more information feel free to reach out to me or to the district office, because it really helps to get the confusion clarified.
Okay and next we move on to the chairs report, I'd like to keep this brief so good evening and welcome to our may 2020 board meeting this month.
So if we all do the right thing, this too shall pass and thank you for staying the course and attending the meeting and everyone just stay safe and be well respectfully submitted.
The district office continues to work remotely on day-to-day issues, as well as preparing for committee meetings, you may have noticed our social media pages on facebook and instagram were launched this month.
The communications committee will be meeting and reporting to you next month, but in the interim, please make sure you like our pages.
We welcomed michael madden, rachel cramer chris yadoli, terry naruho, and chris cyret from the new york city parks, department and also present at the meeting was liam giordano from senator andrew gnardis's office.
Mike madden presented a report regarding the proposed shore road park dog run construction project.
following the board meeting a few questions from board members and the public were that were forwarded to the new york parks and we received the responses, and I will go through those now, since the parks department will be working on a drainage system.
Next question: is there a friends group that will be maintaining the dog run or will new york city parks provide regular maintenance?
There are, there were several of these children sandboxes in the robert moses era, original plans for showroad park, circa 1940 and several remain the one by zaverian, the narrows botanical guard, the botanic garden and which has been marvelously trans transformed into a koi pond, another around 82nd street, or so that has become an overgrown box of weeds, and I think that there's at least one more further south and this one be preserved, and this would be in the in the dog run area the sand pit.
Justin hyatt made a motion to write a letter to the new york city parks department in support of the design as presented.
Okay, thank you diane, so the committee did not meet in quora and all members dependents agreed with the recommendation.
Oh okay, doris, and I need a second, no, I'm not making a motion to support it.
I am making a motion that it not proceed until there is a friend's group department cannot do any maintenance in cannonball park where there are numerous broad benches okay.
Okay, madam chair, may I say something yes responsible, because I spoke today to chris mccrate, who is councilman brannan's chief of staff, and I spoke to him about the issue of the friends group and he does have a list of interested dog goers who attended the scoping meeting, who were interested in forming that friends group and we both committed to working with the group and the parks foundation to organize that friends.
I just want what they mentioned about the lighting that it's going to be open, 24 hours yeah.
You know what the operations of the dog okay.
They said, I think the maintenance, the maintenance gates, were going to be locked and only opened, for you know, parks, department, crews, those big large gates and those were the double gates, but the other, the other entrances would for pedestrians.
The only can I interrupt for a second yeah sure mark, please, if you like to speak, there is a raised hand function on zoom.
Can you please mute yourselves, use your mute feature and then unmute yourself when you're going to speak, okay go ahead, diane, maybe we can hear it now?
Is that the only thing that they are said that it would be putting in the area besides the benches ex been, and that would be the only structure, yeah, okay, any other questions again use your raised hand feature your zoom feature to raise a hand and then mark will be able to see who's willing wanting to speak.
Well, I was, I actually have to say, I'm very familiar with that with you know the park and walking a dog there at night, and I was very happy to hear that it will be well lit, because the area right now is very dark.
I also want to add sorry other dog run, that is on the other side of the by 68th street, that side of the hut.
I think a lot of the questions about hours of operation and all can be addressed when the parks committee joins with the councilman's office to work on forming a friends group as we have with other dog, runs in the district, and I think it is important to have a friend's group.
I do think we can resolve a lot of those issues at you know at that juncture, but tonight we're really tasked with reviewing the design and endorsing the design for the parks departments.
I just wanted to give a final comment of like I'm really excited to see so much attention being paid to the southern part of shore road park lately, especially with the new ramp just north of this, and now a dog run, it shouldn't increase and attract more people to use this part of the park.
So I'm really excited, I know at least 10 friends who live down in the 90s and the hundreds that want to walk their dog over here.
I think that being indicated that that's something that would be worked out with the friends committee and with the parks department so right now, the only thing they're asking us about is the design you know as to the hours of operation.
Okay, that on stella's recommendation we're going to call the question so all in favor of the committee's recommendation with the friendly amendment as suggested hi.
I think we're going to have to do a roll call because the raised hand isn't working and then, in the interest of time, I'd like to do a roll call.
Yes, sorry, I have my up so just because it's ramadan I'm going to go early, but I just want to let everyone know.
Thank you very much staff, and it was emailed to all board members saying if anyone was interested in nominating someone or self-nominate for the position of officer that they had to, let us know by may 5th, and we received no additional nominations.
So I'd like to thank all the members of the nominating committee for serving and that the at the june meeting this slate will be offered unopposed.
Is this all business or new business just because I called them both go ahead, doris you have to mute okay, the nominating committee just for clarification and they said they met in july.
Thank you, okay, brian hi, I know in some parts of the city, they've been doing open streets.
The footprint of where people can go when that when it's nicer well, I think that in our district we have- I mean, as you know, being part of the city.
So I don't think, there's been any proposal in our district or having you know the open streets, but that doesn't mean that they're there aren't considerations for that.
People from other neighborhoods are going to start coming to our area, so it's not just our neighbors but neighboring neighbors, and I think it could be a situation where we wanted to have not having a lot of places to go.
That's my first question and I want to second what dan said I mean walking along third avenue.
Okay, yeah, sorry, I don't know the name host from bay ridge.
