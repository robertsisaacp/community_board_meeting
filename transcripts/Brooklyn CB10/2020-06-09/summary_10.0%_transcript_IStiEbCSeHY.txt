Okay, thank you all for joining us tonight, zoning committee reading forum to discuss BSA application for 437 88th Street to allow a physical culture establishment gym at the site, which is not permitted under the zoning, and we will have a presentation through quick presentation of the issues that you send us in the application sure and if there's any questions about any of those materials, we can stop and I can answer it so anyway, good evening Tadeo for the applicant again, this is a special permit.
They are essentially going to add two stories to the building and convert what is a basement floor into an actual first floor, so seller and Floor Store we'll be right now in his cellar and two above-ground stories, the one level is a basement because of a portion of it is slightly will upgrade.
The proposed PCE would be located on portions of the cellar first and second floor of this enlarged building.
This will not because this is a typical commercial use that would be suitable for this district, and the next is that the proposed facility needs to offer one of a few specified uses.
They could convert this name joining passive rain commercial space, which would be in this case and the seller level like retail storage or office, or something as loud or they wanted to have another PCE operator, move in, let's say, like I, don't know, take your choice, your sports buggy, or something like that.
Typically, they give you a year, I, don't know if they're gonna go 18 months because of the current circumstance, I mean slow down, but it will be a requirement of a grant that certificate for this particular use.
Are you in a district where it's a lot is the proposed use going to disturb?
