You know like in March we made that great strives with I think the city up ban plastic bags, that was gonna start in March.
chairman, nothing to report I have a meeting scheduled, but I just want to say thank you to all the board members who have been out an active I know.
There's a lot of mutual aid supports happening right now, so I just want to say thank you to everyone, who's been active and just to encourage everyone to continue to you know, reach out and to you know, check on your neighbors and see you know.
Yes, I'll sell them to you whether you got the sex I, don't want to hold this off yeah sure and then the other announcement I have, as you know, I'm vice-chair of the cab, the Community Advisory Board for flushing meadows-corona Park we're having our meeting Wednesday May 27th at 7 p.m. I, encourage you all to join that as you're probably aware.
Another thing we're doing is the buddy system pretty much with Ashley was talking about the insists that we reach out to our neighbors and have our neighbors reach out to neighbors families and friends, and as she stated, many people are very proud, don't want to say anything, don't even say that they have food I've been suggesting that they go to Catalina cruise and all these others not to be shy about it or proud about it.
We don't look like officers, so we found that that's a great bridge in which to help our community I reached out to the firehouse 280, not Ladder, Company 138.
James work along the Roosevelt Avenue number, seven line, because they also look for places near stores that are known, so they can pack their belongings, and especially a Broadway is the biggest one so they're going to work on a something like a mate asked for it to see if they can get after that, I don't know when that's gonna be implemented, though, but they are working on it.
Alexa went off okay, so just as Christians that in the last month's board meeting, we have officially canceled the Youth fair because of everything that's going on.
I know you guys have been on for a while thank you, Chris Thank, You Lou again, and thank you to all the board members for the wonderful work that you are all doing, especially during these tough times.
You know the numbers that have come out yesterday in the zip codes of seeing the most deaths in the city of New York, one three, six, eight one, three, six, nine they're all in our communities right here.
We know that this is a working-class community, a lot of undocumented immigrants here, small business owners that are suffering here.
Well, we get to you know, stay here in quarantine and they're, the ones that are Manning the cash registers and stocking the aisles in our supermarkets so that we can get the food we need to keep going.
They would alleviate a lot of the pain that families were going through, especially here in this community there's a program through HRA that provides burial assistance.
It goes after the third-party apps like GrubHub. So if you have your, you know smartphone, and you want to order your food through this app.
We have seen the need to expand that myself and the speaker announced 25 million dollars in emergency food relief to all of our pantries to the city and that's 25 million that is going to come directly to our communities.
It provides them with non-perishable that one box itself has enough food for three days and we are continuing to do that throughout we're going to be doing several things.
What we're seeing now is a lot of scams that are happening phone calls that are coming in to people to seniors telling them you know they have.
A lot of people are suffering from either being at home for all this time or the pressures of being out of work not being able to pay the rent food scarcities.
So it's really important that we provide the service and we can put up the numbers and give it a Christian to distribute people want to talk to professionals.
We want to protect our community and when people decide that they wanted to face our neighborhood, we're gonna go right out there and we're going to take it down and demonstrate it.
We're not going to take that I think it's really important that people know that we are going to continue to fight to maintain our community safe and free from that kind of Filth that we see there so with that chair.
Thank you, a Christian, the other call of it yeah, okay, so right now sorry, I wasn't I was muted again, so Assemblywoman cruises has returned and she has headphones now.
So we come here right now and we also have James Monday Lu. So who was also unable to speak earlier from the controllers office, he'd like to make really quick about.
After that we have a some people in Cruz, unmuted them a little bit better than before, Christian yeah, very clear goal: cookies, fantastic, alright, some hope, I'm hoping everybody's holding up well I'll, try to keep it short and sweet, because I know it's a little bit late in the evening I this week, so Christian.
If our office to let Alex know we're happy to see, we can get you some extra masks or anything like that.
We give out three masks two per person as well to make sure that people have what they need and we at the same time I'm not forgetting that our job is also to legislate, and we've proposed several pieces of legislation that we're hope are going to address the needs of our community during it's very difficult.
We have to partner with amazing folks I want to give a shout out to the hundred and tenth priests in who has been fantastic for everything we needed from them, from responding to emergencies, to crowd control, to actually donating to our office food that they're able to collect from their own members from other places from other presents at least twice a week to come and bring us baby products as well as food.
Our office does remain open and will remain open as long as we're able to find tiny partners who help us provide people with the food that they need.
What we do is not only do we deliver while any of the city services kicks in it, but we help expedite a connection for them to receive whether it's meals, a wheels or one of the other programs to make sure that everyone gets what they eat and we've been working really closely with the parents in the community to ensure that the DOA is providing everyone with the distance learning requirements, whether it's a computer, elective whatever it is, that they need we've been working with them, hasn't the easiest, but you know we're making sure that everybody can get that and I think that's about it.
We were open even before the schools were open to give out food and we're going to continue to be open as long as people need us, and so thank you and let us know if there's anything, we can do for you, your loved ones, and if there's anyone who is either indeed who's, either watching this or from the board, who has lost a loved one.
Yes, sir okay, so I got four things I'm going to put all of them into the chat and I guess Christian you or someone else who's.
We also I also want to announce I'll put the link in now, so you can start sending it second thing: we have a newsletter from the comptroller's office that just came out on the 18th.
So if you know anyone who may have worked on a project like this, you can go to our website.
We just our office just issued a special report on election day operations of the New York City Board of Elections, and the findings were not ideal.
If you guys will know we receive a stipend from this account that allowed us to do several things for the community.
