Okay, what who is this last-minute surge of things that came from where, from everywhere, I'm being you Lou? Your meeting is public right now, I mean so we you know we have. We have somebody. We have one main one which is from the CCRB citizen complaint and they look like they believe they may already be in the meeting right now as we speak, but I can read that during murder, right now, I'm just more focused I'm trying to get them eating slowly to determine I. Don't I, don't see my video but I guess you can hear me okay, one minute at a time so far you can hear- and let me try to mute myself. My neighbors are all clapping and making the noise at 7-under. You will be muted in the next minute or so I trust, except for the chair before you mute me. I finally got an opportunity to read the minutes and I, don't know if you're gonna have a when we go, I guess get there, but there's I was at the last meeting and it doesn't happen in the minutes. Doesn't include me okay. Well, you add the public hearing, though, or the regular meeting, which one I'm sorry you guys need something. Yes, I did Sangha were you hearing and the meeting or just a meeting. I was right, but were you at the public hearing? We had two meetings, we had a public hearing and then we had the regular meeting. Oh yes, I came the meetings. I came about, hmm yeah I. Think the public hearing was first right, so you wanted the end of the public hearing. I. Think I read one or two speakers all right, so you don't qualify for the public hearing. You only qualify as being attended the meeting so look and see if you were listed as there the meeting then I didn't realize there was two agenda two minutes here. We go. Ah, oh I see public hearing and then okay, it does list me down. Oh no, it lists doesn't list me public, hearing, attendants you and there that you're not considered there that if you don't get there on time, but I was at the board meeting the board me: okay, alright, so I'm gonna have to meet. You now meets under Christian I, can't hear you everything's, okay, stop the meeting. I will call it to order and I don't know, should I sing persons report. Okay, that gets very interesting. Let's just do something here during my report. I have some things that I have to read. So let me get to those items. Okay item number one: this is from Andrew sokoloff Diaz. He says I am writing this statement to call on cb4 or any individual member joining here today for resolution declaring the cb4 area a disaster zone to cook on all. You can't hear me: okay, I lost track now, okay, see before it to be declared a disaster zone to call on all levels of government and the business community to immediately bring in and coordinate assessable permanent food sites across Corona and Elmhurst. We know that, prior to the kovat 19 pandemic crisis, the corona community experienced one of the highest rates of obesity, malnutrition. There is other negative effects as a result of systematic neglect and disinvestment. Now that we are in the midst of this crisis and sadly like both Corona 1 3, 6 8 and OMERS 1 3 7 3 within the CB for this week, are literally the pandemic epic center of the entire planet. Where are the additional permanent food, pantries and distribution sites going to be brought in to our community when it'll be brought into our community a typo in the apartment? This okay, based on the food, help New York City and the map included in his statement here, the entire portion of Corona and areas of homeless have no food, pantries or sites. These are the densest and most affected areas with covered 19. We cannot wait any longer and we are late to respond to our neighbors and quite literally, starving and dying as we well know. Thank you for thank you to all the members of see before for all your work. It is great to see much more cb4 member members attending, especially during these times be well. Okay, that's one of the statements I'm finished I will go on to the next statement. Wait sorry, I have a quick question yeah. What is the question that statement that you read?

Okay, that one's done click no, the next one, looking at if I, just jump in for like half a second, can you just chest your family, your badges, much better! Thank you! Oh yeah, forget where I am don't worry about it. This one's from the borough president am I, gonna, be reading this or what okay, so I'm receiving word. That Joe is having some technical difficulty entering. So, if you can just read it, that'd be that'd, be great or you if you want, if you want, which you can do, is just like continue with the adapter and the elected official portion, maybe Joe might be able to log in since then that's entirely up to you, but he is willing to we just read as having okay, actually I just received word that Joe is in and we can make my Pamela. So there's no need for you to read the statement just yet and again. What's the camera? Look? Okay, all right! So now we would like to conduct a moment of silence for a board member that passed during this pandemic: Priscilla Carol and obviously any other friends or family members of board members, and that might have also passed away. We want to have a moment of silence. Thank you. Okay. Let's continue thanks for joining in, we are working from home because being closer to myself the staff and necessary. We are to an extent conducting our committee meetings per speaker and other processes there later time and I were legalized, as many of you will know later on, we did not pouring during the Public Safety Committee meeting that their committee does have a pretty Stern policy in that interest. Iran has any kind of violations and they do not attend because beacon items. That is not the case this time. Instead, we will be doing, is any liquor licenses, so this whole third thing and we will only inform the State Liquor Authority of the status on the license. Excuse me of any violations that we have been may aware of, but we will not be taking any formal votes so I'm letting you like it. We are working at least limited capacity. The main thing that we are doing, above all us is the spread of misinformation right, something that's happening. A lot, I finish that I have for everybody. Is the news will come to you? Stop spreading, stop going on the internet, looking for solutions and cures. If it exists, it will come to you or spend your entire time it's by the interpreters out there and that's one of the main functions that we've been handling as the board is trying to streamline as much as the misinformation. That's out there using our Facebook pages that are associated. As you know, we get all information from the city, different Beach fingers, office, elected officials, organizations to answer Andrews I'll, just touch it very briefly. Yes, inspector is the one thing we don't have in. Everybody will know that see before we have been I myself have been doing it, I'm working with some of our while the idea of putting ourselves in a church and get taken on the huge good idea. It really is, but it also puts a huge strain on the facility itself. In fact, if they have to before in there, we do have several it's just a matter of space speak on this evening, but that's the main thing: if we can get space that we would be pulling, we can do monetarily. Sadly, the City Council stipend every see early in the year remember it was for spending money throughout the community. One of the big provisions is that we are not allowed to use it for food, so as much as we would love that. Thank you have cd4 responses right, Goods and candles. We won't be able to monetary purchase. I've also considered, maybe opening the office to create potentially evidence of the truth is the office. Logistical is just very small opening with very limited space, and it would not be a very effective patch- is something better than nothing. Of course we're not quite there. You have reached that point. Yes, I. Think later on me will have somebody from the parks department from the parks committee speak I, don't think we do have. It is the main concern that we see around the community is, of course, we know the weather. It's getting nice as to whether it's getting nicer people are very quick, the guards down and we having a lot of situations, we're getting crowded, and this speak to the NYPD unless one in the ABS creevy say that they are not at the point really going to be it we're seeing just yes, we are in the information of state right now, vehicles be stationed near parks, the discourage followers, or rather encourage partners to use social distancing. The most part is just that it is a car there just to town to deter the visitors. Traditionally, the parks is on our social sports, such as soccer -, soccer nets, soccer structures ffvp as well as net and again guys. I feel, like you know this: okay, I guess this is the start of the open session that we are supposed to do. Alphabetically based on board members who we know are on now, Lu really quickly. One thing I do want to say is: I do have several board members to be very clear board members who have called in via phone.

We know that there are a lot of people during this time that just need access to information to resources and if we can just be even that link to point you in the right direction or get you to the right office, that's important to us. The congresswoman started actively working with state and city officials to help Elmer's hospital. When this all began, the congresswoman distributed, masks, gloves hand, sanitizer and really other important PPE. That could be helpful, telomers hospital, but not just the hospital, also nursing homes, that a lot of people are seeing on the news pop up now: police, precincts, community-based organizations etc, and she will continue to help and fight for everyone, especially to get money from the federal government to help our essential workers.

Here we are pushing for recurring payments so that we aren't just getting a one-time $1,200 check for a lot of our families, but that can be more than one time it can be recurring. So these are you know some of the fights that were having on the federal level on the local level, though we have been, we haven't been waiting on the federal government to add more aid, we've been doing a lot of direct assistance and so I'm pleased to report that our office has been able to organize about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to local food, pantries and relief organizations in Queens and the most heavily impacted neighborhoods in the Bronx. So we have over a quarter million to local food. Pantries I personally have been going out and once a week and we've been delivering meals in Corona, Throgs, Neck and other areas throughout the district. However, our office and again any issue that anybody has with any federal agencies. In this time our office is happy to kind of intervene and see what we can do.

The next person up as New York's from New York State Assembly Michael den Becker, nothing. Yes, we are or breathe nothing. No, we don't see any magic ovaries office hold on just bear with me. Let's look at the list really quickly. Is anybody here from Barry's office? No, we know anybody from our very catalytic. We look for the list. No! Nobody here from Cruz's office, okay, the New York State, Senate Michel Dolores Ramos, actually hold on. We have somebody from speaking on behalf of thousands a day we are Monday to Saturday from 12:30 3:30 until food runs out, try to get there a little bit early because allied goes literally all the way around located, 40 140 Boulevard and we're taking donations for diapers and masks. If anybody cares to donate them again directly to the office 4140 junction Boulevard in Corona, def Thursday will be hosting their first or a second townhome on housing. We're gonna be this complete for the next month, if you're subscribed to our blast or social media, we'll be posting all the announcements there. If anybody you're, not you need their house called the office acting seniors, particularly occasionally will sometimes Catalina has done it herself. We have volunteers, who've, been doing donation or doing drop boxes and, lastly, we just introduced barrier act which increases the amount of money. It's allowed for low-income individuals to receive public assistance. We feel to be really loved ones. This will, if it gets passed in both the Senate and Assembly. It will also apply to a document in Bend which we there are no public resources available to you undocumented community. That is all okay. Thank! Let's move on to Michael generis Jessica Ramos. We've already done that yeah moving on Toby answer whiskey, anyone from service no sir yeah, we can city mayor's office, Jessica Przewalski's yeah hold on. She isn't just give us a second hold on okay. How can you hear me doesn't get your wrong? Thank you. I wanted to wish everyone a Ramadan Mubarak to those who are observing to highlight a few things. The mayor's been advocating for the federal government to provide New York City, with more testing supplies and stimulus funding. As we're approaching May 1st, the mayor has been advocating for the rent guidelines board to freeze rents for all regulated apartments, he's been vouching for tenants to be able to use security deposits to pay rent and he's been calling for the state to approve an extension of the eviction moratorium to 60 days beyond the crisis. We're currently operating with a crisis standard for PPE we've added thousands of personnel to help our public hospitals and work with the federal government to bring in military health care professionals continue to track indicators on hospital admissions. Read the percent of city residents, testing positive for the virus. We see these numbers are gradually and generally going down. So these are all good indications that we are far on the other end of this crisis, and now we can start thinking about how we can continue to practice social distancing as we lighten up restrictions, so public events have been cancelled through the end of June. Alternate-Side parking has been suspended for another two weeks until May 12th and especially as we start thinking about the summer, we're working with City Council to open 40 miles of open streets over the next month, possibly reaching up to a hundred miles of open streets in and around parks will be working with PB do t at sanitation and parks, and just lastly, I'd like to highlight that if anybody sees anybody violating social distancing to please help our enforcement teams by texting photos to three one, six, nine two or using the three one app Thank You Jessica, really quickly, just because which, for sake of keeping consistency over par surgeries, spunk and something that we're all curious about. Do we have any word. That's or the beaches will be reopening in focus. So right now the mayor has just said that we don't anticipate beaches to have their traditional opening on Memorial Day weekend, but we're open to seeing if, towards the end of the summer, there can be. There are a full opening of beaches to a traditional way or a more restricted version, and one last thing that this was in regards to Jessica. We've just had the cabinet a couple of days ago and again earlier, I had spoken on, be the enforcement of social distancing, but one thing that everybody can do in the meantime. It's a line that is directly linked to any complaint. Savages were not singing our parks and all you have to do is text, be one six, nine to attach any photos of any part that you see that have people that are not practicing it. That includes any kind of contact sport. So again, the number three one six point: I would imagine that standard text message do apply if you sent 25 cents per, but if you have a limited, we won't want to explain to and sent any photos, but whenever you're ready, we do have to us with more okay. The next person out is councilman. Francisco Moya give us a second thank you. Can you hear me some in your in me? Yes, we can hear you're good to go for it. I just wanna, everyone I, hope that you're all doing well in your families are doing well under the circumstances that were in you know. This was a very difficult moment for all of us, but especially you know. All of the board members. We lost one of our own Priscilla Carroll. She was a dear friend and someone I've known for over 20 years. She really gave her life to this community and to the board, and she will be sorely missed and I hope that we all keep her and her families in our prayers. She is someone who really meant a lot to a lot of us, so - Priscilla, we love you, we miss you and we will continue to do the great work that you were doing. Folks I just wanted to bring you some updates. We are operational. The office is still functioning. You can always reach out to us by phone or email. If you need to reach us, we are easily reached at District 21, Council nyc.gov. That goes directly to myself and my staff and my telephone number, seven one, eight six, five one 1917. We will be all those calls that come in. We answer them right away, but just a couple of things, as we know, Elmhurst was hit very hard. One of the things that I was able to do is work and got the largest private donation of Pease. It was a hundred thousand n95 masks that were delivered with the help of some good people that I know from Apollo Management. They came out and got us those masks. We were able to do that from her Hospital and over 50,000 hospital gowns that was given to them on that first wave that we saw, and it's really critical, that we had gotten them that at the forefront it was. It was something that was really work that needed to be done, but we also saw how this impacted our community, especially those that are on the front line and what has been now deemed essential workers. Those are the delivery folks, those are the men and women right now who are Manning the cash registers and stocking the aisles in our supermarkets. They were hurt really badly right now, and we need to make sure that we continue to support them in whatever ways possible. I have introduced the burial, Assistance Fund, which myself and speaker Cory Johnson, are pushing right now to ensure that anyone who has difficulty affording the possibility of bearing or cremating their loved ones, they would be able to get some financial assistance from the city right now, there's a program it is run by HRA, and that only gives you up to nine hundred dollars in burial assistance. Average cost for a cremation is three thousand eight hundred dollars. It's not nearly enough, and it also doesn't cover anyone who is undocumented and we've seen that right now in this area, seventy percent of the population that has been affected by kovat, 19 or Latinos, most of them are in the hospitality or service industry and they're. The ones that had to you know be out there. In this time, keeping really the city running they've been they've, been hurt by this burial assistance program that we're trying to fund would be so that people can bury their loved ones with dignity. If you've been watching the news- and you see the images of the mass burials in Hart island, it's heart-wrenching- it's what we see that in war-torn countries, not in New York, and this is why it's so important that we provide this assistance for those that need it. We also are doing a lot with the food pantries. The City Council right now has put in twenty five million dollars for emergency food that will be delivered to the pantries here in the city of New York, but especially in our district right now, and if anyone is in need of assistance with that I'm happy to talk to you guys, offline, Chris or Lou can follow me or reach out to me anytime. We will help if there's families- and you know that it need food- we can get them. Food delivered especially seniors. It's so critical right now that our senior population has the food that they need. We've seen it there's a large number of our seniors. They actually need emergency if it would help meaning that if they don't receive the food deliveries that day, they will not have food to eat, and it's at a high number here in this community. So we are. We are putting in that money now and making sure that this gets to our community ASAP small businesses they've been affected by this in a real way. We are now putting in a stimulus package that is going to help small business owners, especially those that have less than four employees, that they will be able to get support. I'm sorry, less than ten employees they'll be able to get loans from the city, no cost loan, so that this is a way for our businesses to come back and make sure that they are getting the support that they need. I've introduced a couple of bills that are gonna, be heard tomorrow at the City Council. It really goes to protect the small business owners because, right now, if you were ordering from seamless, GrubHub or any of the app delivery services, they are actually charging our local restaurants a 10% fee and right now, when you go on any one of these apps. If you look at the menu, that's from the actual company, it's not from the restaurant and if you make a phone call- and you don't put in an order- that company is still charging the restaurant a 10% fee, plus they charge them a phone fee, they can run up to nine dollars, for maybe a two-minute call, if not less so, we're putting in a lot of measures here to protect our small businesses and we're just going to continue to work with you and the community. I don't want to take any more of your time, but I just wanted to say thank you, Lou Thank, You Kris, and to all of you who are board members for keeping government work alive, making sure that we're taking care of the this community. You really are an example of how we're gonna keep going forward. So I want to thank you very much for all that. You do and thank you for the opportunity for having me here and to say hello.

So excuse me, do you hear me now, sir? We can hear you yeah I, usually say mangia loser, but I mean I. Guess it's really like mom can loot so like what people pronounce it different ways thanks for coming in man. Thank you. That's me so hello, everybody, it's it's good to be here, I'm glad to join in and a lot of updates from the comptroller's office. So I'll start with some of the bad news, because I know I've been getting a lot of questions about the impact of covin 19 on the city's economy, on the amount of money the city's going to be able to collect and on March 23rd. Our office issued a report. It was second report but an estimate of the amount of money that the city will lose because of Cova 19 because of uncollected taxes or basically, as the economy has slowed down so much the number. The estimate was that there'd be a loss as high as six billion dollars to the city, but based on fact that this endemic has continued and because the we don't know when we're gonna be able to stop the social distancing when will be safe to stop it and when the pause will end now, our office is estimating that it may be worse, but we don't have exact numbers. Everything is just so fluid. That's enough of the bad news now for some of the good news I'm going to give you a link for the Comptroller's small business and MWBE webinar series. So that's a series of webinars via zoom, in which small business owners can join in and get information about money that's available to them through the government, but also ways to get private funding. There are many people who didn't get the PPP money and they're trying to find other ways to make their business work, to pay their employees right to keep people on payroll and so on. So if you or anyone you know my benefit from that, please send them the link I'm gonna, put in the chat right now, which I think only the participant or the only the board. Members can see it sadly, but I'll put it in there and it has a focus on businesses that are owned by women and minorities. But if you don't fit either of those categories, there's still information that could be useful to you, but certain things will be specifically geared towards people that fit those categories. Additionally, Scott stringer himself. Our controller will be on a call tomorrow with the Queens Chamber of Commerce I'm, going to put that into the I'll. Put the link as well or maybe Christian seem to put one in as well a link for that web series. There I'm not webserie sorry that web meeting it's at 11:30 tomorrow, isn't the Queen's Chamber of Commerce there'll, be statements made and then there'll be live question and answers it's going to be focusing on the impact of small businesses, the impact that kovin 19 has had on small businesses within Queens and last thing, I'm going to say last link I'm going to give. You is a link to our koban 19 Resource Center, even though I work for the comptroller's office I actually believe what I'm about to tell you. It is the most comprehensive guide that I have seen for New York City. It has a lot of resources for tenants for landlords, for people who want cultural institutions to have virtual access. We have all sorts of resources in there. I really hope that everyone will be able to look at it. We've I will put it into the chat. Now. This is the Cova 19 Resource Center. So please send that around. It has a lot of very helpful information and, lastly, I'll just say that you know our office has been using our weight as much as possible to advocate for helping a lot of the frontline workers advocating for things like hazard, pay, making sure that there's enough PPE at the places that really need it the most and if you have any suggestions of anything our office should be advocate for please feel free to reach out to me. I'll also put my contact info into the chat there. So that's all, that's all I gotta say thank you so really quickly. James, let me just chime in so we'll do our best to share and we do that this meeting is being recorded. We don't know if the links I'm again is something we'll have to try, maybe into a purlin error. Maybe you can answer it. While the meeting is being recorded, we'll share it as best we can, and if the links are still clickable, then we share everything money. Will anybody from his office? This is that Zechariah boy from Tony moly he's on right now, Zechariah, hey. Can you hear me I'm not sure if this is going through? Yes, you're good, to go? Okay, great hi? Everybody? Thank you. So much for doing this really gives you something to look forward to throughout the month. Going to these meetings up being alone in my house in Astoria is kind of crazy I'm sure you all are feeling that so I just wanted to lift that up really quickly. Just a very quick I had sent a Christian a couple of resources from our office and I wanted to make sure Christian. You did get those correct, I wanted to make sure I cannot hear you. It seems like you're, muted I didn't receive it. I was looking way for you to make the announcement tonight from the board and that tomorrow first thing in the morning: your boss, this meeting is edible, Cheryl, okay, fantastic and that email just hurt everybody. That's here. It has our constituent services portal. It has contact information for myself and for our office. We are open, we are working and we have a decently large constituent services team. That's there to help you through anything that you might that you might need help with I'm. Also in that email is my contact information, which includes my cell phone number and my email. Two things I wanted to bring up really quickly and then I'll get out of your hair. The Public Advocate has been calling for additional testing sites, especially in light of all of the reports detailing the racial disparity during this crisis. I know that we all see that, and we feel that we've been actively calling on that for quite some time and I think we are slowly seeing some results as I get more information about those that are being announced or brought forward. I will make sure to send those out to community board for. Lastly, my phone number I'm just going to give it to everybody while I'm talking is six four six, three nine seven 34 35 I'm, also going to put in the chat just everybody has that okay I'm so glad to hear all of your voices. Thanks for having me. Thank you so much Zecharia appreciate it. Okay, Queens da Melinda Katz. She is your room getting here right now, hi I can't I cannot. Can you see me, we cannot see you, but we can certainly hear you. Alright, you think you you're disabled. My video is that purposeful err like I, don't look that bad, no I, don't think so! No you're! You should be good to go. You can't see. I'll start my video there we go so this is my house make this opportunity to just touch base with everyone. Make sure that you knew that the district attorney's office was running. We are working very hard every single day to make sure I Lewis to make sure that our court systems are running smoothly, we're doing all Ramon's by Skype and so that everyone is social distancing. We don't have people in the office unless they are essential to be in the office like intake and arraignments when people are getting I'm arrested, we're doing Appellate Division arguments by Skype I mean we're doing everything by videoconferencing at the same time. Just so, you know petitions for people to be released from Rikers Island. We released, you know almost a hundred people without any objection. Thirty on, like the first two days where we just said, you know, they've done five out of six of their sentence of months and there are Rikers. We think because of the kovita, because of all the health risks that they should be released. I will tell you, though, that I am balancing very carefully the danger to public and the danger to the inmates to make sure that you know we're doing the right thing for Queens in general, but there has been a very large push to see that we get people who are in danger people. You know there was a gentleman with one lung that we decided was definitely a health risk and made sure that we're in the process of removing him from Rikers and several others and several of these examples, but at the same time we're doing arraignments. We are making sure that people that are arrested are done or arraigned in a in a healthy and safe way. There are two issues I wanted to bring out tonight. Domestic violence numbers have gone down. That is counterintuitive to the fact that we are all social distancing in our home and we're sort of trapped in cell 14 I have done a PSA announcement on Twitter. So anybody who knows anything any of our members that know of people who have been victims of domestic violence who have reached out to your organization in the past. Remember that police are not doing home visits because of the quarantine orders you know, are the sheltering orders and that there is really no sort of physical check. So if you know, if someone who is at risk, please contact them, because we know that, even though the numbers have gone down, it's just not real, they can't be real. The Commissioner of Police has talked about it. I've talked about it and we want to make sure that people know there is a hotline at the domestic at the Queen's District Attorney's Office, that hotlines number is 722. Eight six, four one: zero I apologize I can't see myself on this phone, so I, don't know whether you only see my nose or my house, so the domestic violence hotline is seven one. Eight two eight six, four one: zero. When someone calls that number I decided that you know, since a lot of people know who I am, and hopefully they can trust the fact that you know they're going to call and life's not going to turn upside down on and they're gonna have more control than they might think. If they just call the city agency, the High Line will ask whether or not there's an emergency. They should call 9-1-1, but if they need social services that they want to talk to an assistant district attorney about domestic violence, if they want to see what options are available for them during the pandemic, they should really call the hotline and there will be someone answering 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So please know that number two were coming out with numbers tomorrow the suicides have doubled in this time. It is a tragic circumstance that people feel fearful feel fear. They feel like there's not a lot of people to talk to I am very blessed that I have my children to a shelter in with now many people have that, and not many people have that privilege. Some people are sheltering it alone. They find very few people to talk to the not having any human contact is an issue, and so we want to make sure that we're checking on our loved ones and our friends to make sure that they are feeling okay and that they're not feeling alone in this period of time. But I really wanted the opportunity to say hello and to make sure that all of you know I haven't, disappeared, I'm still around I'm still a resource I still appreciate. If you'd call me if you have any need from anything from me, I've always appreciated my relationship with the community board. I've always felt like it was home to me, especially for so please let us know if there's anything else that we can do, but the office is running, we're doing everything we can to make sure that Queen stays safe and always thank you. Thank you. Melinda much appreciated. Thank you, my phone I'm. Sorry, two, eight six, three hundred is my phone number at the office email address which goes right to my phone. Everyone is cats at Queen. Ca org goes right to my phone, so please use it same way. You always have thanks Lewis. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for everything, no really appreciate you coming in. Thank you so much good. Seeing all of you. Thank you. Okay, Christian, we'll move on the agenda now to the committee reports, recognize elected, wise. You've done right, no I, don't believe so. No we're good to go. No okay census committee. That person here she's no she's, not in she's, not a knight I, will tell you this much. Iii do have an email that I'll forward to the board. It's just one thing that they are very concerned about, as you can imagine specifically Corona I mean I feel like spammers and Corona, but Corona in particular. Is it being undercounted at a time like this? It's even more so nervous, and you should everybody should do it and if nothing else, now's the time to do it, because you are a lot of issues that we've had a lot of student initiatives. Obviously you know: okay, we're gonna, unmute Alex right now, Alex with us, we'll hold on we'll meet her I think I meet it you're good to go Alex one of the hardest hit areas economically and if you walk down a player on a junction, Boulevard you're, lucky thievery, one or two thirds all done I said Samaritan had just announced. There is a new fund that is coming out for small businesses that should be available. He should I'll drop the link into the chat and aware of our number ones, taking calls on numbered stories that were jacking up the prices, sanitizer and food and masks I'm, not sure if that has cited as much as many issues lately. Some of the other issues that I've heard these office is these jobs, Canton's, whatsapp, I, think it's $500 or so desperate to try to get a covert test. That they're starting to people are trying to take advantage of that on this and lawyers who have promised asylum they're not following through or they're misleading, giving false information- and there are also social service benefit programs that are not accurate. So if you have, if you hear of any scams in the community I guess you should be checked the attorney general's office or Christian. But do you take you feel calls you could call into the community board offices? So, if I'm a really quickly I'll just jump into some things, that I was saying yes inspect, my squelching is still happening. We did have a discussion with a rep from Consumer Affairs and price. Gouging is actually anything over ten percent on the retail price. If that's really nothing I mean any store beds, I mean just reach me all. Is there something for the p30? It's already a price, cutting its little girls or meanly. Whenever you see a store that has everything we tagged with brand new orange pricey tags, just give it a kiss go see. What's under it, I mean FMB when I get to the point. We want to do this to every single store, but if you find a store, that's a price gouging, anything more than ten percent, which is really nothing, and we do understand the saying that they're also getting gouged from the that's what they have to take up, but on a local level, we are allowed to use any makeup with ten percent of the regular price would be. We are allowed to call it in. We call three one and it's been, and you know Alex I, don't feel that this is released directly to consumer fairs, which finances are somewhat involved and I think this is all for Jamie's office. Don't think that I'm noticing a lot of people in corona are not getting their stimulus, checks and again it does not necessarily probably the issue is that if you have what apparently is happening? If you are one of the people who paid for your tax return via EFT and the money was handled by your before the money came to you paid it directly and you had the money withdrawn for your bank account by your accountant, your accountant is there as you're responsible for that money. That's why we're not receiving it first. It goes to your accountants account he takes his share. He or she takes out their share of whatever their fee was, and it's supposed to be transferred over to you and a lot of people are getting errors, their bank information and that's why your direct deposit is not linked to you directly. It's linked to your accountant when taking out his payment and then passed it on to you. So if you're paying in cash, you should be okay. However, you want to pay for it before your procedure. Types of learning receive your money today they should be bombarded right now, because it's in their hands and also get out there wait. Swimming people aren't getting the stimulus, checks and maybe James our species later on both line. If I'm correct on that- and maybe we can spread information, that, in fact, is what really happened. That's what I understood to be pushing on issue. Part of that problem is their accounts, set up temporary accounts during tax time. So many of those account closed, they're, not even accessible. We know and that's why we just found it out, because I'll tell you this much. Nobody in my family got it and when we finally figured out, why was it? Was it took a little bit of soul-searching and a lot of a question answer, but it turned out that if you did it that way and again I mean that just create even more issues. But of course we have, if you have any County, that's one of those open up mom-and-pop place that money is sitting somewhere in your accountants responsibilities, the whole something that we want to look into the beginner. If it's, that big of an issue gets into another situation correct, but let's just look into that, because I do feel a lot of people are doing a lot of people in order to avoid the fees right off. The bat just have their cousin shave it off the return when it comes, and unfortunately get direct at the end, so just by keeping your environmental on the line, but he's unable to speak because he's as just went as a standard attendee, but he is your but not right. Now, okay, let's move on health actually is about to be unmuted hold on Ashley there. You go good to go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you guys for working so hard to put this together. Just a few things just to piggyback off and some things that were already said. I don't know if this was mentioned, but you can report price gouging by calling three one and by staying overcharged, and that's just another yeah another avenue for you to. If you notice that happening in your community, you can call 3-1-1 report it that way. Also, if you guys aren't aware, HRA offices aren't closed, but they are still accepting applications. So I would encourage everyone to who feels that they're eligible, even if you worry that you're not eligible still apply, SNAP benefits cash assistance and even rental assistance. If you find yourself, you know in need of extra help or again, if you know anyone does need the help. Just go on access, HRA create an account and you can start an application and it's done completely online if they need any additional information from you can upload your documents online. You never have to set foot in an office and it's completely safe and confidential. So I, you know encourage everyone to use those services if they feel that they are, you know entitled to them, and I just want to thank councilman Moira for the donation of the PPE I'm sure we all know that was you know sorely needed. We've been in touch with our liaison at Elmer's, hospital and I. Think right now they mostly need cash donations. I guess question could speak some more to that. If anyone would like to make a donation, you can reach out to us and we'll connect you and that's all for right now, just encouraging everyone to please wear a face mask or some type of faith covering when you go out. If you don't have a mask scarf, anything will do just. Please continue to do your part so that we can continue to flatten the curve and that's all I have for tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Next, we have parks okay, good evening. Everyone most you know of the announcements. I have already been stated by Christian. You know, as far as social distancing in parks, it's a challenging thing, but it's something that really needs to be adhered to. The NYPD and pepp are you know, staying diligent as best they can on breaking up groups that are larger than ten. You can also call 3-1-1 and report that, so it's really, you know everyone's job to participate. If it's especially since right now, you know the we see that parks are the main way that people get access to fresh air and exercise in those things, but you know that all has changed and we hope with a lot of things that were mentioned tonight. You know with the various mayor initiatives and further things that are coming down. The pike that we're going to sort of you know alleviate that with closing out roads or whatever else is going to be happening. You know to stay sort of on top of this, my scent Christian a link and I'll, make sure he says it with all of you. There's a lot of webinars right now that I've been attending on how Park design is changing, and you know I will be the voice for the board as your parks, chair and the public in communicating how things need to be shifted. Very probably, you're, probably already aware that you know fitness, centers and films are changing the way they're designed. So we really need to sort of take that into account in how future parks are designed, so that we can address these issues, because we have a new normal that we are facing the other notes when I just wanted to make. As the vice chair of the cab, we are still meeting. That's the Community Advisory Board portion of flushing meadows-corona Park for those unfamiliar our next meeting is going to be via zoom. It's May 7th at 7 p.m. I'll, make sure that the link and all the information about that gets out so that anyone that wants to take an active role in flushing meadows-corona Park, which is seeing a lot of issues with social distancing so that we can work together to also find a solution in doing our part in that Park. Thank you. Thank you. Good Thank, You, Gregory transportation. This hold on will unmute lend in a second hi good evening. Just a quick update from the Transportation Committee. We received an update from d-o-t that they will have their contractors, staffing and weather permitting will be completing the bike. Lane markings in community board three and four this spring and we can share a map of where those markings will be completed at the end of this meeting as well and the bike the bike lane markings are for the conventional bike lanes and sharrows shadows being the shared bike lanes and one we don't have a committee meeting scheduled for May as of yet, but we do plan on working with the board office on following up with do regarding the resort, casinos bus, permit application that has been in the works now for several weeks and is likely delayed because of the situation we're in, but we have not forgotten and well we'll update everyone as soon as we have more information about that and that's all I have for now: Thank You Linda, Public, Safety and Homeland Security Jim, Public, Safety and Homeland Security yeah I'm here hold on sorry. Sir, can you hear me yeah so I was saying so Lucy is on the line, but she's unable to speak right now because it was unprecedent. We don't expect that she's having some tech issues so she's unable to dial in to give her a report all right so but I was still you know. A point on the left were those who were on you earlier normally just realize guys. What we're doing is there is no formulas vote to be taken tonight. Remember the SLA process pilot is still active. It's very difficult for us to a board to be able to vote on licenses and restaurant owners are shut down. We actually have a restaurateur dial in who was ill, who actually got hit with a virus. What we're doing is just we're just we're exercising our advisory role and that we are writing to the SLA with regards to any violations, your own complaints or SLA violations that were that were reported to us, and we are only informing the New York State Liquor Authority, that we are aware of these issues and will not be taking a vote because not only did Lucy I have a quorum, but we can't hold. What we can't do. Lou is for all the board members here. We will share that list with all of these. You see which prosper, discuss. That's part of tonight's meetings or minutes, but that's okay. You love! Second, will the mute halton right now? It's in you're unmuted you get to go you there, that's to be able to what's going on in community anything like this before in terms not what's taking place, so anything that was pending is still pending. So I would imagine at some point in time, maybe when he decides to maybe one application. You services you'll, see users actually no she's on the line, but again nothing to report. Very briefly, I could just say that you know wait Alexa. You have a lot of feedback. Christian, no updates from Alexa look I mean we discussed the use fair. That seems to be the main thing, but at this point considering the way things are it's all a little safe. It doesn't seem, it's gonna happen. Okay, let's move on pushing at this second session. I'm, not gonna, read all the names again. I do have one small investment I'd like to make, but it's from the citizens. Excuse me: the civilian complaint Review ports, but I can read that afterwards. So if you wanted yes, absolutely I would go based on the people that are here and meeting and just go from there. I can't see that so I mean we can try to go off. Medical I don't have enough, but I can listen from you right now. Look guys look we're gonna go in the corners, so the first person is Sir Christopher, but I'll go as slow as I can we're not going, though in any order, so right off the bat argh or dips thing or Rula first United sick.

Also, but if you, if somebody need anybody, is the food I'm trying to get rushing hospital if I call them up, we are trying to provide a food also fifty with every day.

You know with what's considered as real construction and, what's not I feel like that's really being exploited. So if everyone can just sort of stay vigilant- and you know take note of that, I know- we have little power in terms of you know changing you know mayoral and governor decisions, but I just so everyone's aware of what's happening. Thank you up. Next, you have the mic. Lucy Scully, you Cerezo, Scully! Excuse me: it's! Okay, I knew you really hit me on that Lucy, sir easels coming yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry, I was I was caught a little off guard the first time I had the mic. So yes, I did just want to say I'm grateful for all the work that people are doing to help support I, do work in the community and live in the community. My students are struggling and you know a lot of them. Are food insecure and we've been able to? Let them know all the different people who are you know giving out supplies and food and anything they might need, and that's all I could say really we just we did lose. A colleague unfortunately took all of it from my school, and so it's been a little bit crazy for us to scramble and get things done. But you know I am grateful that we are supporting each other through these times stay safe. Thank you! So much Lucy, thanks for all you're doing really so much. Thank you all right.

We have to acknowledge the community board members who are not with us as far as the viewing girls, but they are on the phone with us. I do know a couple of names, so, oddly enough we have a quorum. It's just as many people showed up to this meeting, as would have showed up to a regular meeting so kudos to us on that. That's amazing, you know, but we don't have happy. We came through big time.
