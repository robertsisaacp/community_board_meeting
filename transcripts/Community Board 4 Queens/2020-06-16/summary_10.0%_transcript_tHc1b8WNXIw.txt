We answer them right away, but just a couple of things, as we know, Elmhurst was hit very hard.
It was a hundred thousand n95 masks that were delivered with the help of some good people that I know from Apollo Management.
The City Council right now has put in twenty five million dollars for emergency food that will be delivered to the pantries here in the city of New York, but especially in our district right now, and if anyone is in need of assistance with that I'm happy to talk to you guys, offline, Chris or Lou can follow me or reach out to me anytime.
We will help if there's families- and you know that it need food- we can get them.
They actually need emergency if it would help meaning that if they don't receive the food deliveries that day, they will not have food to eat, and it's at a high number here in this community.
I'm sorry, less than ten employees they'll be able to get loans from the city, no cost loan, so that this is a way for our businesses to come back and make sure that they are getting the support that they need.
If you look at the menu, that's from the actual company, it's not from the restaurant and if you make a phone call- and you don't put in an order- that company is still charging the restaurant a 10% fee, plus they charge them a phone fee, they can run up to nine dollars, for maybe a two-minute call, if not less so, we're putting in a lot of measures here to protect our small businesses and we're just going to continue to work with you and the community.
I don't want to take any more of your time, but I just wanted to say thank you, Lou Thank, You Kris, and to all of you who are board members for keeping government work alive, making sure that we're taking care of the this community.

It will be each item that I mentioned a lot more detail worth a five-minute read all be safe, will be well Christian, Thank, You Lou. Thank you board members.
So I'll start with some of the bad news, because I know I've been getting a lot of questions about the impact of covin 19 on the city's economy, on the amount of money the city's going to be able to collect and on March 23rd.
The estimate was that there'd be a loss as high as six billion dollars to the city, but based on fact that this endemic has continued and because the we don't know when we're gonna be able to stop the social distancing when will be safe to stop it and when the pause will end now, our office is estimating that it may be worse, but we don't have exact numbers.
So if you or anyone you know my benefit from that, please send them the link I'm gonna, put in the chat right now, which I think only the participant or the only the board.
It has a lot of very helpful information and, lastly, I'll just say that you know our office has been using our weight as much as possible to advocate for helping a lot of the frontline workers advocating for things like hazard, pay, making sure that there's enough PPE at the places that really need it the most and if you have any suggestions of anything our office should be advocate for please feel free to reach out to me.
I was looking way for you to make the announcement tonight from the board and that tomorrow first thing in the morning: your boss, this meeting is edible, Cheryl, okay, fantastic and that email just hurt everybody.
I know that we all see that, and we feel that we've been actively calling on that for quite some time and I think we are slowly seeing some results as I get more information about those that are being announced or brought forward.
I will tell you, though, that I am balancing very carefully the danger to public and the danger to the inmates to make sure that you know we're doing the right thing for Queens in general, but there has been a very large push to see that we get people who are in danger people.
I've talked about it and we want to make sure that people know there is a hotline at the domestic at the Queen's District Attorney's Office, that hotlines number is 722.
They find very few people to talk to the not having any human contact is an issue, and so we want to make sure that we're checking on our loved ones and our friends to make sure that they are feeling okay and that they're not feeling alone in this period of time.
But I really wanted the opportunity to say hello and to make sure that all of you know I haven't, disappeared, I'm still around I'm still a resource I still appreciate.
I've always felt like it was home to me, especially for so please let us know if there's anything else that we can do, but the office is running, we're doing everything we can to make sure that Queen stays safe and always thank you.
Obviously you know: okay, we're gonna, unmute Alex right now, Alex with us, we'll hold on we'll meet her I think I meet it you're good to go Alex one of the hardest hit areas economically and if you walk down a player on a junction, Boulevard you're, lucky thievery, one or two thirds all done I said Samaritan had just announced.
If it's, that big of an issue gets into another situation correct, but let's just look into that, because I do feel a lot of people are doing a lot of people in order to avoid the fees right off.
So I, you know encourage everyone to use those services if they feel that they are, you know entitled to them, and I just want to thank councilman Moira for the donation of the PPE I'm sure we all know that was you know sorely needed.
You know, as far as social distancing in parks, it's a challenging thing, but it's something that really needs to be adhered to.
If it's especially since right now, you know the we see that parks are the main way that people get access to fresh air and exercise in those things, but you know that all has changed and we hope with a lot of things that were mentioned tonight.
You know to stay sort of on top of this, my scent Christian a link and I'll, make sure he says it with all of you.
There's a lot of webinars right now that I've been attending on how Park design is changing, and you know I will be the voice for the board as your parks, chair and the public in communicating how things need to be shifted.
It's May 7th at 7 p.m. I'll, make sure that the link and all the information about that gets out so that anyone that wants to take an active role in flushing meadows-corona Park, which is seeing a lot of issues with social distancing so that we can work together to also find a solution in doing our part in that Park.
