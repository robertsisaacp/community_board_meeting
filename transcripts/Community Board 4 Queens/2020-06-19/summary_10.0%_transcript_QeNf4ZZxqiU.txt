Is this and you guys everybody knows John Wayne, who I believe might be on the call, as well as the New York Hall of Science, was now under some form of your management, at least, if you outreach division and it seems that we're all getting together on what they call the Elmhurst Corona coalition and what the owners Coalition is basically and again, I would love for John to be able to speak, but we have a chance to do so.
All the Queens Museum make the road Elm core new life CDC a lot of groups are getting together and we're gonna be using the opportunity for all of us to get together and make like a one-stop shop for all things of a community outreach that includes helping education, community welfare awareness and fundraising.

We do, however, have reps from the Census we're reaching out to wasn't going to do much more community outreach because, as you could imagine, more than ever, our numbers are lower and then the European I think reeling in a 30 percent.
I will understand obvious things on workers, a hospital workers, police members of committee board that I working, maybe steak and gab.
I, just now got a text from Ruby Mohammed she's on the phone she hears everything, but she wasn't able to you know to let you know that she's none but just got it now and as for the census, the Queen's General Assembly and the presence of his doing a phone in the predominately for Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese people, that's who they want to get onto the census.
If anybody's interest to call their office, maybe Joe will bring it up if he's on tonight, and that might be a way of you know an ting of those numbers for Queens.
So if anybody's in just get in touch with the borough president's office, and that's it thank you so much root Lucy.

Okay from the House of Representatives race me: yes, we have Christian representing a congressman: Ming Christian, Thank, You, Christian, Thank You, chair on behalf of congresswoman mang, just hoping and wishing everyone's family still remains all healthy and well to update everyone.

chair, if I may also I, want to just add to the fact that a Christian and I and the congresswoman earlier this year, cuz he before pardoned up with Pakistan Bank and on Memorial Day. We were actually out there giving away some masks.
Giving away a thousand masks in 45 minutes shows that everyone is in need and we're happy to be there, and thank you for partnering with us.
We I'm going to show here, Michelle hi everyone- and this is Michelle from the office of congresswoman Olga self Cortese, welcome new board members.
So it's important to you know, get the word out and thank you for the board for the work that they're doing around the census.
There's small businesses to be open, so we'll be out there on Saturday small businesses giving out masks you can send dieter and just informing them how what the process will look like when they start Camille Ben, the congresswoman, Assemblywoman sensory guards- and he you know thank you guys- are doing well from the New York State Senate Michael, generous.
Everyone I want to start off by wishing everyone a happy Pride Month we're just gonna go into highlighting a couple of top-level announcements.
The initial goal is to save a hundred restaurants across the 27 communities, supporting 1,000 workers, we're looking at our daily health indicators, which continue to remain below the thresholds, and we expect Phase two of reopening to begin either at the end of June or the beginning of July, we're leaning towards more likely the beginning of July.
Today was my first stop going back on a week or so, and I was mortified over what I saw all over Crona plasm, nonetheless, not to mention the fact that, of course, the food vendors and mask vendors and glove vendors and every kind of vendors possibly out there, but there is literally no social business thing more.
So we're hoping really that this is like a you know, everybody kind of chips in looks out for each other, but all we can really do is educate.
We can't force people, you know we're not trying to get anybody in trouble, and so it's kind of this balancing act.
Yeah Lou, if you like, you, can send me the sites and I can ask DOB to check it out and again we're not trying anybody in trouble.
So if you'd like to send me those two sites, I'm happy to look into those okay, yeah, no I'm good to go.
So Lou I'm deported before you can see me Thank You Kelly, by the way before you continue, of course, do so, but we do have a represent from lawyer's office, so we're just gonna get on a minute I'll, let you know when we get her on, but you continue everybody else, no, sir, and we just we just gotta represent it from barnwell's office.
Let the community know that we will be our office, will be hosting an I lag event and giving one second sorry it'll be it'll, take place on June 18th and if you need to RSVP for the appointment, you can reach us at our office number, which is seven one, eight six five one three one, eight five, and also to let everyone know that our office has also created a covert 19 community resource guide, which includes information and resources for individuals.
In the meantime, good evening, everyone I get to meet everyone and welcome to new community board members.
Maybe if you know, if you just acknowledge the next speaker- and we actually have somebody from the borough president's office who is going to speak and we're gonna unmute them right now, so just you can continue with the controller's office.
But you know I think what more people will be interested in is the fourth quarter of current fiscal year in those numbers and report on that will come out.
You know in the near future, but that probably will happen for the summer when there's no meetings, but just people look out for it if you're interested next thing is that there has been a annual claims report that was just released.
First off on behalf of the borough, president I wanted to welcome all the new appointees to community boards for as well as returning members, the birth president wanted to prioritize the census, she's encouraging everyone in Queens, so you fill out their senses that they have yet to do so, and she also wanted to remind everyone to vote on June 23rd.
Eight two, eight six three thousand I encourage anyone who has any issues or questions to call and as we work remotely, I will be able to follow up with any concerns or issues going forward and I want to wish everyone a happy healthy summer.
Yes, she has Oscar, yes, yeah, okay, I just thought much to report just that some information I think beginning June 15, which was on Monday another stop a lot of stores stopped carrying plastic acts.
So you know, if you guys, hopefully I'm hoping you guys, bought some reusable bags, because a lot of stores already stopped giving away plastic bags.
Already so I mean I, don't know what the public, except whatever they have left in stock when it comes to passing packs they probably giving that out, but as soon as they finish, what that I don't think we're gonna have another stock of it.
Ashley is here with us hi everybody specific to helps to report, but I just want to encourage our body to please keep wearing face coverings when they go out continue to social distance, we're seeing the numbers go down in the state and in the city.
Also going to these marches I did give it out in October I'm, going to give it out again seven one, eight four, seven, six, nine three two one I didn't hear anything - they're far from 110, but it's good to know that we have someplace to still reach out to if things start to get worse again being that we're in hard times with money and family issues, and such I asked if any of the neighbors or police were under any tension.
Sometimes when we're under all this tension with what's been happening, the culvert and the marches and protests was there any people being hurt by things being said so far, nothing's been reported to the police department or the community at large.
As soon as you can get, the men I know that John we're certain police officer is working now on covering a lot more area, so you can get those waivers in would help they've been covering my first street and my first place on 43rd and 43rd for fourth Avenue and the overpass of the Long Island Railroad.
If you are there, we know she's here, Thank You, Alexis committee reports and item seven.
Just would like to thank everybody for coming in on these meetings.
It's rather important I hope we can meet again, but I have no idea what, when that's going to happen in the meantime, I just like to wish everybody a very safe and hopefully as happy.
