We're excited to be with you all tonight and behalf of dr marez and our team were just grateful for the partnership with community board 13, you know preparing for return for school coping with reality and the uncertainty of Covid-19 19 I know there are a ton of questions that folks have on their mind, and so we are delighted to have members of our behavioral health and medicine service line here with us tonight to kind of look at the facts and and really better understand the implications of and coping with reality and the uncertainty of Covid-19 19, and then we're going to invite dr peter tamiko, who is director of psychological services, a part of our behavioral service line to speak more about the stress and the uncertainty around Covid-19 from a psychological perspective and leave you all with tools and tips and tricks So everybody wants to know the questions that are all over the media and everywhere, which is should schools open?
Does one go about reopening a school in the context of a rapidly changing pattern of community spread of a pandemic that has not been seen in this world for over a hundred years, and the decision to reopen schools involves weighing the public health risks of opening against the educational and other risks of keeping buildings closed.
As, you probably know a contact is somebody who spends 15 minutes or more by definition, within a six foot radius of a case without them both having protected ppes and in the case of a school, since nobody is going to be wearing eyewear and many of the young children may or not be able to keep their masks on.
A state like California is using to decide whether to reopen or not Let's just put it that way, and I am supportive of trying to open the schools, even though I think it's a risky and difficult event chicago third largest school district in the united states is not going to open and is fully online, but their rates are much higher than new york You know the governor has said that new york schools can reopen in person.
Have the liberty of working from home Many people in new york city are essential workers that have to go to work and depend on their schools to watch their kids.
Many people in new york city depend on schools for their kids to get food and across the country These are important considerations that cannot be overlooked in decisions about reopening the school now Another point I will make is regarding the spread of covit.
These kids are going to leave school and if you think that you're going to be able to control the habits of a 16 or 18 year old kid and keep them quarantined or keep them with a small number of people, it's extraordinarily difficult, I direct the Covid-19 problem for a local college, and it was clearly related to an event inside where a bunch of people got together had a party they were crowded and bingo So. You have to try to limit and watch what these kids are going to be doing outside of school, and it's difficult.
You know: I have a parent who's going to be watching the kids or he's immunosuppressed or he's aged with congestive heart failure or copd, and these are good questions and they're not easy to answer, and each family is going to have to decide this on their own In my opinion, a lot of the safety depends upon how carefully that family can keep relatively out of these large crowds of people.
If, you think about new york rates as being roughly 0.5 percent right now, then, you can think of it in a very rough manner that when you're walking down the street one in 200 people that you run into are either symptomatic or asymptomatically carrying Covid-19 How often, will you get a bet like that you're going to make, and particularly if you wear a mask- and you know you're careful, then those are pretty good odds.
You know you'd have to get folks who are over a century old to have anything similar to what has been experienced before and hear stories about it, and you know similar kinds of conflicts about keeping people's masks on, and you know fines for such and having a conflict in the social order in terms of keeping ourselves safe with this invisible, as dr farber was saying, the announcement from new york city public schools that now you know they're not going to open until the 20th or so or a couple of weeks.
You know they were really on a tight rope in terms of being late, and you know in terms of spring and as as school was you know in terms of child care issues, and this looks like it was gonna, be the piece of information that was just gonna, be too much The degrees of stress that people are dealing with in terms of even anticipating what's to come, so work challenges Of course, just in terms of safety and the danger there are you bringing danger home to your family, and you know factoring that in terms of the type of job that you have, then you know changing work schedules It's really difficult and places a huge burden on families, in terms of trying to adapt that and modify, and to ask for special considerations from employers and so forth.
You know your family like each other anymore, and so we wondered we wanted that in the middle of the summer, with her with our kids, you know and establishing new routines and trying to deal with the increased proximity, and you know getting thrown off your routines and your way of life at home It's, not just the loss of the you know our way of life, but actual you know, direct losses in terms of health, significant loss in terms of having losing folks opportunities to be with family members and friends, and some folks have you know, saw some positive outcomes of in terms of the remote world.
I thought it would be important for folks again to be armed with information and this is, and this is what your school has put out in terms of their response to the board of ed You know: department of education, new york state, who is actually using the department of health guidelines.
All students and staff will practice physical distancing in all school buildings The entire school day, including bus schools, are responsible for health screening They do burden as much as it can be back on the families in terms of supporting that and they're asking families to take care of that at home, and then report that indeed, your child does not have a temperature over a hundred If, that's not clear or that can't be communicated.
They are being asked and have agreed and are again making a pledge to you that they will be separate locations in every building for ill persons who are either suspected or have you know a temperature and those kids will be asked to wait either be picked up or permission to walk home if they're, older and live close by that's your pledge from your school from new york city, public schools, education, wise all, children are being educated five days a week.
This kid was trying to adjust to the to the light to the home life of remote learning and was really thrown off the fact that he had jim or wasn't having jim In terms of you know the school and the the schedule where he at 10 o'clock was expecting to be in gym.
This example working that out and then, of course, try and find time for self-care and some fun information sharing, again really important that you are here tonight, listening even at least being informed about your school's plan, their response to the governor, their response to the department of education, their you know, promise so to speak to you and the neighborhood and the city and the student body, and being informed about that and sharing that with your kids in terms of knowing what to expect I would practice some mask wearing.
If it's not something that you know you've been doing and going out and the kids are going to have to have it on all day and on the bus and so forth, and that's not something you've been doing So you know you might want to practice that some and have some exposure to that before they get in there, but you know being letting them know what to expect and what the plan is and that kid should be wearing mass staff You know, anyway, all of those features that we spoke about in terms of the promise that the school is making I talked about communication in terms of making sure it's at a developmental level, and you know because kids at home and we're together, more I, think being a little bit more careful about.
