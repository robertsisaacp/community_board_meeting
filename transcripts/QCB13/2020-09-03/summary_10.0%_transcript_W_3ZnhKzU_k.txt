I know there are a ton of questions that folks have on their mind, and so we are delighted to have members of our behavioral health and medicine service line here with us tonight to kind of look at the facts, And and really better understand the implications of and coping with reality and the uncertainty of Covid-19.
So everybody wants to know the questions that are all over the media and everywhere, which is, should schools open?
How does one go about reopening a school in the context of a rapidly changing pattern of community spread of a pandemic that has not been seen in this world for over a hundred years, and the decision to reopen schools involves weighing the public health risks of opening against the educational and other risks of keeping buildings.
Children, who are under the age of eight or ten, have much more difficulty using remote, access, and I certainly think that special needs kids do very poorly with remote access and have lost a lot of time in school.
There's no question that there's going to be enormous, problems, and I think it's clear that if we opened our schools back in March or April, it would have been a disaster.
A contact is somebody who spends 15 minutes or more by definition, within a six foot radius of a case without them both having protected PPES and in the case of a school, since nobody is going to be wearing eyewear and many of the young children may or not be able to keep their masks.
Let's, just put it that way, and I am supportive of trying to open the schools, even though I think it's a risky and difficult event.
Many people in New, York City, are essential workers that have to go to work and depend on their schools to watch their kids.
These kids are going to leave school and if you think that you're going to be able to control the habits of a 16 or 18 year old kid and keep them quarantined or keep them with a small number of people, it's extraordinarily difficult.
You have to try to limit and watch what these kids are going to be doing outside of school You know this is reopening of school.
It's going to depend most importantly, as I said, on, the community rates have spread, and fortunately, in New, York You can be prepared that there's going to be another classroom or another school where it's going to crop up, and you want those whack, a- moles to be reasonable and not to result in large outbreaks and under those circumstances, If they're reasonable.
Many questions do I, get about the fact that well, I'm going to send my kid back to school, but I have a grand you know.
Then you can think of it in a very rough manner that when you're walking down the street one in 200 people that you run into are either symptomatic or asymptomatically carrying How often, will you get a bet like that you're going to make, and particularly if you wear a mask And, you know you're careful, then those are pretty good.
It, and you know similar kinds of conflicts about keeping people's masks on, and you know fines for such and having a conflict in the social order in terms of keeping ourselves safe with this invisible enemy- First aid work in our hospital with some of the frontline workers and the nurses and the Physicians and man.
I was just speaking to somebody this morning and as Dr Farber was saying, the announcement from New York City public schools that now you know, they're not going to open until the 20th or so or a couple of weeks.
As as school Was. You know in terms of child care issues, and this looks like it was going to be the piece of information that was just going to be too much The degrees of stress that people are dealing with in terms of even anticipating, what's to come, so work, challenges.
Of course, just in terms of safety and the danger there are you bringing danger home to your family, and you know factoring that in terms of the type of job that you have, then you know changing work schedules, and And, that's part of the department was talking about the one to three day: hybrid role and or a plan from the from the schools Yet there's five different kinds of hybrid plans.
You know your family like each other anymore, So we wondered we wanted that in the middle of the summer, with her with our kids, you know, and establishing new routines and trying to deal with the increased proximity, and you know getting thrown off your routines and your way of life at home and folks are dealing with considerable losses.
Let's just get back to the basics in terms of just the routines, sleep and bedtime, and meal times- And you know in school.
I thought it would be important for folks again to be armed with information, and this is- This is what your school has put out in terms of their response to the board of Ed. You know Department of Education New York state, who is actually using the Department of Health guidelines.
It is relatively broad and exhaustive, but in just in terms of some things that you should be informed about just to be able to know to inform your kids to be able to hold the school accountable.
You know to be able to speak to the Covid-19 coordinator in your school building.
A parent, a family can opt for full remote and it's just a form to fill out, or you know, communication to be made, and that can happen at any time going.
In terms of closing regarding test positive of number of kids in a classroom and or a school overall.
You felt less safe, listening to Dr, Farber and hearing more from the news and being armed, but the uncertainty is the uncertainty and safety issues predominate in terms of people's ability to you, know, think clearly and be able to.
Or I should a rel, a relative, a sense of hope in terms of what you know what you could be wishful about, drawing some positive meaning from difficult times identifying yourself as someone who is persevering as a coping family, and we certainly hear that from a lot of our health care, workers.
And she was saying was that it was one of the best birthday surprises and parties she's ever had in terms of the outpouring of affection, And again I mentioned earlier, creating new family rituals or routines, I think, is important for us to feel grounded in what those can look like some role issue about roles, You, know, trying to coming home from work and then also having to deal with or trying to work from home and then also trying to deal with the remote learning from school, and you know, and trying to not.
You know between the adults and families and the real importance of communication in terms of renegotiating that, in terms of you, know, parents and grandparents, and so forth, and kids may also be changing their roles.
You know our kids are doing a lot more in terms of chores and taking care of the home than they were before and other others that, and we have some ailing grandparents that live nearby Our families have talked about that too, in terms of helping out so again, preservation of routines and then also creating new ones overall, with a child who we been working with in the clinic as an example with the expected school was a kid who who was?
This example working that out and then, of course, try and find time for self- care and some fun information, sharing, again really important that you are here: tonight, listening, even at least being informed about your school's plan, their response to the governor, their response to the department of education, their you know, promise.
So to speak to you and the neighborhood and the city and the student body, and being informed about that and sharing that with your kids in terms of knowing what to expect I would practice some mask wearing.
I talked about communication in terms of making sure it's at a developmental level, and you know, because kids at home And we're together, more, I think, being a little bit more careful about you, know, sharing news and watching.
