These people, who you know, who do that and I think for the most part people are pretty. Oh, you know observant of reasonable rules and and it's helped I mean I I'm shocked when I go to the grocery store. When I go in places, people are very respectful wherever I am for the most part, yeah there's always exceptions, but there's always exceptions to everything. Nothing's ever going to be perfect, so you know I am thinking that we're in a better shape here than probably 48 other states. Let me just say bruce that we are now live. People are able to hear us and see us, so you know I just wanted you to be aware of that. Okay, I appreciate it. The other thing, hopefully, that you guys will discuss, is how, if an infection rate does come back, how that happens- and also I just saw- I got a flash on my screen about the CDC talking about the a vaccine- will be ready on november 1st so sort of the notion around what that actually means from a medical standpoint. Obviously, we don't want to get too much into the politics, even though that's the elephant, you know, you know it's like putting a red flag in front of a bull talking to me about the CDC making that announcement, because it's nothing more than politics and I think we can discuss those things because, quite frankly, I mean I won't make this into a political speech. Obviously my views come across even when I try not them trying for them not to, but it's very sad. It's the best way to describe it. The CDC was previously a totally non-political organization based on science, and now you see these things that clearly relate to political, not scientific decisions. There's one other thing: hey michael: how are you good? How are you hey bruce? How are you I'm well? Thank you good. Thank you for joining us tonight. My pleasure where's jennifer she'll be joining momentarily, I'm sure. Okay, so I know oh great well, yeah we yeah she should be on momentarily. We were on another call mark, I'm thinking in terms of once. You kick it off hand it over. To me I'll say a couple of words like literally a couple of words: hand it over to bruce and then peter will take over after bruce very good, very good yeah bruce, and I was just having a chit chat about things that are going on now. The CDC and just one other thing: I'd like you to address bruce, which is there have been people who've, been saying that the real number of kobe deaths is really eight thousand, because the underlying conditions killed everybody else. This is again. This is chit chat. I hear from people who listen to q9 and other sort of websites. If you could just address the reality of what the death toll really is in the presentation, because these are things that are out there in the community. Yes welcome peter hi peter. How are you, how are you peter hi? Can you folks hear me yes loud and clear? Oh wow? How about that hi bruce hi nice to meet you peter yeah, nice to meet you, I'm glad you could join us. My pleasure appreciate your slide. Putting yourself out there. Just ask me the political questions. If you want to see me out there yeah, I want to wait a few minutes because, as things happen in the community, people don't always tune in on time. So if you tell them a certain time, it's usually 10 or 15 minutes and as the numbers come up, that would be great, I'm also I'm gonna. Let people know that there will be. They can put questions in the q, a box and at the conclusion of your presentation, I'll just read the question, so you guys can answer it. I already have one question in there. So, okay are you? How are we going to do the slides? Are you going to try and give us control to move them or you just? You should have I'll share the screen. You should be able to just put the slides on there and we'll move along at your own pace. Okay and first you bring up your slides. My slides aren't with you yeah, so I wasn't sure so we have a consolidated deck. So if we put that up, mark you'll just give them remote access and they'll just go through them. Yes, okay, that's great awesome come on so bruce you don't have it in front of you on your okay mark. Are we starting right away, or did you tell 6 30? I told people six o'clock, hoping they would come in early, so, okay, we can give it if we can give it like 10 more minutes. If you don't mind want to take it. Yes sure and peter mayer should be joining us right. Yes, okay, yes spoke to him earlier yeah, some great. Thank you bruce where's your office on the campus. I have two offices, one, isn't the 400 community drive building? Oh yeah, you know entrance five and then I have an office in the hospital. I spend a lot of time there you know, michael. I just wanted everybody to know that you are. You can be heard, so the conversations you have are public. Okay, bruce jennifer is joining from the car on the phone. She she says, hello sends her best hi jennifer and that's fine putting mine down right now. Okay, that's fine! I gotta go people listening to this. Okay, bye! Sorry about that! No worries I'm just happy when the tech works at all. Okay man. I am not able to negotiate getting okay, michael, that's mayor he's said he could see us, but he may not have the right link to get inc and I can't seem to be able to navigate this. Could you can someone send him the link again I'll? Send him a link, the link again right now, thanks? Okay, thanks hmm, can you guys get on to get the deck or do I need to do that for you peter? I have it. I have it saved on my desktop. So do you know how to just pick that up and present it? No, that's! Not the screen! Yeah! I'm! Sorry! There you go. Okay, you can see it. I can see it yeah! Okay, bruce! Can you see this as well? Yep, it's fine! No one else will be able to move them, though, except me right, yeah you'll be in charge. Okay got it good. Now the arrows are working yeah. I just first have these two slides before your deck right here: yeah sure, okay, so michael I'm gonna start at 6 15, because I don't want to hold up so that'll be a couple more minutes. No first, do you want to just check you can move the slides, so I'm going to go to review options and request remote control from you. Correct, yes, and then did you give me the did you respond. It looks like I have to approve it. Okay, it says waiting for you to control the screen. You got it. Okay, you can. Just if you want just tell me, is this your first slide? No, I ate the one just before yeah there we go all right just so you guys know I'm getting text messages now about michael. What you told me before, there's a face to face with the chancellor. This will we will be taping this we're taping it as we speak and we'll be able to post the link to youtube, so people can subsequently come and see it. It's 6 12. I think I'm just going to start, because you know people will be chiming in as we as we go forward. I just want to say first of all, this my name is mark mcmillan, I'm the district manager for Queens community board 13 and we're doing this meeting in conjunction with northwell lij under the auspices of our youth and education committee, youth and education committee. I want to thank the doctors who are part of this, the preparation that would be dr wright, dr d'amico, dr farber, dr bellison, and I guess, what's michael: what's your partner's name, dr jennifer mirez who's joining me and I'm going to turn it over to them. But I just want to say that this is really important to the community. As we get information that's relevant to what's going on today. This particular powerpoint has been crafted, so people who have children who are going to school or working with children going back to school will have a full understanding of what is involved in terms of mental and infectious rates regarding cov19, and I want to thank all of everybody who's presenting tonight and everybody who's tuning in for for being a part of this presentation, michael mark yeah, thank you for the invitation. Returning back to community board 13, we're excited to be with you all tonight and behalf of dr marez and our team were just grateful for the partnership with community board 13., you know preparing for return for school coping with reality and the uncertainty of Covid-19 19. I know there are a ton of questions that folks have on their mind, and so we are delighted to have members of our behavioral health and medicine service line here with us tonight to kind of look at the facts and and really better understand the implications of and coping with reality and the uncertainty of Covid-19 19.. So with that, I'm honored to welcome dr bruce farber chief of infectious disease at northwell and he's going to kick us off tonight and then we're going to invite dr peter tamiko, who is director of psychological services, a part of our behavioral service line, to speak more about the stress and the uncertainty around Covid-19 from a psychological perspective and leave you all with tools and tips and tricks. But as we go along donuts to use, chat, ask questions and again thank you for the opportunity to be with you all tonight, dr farber. Thank you so much thanks for the invitation. Thank you mark. Needless to say, we are in unprecedented times. It is a very difficult time. None of the answers are easy and everything is changing very rapidly. Okay, so everybody wants to know the questions that are all over the media and everywhere, which is, should schools open? How does one go about reopening a school in the context of a rapidly changing pattern of community spread of a pandemic that has not been seen in this world for over a hundred years, and the decision to reopen schools involves weighing the public health risks of opening against the educational and other risks of keeping buildings closed, in-person instruction for kindergartens through grade five and special needs. In my opinion, and a lot of these quick, these slides or opinion that I'm welcome to discuss with you should probably be prioritized. Children who are under the age of eight or ten have much more difficulty using remote access, and I certainly think that special needs kids do very poorly with remote access and have lost a lot of time in school. Children in these age groups are still developing skills that need to regulate their own behavior and emotions, and they need to maintain attention and monitor their own learning. It is fine for the schools to have been closed down for several months, and we all understand why that was necessary in the spring, but I will start off by saying that it's not acceptable. I don't think anyone, no matter where you are on the spectrum, to think that schools are going to be closed forever and our children are not going to be educated. They have to be educated, they have to learn to socialize, and I think we all agree with that, and I think we also all agree that remote learning, although we have to do it, is not a permanent fix to replace in school education. So the decision involves ensuring that ventilation and air, filtration and cleaning surfaces frequently are safe and, as I've said to mark right before this began, there is no question whether you are opening a school, whether you're opening a gym a restaurant or anything else in the public domain, that the most important number as to whether it will be safe and successful is what the rate of infection is in the community in which you're living and if you open schools in houston, texas, right now or parts of Florida. That there's no question that there's going to be enormous problems, and I think it's clear that if we opened our schools back in march or april, it would have been a disaster. Fortunately, new york is in a much better situation than it was before and that's why we're having this conversation all right? How to plan to tackle this? Many of you have read about this, and some of these slides actually come from the newspaper, but, as you know- and this slide changed yesterday because, as you know, the mayor put off the opening for almost a couple of weeks, but we are going to be opening at least as it is now, with a hybrid model. All around the country. There are various models. There is a hybrid model. There is a total at home model. There is a full-time school model and the model for right now for new york, as you've heard, is one to three days per week in school. The current plan is that if one or two confirmed cases occur in a single classroom, that class will close with the students and staff members required to quarantine for 14 days. As you probably know, a contact is somebody who spends 15 minutes or more by definition, within a six foot radius of a case without them both having protected ppes and in the case of a school, since nobody is going to be wearing eyewear and many of the young children may or not be able to keep their masks on. It basically means that anyone within a six foot radius of a confirmed case will be quarantined for 14 days, including that whole class. If two or more people in different classrooms in the same school test positive, then the entire school building will have to close and may not reopen. For two weeks now, it's difficult to say whether this is the appropriate numbers or not a lot of times. These decisions ultimately come down to arbitrary decisions, and it's not totally fact based. But it's not. These numbers are not unreasonable. Certainly, they shy on the side of being careful and conservative in the consultations that I've done with many colleges and sports teams, and I consult with a lot of professional sports teams around the country. These numbers are not unreasonable compared to what's being done in other places. We do have the liberty of closing a classroom, unlike a college where these people have to be isolated and kept away from other people, or you have to close the whole school down as light as what happened at unc just a week and a half ago. So just to give you some comparisons. In California, the largest state in the union, 55 million people, two-thirds of the state have been barred from reopening in person and a third of the state will of the third of the state that can, if more than five percent of the students and faculty test positive over a two week rolling period. Then the school must close for two weeks now to put that in proper context. Rates in new york city right now are significantly less or are definitely less than one percent. So I I'm not saying that this is not going to be without problems. Anything that you have to do with Covid-19 and opening schools or doing anything is always problematic. But I have to say that if it doesn't work in new york now, then it's not going to work for a long time, because our rates are less than a fifth of what say a state like California is using to decide whether to reopen or not. So I think that we have a shot at it. Let's just put it that way, and I am supportive of trying to open the schools, even though I think it's a risky and difficult event chicago third largest school district in the united states is not going to open and is fully online, but their rates are much higher than new york, no comparison and they're higher than California. So you know the governor has said that new york schools can reopen in person. Schools across new york can reopen this fall if they're in a region where the average rate of positivity is below five percent, but, as I said, we're below one percent most of new york has new york city virtually all of it right now, as we speak, all of it is below one percent, all five boroughs, many teachers and parents across the state have expressed concern as the viruses spike in other states post-school opening this is normal. This is rational. This is, of course, people are afraid. Why shouldn't they be afraid and we're in difficult times. Quite frankly, there's no easy answer here. The teachers are afraid the parents are afraid everybody's afraid, but we have to act. It's this time is what it is, and so just to go. Hide our heads in the sand and pretend that this is just going to go away and everything's going to go back to normal is not happening about 75 percent of new york city students are low-income and many of their parents are essential workers who cannot work from home. This is important, although initially people thought that Covid-19 was an equal opportunity virus and you could be rich or poor or live in any part of the city and still get covered and die from it. And, although that's true, of course, that's not really true, it turns out that, as you know, many people in new york city cannot afford to leave new york city and go to their second homes in the hamptons or in westchester. Many people in new york city. Don't have the liberty of working from home. Many people in new york city are essential workers that have to go to work and depend on their schools to watch their kids. Many people in new york city depend on schools for their kids to get food and across the country there's over 25 million children who depend on schools for both lunch and breakfast. So these are important considerations that cannot be overlooked in decisions about reopening the school now. Another point I will make is regarding the spread of covit. Covid-19 is spread by three potential mechanisms. The first is what most people think account for the overwhelming majority of its spread and that's by droplet nuclei. Droplet nuclei are less than five microns and they are coughed out of people's mouths and they're sneezed out of their nose, and they can generally go six feet. That's the reason why people have come up with this six foot, radius that we've talked about. It turns out that in reality they can probably spread a little more than six feet. Many people think that it's close to eight feet now, but it is some finite distance. The second mechanism, by which Covid-19 travels is by aerosols, are small particles less than five microns, frequently one to three microns in size. They are dust particles that the virus attaches to in the air, and then they can travel for long distances for long distances across a room. The outbreak in seattle, where a choir one person had it and 46 people got Covid-19, even though they weren't within a six foot radius of the person who was Covid-19 positive in singing and singing and speaking and coughing, and talking are all mechanisms by which aerosols can theoretically be spread. The third mechanism is, in my opinion, the least important, and I think, if there's anything, that's overkill in our control of Covid-19. It relates to fomites. Now what are fomites are inanimate objects that you touch that are contaminated with Covid-19, and then somebody else touches and then touches their nose or the conjunctiva or lining of their eyes and transmit the virus by that mechanism. Now fomites are an important mechanism for the transmission of rhinovirus, which is the common cold rhinoviruses cause most colds and years ago. I did research on this and we used to state that if you knew somebody with a cold feel free to kiss them, but don't shake their hands, and the reason for that was because there aren't good receptors for a lot of these common cold viruses like the non-covid19 Covid-19 or the rhinoviruses. That you know are transmitted by nose or by conjunctiva, but not male. There aren't good receptors in the mouth. So when Covid-19 19 came out, everybody immediately assumed and rightfully so, I'm not being critical. That Covid-19 can be transmitted by hand to hand contact and then hand to nose or hand to eye contact. The average person touches their nose over 15 times per day. You think that I'm kidding, but if you watch keep track of it, people are constantly touching their nose and less frequently they're rubbing their eyes throughout the day. So if you touch somebody who has Covid-19 and they contaminate something, and then you rub your eyes or your nose bingo, but in reality that's not what happens very often, if ever it happens extraordinarily infrequently, it turns out that fomites don't seem to be very important in the transmission of Covid-19 and it was all hyped up based on the fact that studies spraying large concentrations of Covid-19 onto cardboard, glass, formica desks. What have you floors demonstrated that you can live for hours or even a day, or so everyone feared the worst and that led to this enormous push for disinfection of airplanes, of deaths, of schools of restaurants, no touch menus, I could go on and on and defogging materials, but it turns out that you know hand washing and purell are probably more than adequate to stop the low risk of transmission by fomates. So, personally, I think that you know we should take out some of the worry about fomites. Can it happen? Theoretically, yes, does it happen? It probably accounts for a tiny minority of the spread of Covid-19 and clearly the things that we need to worry about. Most are the ventilation, the social distancing as a mechanism to decrease the risk, so with the preventative measure in place for fall, how will the student home environment be addressed? Tylenol is given to many students before going to school, because parents cannot afford to miss work. In addition to which tylenol is given to many students for lots of ailments and not every ailment is going to be covered just because covid's around doesn't mean that common colds, rsv influenza, earaches and an asundry of other respiratory complaints are going to disappear. Overcrowded homes where two to three people live due to an increase in rent can increase the risk of transmission within the home. Contact tracing involving both children and parents will connect information to be given on how people can live at home with their contacts. Parents do not always come home work home from work at three o'clock. Kids have to go to often crowded homes, where somebody will babysit several kids before they are picked up by their parents. It will not be surprising as a mode of transmission by airborne route that household transmissions, particularly when kids are being watched in areas where there's low ventilation is more likely to occur in the schools where there will be some distancing overcrowding. High density areas has defined most of the Covid-19 hotspots. Let me be very specific. It appears that 80 percent of transmission of Covid-19 occurs by super spreaders in super spreading areas. What's a super spreading area, a super spreading area is a large concentration of people in close proximity to one another. Without there being adequate ventilation, it's almost always inside. It's almost never outside. I'm, not saying that you can't get Covid-19 outside, but there's very few super spreading events that are outside. There are a few examples. The motorcycle race in south dakota was mostly outside, but these people were congregating in really close proximity. There were 500 000 people that went into a small town that normally houses, 7 000 people. So you know if you're working it and you're careless and you do really risky things, then there'll be an outbreak, but in reality that's why bars are so difficult, they're, crowded, there's, poor ventilation. People are on top of one another and that's where a super spreader event starts now what about the age groups? Let's talk a little about this comes up all the time. Children younger than five generally have mild to moderate Covid-19 19, even though they have high amounts of Covid-19 rna in their nasopharynx compared to adults and they're, very small, though so, even though they have higher concentrations, their nasopharynx is very small. You can't compare a five-year-old to a large adult. This study was limited to the detection of nucleic acid rather than virus, and realize that people excrete Covid-19 rna for prolonged periods of time. Even though they're not contagious after they've recovered from Covid-19 young children can be potentially important. Drivers of Covid-19 19 spread in the general population, as it's been demonstrated with rsv and gastrointestinal disease, but as a general rule, they seem to be much safer than teenagers, and I also has- and that's what's demonstrated on this slide, and I also have to tell you that realize that this is not a lockdown that is being done for the nba and the nhl. These kids are going to leave school and if you think that you're going to be able to control the habits of a 16 or 18 year old kid and keep them quarantined or keep them with a small number of people, it's extraordinarily difficult. I mean this is basically the problem with colleges, fraternity, houses, parties. I direct the Covid-19 problem for a local college and I can tell you: we've had you know one major outbreak and it was clearly related to an event inside where a bunch of people got together had a party they were crowded and bingo. So you have to try to limit and watch what these kids are going to be doing outside of school, and it's difficult. You know it really is so you know this is reopening of school. That's at its worst, and this was a picture that was shown in the paper from last week. Take a look. This is a georgia high school. You can see one person wearing a mask. It would be hard to get a worse situation of social distancing than you see in this picture. This is what would be a classic super spreader event: mass, no crowded hallways, yes, open and crowded school, gyms and cafeterias. Yes, group work with students sitting together a school nurse resigns, citing concerns for safety online, offering is limited to a certain amount of students and closes in a few days. This is a disaster waiting to happen, and that is what's going to happen in states and places where there are poor plans and there are lack of common sense and political problems that lead to purposely violating normal, acceptable rules to try to prevent spread. My predictions for the fall are all over the place. I think that it's going to depend on local school. It's going to depend most importantly, as I said, on, the community rates have spread, and fortunately in new york, they're good, but I also think that it's not going to be without problems, and I think you know I always use the analogy of a whack-a-mole because it really fits so wherever you punch down something. You can be prepared that there's going to be another classroom or another school where it's going to crop up, and you want those whack-a-moles to be reasonable and not to result in large outbreaks and under those circumstances, if they're reasonable, that's really the best. We can hope for problems with grandparents problems with people watching children coming home from school. How many questions do I get about the fact that well, I'm gonna send my kid back to school, but I have a grand you know. I have a parent who's going to be watching the kids and he's got. You know chronic leukemia or he had lymphoma or he's immunosuppressed or he's aged with congestive, heart failure or copd, and these are good questions and they're not easy to answer, and each family is going to have to decide this on their own. But in my opinion, a lot of the safety depends upon how carefully that family can keep relatively out of these large crowds of people. If you think about new york rates as being roughly 0.5 percent right now, then you can think of it in a very rough manner that when you're walking down the street one in 200 people that you run into are either symptomatic or asymptomatically carrying Covid-19. So is that a good number or a bad number? Well I'll? Take those odds I mean. How often will you get a bet like that you're going to make, and particularly if you wear a mask and you have students wearing masks- and you know you're careful, then those are pretty good odds. Are they perfect? No, if you're a risk-averse person and you're not willing to take any risks, then you're paralyzed, basically during this outbreak, and so those are the ways that I think you have to look at it. I also will lastly state on this topic that you look at it like. You, have a small bank of risks that you're willing to take and some are worth taking and others aren't. So, for example, you know, would I go to a sporting event or crowded restaurant or any event, and the answer is no, but would I go publicly or a place? Do I see my grandchildren yeah? You bet, I see them all the time they're in school. Could they get covered. Yes, I realize that I'm willing to take that risk. I'm not willing to take other risks, because this is a risk, that's very important, and so that's the way. I think you have to sort of spend your risk dollars wisely, because you're going to have to spend some of them you're not going to live in a world where there's no risk of Covid-19, I mean, and if you do then you're never leaving your home. So what else predictions I think there's going to be a decrease in respiratory viruses, because mass use for Covid-19 is going to cut that down. There'll be less flu, there'll be less rsv that plagues schools in the fall there'll be probably a shortage of rsv and cova tests, because there's going to be so many tests for kids going back to school and these kids are going to intermittently get sick and we're not going to know what it is and so they're going to need to be tested. I highly recommend that everybody get an influenza vaccine. Everybody thinks that influenza vaccines, major role, is to prevent flu. That's not what their major role is. Yes, it's great when it presents influenza, but the major role of influenza vaccine is to decrease on the morbidity and mortality of flu when it occurs. So if you get the flu shot, how many people tell me? I got the flu shot and I still got the flu and I said yeah. I say to them absolutely and you're still here to tell me about it. So the flu that you got was a lot more mild than it could be. The death rate overall from flu is about between one and three per thousand death rate from Covid-19 is probably ten times that number switching gears the symptoms of flu versus Covid-19. If you look on the left side of that slide, you will see that it is important for any clinician, including myself, who has seen hundreds of cases of both of these diseases to distinguish which one is flu and which one is Covid-19 and which one is adenovirus and which one is mycoplasma and which one is rhinovirus, because the real truth is they all look the same clinically and there are no distinguishing features. Yes, I can tell you that sore throat is less common with Covid-19 than it is with flu, but if somebody comes in with a sore throat, could it be covered yeah? Of course it could be. Five percent of people with Covid-19 have sore throats. The differences are as follows: a change in, or loss of, taste or mal a smell symptoms that develop within five days after exposure to somebody with known or suspected Covid-19 or within two days prior to the symptoms. Developing school aged children are at higher risk for getting multi-system inflammatory syndrome, which is a rare, serious complication of Covid-19. That is seen almost exclusively in children, but I will say it's rare number. One and number two is it's readily treatable and most all the kids have recovered. To date, flu much more acute onset than Covid-19 Covid-19 tends to stagger over a three to five day period of time. I don't feel well on monday, I feel a little worse on tuesday, but I went to work wednesday, not so good and then thursday and friday. Oh, my god, I got hit by a truck flu, is different. Most people with flu can tell you. I got sick at two o'clock. In the afternoon. I felt okay at one and by three I felt miserable symptoms develop one to four days after exposure to an infection. Individuals are contagious only for about a day before symptoms appear and they're contagious for a much shorter period. Time than Covid-19. Generally three days they become rapidly non-contagious. Five at the most young children, a higher risk of getting severe illness from flu, young children can die from flu, and so you have to distinguish these two now. How do you distinguish these two? Well, the only way to definitively is with a rsv pet test. That's one of those rna-based tests. It's stuck up your nose or your nasopharynx, and there are in the fall going to be combined Covid-19 and tests for flu rsv and other viruses, and those can be used to distinguish the two has Covid-19 wiped out the flu. I think that's way too premature to say that this is a look at brazil. This is a look at south, America and australia and what you can see in argentina- and these other places is that flu is dramatically less this year so far, six months into the bet into the pandemic and I'm almost finished I've taken too long. I apologize mark for that, but ventilation- and this is what I think is the scariest part of the schools. The schools are old, the schools have not been updated and they need to be opening. The windows is a reasonable tactic. If I'm in an uber or a cab, now I open the windows, I don't want the air conditioning on when I click with the windows closed, but hivax, which we call it need to be improved and portable hepa filters would help and we need to aspire to reach the ash rac standards, and this is an important point. I think I think that's my last slide, so I'm going to turn this over back over to you. Oh I'm, sorry. I have one last slide to make not to get into politics, but I do think we need to realize that what's happening in our country is an embarrassment. We have had one almost two million people test positive. We are approaching 200 000 deaths in our country and there are only four or five countries that are worse in the world or equal to us. They're, brazil, peru, south africa and all those countries have a lot higher immigrant populations and we should have done better and we can do better. So there's repeated breakdowns in our testing. There's confusing guidance about mass there's, a misunderstanding about the relationship between the virus and the economy. Anybody thinks that we're going to choose between the virus and the economy does not understand public health. The economy is never going to be good if the virus is not good, inconsistent messages and lack of effective travel restrictions and testing. So that's it. I will turn it back over to you great. Thank you. Thank you, dr farber, for a very informative presentation. I know folks may have questions as we go along, but let's turn it over to dr peter d'amico, who will you know, spend some time talking about coping through this period. Peter. Thank you michael. Thank you, dr faber, so everyone who's on this call. You you're doing yourself. You know well, in terms of you know, information is power, and I know just listening to this. Helped me feel more armed and, and you know, protected in some sense in terms of moving forward so free on behalf of your families and yourself, you have you, have more knowledge to base your decisions on and I'll try and do the same. So you know what what a very unusual and you know very difficult, overwhelming back to school. We have you know different than anyone in our lifetime has experienced. You know, you'd have to get folks who are over a century old to have anything similar to what has been experienced before and hear stories about it, and you know similar kinds of conflicts about keeping people's masks on, and you know fines for such and having a conflict in the social order in terms of keeping ourselves safe with this invisible enemy- and I don't know about you, but you know the more the more I talk to. Colleagues and you know, we've been doing a lot of stress. First aid work in our hospital with some of the frontline workers and the nurses and the physicians and man. People are just really and even beyond the healthcare workers and the folks who've combated. This directly. There's just a you know: a fatigue, that's just wearing us down, so you know we are. We are resilient for the most part in terms of the majority of folks. Even those who have you know high exposure to you know the stressors, but let's talk a little bit about what helped and maybe how to get us through. So some of the some of the stresses for caregivers, you know, can be enormous. I was just speaking to somebody this morning and as dr farber was saying, the announcement from new york city public schools that now you know they're not going to open until the 20th or so or a couple of weeks, hence from the original plan and all and just that news there was well, I think that's going to be my job. You know they were really on a tight rope in terms of being late, and you know in terms of spring and as as school was you know in terms of child care issues, and this looks like it was gonna, be the piece of information that was just gonna be too much, so folks are just really juggling these folks are dealing with so much. It's incredible. The degrees of stress that people are dealing with in terms of even anticipating what's to come, so work challenges. Of course, just in terms of safety and the danger there are you bringing danger home to your family, and you know factoring that in terms of the type of job that you have, then you know changing work schedules and you know- and that's part of the department was talking about the one to three day: hybrid role and or a plan from the from the schools and yet there's five different kinds of hybrid plans and they're not consistent across the board in terms of the actual days per the week. So it's really difficult and places a huge burden on families in terms of trying to adapt that and modify, and to ask for special considerations from employers and so forth. So all you know very difficult there coordinating space and time- and you know and just dealing with the ongoing uncertainty again, you know being armed with information and you know being able to make these individual and family decisions. Even you know, with the best intentions from your school and others in the community parenting challenges. You know, especially as dr farber mentioned, with younger kids and kids with special needs, and they should be given priority. Your school is saying they are considering that prioritized needs supporting social needs by staying safe. You know again, this covert brain in terms of the fatigue, and you know actually the antidote and or one of the car one of the precautions or some of the precautions for kovid is a risk for mental health. You know the isolationism, the quarantine, the distancing and so forth. You know my 17 year old daughter was just letting me know she can't live in a world where people can't touch each other. You know how she you know she this better end soon was her with her. What's her talk was her rant today, so offering guidance and ongoing uncertainty? Is you know and trying to find the words and trying to offer reassurance to children and to families and not having answers and part of that is being able to say I don't know, but you know we'll find out or when we know you know we'll take it from there. It's very hard as a parent to be in that position economic resources. So there are folks, of course, who you know you can't take for granted the fact that you know they have working computers and internet access. The extent that is needed for this remote existence in education. You know and then others are, have the burden of elder care. And are you part of that sandwich generation? You know where you're taking care of young ones and as well elderly at the same time, and then there's you know, stress of even just the being together. You know your family like each other anymore, and so we wondered we wanted that in the middle of the summer, with her with our kids, you know and establishing new routines and trying to deal with the increased proximity, and you know getting thrown off your routines and your way of life at home and folks are dealing with considerable losses. It's not just the loss of the you know our way of life, but actual you know, direct losses in terms of health, significant loss in terms of having losing folks opportunities to be with family members and friends, and some folks have you know, saw some positive outcomes of in terms of the remote world. You know maybe celebrating a holiday and having people come together. Who would never even be able to travel that far? You know what so the chief of our department in psychiatry was telling us about a family event where they had folks from you know four continents and seven countries that never would have been together for that holiday, and that was something new and different and potentially exciting. So there are some potential at times, positive outcomes from you know, and our learning of the technology and so forth and cost saving for businesses. But we remain in this place where you know we need to get to the other side, expect celebrations losses of you know. Just kind of you know: basic developmental milestones expected opportunities, so my kids are in that place, and you know my heart goes out to folks with younger kids. I don't know how my wife and I would be doing it- we're thinking about things a lot differently on some level we feel like we have the luxury of having a 16 and a 17 year old, who can take care of themselves and the child care issues, and you know the risk and you know and having to depend on and rely on the schools more heavily and we don't need to be doing that. So stress is for the kids and teens, of course, the physical distancing, loss of social supports event, cancellation, sports special. You know after school activities disrupted routines, and you know as a psychologist, who deals with schools and works with kids in our in our psychiatry department. So much is about the first thing we talk through with parents in terms when kids are dysregulated. Have you know issues with behavior with their mental health? Is let's just get back to the basics in terms of just the routines sleep and bedtime and meal times, and you know in school and and these are completely turned upside down- you know frustrations with caregivers and siblings and for older teens. You know the uncertainty about those transitions that that they were expecting or anticipating a significant impact of covert 19 across every aspect of life, and that includes schools. When I worked in your community after both 911 and hurricane sandy, in both of those disasters in the community, the school was the safe harbor. Once schools reopened, the school was a safe harbor, for you know getting back on your feet for consistency for stabilization and that's been taken away here right, because schools are also impacted and the loss of school is an anchor of security and consistency. Stabilization is really significant and really an extra stressor. That is some folks just enormous in terms of coping with that. So a little a vietnam cartoon about what it feels like being in 2020 here, but I thought I would it would some more information beyond what dr farber shared. I thought it would be important for folks again to be armed with information, and this is- and this is what your school has put out in terms of their response to the board of ed. You know: department of education, new york state who is actually using the department of health guidelines. You know to create their guidelines for schools needed to create a plan, all school districts in the state needed to create a plan and submit that plan, and this is the summary of your district's plan. You know, and it is. It is impressive, at least in terms of language and in terms of trying to respond to the critical issues that are outlined, and you know it is. It is relatively broad and exhaustive, but in just in terms of some things that you should be informed about just to be able to know to inform your kids to be able to hold the school accountable. You know to be able to speak to the ovid 19 coordinator in your school building. Then there should be one, that's one of the issues, but just some just what are some of those factors? The board of ed is saying that they have. They will have a 30-day supply for PPE at the department of education. All school buildings will be disinfected every night. That's every building. Every night overnight. High touch zones will be cleaned multiple times throughout the day. Any building or classroom, as dr farber was alluding to without adequate ventilation will not be used. Now. What is the criteria that? What is the enforcement? For that? I'm sure dr farber would have something to say about that. All students and staff will practice physical distancing in all school buildings. All students and staff will bear face coverings. The entire school day, including bus schools, are responsible for health screening. All students daily. They do burden as much as it can be back on the families in terms of supporting that and they're asking families to take care of that at home, and then report that indeed, your child does not have a temperature over a hundred. If that's not clear or that can't be communicated, then they are responsible for doing that on site at school. They are being asked and have agreed and are again making a pledge to you that they will be separate locations in every building for ill persons who are either suspected or have you know a temperature and those kids will be asked to wait either be picked up or permission to walk home if they're, older and live close by. So those are some of the cleaning and protection factors that are that's your pledge from your school from new york city, public schools, education, wise all, children are being educated five days a week. The pledge is to that remote students will interact with their teachers. Every day. Teachers will have time each day to engage one-to-one with students and families. They will prioritize in-person services for high-need students that is special ed and younger kids pre-k. As the top priority student schedules will be set and, as I mentioned before, however, it's not as consoling as it might be, because there's five different hybrid models being put out there and each school gets to choose what fits for them and that's really based on in-person space needs depending on population and those who have not opted out and do one in person learning at any time. A parent, a family can opt for full remote and it's just a form to fill out, or you know, communication to be made, and that can happen at any time going forward. Just a couple other things to keep in mind that there's also a mandate from the department of health and or guidelines. I should say, and through the new york state department of ed, that a full-time nurse will be in every building. I don't know how folks will be able to accommodate that, but and then identified within the building, and it may be the nurse and maybe someone else with a health background. A kovac coordinator will be identified in every building. There'll be multiple platform forms used for timely communication of things and there'll be free testing available for those who want it and then confidentiality of any contact tracing if tested positive. So dr farber reviewed some decision making in terms of closing regarding test positive of number of kids in a classroom and or a school overall, the district is saying anything over three percent infection rate across seven day average in the city, across the schools or in the city itself, and the whole district will close down. So that's some information to be informed that all of this information can be found on the website for the go to bed. But I thought you would want to know those basics there's more to take from that document. So where do we begin? You know, and some you know some of the advice and in terms of looking at where we're at is how to how to just get through right in terms of this isolation and so forth, we do have to start as parents and caretakers caregivers with our for ourselves right. So, first and foremost, you know trying to find some level of calm. Some level of you know being able to you, know your oxygen mask on so to speak, the metaphor right in the brain when there's when there's an emergency so taking care of your own mental health, your own health needs getting sleep, finding some way to speak and communicate in a composed manner. You know to even if you're as anxious as you might be inside, certainly sharing feelings, but you know trying to reduce alarm across the board, so a model that we've been using at the hospital and to talk to healthcare workers and to talk to folks about what's a what's a nice way of doing this place that we're at and how to think about taking care of ourselves. But we have some. This model called stress, first aid, and it has five essential elements, promote what we're gonna call resilience and recovery and resilience. We'll talk a little bit more in a moment: the ability to bounce back the ability to bounce forward. However, you see it, but there's essentially you know some ways of thinking about it and the first of which, of course, the primary factor is a sense of safety, and you know, maybe you felt more. Maybe you felt less safe listening to dr farber and hearing more from the news and being armed, but the uncertainty is the uncertainty and safety issues predominate in terms of people's ability to you know, think clearly and be able to you know, move forward in terms of, as dr barbara says not be paralyzed. You know there is some need to act. You need to do something. You first need to feel safe in order to do that so and it's a notion of relative safety, isn't it right? It is a time of great uncertainty, so relative safety being informed. And can you answer the question, and can you say this to yourself? I've done everything I can I'm doing everything I can and that I know of myself and my loved ones and those I care about safe and that and that's going to have to be the answer right in terms of that effort. That degree of efficacy there isn't going to be a perfect answer. To that, are you able to come yourself? Are you able to disrupt this vigilance? This? You know this th, this Covid-19, you know kind of a cloud this nightmare that hangs over us. Are you able to separate from that? Are you able to some time where of coming, take care of yourself to carry your body and disrupt that vigilance of always being in a relative alarm state, a worried, state, a state of uncertainty and then importantly, a connection, and we find that so many folks who are dealing with the stresses directly and otherwise many of them really find with one of the one of the big strategies. Most helpful is about connecting socially connecting with family and, as I said, you know, the questions for Covid-19 are against that right in terms of social competence and your social health. So you need to make deliberate efforts to make that happen. For yourself, are you able to say, and can you recognize and realize we're working with a lot of the healthcare workers and talking to folks, is to try and recognize? There are things you are doing that are making a difference. It feels it feels like it's uphill. It feels like you know like like there's, not much control. You have over things, but you are making a difference. Can you see that? How is it that you can see it in others, and not yourself about the you know the perseverance that you're having getting through this and the resilience that you're showing and that often can lead to feelings of hope and being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so another strategy or tool that folks have found helpful, is thinking about the stress on a continuum in terms of green, yellow, orange and red, and this has been really helpful for us to communicate with folks and talk groups and think about where you're at in terms of self-assessment. In terms of your emotional, you know position and posture about where you are and most of us at a baseline. All of us really are probably standing in the yellow there's. You know very few people who are really in the green or they may be temporarily or sporadically in the green, but we're all probably standing most of the time in the yellow reaching towards orange and in terms of that threat of injury, stress, injury, and so the stress continuum is, you know, basically features and looking at signs and symptoms about. How are you doing you know? Is it? Are you at your optimal functioning and most of us are not? Is it something that's mild and transient? Are you taking care of yourself? Are you getting some sleep? Are you connecting socially? Are you know doing doing what you can in terms of controlling things or is it building and is it? Is it moving towards the orange and the red in a place of potential stress injury and putting yourself at risk in terms of mental health? So one of the probably the slide that has the most information in terms of you know all together at once in terms of what you know, the five pillars and some of which I've already mentioned. But let's talk about practicing the five r's. There's always you know a new packaging for this information, so just saying the same thing in different ways and putting it together and in terms of some acronyms and some ways of thinking about. It is helpful, but reassurance remind yourself that your feelings are okay and not just okay. They're expected, it is expected for us to be feeling stress and it's understandable in terms of where we're at and that we're feeling a little unhinged and feeling overwhelmed and beyond our capacity at times more than we have in the past. There are positive things that you can do for yourself to get through this hard time and affirm that you, as I said before, you're doing everything you can and know of yourself and others safe. If you can say that, then you are in that place of relative safety. There is no certainty here. Routines are very important, especially for children, for families how they operate. Keeping yourself sane- and I think us we've come to the conclusion that we need to develop new routines, because we just can't seem to get back to the ones that we're missing and ground us so we're creating new routines for yourself regulating our stress again calming you know to manage. You want to actively engage in strategies that will help you calm practice, deep, breathing, taking a walk. You know, journaling, drawing your feelings. Listening to music, your favorite song, you know closing your eyes using imagery, taking yourself away but doing something disruptive effect, because it is, you know it is chronic and it is really draining and we have to try and find you know, moments of escape and calm connecting reconnecting we talked about, but it requires a deliberate effort, that's away from that risk of isolation and despair that we're in terms of our precautions for kovid. So it does require a purposeful effort, a deliberate effort, connect with loved ones and keep yourself and offer that support to others and, lastly, in terms of hope, you know reaching for meaning reaffirming your values. You know why you're doing what you're doing every day, how you just you know hitting it one more time you know and persevering and living to your values and maybe awakening your spiritual side and revisiting that, recognizing that your actions are making a difference, even small things like you know, showing up one more time. You know making one more meal when you can barely tolerate opening the fridge and thinking about it. That way. So this notion, the goal is resilience and what's interesting about stress and resilience, is you would think that you know in this kind of you know this kind of this pandemic and this level of stress and the an enormous burden? That's on some folks, but even something as extreme as kind of like veterans in war who have experienced death, and you know in battle and just extreme levels of high vigilance of stress, ongoing and trauma potential trauma. You think majority of veterans must have ptsd right and it's not so the majority of folks, even in really extreme circumstances, majority of people will bounce back. Will bounce forward will be resilient, which is the ability to cope effectively and address? You know adjust to stressful situations, so that is what we expect when we speak to our care. You know our health care workers that resilience is expected. You know they expect that of themselves, but you know still reaching out and asking for help and you know kind of taking it one day at a time. In that way, there are some factors that support family resilience. What are those and, in short, they are belief, systems in terms of your values and how you guys identify yourselves and think about yourselves in terms of your family and your family system roles, rituals and routines that we've spoken a little bit about in terms of persevering, but also showing flexibility, which of course, is now needed more than ever. Communication is key in terms of you know, making it a developmental level of kids in terms of their age, but also how your as partners and his family. You know how the adults are doing and communicating effectively and making changes where needed, and then problem solving, of course together in a way that so a little bit about the belief systems, you know and making sure that it's realistic in terms of hope that you have and again it's you know it's kind of a relevant or I should a rel, a relative, a sense of hope in terms of what you know what you could be wishful about, drawing some positive meaning from difficult times identifying yourself as someone who is persevering as a coping family, and we certainly hear that from a lot of our health care workers. That's why I went into this field. This is what I do, I'm a I'm a helper. You know I expect that this is gonna, be I knew that I was gonna, be called on to do this and so forth. So what is you know? Are you able to extract some meaning from this in terms of what what persevering through it look like for you and for your children in terms of modeling that and getting through it together? The rituals and routines I mentioned you know, but you know having some flexibility with meeting that situation and some examples are, you know, kids having drive-by parties and, having you know, more social distancing opportunities. My daughter had her 17th birthday. She was really bummed out, wasn't able to mean this was in april, so it was at the height of you know. A lot of there was no way we were going to take a risk and have any kind of in-person party, but they had a a zoom. That was a surprise and she wound up getting like 20 30 kids showing up writing songs, reciting, poetry, four or five hours into the late night, and she was saying was that it was one of the best birthday surprises and parties she's ever had in terms of the outpouring of affection, so finding opportunities and being flexible with that and again I mentioned earlier, creating new family rituals or routines, I think, is important for us to feel grounded in what those can look like some role issue about roles- and I know a lot of folks have been talking about- you- know really being overwhelmed with both. You know, trying to coming home from work and then also having to deal with or trying to work from home and then also trying to deal with the remote learning from school, and you know and trying to not, you know not being able to have access to child care and trying to pull off this. You know magic trick in terms of all the juggling that goes on, but constant re-juggling and redistribution of parenting roles and shared. You know between the adults and families and the real importance of communication in terms of renegotiating that, in terms of you know, parents and grandparents and so forth and kids may also be changing their roles. So you know our kids are doing a lot more in terms of chores and taking care of the home than they were before and other others that, and we have some ailing grandparents that live nearby and they've been taking on more responsibilities with that as well in terms of spending time and doing things for them to help out. You know and then actually, my daughter's all been interested in taking on one more. So our families have talked about that too, in terms of helping out so again, preservation of routines and then also creating new ones overall, with a child who we been working with in the clinic as an example with the expected school was a kid who who was? We made some accommodations with the parent in terms of trying to advocate, but you know some kids who have special needs and kids in particular with autism, are very rule-governed and you know very rigid about you know following a schedule, and things being the same. So this kid was trying to adjust to the to the light to the home life of remote learning and was really thrown off the fact that he had jim or wasn't having jim and he was supposed to have jim at 10 o'clock and he was having english zoom english at 10 o'clock and he was really having some real strong behavioral reactions and meltdowns and emotional stress about it and just a little bit of flexibility there. In terms of you know the school and the the schedule where he at 10 o'clock was expecting to be in gym and he didn't have gym, he was asked or he was allowed to go outside and do some jumping jacks and do a little bit of activity in the driveway at 10 o'clock outside of the house and then and english was moved to 10 30 as it had been in the school, and it really calmed things down for him. So these kinds of adjustments being flexible accommodating you know especially special needs. This example working that out and then, of course, try and find time for self-care and some fun information sharing, again really important that you are here tonight, listening even at least being informed about your school's plan, their response to the governor, their response to the department of education, their you know, promise so to speak to you and the neighborhood and the city and the student body, and being informed about that and sharing that with your kids in terms of knowing what to expect does that help them feel safer. They know what to look for. I would practice some mask wearing if it's not something that you know you've been doing and going out and the kids are going to have to have it on all day and on the bus and so forth, and that's not something you've been doing. Who knows how long they can tolerate it? And so you know you might want to practice that some and have some exposure to that before they get in there, but you know being letting them know what to expect and what the plan is and that kid should be wearing mass staff. And you know, anyway, all of those features that we spoke about in terms of the promise that the school is making. I talked about communication in terms of making sure it's at a developmental level, and you know because kids at home and we're together more, I think, being a little bit more careful about you know, sharing news and watching. Certainly, limiting media could really heighten kids, anxieties and fears and so forth, so limiting and knowing what they're watching and that's hard to do because you know are on their phones and they're on their computer and but finding a way. You know to make sure that what they're hearing is factual, accurate and appropriate for their age level, of course, and then you know reaching out and using resources so again, more helpful examples in terms of communication in terms of feelings, using the stress, thermometer or the stress continuum and talking about it that way and be able to communicate our feelings and where we're at and then problem solving together in terms of family meetings. You know, brainstorming together making adjustments where we need to and then seeking resources- and we do have some examples here for folks in terms of resources and there's a lot of good information out there. National child, traumatic stress network special needs resources from our own center here at lij stride center in terms of special needs: kids over 19 pandemic resources in terms of discussing coronavirus with your children, helping teens manage with 19 managing family conflict and so forth. So lots of lots of good information sesame street has a lot of good for younger kids, has a lot of good videos and so forth. So there's a lot of resources out there and you might want to take advantage of them. These slides could be shared, you'd, certainly check these out and click on them. I'll stop there, and let's have some time for for questions comments, feedback for myself for dr farber and for mayor bellows and dr ellison who's joined us as well, and I'm not sure we are you hear us mayor yes. Signing on dr bellason is also on psychologist from our you want to introduce yourself mayor just so folks know where you're coming from and sure. Thank you and thank you, dr farber. I'm with the senator stress injury, maybe you're, breaking up pretty bad yeah, so yeah it was. Is your voice, so yeah you're going through sporadically, I'm not sure, I'm not sure we could hear you clearly michael. Are we? Are you prepared to go to the questions? I have four questions in the q and a or do you want to? Yes, oh no. That sounds great mark. Let's do that. So I think dr farber, you covered this question. The first question was around: how does the ventilation system in old buildings have an impact on the opening of schools? I think you covered that, but any additional thoughts yeah I don't blame parents and teachers and everybody for being skeptical about the city. I think they're going to have to hold them to this promise, he's made it in public. He promised that this would be done. I think it's okay in the fall and the winter if the windows are open, believe it or not, opening the windows helps enormously. Obviously that is not going to be solution, a solution when the when it gets cold out and it's not a solution for common areas where there aren't windows, so those ventilations need to be done and I think we have to hold those people responsible to make sure that gets done in a timely manner. I don't blame people for being nervous about it. Great. Thank you, one other question that came up. I work in a high school and the likelihood that students will keep their masks on all day. I believe is unrealistic. What suggestions do you have on how to deal with this issue? It's tough! It's really tough, I'm sure you're right and you know I think you know I wish I had an easy, quick answer. I think you need to constantly reinforce. It has to be zero tolerance for non-masking for this to work and if masks are not going to be worn, then there has to be at least a six foot distance between people. I wish I had a better answer. You know when I, when I think, when I think of kids walking through that maze and you know and assessing for themselves on a period to period moment-to-moment day-to-day basis about where the risk is and who's putting them at risk and what they have control over. I mean what I would tell my kid just like you would mention and or have a plan for them in terms of bullying that might be going on in the school. Think of the overt risk as a bully is, you know, make your own plan in terms of you know. Why? Don't you wait until after the bell, as you know, and you're gonna have to hang out low and look for the passages in your school. I mean it's on an individual basis right, but in addition to, of course, reporting it to teachers and letting the adults know to try and hold others accountable, but you know finding your own. You know at least dangerous path through the school and through the day and thinking about that again period by period I mean that's a lot to think about and a lot to put on, but I think might be the only choice you have. Thank you peter and then the only if the final one here is this is very informative. Presentation can attendees receive this slideshow, especially those working in schools and mark. Will you assist with that? I will. What what's going to happen? Is we will post this presentation on our website tomorrow and michael I'll? Send I'll send you the information on that in case anybody comes directly to the hospital and wants to get it from there awesome. I just have one question for dr farber: if you could just elaborate on ventilation from the standpoint of open windows versus hvac or air conditioning, and what the difference is with respect to contamination. Air conditioning is not great in depends upon the air conditioning, but if they are, if they are ventless units which are increasingly being used, if anything, they can spread Covid-19 and that's happened in many outbreaks in restaurants and other locations. So when I'm talking about ventilation, I'm talking about not having air recirculated the way it typically does at very low rates in closed buildings. The rates have to be higher and it has to be filtered, and so you know, the direct answer to your question is air conditioning is not good, not that it's bad if the rate of ventilation is appropriate and the filters are there, but routine air conditioning by itself is not adequate. Open windows are a lot better than air conditioning, as I indicated in a car. I definitely keep the windows open and don't put on the air conditioning, even if it's hot, but in answer to your question, what parents and what the community deserve is hivac and hepa filtration in the schools so that, whether it's cold or hot or raining, we don't depend on things like opening the windows, which I don't recommend in a normal situation. But it's if those improvements are not going to be made. It's the best alternative, as opposed to doing nothing and keeping the windows closed. And what about fans do fans play a part in this? If you have fans play a part if they improve pushing the air out so at the hospital we have used fans we've actually in the height of Covid-19, when our ventilation wasn't up to speed, we broke windows that were never supposed to be open. We cut holes in them and, yes, we put fans next to the windows so that air was being blown outside. The concept is we're trying to get rid of recirculated air and air that's contaminated. I mean just to give you an example mark the best and safest way of doing this, which is not necessary, but if you have a very sick covert patient, you know you want to put them in a negative pressure room. The negative pressure room in a hospital means that all the air of that room is exiting a vent and not within a 10-foot radius of an intake vent so that, basically, that air does not recirculate to other people and so yeah. Putting a fan next to an open window is a reasonable thing to do. Thank you, doctor mark, I believe, that's all the questions we have very good again. I want to thank each of you for your participation and your expertise. I want to tell our audience that this will be posted on our website tomorrow, and thank you very much and I look forward to our next collaboration. Thank you mark. Thank you all have a great evening. Thanks very extended weekend, folks, good night, good night good night, peter.
