If people can see you at the time, you're speaking so I will let you know when topics are open for comment by committee, members board members and the general public, if you, as you know, we're doing this through WebEx. So if you want to speak, use the WebEx feature in the participants panel to digitally, raise and lower your hand, and we will call on you in order if you have questions that don't get her during our public comment.
So if you require any accommodation or assistance or you know of anyone who needs those things for full participation, please contact the district office at least 72 hours before any public meeting takes place.
I can't do that in person tonight, but we're very fortunate that we have a very really good, large crowd interested in what's going on tonight, so I think if anybody has the opportunity to speak, hopefully you will introduce yourself at that point in time.
So I want to take this moment for those both the committee members who haven't had this chance yet and everyone else on the call to welcome our new liaison, who we are very fortunate when it comes to tech.
We really appreciate it we're going to be talking tonight, both about Commodore, Barry, Park and perhaps capital projects in general about the parks and also work on our annual update of capital projects.
So if anybody who is not a committee member has something that they want to say about those things briefly at this point in time in a moment, I will give you the opportunity to do so.
Instead, we're I have an update on the parse Department capital projects, so with that I think I can amend that on my own Rob and then ask for approval of the agenda based on that change.
I am -, I'm, always delighted to have people from the parks department here, I think we work closely with them and we really I think they listen to us.
The topic is capital projects in general, but I think your focus is gonna, be on Commodore Barry Park, which is something that's very dear to everybody's heart on this committee and put a lot of focus on it and as well as the other Park, so I'm gonna turn it over to you Davy and thank you again for being here great Thank, You Barbara and thank you thank you.
So I can tell you which ones are still on our list and which ones you know on have been, and then the capital update will tell you which ones have been funded and where those I didn't know, if you I didn't think to ask beforehand, but hey I may have whether you have a PowerPoint or you're gonna share a screen tonight at all I, don't know how I have a PowerPoint for the capital update the status.
First, I don't have a presentation for that, so yeah, so covin, 18, right, I, think the formal shutdown started sometime in mid March or, and maybe before, I start.
As you know, members of the community that also service parks and help maintain that.
So you know initially when people needed to stay home because of childcare issues, we work through systems with that you know kind of incredibly, we went from no preparations for a work from home arrangements to suddenly a large portion of especially our administrative staff working from home in order to reduce people kind of being on top of each other in the office, which was a big feat for some of our IT work.
Unfortunately, you know I, think in the interest of safety, we've had to close a lot of parks, amenities and I shared in the chat, the link to the parks website web page.
Obviously this thing is changing everyday, but what I can recommend is if you're thinking about it, get your permit in and if you have any question, Nancy and her staff are amazing in the permit office, so Nancy Jose, Joe Darnell, all those guys can help you out so feel free to give them a call Nancy's in the office most day.
I'll try not to bore you guys on this, but look at that website that has it and that will be updated as we evaluate things, but right now, I think one of the big ones is playgrounds or clothes.
I'm, probably gonna miss some things here, basketball courts are closed and we took that we had to take the hoops down actually, which was a painful thing for us to do, but it's something we felt it was the thing that could guarantee that you know we could maintain social distancing.
You know that takes place and you normally I think we start this around February and obviously we couldn't do this training with the virus happening.
I know that the mayor said he's still looking into it, but there are just a lot of logistics in terms of hiring workers getting them on board and in addition to the lifeguards there's, you know, if there's a lot of our seasonal staff that works at the pools, as you guys might encounter during summer.
Think the last thing I'll say that community gardens have been closed, but what we've been allowing through our green thumb program is for some people to you know for a kind of the minimal amount of maintenance to happen in order to keep these Gardens alive and well so green thumb gardens are closed, but you know some maintenance can take place.
If anyone has any is we've entered phase one, what amenities get opened in the phase, one phase we're taking our cues from City Hall, so you know we initially thought it was going to be a little bit more.
So if there's a park near you, but the whole site is closed due to you know some amenities that might be in it.
Can you share sort of the dynamics behind that, and you know the suggestions that I've heard have been proactive, like people should take their own garbage out so which exists in a lot of parks.
It was, you know, clearly garbage out with you, so just what sort of creating the dynamic and then are there efforts to put signage up or otherwise to direct people to take the garbage out with them anything you can share on that and then I have a second question after others have gone.
If you can take stuff out and not throw it out in the park, it might seem little okay, you know it might just be a coffee cup and you know a couple napkins, but over time, if everybody does, it does add up so yeah.
We don't have any plan to do any signage about it at the moment, but you know I think one thing we're grappling with is not having our full summer seasonal staff and at that hurt a lot.
You know we'll do one thing at Commodore Barry, but it would be a different sign at another Park or a different.
I think Candace might have had a question, but I don't know she disappeared.
So now that Suzanne's question was a little bit about the garbage you touched on not having a seasonal stab, but with all of like the protests and the March that are happening, a lot of them start or end in our district like a cabbie Plaza or tree park.
So what is the parks department doing in terms of like you know, still making I?
We are just kind of where we're just being cognizant of the event and trying to send our people back out once the event has cleared out so like admin once they go across the bridge or for once they come down so we're just trying to be as responsive as possible make sure the bathrooms are cleaned.
You could think of it in the lines of you see those like white ghost bikes around the city, so some of them you know so we've instructed staff.
We don't have any plan at the moment to open up the large pavement area, but I wish I had a better answer for you, but at the moment there's no point: are you trying to envision Carroll Park, because I have been there yeah and in his jams, but I feel but I, don't know how many has anyone with?
Has anyone with authority been on a site visit of Bridge Park to because it appears like there's a like very tall, serious metal gate that could separate the two so to the right to what seemed to be a reason why it could I just wonder if it's actually been closely looked at or if it was just sort of you know, part of it, especially since the park is going to be renovated.
You know, maybe it was a carefully considered, but, as we all know, every spin asked our staff to look into it and I can try to get you a better answer after the call yeah.
Obviously the huge issue with Domino Park yeah, not in our district, but that you know they had introduced the social distinct circles I.
It's like one of the markers that you put on top of a sprinkler or something to sort of get folks separated, yeah I mean I, think we we've thought about it.
You know I, think, there's a bit of an enforcement issue with respect to like mulling circles in it.
You know if you have suggestions, we're open to them and we can listen to them, but nothing's planned for at the moment, I think did you bring up sprinklers as well?
I can do it publicly for all you've done for the parks committee, while I've been the chair and how much I appreciate it and I didn't mention you at the beginning of the program, but I don't think you had joined at that point so, but thank you for being here and for all you've done.
If someone else in your office on the call has access to the file and is able to share content, maybe they could run the visual while you provide audio or you know, let me I can try to email it to you guys right now, so it's a bit yep, and so, if you guys could just bear with us for a second sorry about that, I'm gonna, send it to the bko to email address.
So you know those sites that were scheduled and then that's just for a concise that you know, we've had the budget approved and it was in construction for those sites that have yet to start construction, I think the timeline is even more delayed and we're looking at you know we're looking at projects that we're supposed to start in the spring, getting pushed back to late summer or even into the fall, if not sometime, in 2021, because you know some of these projects made it through the procurement cycle to the point where they were bid out and they and we had a contractor on board ready to go some projects, never even made it to that point, and so the Office of Management and Budget is kind of telling us to just slow down a little bit and to hold back from releasing new bids until they can kind of inventory.
I know: we've had a lot of issues with trash collection, which was a tough one for us to work out when the Park first opened so well.
We also got all the lighting to work in the park that was a bit of a struggle with Quixote and kind of ascent, but I think everything should be up and running at the moment next, so Cadman Plaza.
You know as I think the people in the parks committee are aware.
At the moment, thanks yeah same thing with this one, this is kind of the main plaza area now I'm at the bottom.
The council member has put other money into this project at the moment you know, but keep in mind it's a twelve million dollar price tag to redo that whole section.
So what I heard in general was tell me if I misheard that obviously their delays until the city can figure out the budget impacts from coal bed and have a sort of floats down to park but bridge park -, given that the funding is in place from the Jehovah's Witnesses like is that Ana different, you know?
So I don't know, sir know what they're thinking in terms of releasing projects yeah but I mean Yin. We would have started this spring.
You know we're gonna just wait and see what happened yeah for those of you, who've never been on the capital tracker website, Chris Campbell, just shared it.
Okay, thank you, I think any other committee members all right.
Are you doing you guys hear me yeah, okay, so I did hear you say that there won't be any locker rooms, anything big look for sports teams at the present time, I have three containers in the park that I maintain and to make sure that really free and keep them very clean.
You know, even if it's a mobile facility inside the park and design I believe so I, don't see why but I don't think.
We know how busy everyone is, and the parks have been a wonderful respite during this time it just it's so great to be able to go out and enjoy just being walking through a park yeah very fortunate well day, and thank you guys for being advocates.
You know these are the types of things that how I think the budget cuts will start manifesting themselves in your neighborhoods, so just be mindful of that, and obviously we're doing the best that we can.
Just let me know, and we can work with you guys, I'm trying please reach out to us.
Rather, the look at this statement of community needs, so I hope people have looked at it, I'm open to changes or do we need to remove anything I have something I'd like to add when we get so is there anyone who wants to start that discussion right?
Since so much of this takes so long, I don't know if the emphasis is necessary, but that's a question anything and in the needs for parts session, section three lines down from the top starting with he talked about the southern portion of Clinton Hill.
Sorry, there are different subheadings that could be put at as the most important issue, your request or the community boards request doesn't fit into any of those specific titled buckets, and so many questions other the bucket that slept over I just want to say thank you, I think we're gonna we're going to take off.
I hope we stay that way to finish up by 8 o'clock, but a community forum does anyone who's, not a committee member have something they want to share.
That looks like else all right, so I'm going to assume welcome everyone, and you have delighted I- was that we're happy meeting we haven't met since March or no I think was we haven't met.
Think then, we've gotten through here with little glitches and did you make it onto the call I know you were here at least part of the time, but we'll have to work on that with Andrea, and so I am delighted to see everybody, even if it's this way, rather than in person and I'd love to think back in September I mean going forward to September that we'll be meeting in person, but there are no guarantees at the moment.
