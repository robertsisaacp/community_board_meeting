And before I start the regular introduction of the members, I am going to read, or paraphrase some of the information, because we're being recorded and so on. So since we've called it to order the recording begins meeting. Is the youth education, cultural affairs committee of the brooklyn community board two it's being recorded for the purpose of transparency and for public access on the cb2 youtube archive? Okay? So please keep your microphones muted when you're, not speaking, so that we can hear the other folks and the district staff who are also on this call will actively assist in maintaining this. We will be conducting remote meetings with the committee members cameras on full transparency. We encourage attendees to leave the cameras on, especially if you're, given the flaw to speak, I'm going to make it known which topics are open for comment by community members board members or the public, and if you wish to speak, you can use the webex feature to digitally, raise your hand, and I can call on you if you have a question that falls outside of the public comment. Type your questions in the chat panel and we will address them as applicable.

So we want to provide access to our neighbors, regardless of their ability or limitation and contact the district staff 72 hours before public meetings. Excuse me if you need any accommodation or assistance, so we're going to begin the roll call I'll call on the members and they can introduce themselves and say their position on the committee and in the board dorothea. Can you unmute dorothea thompson, so I will probably do more learning than talking. Thank you. I have nick. Can you introduce yourself yeah good evening, everybody nick ferreira committee and board member? Thank you, santia, hello, santiago, committee, member and board member great, thank you and I'm very excited to introduce oscar who will introduce himself but he's a new member to our committee and he's a young person who attends high school and we're absolutely delighted he's been coming to our committee now for a while and welcome oscar. Please introduce yourself. Thank you, hi everyone. My name is oscar, I'm on the committee and board member welcome okay. So before we start our business, I just want to reflect that since our committee last met in february, a community as well as people have experienced tremendous loss and we acknowledge that and our country is going through a very challenging time. Hopefully it can lead to a better democracy and a better place for all of us, but we acknowledge that the pain that people are feeling- oh right now, so if we can have a moment, thank you. Okay. So generally we have the approval of the agenda. So I'm going to ask the committee members by consensus is the agenda. Okay, are we going fast with the agenda? Are there any objections? Okay, so I assume that we're going both with the agenda. We have two basic topics tonight: the introduction to the brooklyn book bodega. We will be hearing from and an update on, the school operations and summer school and so on from district 13. and then, as usual, we go through our approval of minutes, chairs report, other business and community forum, and I want to acknowledge that we have a representative from the library we might have a representative from the madison boys and girls club and perhaps others. So that's the time in community forum to please share about your organization's work and activities. Okay, thank you. So I'd like to introduce the co-founder of the brooklyn book bodega. I hope I pronounced your name correctly. Sema aguero, welcome. I'm delighted to have you speak with our committee, so tell us about the brooklyn book ortega great thanks for having us. Let me just get my presentation here: set up. Okay, great. Can everyone see the slides? That's great! Yes, okay, great! Thank you. So thank you again for having us today. My name is sima aguero and I'm the co-founder of the brooklyn book bodega. I have about 20 years of process and program management experience and I'm also a resident of downtown brooklyn a proud resident. I should say for the past 13 years I also have three children, two in elementary school and one middle school, and then I'm gonna, actually let my colleague, rebecca cohen, also introduce herself she's on the call today with us, rebecca you're on right. I think I saw you yeah rebecca. You are unmuted, you can go ahead and speak. I'm just hearing some quiet little electronic chirps. So maybe that's not working tonight. Okay, I can introduce you introduce her. So rebecca is my co-founder. She works in education at all levels, at primary, secondary and collegiate teaching children and devising curriculum for schools. She started teaching middle school in baltimore city 20 years ago and has been working on issues of literary access and equity for her entire career. She has three sons so between the two of us, we have six kids, if you can believe it or not so rebecca, and I are both the leadership team for the organization. So today we wanted to share with you our mission, the timeline of our organization, the impact thus far to the community, how we've been operating during coven 19 and then how we would love for people to get involved with our organization and then, if time permits we'll have q a. I know, we've been asked to keep our presentation to 15 minutes because you guys have a full agenda today, but we have our contact information at the end. So first I'll share with you the mission of the book of the bodega and the mission is to increase the number of 100 plus book homes in new york city. There's, research that shows that households with 100 plus book homes, boost life outcomes for children, adolescents, and we have educators on the call today. So I'm sure you can speak to that also and know how important it is. So, despite the resources, though, and the wealth and the growth in brooklyn, we recognize that our community actually is a book desert, which just means that areas have few books available for sale or for lending, and we strongly believe that children should be able to grab a book and be at home and immerse themselves in it. So we created the brooklyn book bodega, which is free for anyone, regardless of your family's economic status, we provide free books, we have free events, we have free literacy programming and we are bridging communities by providing all these resources for free and through this we strongly believe in six areas and those are discovery of oneself, book ownership, reuse and passing forward gently used books, book access book choice and then, lastly, engaging in a purposeful community around literacy. So just in the interest of time today, I'm just going to share a little bit more about ownership, book access and building a community see my if you need a few. A few more minutes feel free to do that. Oh okay, I can slow down a little bit great. I appreciate that thanks, rob so sort of the areas of focus is one is ownership, so you can see children. We really strongly believe that children should have lots of books in their home and what you're seeing here is a stamp that we put in all of our books. So kids can write their names in their in the books, and we know that books at home makes it more like likely that children will have exposure to vocabulary, which then leads to them to thrive at school and then in general in life. And then, if you put books in accessible places for everyone, it just creates a book culture which then becomes part of one's home culture. Also, I can touch upon discovery since I have a few extra minutes. So that's you know similar in the sense that you know. We believe that kids can see themselves in the books that they read and it's even more important now with the current state of our country, that books do act as windows and mirrors for children also and then lastly reuse. The idea there is that books are meant to be read multiple times, but books. Also at some point, kids have outgrown them, but other families would love them. So the idea of passing on books to other people in the community is also important and then the next three are around access, choice and community. So we strongly believe that families should have access to books and they may not have the excess cash to purchase books. So I don't know if many of you know, but the average hardcover children's book is 18.68 cents and that was reported in 2018.. So we want to give away the book so that cost is no longer a barrier to ownership. For kids. Community is another area that we strongly believe in oops. I jumped ahead a choice so choice. You know, I think it's important for kids to be able to choose the books that they want to read and have access to a variety of books, and then the third is around community. So we because we're bridging communities and we're open to to the public to any community we're really welcoming diverse backgrounds from people from different social, economic classes, race and culture, and so it's not uncommon to see at our events, people from public housing and then people who own a multi-million dollar apartment sitting and reading together with their kids and we found downtown brooklyn is a great location to bridge communities together. So now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the organization we're a young organization that was started in december of 2018 and what we did is we piloted programs? First at the ingersoll cornerstone community center. We are a hundred percent volunteer run, including myself and rebecca, and one of the many questions that people ask us is: where is the bodega, so there's no physical bodega, we're partnering with other organizations and schools and businesses for our programs. Right now, we spent most of last year working building our relationship at the ingersoll cornerstone community center at nycha, and we hosted five public events at that community center, which was open to anyone, and then we also had private school events in the neighborhood in in downtown brooklyn, and then in the middle of last year. We also received our 501c3, which is a huge milestone for many nonprofits, and then we decided in 2020 to expand to another location and the brooklyn navy yard was able to give a space to run our events, and I think someone from the call is here from the brooklyn navy yard, so I'll just give them a shout out, because that has also been great for us during Covid-19 and I'll share a little bit about that later. This year before Covid-19, we had three successful events and we had, on average about 350 parents and children attend each of those events, so I'll share a little bit more about coven in a second, but before I get into that, I'm going to share a little bit about the impact that we've had so far with some of the numbers. Okay. So since we started in december of 2018 up until now, which is about 19 months, we have been partnering with many local organizations from businesses to schools and we're utilizing them for either book collection or volunteers. Our distribution to the community we've been working with the walt whitman library and the brooklyn public library annex also, and building partnerships with them. In addition, we've also had quantitative impact, in addition to the quantitative impact, I can also share some qualitative impact through the surveys that we also have families fill out when they attend, and some of the some of the information they've expressed with us is having books at home has really improved their kids reading skills, their love for reading and then just also just having family time together to read. But now I'm going to share with you sort of covet 19 and how we've had to pivoted our distribution model, because we are not hosting any events and we don't foresee hosting any events through the rest of this year. Based on you know the guidelines so I'll get a little bit I'll get into that. So since covert 19, our last large distribution was on march 14th to ps287, which is the school just kitty corner from wegmans. We handed out 500 books there and then the monday after new york city school doors were closed. So we knew that then, that we needed to shift our model and we weren't going to be able to go into schools. At that point, we really need to get books into homes, because schools were going to be closed and libraries for the foreseeable future, and during this time one teen wrote to us about the start at the start of the pandemic, and I want to share what he wrote to us to everyone. I know I would love some books, I'm between 12 years old and cannot read online. It hurts my eyes. I have eye issues. I can read anything level, I'm a very strong reader, but I really miss the library. So when we got that letter in at the end of march early april, we were like, we really need to work, to get books out into communities and into homes, because kids do want to be able to read in their own home and may not have the books. So we did. Is we set up a model where we were distributing books with essential organizations that were handing out things, handing out food and supplies to the community, and so we've distributed about 6, 500 books so far to different community-based organizations and right in the community board two area we've distributed to 307 to 261 and the farragut cornerstone community center. Also, and then I also wanted to share with you a letter that we got from a principal once they received a delivery from us, so they said, as you can imagine, access to text can be challenging in the best of circumstances, but during these unprecedented times ensuring our students have access to books is virtually impossible. Our primary focus has been securing resources, such as food cleaning supplies and hygiene. Your facilitation of the book donation has significantly supported our school's commitment to providing a strong literacy program for our students, whether you're in the school building or not. So it you know we're getting more and more letters from cbo's that having access to books to be able to share with their community has had a positive impact in the last two months. So if today you're on the call and you're part of a community organization, you're an educator or you're, just someone who wants to hand out books please reach out to us. We have the books and we'll work with you to get them out. So I mentioned the book distribution and the other part that we've been working on is all the online resources that are out there. So the internet has been filling up with free educational resources. I know as a parent of three, so we wanted to provide a way for parents to navigate this new normal, and so we send out a weekly newsletter of resources that are all available free and online. We've also added our reader's corner to get recommendations for readers, and then we've moved our personal guest, our guests that come in on-site to our events, to be pre-recorded and virtual, so that parents have access to them anytime, also, and then, just last week we added a summer reading page for families also, and you can see all this is on our website and it's free and available to anyone simply by going to our to our website, okay and then lastly, I'd like to show and share with you on how people can get involved with the bodega, it's the end of school and school's going out this week. My kids have been out since last week and we know about summerslide, but there's also going to be covet slide on top of that summerslide. So we'd love for people to get involved in our work and what we're doing our goal is to serve 5 000 people this year and to give 40 000 books. But we can't do that alone, so we need we need. We need help to do that. So I think the first ways people can go to our website and you can learn more about us and the work that we're doing and there's many resources. Also on our website. Second, you can host a neighborhood table to distribute books. So, as I mentioned, we can give you the books. We can get you all set up on how to distribute the books and people can just invite your neighbors set up a table and it's as simple as just handing them out to your neighborhood. You can host a book drive also for us. We've had a few book drives happening during Covid-19 and they've been very successful, because people do want to share their resources and again we have step-by-step instructions on best practices and people can get their community engaged. You can go to our website and sign up for our newsletter and then lastly, you know we are 501c3, so we're also accepting financial donations and we also have set up a sponsored program. So, if anyone's interested I'm in a sponsorship program, you can get in touch with us and then we have social media. Like everyone else, we have instagram facebook and twitter. We are most active on instagram and share daily resources. So you definitely can follow us on instagram and we have our contact information here. So let's all work together and get more books into kids homes and we look forward to working with you know anyone who's on this call and interested. That would be great. So that's all I have. I know it was a lot, so I can take questions, but I know I was on a time constraint to not take away from the superintendent. So thank you so much. This was so informative and such important work and you did do it in 15 minutes. It really did okay hours presentation. You gave us such wonderful information, including the specificity of which schools and organizations you work with. So I'm sure that the superintendent is very interested in that as well. So first I'd like to call on any members of our committee who have any questions about the brooklyn book odega, can you tell ya who is? Oh, that's oscar has a question. Yes, thank you for the presentation. First, my question: is there a permanent book drop-off center or is it more on a case-by-case drive by drive? We do actually have two permanent book. Drop-Off centers one is actually in the brooklyn navy yard in building 77 there's a bin in there all the time at the security desk in building 77 and then carver bank by the atlantic center is also collecting books for us and on our website there's a section of our permanent book drop locations. Thank you, yeah you're welcome great. I oscar. I see your wheels turning and maybe thinking about how to get books from your community into the brooklyn book. Bodega. Is there anyone else from our committee? Who has a question or a comment hearing none. I said no questions. Well, I could always ask a lot of friends on a personal level. I tend to be involved in community gardens and we've done some community book exchanges. So in the future, when we hold events in our community garden, we can certainly collaborate, but I think that could be an area for your organization to reach additional families, because when the gardens are in operation, lots of families go there and children and it could be great yeah for sure for sure yeah. I would love that so just reach out to us, because we, like, I said we have the books and we've had to come. We have to come up with creative ways now, because there are not large family events that you know that we're going to be hosting- and we know, there's still a need to have books out there, you know and in people's homes. So I mean that would be great. Another idea that came out in another committee was that people are looking at barber shops as poor places in the community, where people regularly go and the thought of having maybe some books there. Just there. You know maybe without a person explaining it or an event, but just so that the I assume it's mostly men, the men, the people that are in the barber shop might be encouraged to take books home for their children, yeah or neighbors, or relatives yeah. There is an organization called barbershop, it's called barbershop books called barbershop books, yes, barbershop books, yeah and that's what they focus on. They focus on books and putting books in barber shops and also working with the people who work in the barber shops also and to educate them about literacy. Great, so maybe we'll reach out to hear from them in the future. Yeah. Thank you. Are there any more questions or comments from committee members, so I'll open this up to anyone who's on this call. If somebody has a question shasima anyone, superintendent yeah I do have- I mean I mean I wanted to definitely I took down some information here follow up with my schools, because you know, even though you're not able to go into schools to do this. I'm sure several of my of my schools will arrange with their parents to can arrange with their parents some kind of drive or something especially over the summer- that's pretty, and especially as we and we also have a regional enrichment center. There was one in that didn't serve the children of first responders, and so one of the things we could possibly potentially do is to connect you with someone who supervises one of those sites in the district. There was one in this and community board. That was, we merged it with another site, because we didn't have a lot of enrollment, but we have one at one 133. I want to ps 56, which is actually in this in this community board. So I'm thinking that would be one that could be one place that we could try to see if we could do something yeah that would be great and ps56 actually picked up a few hundred books and an event for their families. Last weekend, I forgot to add them to the presentation we've been working with so many schools in the neighborhood, so yeah they and they said the event was a huge success. I think I gave them maybe 300 books and I think they were able to give away money. They have a really good, like vibrant parent association there. So that's good yeah, so yeah I'll reach out regarding some of the schools that I think would be able to arrange something, even though it's in a remote environment yeah. That would be great and ps. 307, where I dropped off. Books is a meal site and they said that the meal site was not confirmed for the summer, and so they weren't sure, but if they are confirmed for the summer, they said that is a one of the. You know a great opportunity for us yeah, I'm pretty sure I didn't hear that they were not going to be a site, so we could. We could somebody, they don't know yet. No, I can follow. We can follow up on it. No, it's not! No, let's follow up and let's make sure so I will reach out to you seema. We have a question from the representative from the navy yard as well. Can you hear me hi? What is your name hi, I'm curtis minnis, I'm the assistant clubhouse director at the navy, clubhouse right there on nassau street yeah. We spoke on email, so I'm glad absolutely yes, nice to finally put a face to the email. So can I have your last name m-I-n-n-I-s? Thank you. Okay, so sema of the things that we're doing at the clubhouse we're operating, obviously or you know social distancing levels so we're not at max capacity. One of the things we are doing is we're trying to support the young teams, so we're kind of hiring, because I know some of you kind of cut off some of the funding, so we're actually hiring six to seven teams through the summer for each clubhouse and I'm in charge with coming up with different service projects or project-based learning activities, and I think you know your your neighbor like hosting, like maybe a book drive or doing like a table drop, would be a good act, a great activity. So I just wanted to know what do I need, or how can I get involved with that? For my teams? Yeah, I mean you just email me at brooklyn book bodega at gmail and then I'll walk you through the instructions for how to host a book, drive or we'll arrange a time for you to for your teens to come pick up books and I can walk you through the process of like setting up that has successfully set up a table during coven. We can work together on that so yeah. If you just reach out I'm more than happy to discuss that with you, thank you and I put our contact information in the chat for anyone who didn't catch it. Okay. Are there any other questions from members of the audience? If not, we would love to hear from the superintendent superintendent. Samuels is the superintendent of district 13, where I'd say most of our schools in the cb2 area are in district 13 and we have had a relationship with the cec 13 that have been sharing information with us, as well as parents that come to our meetings. So we're really interested in an overview of what's happened. The last few months with the remote learning the plans for the summer, the plans for reopening I know a lot of this is still in flux, and then there will be questions from our committee and audience yeah. So we just want to hear your perspective and also help inform us when we start to write our statement of community needs if there's an area of overlap great well. First of all, thank you so much for having me, I really haven't been here. For now. It's been an interesting year a year and a couple of months give me your name. Please give your name sorry, mar samuels k-a-m-a-r samuels s-a-m-e, okay! Thank you. Oh you're welcome yeah. So I I've been here been an interesting year, as I was saying, and just around the schools that were that are within the community board too. First of all, thanks for having me thank you. Thank you so much, and I hope this is the beginning of several conversations. Several meetings I'm open to coming and if you want there's always something happening so I'm gonna. I always have things to talk about when it comes to the district, so the schools specifically that we're talking about are psa, 9, twin twenty forty six, fifty six ps sixty seven, two, seventy two, eighty seven three, oh seven, those are the elementary schools. Our middle schools are 113, 313 or doc, street 351, unison, school and 691 for green prep 915, which is our new, which is like the new, the former ps8 right. So it's a it's a standalone middle school. Now that used to be a part of the k-8 of ps8 and then also we have a middle school and a high school together, 6 through 12, which is susan, mckinney, that's 265., so those are schools we also have- and this is kind of going to move into my presentation a little bit or what we're talking about. We also have arts and letters which is going to be recited next year and I'll talk a little bit more about that next, a little bit further, so let's kind of center around just the disruption this year. First of all, you know I want to thank benny for acknowledging there's been a lot of loss in our community, certainly within our schools. We've also felt the loss within one of our schools in community board. 2, we lost a teacher to a virus. Her name is sandra viscaino and she taught at ps9 an outstanding teacher that we recognized last year. So if we could have a another moment, I'd appreciate it. You didn't indulge me. Thank you so, along with sandra you know, our parent, our parents, parent bodies, have suffered losses as well. We had we had two students who came down with what's now called the misc virus. One of them was really was critical in the hospital and has recovered. We're gonna continue to watch that as we continue to work for the summer. So immediately after school closed, though all of our teachers are the door schools. All of our teachers were really immersed for three days into how to get onto remote learning how to launch google classrooms, how to use zoom, how to use teams just like a lot of work went into that and, quite frankly, our district did really well. We did very well across so many of our schools. We are now in the middle of all of our all, of our principles are meeting and assessing how we did and areas that we need to improve going into the future and developing real expectations across the district for what high quality remote learning would look like, and so, as we continued into remote learning after the disruption. You know we have, we set. We set up several sites that brought grabber and go sites. I think seem seemed kind of alluded to that. But we have grab and go sites where kids can get meals, breakfast and lunch at in this district. There's one at 307 there's also one there's the 256 113 there's one in 113 and one is 67 as well as far as I know, we're going to try to continue for the months I'll get started on that, and so we had, we had grab and go sites. We also in this district launched three sites for what we call regional enrichment centers, where we were serving and we continued to serve the students and families of first responders. The three in this in our district was one in 56, one in dock street and one in 133. The dock street site was subsequently merged with the 130 133 site, and so we now have two sites that are operating at really high levels. Families of first responders have definitely voiced how supportive the staff has been and how much it's re. It's a real experience and a real school experience, and you know they are. They complement the enrichment and the and the instruction that's done at the school level right there at the site, and we, along with that, we delivered over 4 000 devices were requested and delivered by from directly from the doe, and then that was on top of devices that were just given were given out at the school level. So what we did was we asked the schools as soon as students were going home to deploy just to send home the devices with students, obviously doing the requisite recording of the devices and folks those who didn't have either didn't, have internet or didn't have devices. We then were able to request over 4000 of those through the doe sent home so that students could access remote learning. Excuse me when you say devices. What are you referring to please? I'm rep, referring to ipads, in particular from the from yeah you're, welcome, and please don't be hesitant to stop and ask for that clarification. I appreciate that. Thank you very much all right, and so then so once folks got devices, I think the big question was: are students learning and how do we know right and right now, where we are the first thing that really we were focused on in terms of figuring out what the kids were learning or not was how often they were logging on and who was logging on, and so we're at between 85 and 90 percent of our students that are logging on to remote learning and then, and also we had a number of students that we couldn't we couldn't reach. So we were trying to do outreach to those students. So I'm happy to report that of the 10 000 or so students in our district. We only have under they do keep me up at 92, kids, that were two students that we haven't been able to reach. Unfortunately, yet, but we contact, we constantly are trying different ways to do that. We had some leads on them, but yeah. We are con we're committed to serving every student in our district and when we can't find them, that's that causes great consternation and so right now we're in the process of refining our remote learning structure. We have some very promising practices across our district. A lot of the feedback that we got from parents was that there wasn't in at first there wasn't enough live instruction, meaning a teacher going on and teaching life focus. Some of our parents felt as though there was this assignments posted, and we worked with our teachers worked with our unions, work with everyone to get to a point where the overwhelming majority of district 13 teachers are engaging in thoughtful live instruction. There were many different mechanisms that we used to do that, including small having teachers go online with other teachers and small, with smaller groups of students to make sure that it was more manageable and smaller chunks of time. So we made several adjustments to our pedagogy and how we approach instruction in our district as we as we had to do with the with the pandemic, and so we are. Our principals now are looking at what are administering assessments and looking at what kids have learned in during this time and making sure that they plan different intervention strategies, making sure that students are recommended, if not mandated for summer school. Most most of our students that are inside that have been have been recommended for summer school not mandated for summer school and in a man. The mandate mandated pieces that, if you, if you, if you're mandated to go, that means that, if you do not go there, it's like we can have conversations at the end of the year around. What whether or not you get retained for folks that are recommended they can. They have the choice to go they're going to be promoted to the next grade, whether or not they go so we have. So that's where we are around the remote learning adjustments. We continue to really take a look at what the how we refine our instruction to meet the needs of all of our kids. I'm going to switch a little bit to talk about the moment that we're in terms of the protests and in terms of the killing of george floyd and how that has impacted our district. I mean, I know many of you were like me and looked with keen interest. Maybe when one day you were home or maybe you're in a protest yourself, but you know, I think the a jarring image for me was seeing the police van burn close to the barclays center and realizing wow. That is right here in right in my that's right in my district, and so we've worked with our teachers and very closely with our teachers and principals to kind of think about how to how to have conversations with our kids how to really look at the trauma, not only from that event, but also from covet to really look at our social, emotional learning and development of asia appropriately for students, and we used that to then launch, as requested by the cec launch a conversation with the cac with the broader community around you know. How do we move forward to an anti-racist district when we look at you know one of the things that we're looking at and just the cec and myself we hold ourselves accountable to look at. You, know: policing policies, housing policies, how and how they interact and how they intersect and play themselves out in our schools right, and so that's that that's a conversation that we are heavily involved in our district, we're having really good conversations around that we already before this, we were engaged in the school diversity group discussion, district-wide, where we were, and actually that conversation was in kind of it was interrupted by kobit, but the work around that had even begun before that, where, for example, in ps9, which is one of the schools in cb2 ps9 and their parents requested, and we granted the granted the approval for the for the phase out of their gifted and talented program, which they felt drove segregation within their school. Also, we looked at the reciting of arts and letters from the ps20 building, which has been an ongoing issue in our district, where both schools felt like they were growing and needed. More space, and so we are emerging arts and letters. We engage in a community engagement process which led to the merger of arts and letters, proposed merge of arts and letters with the ps305, which is in the bedside community board three community, and so that will that also has brought up a lot of significant conversations around? How do we really get to an integrated space? We as a district at the new york state level, we were involved in three integration: we're involved in an integration pilot if you will for the entire district, and out of that came the merger idea. That was that was one of the things that was linked there, as well as the phase-out idea and other ideas around that was to in fort greene prep, which is another one of your schools, we're launching a dual language program in fort greene prep, which aims to keep our french-speaking population within district 13, because currently we only have dual language for french from kindergarten to fifth grade, and if you want, if you want a french middle school program, you have to for dual language, french, you have to actually go to another just within our district, with the hope that those families will be will stay in our district and attend school in our district. There you know. Finally, I want to before I get to summer school. I guess I want to talk a little bit about two three schools, the street well, first, two schools, two 287 and 270- are both under enrolled schools in our district and they have been they're on a state des. They have a state designation, which means cs, which is called like a csi comprehensive school improvement list, which means that the state has flagged it that these two, these schools really need to improve and so we're in working with, in collaboration with the principal and she's being supported with to move towards the the improvement that needs to happen in those in that school and the same similar with 270 ps 270. That school is what's called a tsi school and a tsi school is what's called targeted, school improvement, and it means that in one in a specific area which for them is students with special needs. They need to improve in that particular area, and we are working within those schools to really really build out the educational platform and once and also we will be thinking about and engaging in a public engagement process around. What do those two skills? Schools need to do to ensure that they attract the population, that's a zone to that school or beyond. And finally, I want to talk about ps 67, which and by the way most of my schools, like elementary schools, especially have are involved in some kind of diversity and enrollment conversation. So, even if, in psa that conversation is happening to ensure that we are pushing diversity and integration in our district and within our schools and ps67 is a community school that was formerly a renewal school and has done pretty well and has gotten off of any state designation, so they're in they're, building out their community community school initiative and are doing pretty well in that, and so with that. I just want to stop there and ask if there are any clarifying questions and if all the questions are about summer school, I can talk a little bit about summer school. Are there any questions from members of the committee? Okay, do I have to raise my hand you're on nick yeah hi. So thank you for that. I appreciate that I was curious. You mentioned a little bit about the live teaching, and so I was just curious about what the plan may be going forward. I've heard definitely less optimistic. You've presented it very optimistically, I've heard quite the opposite about teachers really not being very live and it being you know, a lot of google. You know classroom and a lot of work where there may be office hours, but the teaching you have to read it on your own. You know you're watching videos, but where is the teacher? So is there what's happening next year? Are there any plans to ramp that up how's the uft, cooperating, yeah, good question, all right so I'll say I'll stand by what I said that this was this was this was a journey and certainly at the beginning of that journey we experienced a lot of things that you just talked about right, where parents felt like wait. What there's no teaching happening, which you know we can argue what is this part of the tension of what is good, remote learning right? So what I can start with saying, what's not good remote learning is to expect people to do just to post assignments and so on, and also- and what's the flip side isn't good. You can't recreate what you had in the building, so the teacher is on like for the entire day, so I would I so. I believe that and what we talked about as a district, is that what happened was a period of adjustment right, a period where, first of all, how much work is enough work? How the this is too much work, and so on and so forth. I think live instruction, or what we call synchronous instruction is cr is a critical tool, but it's not the end-all be-all. We should not think that, just because a teacher is live and because, if you're a teacher live with 20 kindergarten, kids on, like that's a very difficult thing to manage right, like the camera, is off the camera's on huh. I don't know right so live instruction in and of itself is not going to solve all of our problems, but I do believe it's a real strong tool and so to answer your question about next year. I do know that their conversations trump. The issue was that, and a lot of principles had was that we couldn't that teachers had to do live instruction in the beginning. We still can't as of today, but, like I said, I can speak to these schools on this list right. I will I- and you can challenge me on this. I believe the vast majority of these schools that are in cb2 have live instruction happening at least once per day right now. How long is that? Is it 30 minutes? Is it do people feel like it could be more or whatever it is? I believe it's like a constant conversation. I don't think we'll be able to get out, and this is kamar samuels. Now, I'm not speaking on behalf I'm not telling you. This is something in the doe, but it's very difficult to see a world where there isn't some mandated live instruction going forward. Obviously, with what happened it was, it was very, it was jarring and everybody had to adjust. I think within our district. Yes, I will say: may you'll say it's glass, half full, but it's been a journey, but I think where we, where we ended up was pretty good, but we have a lot a lot of work to do as well. I appreciate that and I wasn't I didn't hear anything specific to district 2 or district 13. You know school, so I was more of a role. I think that's true, that's why I said that's exactly right. Actually we had, I believe we had a better journey than many of the district city-wide. That's that that's the that's what I believe I and I believe so, because we had the issue in the beginning. I have a very good relationship with my uft district rep and you know you have to deal with these things school by school. I literally had a school where the teacher said. I am not good with technology and then I don't, I don't feel comfortable and then we had teachers say: okay, join my class, come see how we do it. Then she said well, the group is very big, and so we said okay, so your group you're going to start with a small group and it's gonna and that's the kind of story that happened over and over in our district, where I feel like our teachers really well worked well with each other and so and the principles kind of set that environment. I do. I felt fortunate in that regard. I'm not I'm not I'm not saying it's the same for you. No that's refreshing! I was I'm a former teacher in a former uft chapter, whatever they're called in the school, I don't even remember so yeah. I appreciate the mandate and not being able to, but it's good to hear that they're working with you guys, so thank you. Yep you're welcome. Are there any questions, additional questions or comments from any of the committee members to the superintendent? Okay from any other members of the audience who are attending this webex betty? I have a question: yes, superintendent, the coronavirus among its more powerful implications. The timing was such that the outbreak came just as the d13 diversity group was about to go public and, as nicholas has already pointed out, we don't really have a timetable for what's going to happen in the fall 2021. Can you give us an update on what's happening with that process, which I carol ann church who is on? The call is our representative to the group, the working group, but I was able to go to some sessions and I was very impressed by the work that the consultants were doing and the direction they were going in all right. So that's good that that's the question. That's a question I just didn't. I want to make sure I wasn't cutting all right. So yes, that was very unfortunate. I believe it was. It was march 10th or something we had a meeting and then we decided not to do it because of the outbreak, and this was very important to me. I'm super passionate about this work. So it's not about for me the consultants that are involved. I feel that we have to continue to work regardless and that's one of the reasons we decided to launch the conversations in the way that we did at the cec and so truth be told. I also reached out to one of the consultants who I said: look I know we're not we're not in a position to pay you, but this work has to continue and he was gracious enough to join one of our cc meetings and be the facilitator of some of the conversations. So what given the two meetings that we had and the level of commitment on one of the calls we had, I mean the cec had a zoom thing that had a capacity of a hundred and like we had to we blew through the 100 and we had to buy new zuma. So the people especially given, what's happening today. It's a conversation and it's a it's a mission that most people want to start back and it's a mission that I I'm committed to starting back. So, in terms of the specific that the work of the diversity group and the specific people that have been that are together on that we're constantly pushing and advocating to start, hopefully in september, but even prior to that there are ongoing meetings at the cec level that I feel are connected to that work and moving forward in network so and also the d and even within covet. We were able to apply to to two grants. We applied for two grants, even with everything happening. One was a magnet grant, which is really is about attracting adverse population to four of our schools. Those schools are in cb three in bed-stuy, but they're part of our district, and then we also applied to the third phase, which is the with the biggest phase of the new york state integration grant which, like I said, contributed and funded some of the work with the phase out of the getting planted program and so on. So that kind of work and that kind of conversation is gonna continue. Hopefully, we'll get these two grants that will allow us to do that engagement process, but even if we don't some of that, some of that work is about it's more about will and the political will that you have and how strong how you position yourself in order to like house those conversations which I think would like I said we're building on that in our cec meetings. The doe has should be starting the conversation back or should have the contracts back up in september, but I don't think that I can wait for that. So I really want the cb2 to be involved in like this. I know you guys are in touch with the cc and I'm hoping ayanna and we can have like really a seamless conversation, because I need all the help I can get in having this conversation, all the voices at the table and really managing a process that involves becoming a better new york, I'm becoming a better brooklyn, a better downtown brooklyn, a better district 13.. So I you know I am there, I'm going to be working on that, regardless of what the school diversity, whether we get go ahead from them or not. I'm going to be reaching out to your folks to join me in the conversation yeah. I hope I didn't overemphasize the consultants by the way, one of the heroes of my youth like to say by any means necessary- and I agree completely with you. If this isn't a moment for you know resolving this very critical shortcoming in new york city schools, then I really question whether we'll ever have the will absolutely yeah and I'm definitely involved with you know. I've had those conversations with assemblyman mosley and a number of different. You know. Lori combo and just we're gonna continue to have those conversations over the summer with the cec and yeah I'm excited, because we actually have a plan at the district level to address integration, and that is that that's not going away. I have several different avenues to do it and yeah. Can I follow up on that? I'm glad you asked that robert yeah, so you may have answered it. I'm just going to be more blunt. I guess so have the conversation started or are conversations? Are you intending conversations to happen directly linking what is going on now? You know and the political will for ending the systemic racism and making the very clear connection that our segregated schools are one of the results of that mindset. You know that says whether the parents know it or not like are we confronting people with those conversations, since everybody wants to be anti-racist today, all right, so I will say the last two meetings which I kicked off at the cc was directly addressing what you just talked about and the first one was like. I believe that all of this, these conversations starts with the personal right, so the first meeting was you know me modeling, my own experience with the police, my which you know when I come back I'll. I I'm happy to come back and share that with you, but like but modeling for folks how what it means to show up- and you know, be vulnerable and speak your truth, and then we had either we had parents, we had. We had white parents stand up to talk about how they got to the place to support. You know the black lives matter, movement or whatever it was, and then we broke up into groups and have that and had each person kind of talk and came back to share right. So that was the beginning and then last night. Actually we had our second meeting, which was how you know part two in the journey towards an anti-racist district which started off with policy right. So if what we, if we only end up with changing to policing as a result of where we are right now, then we've missed the mark right, even if we change police, which is hard to do. But even if we do, we change policing, that's not enough. The policing of our kids starts in our schools right how we discipline our kids is directly related to how we how they're policed in the street like that's. So that's why we have disproportionate kids of color suspended, which we have. We have real, deep work happening in our schools and with our principles around that, and then also when we look at the enrollment patterns within our district, we then have to ask well what policies drive enrollment patterns right. I mean over the course over the last 10 years, you've had like thousands of black students, leave our elementary schools. While you have you know a thousand or so white students who move in. So what is it? That's causing that, because what we believe and the way we discuss it as a cec and as and as a community superintendent, which is kind of you know the community comes before the superintendency. It's like, though, even the title works I feel like. If I don't work with my cec and know my community board to kind of interrogate the intersectionality of all those things, then I don't think I'm doing my role as service right. I think you know barack obama, when he appointed sonia sotomayor talked about like how what your life experience brings to the role that you take on, and I think my life experience makes it so that I am. I am uniquely. I have an advantage almost being in district 13 right now, just given my own experience and I am taking rcec and they're taking me on this journey together and I'm hoping that as of today, we'll be on that journey together as well. Thank you. Good luck. I'm happy to participate. I hope we can as well super important work and probably very difficult conversations. I know I'm smiling, but it's hard. Thank you. Hey oscar asker seems to have a question or a comment. I was just gonna ask if there's plans to have more of those conversations in the future in the upcoming weeks yeah, so there's two things right and I'll make sure that you guys are so the first, the first the way with the way I approached it. This time was to like approach it to. I asked the cec if they could help me to kind of have these conversations and they were willing. So we have going on as well as we have what's called the district leadership team within our district. So, yes to answer the question, we're going to continue the conversation and it's probably going to go out from our district leadership team, where we're going to host some of those conversations. What we came up with yesterday were some areas of policy that folks are going to look at, whether that be funding mechanisms, whether that be school safety being under the nypd versus the department of education and what that can? We, you know, have some adjustments to that restorative practices. There's a number. This is like all aligned to what's called the five r's framework so for integrated schools, so yeah. So to answer your question: yes, we're gonna oscar, yes, we're gonna have more of those conversations and I'll be sure to make sure all those community boards get information on that. Thank you thanks. Is there anyone else from the committee who has a question for the superintendent or a comment? Okay, so you know I will have questions okay. So, as you know, superintendent, I am obsessed with school gardens and outdoor classrooms and so on. So looking at this crisis time that we're in as perhaps an opportunity. What is your thinking, or how can we engage with your thinking to use school gardens as outdoor classrooms, because we know that we would prefer the students to be outside then inside, but we know that gardens are very powerful in the children's social, emotional learning in cultural revol, cultural, relevant work, storytelling, acknowledgement of kids, culture building skills, as well as the healthy food, nutrition and so on. Parents from other districts have contacted me to say what are the plans for getting the doe to include the notion of the outdoor classrooms, whatever it may be, whether you use the garden space to teach poetry or to teach how to grow a plant to see this as an opportunity. I also I share that view. I think it's the things you've you hit on. I certainly appreciate one. The one of the biggest thing we'll have things we'll have to deal with when we come back is the trauma of our students. So I'm really happy that you talked about the social emotional pieces of that I think, is critical and then I think thinking about the space and how to manage the space and the schedules. And all of that is something of course. You know we're like steeped in right now and so to that and the my answer to that is you have my supporter on that. I know that ps20 has you know is thinking about that because they have like their gardener that they're using of course a lot of our you know. Some of our schools have like these hydroponic pieces that are inside right, but but yeah. I support that. Actually, I am going to I'm going to put that down as something that we should leverage as we think about space needs, but right now we're so focused on making sure that we have the right structure in place to ensure that appropriate social distance, because you bring up like reopening and you're bringing up a reopening conversation right, and so we are heavily focused and are spending a lot of time. Thinking about protocols and mechanisms to ensure safety and social distancing- and I think this does if there are schools that have gardens, they should be considering that into their program, to kind of alleviate some of the space concerns or some of the internal kids being inside concerns, and so I totally appreciate that you're saying what you're putting forward- and I will I'll raise this with my schools now I, as you know yes, I will take it that I know that this is something you're, passionate about I'm very and so yeah. Well, I think you're, the you know the chance to just say: you know people he got a letter into a little trouble, but I'll say too. In this case you know we can't afford to waste a good crisis like this crisis. Actually there are some things that we know we should have been doing all along and that we can actually forward some of this thinking, because I think this food gardening stuff is one of them. Thank you, and then this brings us into the discussion as you're saying at the d.o.e they're talking about what is the reopening look like, which perhaps scattered as a staggered schedules different times days in and days out, and there are various reports that are being featured in the media and from the point of view and taking the point of view of parents who have to organize child care after school programs etc. How is this I mean? I know it's a very big challenge, but how is this being communicated with the parents and having perhaps some parent input, because people with several children on all different schedules? It's going to be a parent's nightmare and people who have the opportunity are even talking about leaving the city. So I think it's a big consideration. Yes, it is yes, it is. It's is what it's. What a lot of our days are spent thinking about now I've heard some. So, as you know, the city has put out that, given all the using thinking about the protocols, all our schools can't fit more than 49 of our kids in building at any time and that actually is lower when you think about some schools right. So I think the number is closer to like a third, a third of the students can be in the schools with the proper protocols in place at any one time and, like you said, we are looking at a host of options and principals are thinking through different ways to use space. You know we haven't. The final guidance hasn't come in from center has hasn't come from our central office, yet we're continuing to work to through different things. Our parents have gotten surveys that they've completed to kind of say what they would prefer so on and so forth. So yeah we are continuing to work on that. Like I just know, it's been, it's been very difficult and I think that we will, you probably will hear a little bit more of the maybe in the first or second week of july. Thank you. Sorry. Just before we get together, I just want to talk about summer school for a little bit so summer. School is on obvious. A lot of it is well, it is remote for the most part they have done some of our 12-month school year-round school option for students with disabilities. They they're looking at some of that being in person, but for a lot of for the vast majority of students, it will be remote. We have 700 students that have been recommended for summer school. As of yesterday that I that I saw- and we have the vast majority of those students- I think I alluded to before- are recommended not mandated so they're great in grades three through eight and they'll be engage in remote instruction, they'll be in engage in a lot of enrichment, many enrichment activities, some virtual tours and virtual visits, and so on and so forth. Just so we're trying to make it as interactive and interactive as possible and also and also make sure that they get the interventions that they need to catch up. Thank you. Are there any questions for the superintendent? At this point, do you see the question from malcolm hill in the chat panel? If not, I haven't been looking at the chat. I'm sorry! No! That's! Okay! I was asking betty if she was and then also curtis minis from the boys and girls club. He has a question as well. So am I going with a mark on hell questions? Is somebody gonna? Sorry, no, I think my hand was just raised from last time and never went down. So I'm pretty clear. I got it. Thank you all right, all right. How is principal little steam center doing in and you have a steam center in the navy yard. Right yes run by mr thomas is the principal over there. But anyway it's my favorite place all right, okay and anybody who hasn't checked out the steam center in the navy yard. It's amazing so yeah our committee visited it last winter yeah. Well, I think you might have us confused. Are you talking about the brooklyn we're the boys and girls club? Oh you're, the boys? I thought the navy yeah the confused us with the brooklyn navy, so there was one other question. Sorry so malcolm hill asks- and these are not my questions- I'm reading them. Thank you for your presentation. Schools have a very difficult job right now and I appreciate your efforts. I have a few follow-up questions. You mentioned principles giving assessments. How are they doing this authentically in a remote way and especially at the high school level, ensuring students approach assessments with academic integrity I'll? Let you answer that before I go on to the second question yeah, so the issue that's come up in several ways. I think a lot of that has been done through live instruction and kind of like one-on-one. That's how does the and small groups? I talked a lot about small groups before that's really how we are trying to get to this issue of academic integrity. We had parents we had. We had. Teachers complain that it seemed like parents was doing more, were doing more of the work than the students were doing in the beginning, and so, when we came down to the end and to really assess students, we wanted to make sure that we did one-on-one. Some of that is not it's almost unavoidable. Like I heard I had a teacher say to me yeah, because I asked the same question the gentleman asked I had a teacher say to me: yes, I even heard the parents trying to whisper the answer to the child outside of the. So it's something that we're trying to grapple with. It's a fabulous question, and you know I know from my son. You know I it's a very it's a very difficult thing he's trying to get me to help and I'm like. No, you have a teacher for a reason or whatever it is, and it's been. It's been. That's been a really interesting journey, but the I think the main issue right there is the live and that's one of the reasons live instruction is critical, because if the teacher is there with a small group of kids, then it's then that assessment can take place like in our lower grades. The kids actually have to read things, and then the teacher has to listen to what the students read to do a running record or whatever the situation is so that's. We've used live instruction to really propel that piece. That piece of the work, but it is a struggle in terms of in terms of online in terms of remote learning, so we're going to continue to think about that. Mr hill also complimented you on the fact that there's only two students that are not logging in regularly. No, that's not that's kind of. Let me clarify that so there I would say there the 85 of our students log in regularly, so that we have like another 15 percent that you know are sporadic the two students I mentioned of the are students that we haven't been able to contact sin and their families that we haven't been able to contact since remote learning started, and that's why I said: that's just like really critical, so there's a difference I wish it were to. I would gladly take the compliment and run, but I just want to clarify it. Doesn't those two students we haven't heard from their families? That's my issue that you know the staff and I were communicating on the side. That's a that's a scary thought and we can sense your concern and it's sincere. Mr hill asked what practices schools use to promote participation yeah we have. Of course we have the same staff that were in every school has a parent coordinator and so on and so forth, but we also on top of that we have a bco that helps us with attendance teachers. So what, though, so? Obviously you know the paraprofessionals, the parent, the parent coordinators, everybody is trying to contact the parents trying to trying to figure out is everybody okay, and then we have a group of people. We had a group of students that was up to about went up to in the beginning, maybe like about 200 students that we actually did. We weren't able to figure out where they were, and then we targeted those students with support or outreach. In fact, we had people going on facebook trying to connect with your cousin. If I know you have a cousin in the school and trying like we had a whole, I felt like investigative work that we were doing to get to those students, and so we worked out that list down over the course of the last seven weeks, and but just these last two and I have to do some follow-up work on them. These last two we haven't, we haven't, have had official notification of where they are yet. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any other questions for a superintendent? Thank you so much for engaging with our committee, and we please continue on the meeting here unless you want to put your daughter to bed but [Laughter], and we look forward to engaging in these deep conversations to hear all voices and all parts of the community. Thank you for your work. So, if I so who, so I guess, if I have any anything, I want to raise with you I'll, just like email, who's, the best person to kind of reach out to on a team. Well, the district office. Mr paris is the district manager and taylor muller, who helps set up the webex with you and all she works with our committee, and you can always shoot me an email. You know who I am so all right, buddy. Thank you and thank you to. I am more than willing to come whenever you whenever you ask- and I am I'm looking for partners and allies in this work. So I really appreciate that you've given me this opportunity to speak to you and you know, everybody stay safe and healthy, fabulous, and I know one of the things we're going to be talking about further this summer and so on. We're going to be talking about policing and in relation to the school safety and the police and the schools, and that might be something that you or your staff want to be part of that conversation, of course, I'll be happy to I'll. Do it myself, I'd be happy yeah and I know we're going to be asked to start working on our district statement of needs and I reviewed it, and I feel that there's a lot we don't know. For example, there were schools that were over capacity under capacity. We have no idea who's left the city. Where do we need? I mean we have two schools that are in the process of being built or built out. We heard from sca a few months ago, so we're interested in hearing your perspectives when we do create this district needs statement. We like to hear your voice, okay, so I'll, so I should wait for you guys to reach out to me on that or you can continue to you know you can write to us, we'll be probably talking about it during the summer. If my committee chooses to meet which I will encourage them, yeah and yeah, if you let me know when the meetings are I'll, definitely try to make it. Thank you, superintendent. I would just add I'm just telling this it's an anecdote. There have been borough, commissioners and others who have shared with us needs that they perceived in at their agency or their facilities. That say the parks department. They didn't want the arsenal to know that the suggestion came from him. You know if you had something like that. We can respect your privacy, okay. Well, thank you that I appreciate it. Thank you very much fabulous. Okay! So thank you again. So now we're up to the part of the approval of minutes of february 26th, which seems like another lifetime ago pre-covered, and it was the middle of the winter. The minute was sent out to the committee members. So is there any discussion about the minutes, any corrections hearing none. Can we accept them by consensus? We're? Okay with that we see a thumbs up. Okay, yeah! I asked her was that a thumbs up? Okay, so we approved the minutes by consensus. If you remember that was the meeting we had the sca and the cec 13 ayanna spoke to us about the district. Okay. So now we're up to the chairs report. Okay, so we spent a lot of time talking about the challenging time that we're under some of our and practices are changing. As you know, we're on remote meetings and so on, we might be having summer meetings. That's what so, I want to hear from the committee members how you feel about having a summer meeting. Some of the things we would probably be talking about is the statement of district needs, we'd be talking about youth and the police, the policing and the schools, the school safety. That type of thing. As everybody knows, the summer youth employment program was not funded. So they're going to be a lot of kids, unfortunately, that much to do this summer and no camps. What no camp funding either correct a lot yeah totally. So we probably want to talk about that in terms of what our committees need to recommend and put forward monday night, when we had the executive committee meeting, there was an interest in the transportation bus, transportation, public safety committee. So it's the public safety part of the committee might be interested in meeting with us regarding youth and supporting youth in terms of perhaps a statement about the school safety agents who are transferring the funding from the police to the school. So our people interested in perhaps having a summer meeting and it would be a format like webex from where you are- is there any discussion? This is dorothea. If we're gonna have it, we have to choose I'd, say one month out of the summer, either july or august. Also you mentioned several things and frankly I don't know if we could do several things with this type of platform. So if it's going to be on, let's say the district of you know the needs, then we have that and we work on that and then, if we can put something else in to discuss, we do it, but I don't think we need to have more than one item of substance on the agenda so that we can get it done in a good time. Get it done. You know correctly so you're suggesting one meeting in the summer. It might be a meeting with the transportation safety group committee. Rather is that agreeable to people and that we would focus on the funding to support the police funding, maybe going to the schools and supporting the young people in that way? If we do that, how do we get the statement of district needs done? How are we going to agree? That's challenging. Can I suggest you know for your comment or consideration that everybody read it through? We can have the office sent to us again if we can't find it in our emails and maybe just write down all of our questions so that we're better prepared to either have an online meeting or yeah to have to do it online on the the webex with a lot of advanced preparation, so it would go more quickly. Perhaps, but now it sounds like you're talking about two meetings, one with public safety and one just on the district of needs. That's what it sounds like you're saying to me: I'm not sure I'm exploring it. I don't have a definite decision or a recommendation on it, but I do think I guess I do recommend that everybody look at the district needs carefully. So maybe if we don't address it in the summer, if we address it in our september meeting, then we're really ready to discuss it and to suggest revisions or changes to that statement to bring it up to date. I appreciate you asking superintendent samuels for input. I think we should get feedback on the state of the schools before we revisit the needs statement, if possible, any data that's out there, because I think we're often wondering about the needs of the schools, and we have certain schools listed up there, and I think we have like middle school right, like their labs being maybe improved and etc would be nice, maybe to have some updates before we revisit it. So we could get some updates to saying on like what's needed. Science labs gyms, I mean the city budget is in such a horrendous shape. We're being told that I mean we'll need some guidance, I guess from the chair of cb2 and from the office to like how far we go on this, so that it's an important document. It's not just saying the same things again and again, right so yeah. I think I would recommend at minimum he looks at what we have to see if it feels relevant and any other information we need to know to guide any other needs. Okay sure. Well, I just know personally, I'm you know have a lot more free time this summer than I may have in the past, and I would be happy to do as many or as few meetings. I know, there's a lot to cover as well. Over the summer, have you seen a copy of list his statement of the district needs? I think maybe we need to make sure to get you one. So you can read it and see what the document covers and kind of how it's great beach, reading oscar great beach reading yeah. That would be fantastic. Thank you, okay. So I also want to share that community board 3 our counterpart, their youth and education committee, in other words us, but in cb3, held a very interesting webex meeting with the different department of education officials, like speaking to their community, now the way it was set up. I had no idea if, like 10, people were on the call or a hundred, so I don't know how you know how many people the meeting reached or how effective it was, but it seemed like it could be something we would consider hosting, maybe at some time in the fall so that they had various like doe officials, including the superintendent and his boss, and someone from community affairs. You know the different people that but the fact that it was hosted by cb3. It's telling the community board three community. This is something we care about and we're providing this opportunity to get more information to our public. So what do people think about that? Anyone? I love it. You love it. Okay, maybe it's something we should consider: okay, yeah, I'm just looking at my notes. So is there I'm sorry just did we didn't? I just didn't feel like we closed the loop on the combo meeting with transportation. I'd have to check that out with the board office because they might have certain constraints of when they want to do that. To check with the chair, I mean, I can't just say we're gonna, but I think we should do it because they're concerned with public safety, we're concerned with the youth and the the policing and yeah just a related anecdote very quickly. My ceo is on the school opening committee for the mayor with the mayor and she, you know, is, doesn't hold back and school safety actually was has come up in that conversation, and I believe there was some students represented and comment was made that school safety is not the nypd by the doe and the student had to say. Excuse me, they wear the uniform they're in our schools, with the nypd uniform on, and that is their boss. So you know with all due respect what you know. What are you saying kind of thing? So it's interesting. If that's sort of the leadership's perspective that they're not nypd. Well, they don't carry a weapon, no yeah, so they can't do this in the school right. They can write some desk appearances anyway, yeah it is the police department, because the police, department, trains them and the police department supervises them. So the principal doesn't supervise them and the principal can't have them can't make them go to a meeting of let's say a climate and culture meeting or any of the meetings about the students, social, emotional development. The principal can invite them, but that's right, they're, not under the school supervision. They can't even make them do really anything honestly correct. They can't make them go anywhere or do anything that is correct. Okay, and I know a lot about the school safety agents. I worked closely with them in my follow life. Okay, is there any other business to come before this group from the community committee members? Okay, are there people out there taya? Can you see if there are people out there who are from the community, such as the library, the madison's club, who want to speak? I don't currently see any hands raised, but I think the group is small enough that we could invite folks to unmute themselves and chime in. If you would like to make a comment, I don't know this user's name but the handle, if it's thrown from the clinton hill library. If you want, I can talk. Yes, go ahead: okay, when the libraries are opening or how they're going to go about opening, which is okay actually on our website. If you go to the website at the top of the website is a red banner that has the covert 19 information. If you click on it, it's got the reopening plan, so what's happening is at the end of this month. I think it's 24 branches, their staff will be returning to the branches on july 13th. Unless things change, seven branches will open for book return and also for holds pickup. The other branches will be opening later on and then the branches that didn't go back on the 2019 of which clinton hill has won. We will be returning at the end of the month and reopening sometime in august, but as part of the phase, we're not going to initially have people in the buildings. You'll be picking up your materials from the vestibules you'll be able to call in and ask for four books to be found for you eventually you'll be able to replace your printholes again. The phases are all in detail on the website for community board. 2, your closest location for returning items and picking up holds, as of now will be central as of july 13th. So, can I ask you if you have books that you need to return? Can you return it in a box anywhere like some of the libraries? Have these boxes? You can return in or you definitely have to go to central right now. When we closed on march 14th, all the drop boxes were locked, so they will only reopen drop boxes at seven locations on july 13th you'll be returning to those initially and then they'll be rolling them out at more locations throughout july and throughout august. So for community board two, you, your closest branch to return is going to be central, which is not enough cb2. But that's. Okay. Thank you for the information, because the other branches in cb2 are brooklyn heights clinton, hill and walt whitman. We are not going to be in the first round of returns. I'm afraid red hook is going to be in the first round of return. That's in my region, but it's some distance away so yeah, so you could return to red hook or it might be more convenient for people to return to central the seven branches that open will are on the website. If you go there and take a look at that, yeah we're going to be continuing to do virtual programs. We've been doing a lot of virtual programming. As of now. We also transferred a lot of our budget to ebooks and e-audio books, so people have been able to get a lot of e-books and audio books to check out and then we've added a whole bunch of additional databases with materials on demand. We added, for example, a database called team book cloud where teams can log into it with their bar code and pin number and read books on demand. They don't need to check them out. They can take a look at them. It includes manga and we've added some more adult ones like that. So you actually have a lot more options for finding materials to read. We also have teens find out about that. Well, like that sounds really cool, but how do they? How would they know our brooklyn connection? People have been working with the schools. We've got a lot of virtual program listings up there for virtual programs. I've been doing chat and I've actually been helping teens make library cards they've been you can make e-cards, so you can use the materials and, during the course of the conversation, I shoot them out of flyer with the different resources that we have. But we've been, we've been interacting with a lot of the schools, because you know the kids are getting tablets. So with the tablets you're they're able to sign up for e-cards and we've, let all ages now get e-cards. We used to not let children get them, but now even kids can get an e-card, so they just fill out a form online. It realizes it tracks their location, they can get any card and they can use all of our virtual resources. That's excellent! Yeah we've even having a lot of people getting cards from out of state; they have to pay, but if you're in new york state or if you work in new york state, you get the your card for free yeah. Some people won't be able to return the books right away. Either they left town or their lives are upside down. Will you be not charging the people for a while? Well, what they've been doing is rolling over due dates. You know the due dates keep being rolled over and expanded for people. We've been contacted by people who are moving out of state there's an address that we give them where they can mail, the books back and we they will be checked in after people return to book. Ops- and you know all fines and fees will be waived and then, with the other people who are in town, as I said, we're basically rolling over due dates, so we're trying to make sure that things are extended as far as possible, because we know it's going to be really difficult for people to get to the locations to return them. That's very helpful. Does anyone have any questions for miss manchon? I do and a comment. Okay, so tracy, I'm on the bpl website and the coronavirus page itself and I may be looking in the wrong place, but it seems to only say central library and six other branches, not which six branches they will be posting up these six branches shortly, I know yeah. I know in terms of I'm in the park slope region in my region, the one that's going to be opening to the public is going to be. You know, for the best of your work is going to be red hook, it's not going to be brooklyn heights, it won't be walt whitman, it won't be clinton hill. We won't be coming back until later on, but red hook is going to be opening up well, the vestibule at any rate, on the 13th and central. So that's really going to be the closest ones for this region. For this community board. Okay and then my question is, as you know, when you put a hold on a book, you give a specific branch as the destination for the book to go to. If a book is in route or not quite in route, is it still going to that branch? And then, therefore you have to wait till that branch reopens. They are in the process of working on that everything got halted when we closed so there are holds that are sitting in branches and we're just extending their whole date. Their whole expiration date right now, they're having discussions about what to do with the holds already in branches, then the other things that are currently in transit are at book ops. So when bookops goes back into operation, they'll be taking the things that are in transit, then they're going to have to one of the conversations that they're having now is: what will we do with these books? Will we decide? Okay, you know we're going to have to send them to one of these seven locations and notify people or what's what the process is. So when we know the process we'll be put putting that up there we'll be able to tell you about it. We actually stopped letting people put holds on print materials about two weeks ago, because we realized that the backlog is really so big. So it's until we get the backlog of down on the outstanding holes for print materials. People are not going to be able to put holes on print materials because that's going to be one of the things that the people will be doing and the branches that are not pick up locations they're going to be sort of like fulfillment centers, and I just want to look. My one last comment was that when sema was talking about the value of having books in your home, I wanted her to see your backdrop yeah. It definitely is that we, you know the friends group have been doing book swaps and one of the reasons that they've been doing book swaps is because they're not charging people at the book. Swaps they're encouraging people to take as much as they want, and we have members of the friends group who've taken lots and lots of books and given them to different organizations. We've had senior centers come in and walk out with like a couple hundred books to take their senior centers to keep. So it's something that our friends group, that clinton hell has really taken very seriously where the idea of the book swap is a way for people to exchange books and get them out to people. I mean we've done a lot of advertising. I remember one time we had people coming in from crown heights because one of their relatives, texted them and said, go to clinton hill and you know get books at the book swap and we end up giving out a lot of library cards too, because while people are there, they get library cards so yeah, it's something she's totally right. We really take that pretty seriously. That's great yeah, so that's very helpful. Do you or mr perez know what the status is of the brooklyn heights library, whether it's gonna, whether the construction is going as planned or they've, had a staff and also the one in dumbo? I can't answer that question. Mr paris would have to reach out to our government affairs department and ask them about that, or I can have them reach out to him, but I can't answer that information yeah. Let's have you heard anything, mr paris, about that we well. We tentatively had a presentation scheduled for the spring where government affairs was going to give us an update on all the work that's happening in the district, including walt whitman. Obviously that didn't happen for obvious reasons. So I know you'll keep us up to date as always that when we can hear from our library partners great so is there any other business? Is there a motion to return? Okay, great, so stay well and healthy everyone and safe, missed you guys, a lot and we'll be in touch have a great evening.
