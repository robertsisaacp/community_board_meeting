and he's a young person who attends high school So before we start our business, I just want to reflect that since our committee last met in february, a community as well as people have experienced tremendous loss and we acknowledge that and our country is going through a very challenging time.
So today we wanted to share with you our mission, the timeline of our organization, the impact thus far to the community, how we've been operating during coven 19 and then how we would love for people to get involved with our organization and then, if time permits we'll have q a.
So just in the interest of time today, I'm just going to share a little bit more about ownership, book access and building a community So kids can write their names in their in the books, and we know that books at home makes it more like likely that children will have exposure to vocabulary, which then leads to them to thrive at school and then in general in life.
You know, I think it's important for kids to be able to choose the books that they want to read and have access to a variety of books, and then the third is around community.
Right now, we spent most of last year working building our relationship at the ingersoll cornerstone community center at nycha, and we hosted five public events at that community center, which was open to anyone, and then we also had private school events in the neighborhood in in downtown brooklyn, the brooklyn navy yard was able to give a space to run our events, and I think someone from the call is here from the brooklyn navy yard, so I'll just give them a shout out, because that has also been great for us during Covid-19 This year before Covid-19, we had three successful events and we had, on average about 350 parents and children attend each of those events, so I'll share a little bit more about coven in a second, but before I get into that, I'm going to share a little bit about the impact that we've had so far with some of the numbers.
At that point, we really need to get books into homes, because schools were going to be closed and libraries for the foreseeable future, and during this time one teen wrote to us about the start at the start of the pandemic, and I want to share what he wrote to us to everyone.
So when we got that letter in at the end of march early april, we were like, we really need to work, to get books out into communities and into homes, because kids do want to be able to read in their own home and may not have the books.
We've also added our reader's corner to get recommendations for readers, and then we've moved our personal guest, our guests that come in on-site to our events, to be pre-recorded and virtual, so that parents have access to them anytime, also, and then, just last week we added a summer reading page for families also, and you can see all this is on our website and then lastly, I'd like to show and share with you on how people can get involved with the bodega , it's the end of school and school's going out this week.
, you know we are 501c3, so we're also accepting financial donations This was so informative and such important work So first I'd like to call on any members of our committee who have any questions about the brooklyn book odega, can you tell ya who is?
So in the future, when we hold events in our community garden, we can certainly collaborate, but I think that could be an area for your organization to reach additional families, because when the gardens are in operation, lots of families go there and children and it could be great We have to come up with creative ways now, because there are not large family events that you know that we're going to be hosting- and we know, there's still a need to have books out there, you know and in people's homes.
I'm sure several of my of my schools will arrange with their parents to can arrange with their parents some kind of drive or something especially over the summer- didn't serve the children of first responders, and so one of the things we could possibly potentially do is to connect you with someone who supervises one of those sites in the district.
, I'm curtis minnis, I'm the assistant clubhouse director at the navy, clubhouse right there on nassau street One of the things we are doing is we're trying to support the young teams, so we're kind of hiring, because I know some of you kind of cut off some of the funding, so we're actually hiring six to seven teams through the summer for each clubhouse and I'm in charge with coming up with different service projects or project-based learning activities, and I think you know your your neighbor like hosting, like maybe a book drive or doing like a table drop, would be a good act, a great activity.
and then I'll walk you through the instructions for how to host a book, drive or we'll arrange a time for you to for your teens to come pick up books So we just want to hear your perspective and also help inform us when we start to write our statement of community So I I've been here been an interesting year, as I was saying, and just around the schools that were that are within the community board too.
right now, where we are the first thing that really we were focused on in terms of figuring out what the kids were learning or not was how often they were logging on and who was logging on, and so we're at between 85 and 90 percent of our students that are logging on to remote learning and then, A lot of the feedback that we got from parents was that there wasn't in at first there wasn't enough live instruction, meaning a teacher going on and teaching life focus.
You, know: policing policies, housing policies, how and how they interact and how they intersect and play themselves out in our schools right, and so that's that that's a conversation that we are heavily involved in our district , we're having really good conversations around that we already before this, we were engaged in the school diversity group discussion, district-wide, where we were, and actually that conversation was in kind of it was interrupted by Covid-19, but the work around that had even begun before that, where, for example, in ps9, which is one of the schools in cb2 ps9 and their parents requested, and we granted the granted the approval for the for the phase out of their gifted and talented program, which they felt drove segregation within their school.
You know that says whether the parents know it or not like are we confronting people with those conversations, since everybody wants to be anti-racist today, all right, so I will say the last two meetings which I kicked off at the cc was directly addressing what you just talked about and the first one was like.
If I don't work with my cec and know my community board to kind of interrogate the intersectionality of all those things, then I don't think I'm doing my role as service right.
If I know you have a cousin in the school and trying like we had a whole, I felt like investigative work that we were doing to get to those students, and so we worked out that list down over the course of the last seven weeks, and we look forward to engaging in these deep conversations to hear all voices and all parts of the community.
So our people interested in perhaps having a summer meeting and it would be a format like webex from where you are- but I don't think we need to have more than one item of substance on the agenda so that we can get it done in a good time.
