Good evening, everybody welcome to the first meeting of the new committee year for community board 2 health environment, social services committee.
There's a bench in front of the building here, we're opposite the putnam triangle and right now, even though it's pandemic I think it's four times we opened since they started the cooling centers, so people are able to come in, seniors are able to come in and we have.
I don't know if it would be the committee if we need any help from you, I will reach out to miss church to see what the community board can help us with helping the seniors during this pandemic.
People that don't get wellness call is because they're coming out in the street now I just wanted to give one sort of public service state statement here to the members of the committee.
, there's a lot there's a strong effect from you know, sort of a lifetime of racism and discrimination and people are walking around with that trauma, and so I think, there's stuff that can be done from a health perspective around mental health and providing access to more care in our community.
They have this scaffolding up in the in the night, in the nycha development, for that she lives in, for that has not been taken down for something like 10 years, which is would which is somewhat of a of a concern, because it not only causes confusion for people trying to visit the developments, but it disturbs the quality of life of the people who are at the developments, and I thought that was an interesting comment and possibly something that we could fashion into an additional need.
There has to be sort of comprehensive distribution and and facilitation of the personal protective equipment getting out to both hospitals, medical providers, as well as places where there are large concentrations of people like nycha developments, so that people have the opportunity to use them, and I'm continuously troubled by the number of people who just flagrantly don't wear, masks, left and right throughout our community in multiple different settings and the it I mean, it's always a struggle to balance the people's individual rights to do what they want with the public health effects that come out of not wearing masks.
I know I always talk about green infrastructure and can seem a little bit intangible or maybe not always timely, but particularly with the development that we still struggle to have a voice in controlling, and while we have other committees that are thinking about how we address things like ami calculations and the lack of affordable housing in the district, I worry a lot about air quality and street safety.
I think those are all very important for us to consider and try to develop into needs statements and hopefully related budgetary requests, and I think jessica's thinking is really big picture in terms of that as a problem, and I think I think we will need to think that through some more to see if it's possible to turn it into anything, that's actionable in any way, but I think you know When you look at the child asthma rates in our in our district compared to other parts of the city, it's really horrendous, that kids are suffering and families are suffering the way they are, and that leads me to something I wanted to say, which is not really a specific need statement at this point, because I think we really covered a lot of good ground last year, also in the major needs that are there, I don't think one has to rewrite something: that's good and that's accurate But what I wanted to point out is that we are a very diverse community district, which probably everybody here knows, and I'm saying what everybody already understands.
But I don't know how needs are thought about on the city hall level if they look at community district wide.
You know well not park slow, but you know what before my neighbor's need is very different and at a different level than what many components of the district need, and I think that has to be repeated frequently so that the powers that be who are going to really make the decisions about spending money understand what it is that we're asking for, because if you ask for something- and I would like to say that part of the problem is how the data that we're getting that community survey, which you know it really murkies up the waters here.
I think, than the broad census data for our district, the one that new york city does every year, and so that's something we can use as well as So, if we have, you know a lot of data people, that's something we can actually get into and tease out the data that we're looking for.
I think I got it, but I think what I'm hearing at least barry and alejandro, is that we need to have a little bit more geared towards the those specific aspects of the community district, because you know in several in some parts of the district, things are going fine I mean it's good to know that we have that we have that in our community and those of us who are lucky to live in that circumstance or are, can be gratified with that, but I think there needs to be more education on Covid-19, put out to by the city department of health.
When I go on the street, sometimes that you know there needs to be more education, provided particularly to like small business owners in the in the city, and you know, we've had a very kind of interesting couple of months with all kinds of things going on, and I know even here locally, there have been a few bars and restaurants who've had their liquor licenses taken away because they're serving people without wearing without wearing masks on the inside, and I just feel like that could be that there's more education , that's needed, you know, and it's not like mandating people to wear the masks or but really making sure people understand the importance of it and the risks.
I think, like alejandro, has a great idea about these about mental health funds going out in the community it'll be a capital expenditure because you're you got a city would have to set aside resources and purchase a a vehicle.
Did any other members of the committee have any more points regarding district needs, not hearing anything else from the from the committee like with anything else, I'm gonna ask the community.
More things are going to come out with people with disabilities commit community So I think that's another important area to look into.
I just want to also see if there are any other members of the community who have a question for regarding this application as well too I mean people have to work, people have to go to school So my main, I have a big concern that, with the problem with solution, there was no liquor what the issues are going to be when there is liquor and what was happening on the corner.
that the community has okay I'd like to just ask one more brief question before we vote and then I'll be happy to make a mistake, mr caraballo and mr rodriguez, I appreciate your and your consideration to the community's concerns.
one day when the both of them join us during a community event, they are like this place is beautiful and since we've been offering a spot for the coffee people in the morning Your hours are from your open hours are from seven a.m to one a.m monday through friday and eight am to one am saturday and sunday, with a close on alcohol service at midnight seven days a week, we do not have any outdoor sitting, but because of Covid-19, the coffee shop actually has approval for open restaurant, and we finish Okay, I would just ask you guys one question which is that here at the health committee, we are very interested in local hiring and we wanted to have you speak briefly about the number of people you want to hire and give our some available options to consider between grasshall community center, fort greene, snap and the brooklyn navy art, which are great resources in our community?
I should have asked this as a question, but we assume that should any concerns come up from the community while you're in operation, you will be accepted to discuss those concerns and if they seem to have merit resolving them in a way that works as best as it possibly can for you, as well as the people's concerns.
