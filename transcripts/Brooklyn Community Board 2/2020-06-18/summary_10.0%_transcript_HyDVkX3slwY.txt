Cities transfer of development rights to the private real estate, firm, rap ski group, who's joining us today, just to check is ray lebanon, as he will be, preside, he's presenting that the developers portion of the presentation- this is Rob, I, think I saw his name.
So EDC began this project by issuing a request for proposals in 2017, where the sale of development rights from two city-owned Lots under the Manhattan Bridge, which the New York City Department of Transportation, currently uses.
So the city saw an opportunity to create commercial office space to create jobs in accordance with our New York Works plan, using that development potential that otherwise would not have been able to be used on remarks.
We have been working with EDC and again, as Christina said, into 2017, there was an RFP issued which was designated to the raske group for the transfer of about 98 thousand square feet of development rights for office use only so that's what we're here for the action that we're seeking is approval of the disposition of that floor area, the building itself, which I'd love to show you, but if I can't I will describe to you it's a twenty six story: building with retail on the cellar floor lobby space on the first floor, 90 spaces of for parking on the second floor, but there ninth floors would be for the commercial office use which again, which is what the development rights would be used for.
If this were by comparison and as the right development, we would have the same amount of residential floor area and the building would essentially be the same height as we're proposing right now.
Go ahead, tell me so you said as of right: it would have the same height and the same residential I, don't understand sure so the EDC or anyone else feel free to chime in whenever.
Well, there we go: that's real Evan, yes, what a pain in the neck, I hope you're, not talking about me all right, I'm, sorry, I, don't know who took me a while to get on and get on this website.
Rob, you can continue sure yeah I mean just answer the question that the residential floor area is unaffected by it by the land-use actions we're seeking here the disposition, the residential floor areas, the residential floor area.
The office is what would be coming in through the city approval, so the height of the building may be a little bit skinnier in the as of right scenario, but it would have the same amount of residential floor area and the same height but you're, putting in how many floors that you're putting in six floors of commercial office.
Next here's what the building's going to look like as you can see, the sort of tan lower floors are the office floors and then the sort of inset space between the office and the residential is an amenity space and some mechanical equipment in that area.
What would what would happen is the building would be the same height except that, basically, this the portion facing the bridge, the one bay of windows down to the ground would be would be eliminated, so it would just be thinner but same height, and it would look similar to the upper floors in this and destroyed that would just continue down to the down to the ground.
Space created from the development rights, which is what EDC in the city, are mandating that it only be used for commercial offices.
There was no Street frontages, no transparency, no commercial, so that will change with the new building skree trees, which will be provided, and there are you know, local of W MWBE commitments for hiring fairly straight forward in terms of what we're, what we're seeking what the city is seeking to do in terms of just taking floor area that exists, underneath the bridge which can't really be utilized by the city and allowing it to be utilized for office space within our building within the current zoning envelope and we're ready for questions.
Okay, what I do is just I see a lot of questions coming up, given the limitations that we have only one limited to our committee and board members I know Karen, you had I sell you a couple.
You have the first bat right now, looking at Dumbo in general, I, don't think that office creation is a community benefit.
You believe that the office is not a benefit, so I understand that, because we have so much commercial right now and all I see are people leaving commercial spaces.
There's gonna be at least 700 residential units dumped on us and we're getting no help whatsoever with things that actually add to quality of life I'm perfectly happy for a DC if they want to jump in on that yeah.
So, in terms of the office space I mean I would just say that you know the city planning for long-term job growth and making investments for the city's future.
You know further than Bob, so the ideas that the developer would create retail space to help further active skate, and if there is no transfer of development rights, the developer would really just build a fully residential so and in they would not be obligated to abide by any of the local hiring probes, including fire NYC in the minority women business.
Okay, thanks just for clarification at some point, there will be a Euler application for the disposition of city-owned property.
You have a right to build the way you want to build it otherwise because of the city property part of it.
You know, I know we're just talking about additional commercial density but kind of transit and other infrastructure issues and don't know and I just think that should be needed and just for clarification, you know we'll be able to get more into the term sheet when this matter comes through.
So that was one of the things that we're gonna state at the beginning and I guess well, at this time, I'm still formally starting the meeting and thank everybody for I say coming but being on this.
You know conference thing and you are being recorded, so that should make like, let that be known, that everybody will be recorded in addition to Karen Johnson, who will be taking the minutes as well she's doing the best she can on these very tough circumstances.
Move on okay, laughs next is the 110 Bridge Street, the landmark Preservation Commission application for certificate of appropriateness and the application is to modify the opening at the I just lost at the first floor on the south a secondary floor and to replace to existing stairs and with new stairs, and the accessibility will be accessibility, installing a new fence for the food court.
Oh yes, new canopies at the entranceway, so whoever is presenting on 110 Bridge Street, please step up hi, I'm, Steven, Choi I'm the project architect for this project for John, PT, architects.
Yes, I see it okay, so the building is 110 Bridge Street.
You said our application is for work at the first floor of the South facade off of Ridge Street, and work includes modifications to the entrances replacement of two existing stairs, replacing them with new stairs and an accessibility platform lifts installing new canopies over the redesigned entrances and installing a safety railing for an exterior stair to the Sun, so the building is located in DUMBO.
All of this surrounding area is public space, and this is a subway station here and the brooklyn-queens expressway going over the lock like I, said the application is for work on the South facade.
Our proposal is to convert this to an elevator lobby for the school and residential use, and then this is the area where the exterior stair is that's going to have that safety railing.
So here's just an overview of the facade like I said this is the existing loading dock area, the existing manufacturing entrance and this exterior stair down to the cellar.
So here's that proposed fence the new stair on the manufacturing side and you stay on this side and then yeah canopy, that's gonna, be installed, bud and then, like I, said we're.
That's going to be open about, so they can continue to use that, for loading, I mean here's an elevation of those additions, so you can see the new entrance here, a tripartite folding wall.
Canopy, steel and glass canopy match and here's just some images of that and then, like I, said, there's an existing stair exterior stair, going down to the cellar so we're proposing and safety railing.
It's just I, really look how beautiful that building is and I just don't think you're really I mean I, know you're complying to a DA and you're, making it more accessible, but it's really not very exciting or inspiring, given the beauty of the building, but you don't have any objections.
Any other committee members, all right hearing, none I'll talk a motion to approve in a second I'll start it off I move to approve a second esta blunt.
Okay, now, what we're gonna do it's a little bit different we're gonna do is like a roll call, since we can't see each other's hands very well, so Aaron, when you, okay, whenever you, when you're ready I, you know start giving up the reading out the names, Karen, you're, muted, okay, sorry, I'm, not sure I have a consist of.
69 Green Street, which is a petition for replicable consent, which means basically that if you know the property owner wishes to do something on what we call the public highway or in this case the walkway or a sidewalk and you're doing a stupe work, basically coming from their building.
The petition is to construct and the public right-of-way a stoop for before the bill from the first floor to the to the street level and there'll also be some work doing up what is looking here.
It's all going on to what is the city's or our property and could be it could be revoked, but right now they're asking for the city to allow the work to the public thoroughfare for the speed and whoever is ready.
Please go ahead bill, okay, so what we're looking at is LPC's already approved the work that has been proposed.
Yes, so chemic, emotion, I, have no problem like to make a motion to approve the application and I could second it?
Yes, okay, my question!
Let Z look green Avenue first right and if we're ready for a vote, mr.
She voted in the very first motion, but I think on this instance, I think we'll let the decision that was made by the committee stand, because the sympathy of the committee, or at least I would say the sent to the committee is that they did not like what was presented on 110, Bridge and I.
We already did the presentation on Adams Street, so the next thing coming up will be the minutes from February and I saw the minutes and I think the minutes were very well done by Karen, so I'll.
Just to let you know that the bar o president will be now doing their part of the Euler for 265 Front Street in vinegar, Hill, and that's going to be coming up on the 20 on the 30th of June at 6:00 p.m. again online, the bar President does have did send out a newsletter with links so for people or anyone who's interested in participating in that part of the ulid process.
Speaking of you look, my second thing is yes, 1:30, st.
The property opposition is going to be coming from people who live in the or next to the Williamsburg, Savings Bank, building and I.
Think the other building I think that's the Ashland building as well and they're concerned about the height the 21st storey height ever all of coming from the brooklyn music school Carlton, yeah I, don't know if you're aware, or about Saint Felix back in the 90s that whole street collapsed.
Yes, how do they say because it's nothing but subway tunnels and separate lines, but that's a fact: I don't know if people on the board is a report and we start drilling and doing foundation work.
Think that's what you had all those you know all those construction things that was going on for the longest time so but you're right in general is that there is a concern about I.
Think it's a legitimate concern is to if we're gonna build another large structure at that site that you know we should be.
Well, the people, the larger buildings seem to know.
So, there's nothing that it sound like it's not only in the brooklyn music school does that play it's the handsome place, methodist church that may come into play at the same time as I'm vaguely aware and Audrina classical could tell you because he's a member of that church, how you have predatory developers, lusting after property, now, no and I, don't know how that's gonna play out that whole corner is in play.
You know so yeah I, don't know why the Buddhist school I mean I'm not on their board, but if there's an opportunity for them to at least a church property for music Express- and you know- maybe there's gonna probably come up as part of the ultimate.
Sometimes I do visit over that way and I come climbing out of that hilly ramp going up, especially around let's say, 6:00 p.m. and it's not only more difficult when you're climbing out when there's almost seems like to be a thousand people coming down the ramp at the same time, and it's a it is it's that's always been something that I know I personally have been concerned about.
That's something had weird the York Street Station is something that has to be really looked at by the powers that be given its current now right now there isn't as much use of it there's not as much use of the subways, but at some point that's going to come back and we have a look at.
Yes, this is Sandeep travela, okay, you have two minutes great I'm, a resident of the Dumbo neighborhood, and thank you for allowing me to speak this evening.
So yeah I think that is a definite issue and I did bring that up at the exact meaning already: okay, well yeah, my I was going to even take the you're coming early from the other way.
It is that the as you can see, we are still building a lot of high-end housing and a lot of high-end retail, but it's mainly the high-end housing is being still either being built at this time or is going to be proposed and I think we should consider.
Will this you know be of any use if people start going elsewhere, who would have taken, let's say occupancy, either buying or renting high-end housing high-end retail, that the people who are doing developments in arm area, especially along Flatbush Avenue?
You know we've seen older I, think they'll all the store, all the stories of people who gone out, let's say to their second home.
I'm just I think I got the point that it's a federal level that doesn't mean that we shouldn't put a voice in and try it in this day of renewal and looking at what's going on today.
How can we leverage those proposals and the people who are asking us for things to do better, so I think maybe an action item might be I mean this is kind of a big action item but to try to start to document all the applications that are in our community board and we get those notifications from the do via or we did all the permit applications that are filed within our district.
That's the number of people have left because of the combination of the two, so I think it's you know that comes along Nicole today.
Look like the new when blight could be as nothing aesthetically, pleasing but 600 by Fulton, Street, I, don't know where they're at because of this economy, people are unemployed, jobs are being lost.
What will happen once these buildings are completed and they open for business and open to try to get people to come and use them to live in them or work in them or whatever?
I think we've done a good job unless there is really some other point, I'd like to thank everybody and ask for motion to adjourn I.
I just learned that since we have the an executive committee on meeting on Monday I didn't I wasn't aware of it, but now I am so I guess so I'll bring when I have to present for the situation on the 110 Ridge I will bring that up and I'll thank Karen all the work that she's done on this as well.
