It will be more of a concise way that a representative to communicate the concerns of the community to get to the topic that warrants that level of participation that I'm going to pick up with the agenda and introduction of committee members.
Anyone opposed everyone have a chance to review the minutes from April 27th 2020 for the executive committee meeting are there any noted collections may need you to speak up.
The committee met last Thursday on May 20th, and we went over the various line items and also just want to make sure make note of the fact that we were asked.
It's envelopes business cards $350 we had budgeted before we reduced that to 200, don't think we're actually gonna even gonna use that, but still that's there in case we have to replenish letterheads or business cards or whatever, as I said before, that money could be transferred to other line items if needed and staff training.
So let me entertain a motion to accept the budget as presented Thank You Bobby can I get a second Thank You Carlton any discussion on the motion on board members.
It's a proposal for 24 stories, new building on that lot, it's being proposed by the brooklyn music school with a developer partner, and the idea is that the school would get additional space rehearsal and performance space and would benefit from the income from this property.
First is Brian Kelly from the Gotham organization, and also that he'll precede me and then after me is Shelby green from the chair of the board of directors of brooklyn music school.
We bought the property in 2015 with the idea, after being contacted by leadership at brooklyn music school, to help create an expansion and combination of market rate and affordable housing.
An iconic building in the district to include brooklyn music school would be a hundred and sixty four thousand gross square foot development that includes a 20,000 square.
Foot, expansion for BMS, the height of it wouldn't exceed 285 feet or the shoulder of one hanson would include up to a hundred and twenty homes that would include 30% set aside as moderate-income, affordable, homeownership, affordable, homeownership, being the concept of creating both social and economic equity within the community.
The site was sold as a development site, but we have boundaries to work with and to make sure we respect our neighbor in context, architecture and design working around these easements and next the project highlights expansion of brooklyn music school, creating an educational, cultural hub, a base to serve underprivileged youth across Brooklyn and New York City Shelby will talk more about more than three-quarters of the students are at no pay, meaning this social equity.
We got involved and was a number of stakeholder discussions here, is the proposed building and still deemed to be too tall 750 370 feet, and our proposal today is a respectful height that is at the shoulders of one handsome place and is at a more modest development site quickly.
You all are very familiar with what's happening around the site, but this is a drawing my office put together, showing the two bridges at the water going all the way up, Flatbush to the park, the development that has happened in downtown Brooklyn and our site is this little red sliver.
The rezoning basically recognized the fact that this part of downtown Brooklyn is a transit, rich and actually historically, this has been the case also one Hansen and 67 and 62 Hansen were all built as part of when the Long Island Railroad lines came in and it was really established that and they really form a real part of the historic district personality.
We want to establish an appropriate scale of the same Felix treat street wall and there's a north lot line, facade so ad, that's very prominent.
Then we set back 20 feet from the south to preserve the view of those windows from the easement and we set back 5 feet to start the wedding cake of the building on the Ashland Street Ashland frontage place frontage set the building back 48 feet that preserves these line of windows here and then, as we go, we can't it further and create a gap between the proposed building and one Hansen so there, if one handsome, could really stand free as much as possible and then on the on looking Northwest there's further stepping of the building so in scale.
When we looked at how to treat this call, a building architectural e we've really discovered, there's really like two different colors and material flavors, there's one Hansen, BAM and BMS in the sort of limestone zone and the church, the townhouses and Fisher in the more of the brownstones, and as we started thinking about how this third building could we both relate to the church and to one Hansen.
Fourth Avenue that basically, the new building in the blue is completely obscured by one Hansen, preserving this iconic view looking south along Ashland and Fulton BAM, the fauna, one Hansen and I think this is really where our thesis comes most into play.
We've really kept the one Hansen freestanding, if you will, we've peeled back the building, we've created daylight between the proposed building and one Hansen, and we've changed the color so that there is a contrast from Hansen looking and portrait place before and after similar situation with the coloration and the gap daylight Flatbush before sneaking in the corner, it's rounding it out with street-level views, st.
I think that's clear from this North looking south again the church, the development site and BMS for the right- and here you can really see that the first, the street wall of BMS really picks up on the cornice line.
If the technical issues are not sooner, I will turn it over to Shelby, I'm sure there'll be questions afterwards and I have Bryan one quick thing before Shelby proceeds is again I want to clarify that this is a precursor to the Europe application which we would expect to submit later in the year.
Okay, I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes or, in my view, of what the brooklyn music school has been to the community, what it's doing now and what this project means to BMS and fulfilling its mission.
The student body, faculty and staff, and even the Board of Trustees, also reflects a mixed demographics of the community and more than 60% of students identify as people of color and more than half the faculty does also, and the school offers every kind of instruction in all your honor of music and arts, but it's so popular that it's bursting at the seams.
Okay, the project will allow the BMS to contribute to the community in another way, as well as Brian suggested by offering affordable housing.
So we hope that you will support what we believe to be a project that offers many kinds of community benefits back over to the chair over to your questions, so that was the excellent presentation and I.
You know our landmark land-use committee secretary and she had a concern that, because of the largeness or the bulk of the property that the that so many families will be moving into that spot and it may affect not just a brooklyn music school but would affect schools in general that you have so many families coming into that spot.
A heavy amount of children would be living that building and which is normally a good thing, but it could affect the school whatever schools that would be I, guess available or sent right at that location.
We look at one-one-nine, thinks it's right across from the school, we're curious about what the plan is for the old music school building.
Sorry, okay, that plan the plan is to renovate the existing buildings in a phased process as soon as the new facility is constructed and to allow offering more instructions in all different kinds of programs and to also renovate the Playhouse and the existing structure as well.
Mr. the chair of the landmarks Land Use Committee gave an overview of comments that have come in and hopefully that it's Brian Froud Brian Kelly from yes I need to follow the protocol of allowing my colleagues who sit on an executive committee meeting to answer questions and you get to listen in and I.
So, with all due respect, if you allow me to ask the committee members to ask questions, then we'll find our way to circle back to the community while I do have everyone's attention do not misinterpret what I'm suggesting everyone from the community will not get an opportunity to ask a question to speak on this.
Okay, great any other executive committee members of community board to let me have questions on there's Juliet, -.
In this case the Brooklyn Academy of Music historic district I think we're again where some of the questions came up was.
Any other question from board members lean in a little more okay.
There's a lot of questions about the height and I hoped I had addressed it in my initial presentation, but it's you know we do design a lot of buildings and historic districts and I always come to the table with like what would a architect who was working around the time of the other buildings.
Is that the same architect designed a tower and the church and what we thought was the best and most appropriate was to create a mid ground between the two and something that would form an ensemble as if you know it was the same office and the site next door is available and really create an ensemble where we spent a lot of time and architectural thought and looking at three-dimensional models and renderings and so forth to determine the appropriate height and, at the end, the two things that really sealed it for us is one keeping it below the shoulder of one Hanson and two and I think this is very important, is pulling the tower away from the streets in a way that really makes it much more gentle on the pedestrian experience.
Um- fer of the site, I think that we heard on some of the letters that came in when you say that you could have built an unlimited, Heights I, don't want people to be misled, because my understanding is that as of right, there is no f AR that could have been used to build anything.
Currently, the site is the parking lot itself and one Hansen, and it does not include polka music school so and under the current zoning there you're right there's a negative F failure there, any other questions from board members.
We are in New York City of what does it take to create progress, and this creates an opportunity for brooklyn music school who's, laid the groundwork for more than 100 years in brooklyn, for youth, to expand, not shrink to monetize the value of their rights to own and build out their facility and to create affordable homeownership without use of public capital, meaning not requesting direct subsidy of you know the affordable, homeownership opportunities, so I think when we all sort of take a step back of what could this create?
So we hear from the public and I'm gonna ask for five questions from members on the call who are not from the community board who's, not part of things that the committee to ask questions once again: five, but before I.
What I'm talking about is non businesses, residential people who live close proximity to the project, non-business representatives I'm, so my just actual people who so in so the idea behind the meeting to cohesively and strongly communicate what the development was and is we had the meeting in December for a public meeting which we voluntarily came to the board and said we'd like to present this project to the community, so that homeowners on our on st.
Is there way that we can, in a digital format, acknowledge non-members by you know having them raise their hands like how's Eric control, we're doing this because you can't see everybody on the screen in order to recognize who's responding.
Just curious whether or not the building will take up more like frontage distance on the sidewalk, then the EMS program, so okay, good happy to answer that question currently so, as I mentioned before, BMS was originally built as a Browns as a series of four brownstones and they had Stoops and when they were combined to create BMS and I.
You know when the teams like they were the super carved off and those entrances made the face of the building of BMS to set back seven feet from the property line.
Sure thank you, I'm just curious if there any sort of improvements to transit, cow or Nevins or Atlantic, that will come as part of this project jump in for a minute Brian before you answer that keep in mind everyone.
The project like this can naturally raise a ton of questions right, but I want to keep the remaining questions going forward.
That part of us before us tonight that we get to vote on is the design texture and then some of the questions come in naturally relate to community outreach.
So this development that includes affordable home ownership is generating economic activity to also create brooklyn music school.
So now let me let me take questions that are coming from members of the community and, let me just say this: there are several people: who've now figured out how to raise their hand.
I want to say thank you, those of you who already submitted testimony respectfully I'm, not calling when you begin to repeat what you've already written so I see you raising your hand but I'm, not gonna, do to repeat what I am going to do is call on members from the community, so I'm gonna start with James golden who is a member of the public.
That's a great question, but that's nothing to do architecture, so I think I did want to supervise one point of clarification.
What's your question architecture, you know, I think the building.
Cuz I know you already designed the building looks great, but then did something the answer on the Ashland side is the door is required because there is a loading easement that benefits one Hansons, so we need to have a door so that the loading for one Hansen is maintained or legally required doing.
As we started this meeting so given that in 723 and we've spent a considerable amount of time on this topic- and we have other items on the agenda that we need to cover, let me ask two things: there's a whole host of individuals that have identified themselves through emails to the board office and through this chat that have strong support for the project and strong support for the music school, as was noted by my colleague and the chair of the committee in his opening remarks.
I think that they're gonna need more height in order to be able to do their 30%, affordable housing, 20,000 square feet for the school I.
I was gonna, suggest something modest like a make sure all the mechanicals are within the envelope that they all the bulkheads on own mechanicals are within the bulkhead that they proposed, but maybe there's something you know in between those two, its Brian just to clarify.
Felix, a tree application is going to land well, Preservation Commission for certificate of appropriateness, and the only other thing I can think that we can do is simply a move to approve, as presented so it'll, be the full 24 stories.
It's because one of the public members did bring up a point currently right now we're seeing in the city and we're also probably to see a lot of departments they're going to be on the market.
What I'm just voting on right now is voting on the building itself when they come back for Euler, we'll see what the conditions are at that point in time.
The main thing we wanted to point out is that at the rear, which this is the this is 161, which is the larger building which comes out which has had the work done on it.
So our building is not coming out as far as that, but because there is an empty lot and you know it's a garage because there's a parking excuse me here, you will be able to see the back of our railing through the cars.
Yes I, think that's all I have right now: okay, I will entertain a motion to approve the application to Landmarks Preservation Commission certificate of appropriate appropriateness for 163 Bond Street I move to approve, as presented I, get a second mr.
Yes, I was wondering if the architect has rendering don't have any photorealistic renderings no I mean you will see a couple feet at the top of the railing and the brick, but we don't at the moment have any other questions from board members yeah question C, hi, Cheryl, Street, so I know exactly the building they're talking about this is a building we looked at years ago before we bought our house in Whitehall Street question for you that 161 is huge.
You know what I'm talking about yeah I mean the current owners had mentioned: that's how they did that building.
Also like to note, you speak with the neighbors across the street from 163 Bond Street, who would be looking at the building we haven't talked to the neighbors across the street.
We all got together and so Rob is there any information that you want to share with us regarding this application there was a lot of support from both the Fulton ferry landing Association they presented to the Transportation Committee in November.
So here's what is what is what I'm saying right and I'm only trying to be efficient here, I'm, not one who says you know, because we've always done it that we continue to do it I believe in looking at things in determine matter what voted unanimously, I, don't I, don't think, there's need for us to now.
Allow me we're not allowing us to shaumbra work in support of having committee meetings, because that new technology was gonna be a bit of a challenge and we need to walk through some kinks.
It may require the resources of other board members, who are a little bit more familiar with the functionality of this tool, because this is the tool that's been recommended to the city agencies, so just exercise patience, I think now we're starting to get the hang of this I will remind everyone that, as we have committee meetings or the month of June, it is important that everyone must register to receive the link to engage and be participant in the meeting.
So for those who don't have email, if you happen to know who them is on your respective committees, don't have email, I would suggest so that we don't lose interpretation and have everybody trying to answer questions that may be correct.
So that's why I said the board office would be the best conduit to communicate that to those who are computer, savvy or those who may not be good question bill.
Any other questions from board members yeah, so the somebody from the district office will be assisting so that, as the chair of my committee, I won't have to also moderate the technology.
Thank you, that's part of why we took so long because I wanted to work the kinks out so that you could be hands-free and be the queen to off of the community.
If there are members who want to speak on the community, you get two minutes literally two minutes, and then you will have to have your comments conclude.
Thank you any other questions from community members.
