It's and this process came up a year ago or a year and a half ago now, almost and the office of district planning of the department of education started to put forward a couple of potential proposals last summer, and there was a reaction from across a lot of community members gave feedback that it was going too fast, and there was also concerns that the process wasn't so inclusionary of bipark community members and nycha residents who are connected to all of these schools.
We use zoom, but, and we have been working on building our own knowledge, around histories and contexts of rezoning talking with other districts around the city, who've gone through similar process processes, we've been having we've been conducting community conversations with community members, which kind of like interviews, we've been conducting and we've been spending time at food distribution lines and at open streets events and building our knowledge around a community member's experience of schools, elementary schools and getting kind of the access to schools, perspectives on that process and that experience and then also getting community members, dreams and ideas and vision for what could be or what equity.
We've been doing all this, you know in the midst of a pandemic, with sort of unexpectedly limited or resources limited and constrained and unexpected ways, but we have this website and on it you can easily access the survey in a couple different places If people want to share that out in different ways via you know, whatever distribution list- and so we've been getting a robust response so far, but we are and we're really looking forward to hearing from and as many community members as possible, who might be impacted by this potential rezone On this online survey alone, we're really spending a lot of time out in community and talking with people who are very connected to local community organizers and community groups and community based organizations in building a knowledge and vision for what could be across these across these schools.
I mean people can go back and I didn't say before, but just to clarify this project is a collaboration between the community, the you know, brooklyn college and the nyu metro center and the department of education, so that you know part of the idea is that the department of education and the office of district planning are in some way accountable to the recommendations that we will present at the end of this process.
If people have additional questions for you, yes sure I'm gonna put, we have a district, I'm putting two email addresses well So next we have a representative from the new york city of civilian complaint review board that I understand we'll be talking about youth advisory.
So the youth advisory council has regular regularly scheduled meetings where they'll come together and over the course of the year, like one of the things that they did was specifically work on the public service announcement that had to do with informing you about the ccrv and last year hosting the symposium on youth police community relations.
More than welcome to do that, in terms of I mean, are there any other questions or is there any other information that I can provide in terms of the youth advisory council, so the applications will be going live soon and we're gonna have our new cohort coming in this fall, so you'll be sharing that with the community board, so we can publicize that as we publicize other entities, yes and I'll, be on posting those links in the chat great.
The use all of these really important questions so that it is community led and really thought through about what it would what it looks like who would use it and when- and I think now especially you know as we are in a new coveted world thinking about kind of how that plays into here and what people, what members of the community and what school members think kind of.
There is a lot of work to do around racial justice in our school system, and you know I'm heart I interrupted that, but I think that's an important point like will that entity that lab or a facility will that belong in a sense to district 13, so the district 13 community of school leaders, parents etc can help shape what happens there or is it a general doe type of entity?
Remember we heard a presentation about high school cafeterias and some of them needed redesigning not just for salad bars and things of that nature, but so that students could eat in more quote civilized way, rather than in these long tables, with those long benches that it's not like a family type of environment.
Schools could put in something called water jets so that young people could access water for free from like a healthy type of thing, not a fountain where maybe kid's bed is on it So do people think we should put in water jets in terms of cafeterias water jets and it'll have to be because you know you have to be careful with bottles.
But I I'm wondering if the schools almost need people in the role of making sure families have access to the internet and connecting them to it and like making it happen because handing somebody a device isn't enough, you know, and initially the dua handed people devices thinking they had internet and then had to give them ones with hotspots, because they don't you know and a lot of these families.
and then I wanted to share talking about food and free lunch just to let people know in your communities that even people who are not low income, so in other words everyone who had a child in a pub in the public school in this last year will be getting what's called a p pandemic ebt card and some people feel at the 420 I mean even for a working family 420 for each kid come up to a thousand very easily, so some people feel you know.
, I'm not sure if it takes place through the student year or graham, the other one is the brooklyn public library which you know we hear about all the time, but there's something in the brooklyn public library called center for fiction and what it is The other is divine ange's angels wellness center, that is they're reaching young people living in temporary housing group, homes, shelters and detent centers, and their goal is to try to help them develop self-confidence, learn how to be entrepreneurs and other things that you know can maybe help them get into a better situation as things improve in their life or as they you know, depart from high school , I opened it up and it said family of four following god, and it said it was unsecured website.
basis, independent, the new school, coming up any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, recommendations or what my thinking originally when the board office asked me.
I do think that I would like to hear from some of the youth, not necessarily from him to see some of the work that they have done around Covid-19 and also they've partnered, with a lot of other partners in neighborhoods, and most of the young people come from nycha.
