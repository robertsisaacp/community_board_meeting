So after the 11 point presentation, and then after our discussion with policy advocate brandon holmes, I've invited brandon smith from the the health and human services committee to speak to us about community courts in light of our discussion of the statement of district needs and budget priorities.
I mean, I would say all sidewalks and we probably couldn't like saying that, but obviously every street would need to be studied and we have to work with youtube and regina There was a more in-depth presentation about public space, open space, transportation and downtown brooklyn, oh great, and there are minutes to that effect.
Let's stay on this to see, if there's any more comments on eleven white, maybe from community board members opening it up to people who are not on the committee, you can type in the chat if you'd like to speak- and you don't see anybody typing in how about members of the public, you can use the raised hand feature.
Then I worked at the new york civil liberties union, where I developed an expertise around police accountability and transparency, advocacy efforts and some on the state level, some work around decarceration and decriminalization, and also advocating to repeal article 58, which until this week effectively hid all law enforcement disciplinary records from the public and now, in my current role and where I will be taking a leave of absence from in a couple of weeks, I've been at just leadership, usa, managing and directing the campaign to close rikers island, which is effectively in the past four years.
What I wanted to share with you all is for the past two years with the close rikers campaign, we've developed the build communities platform which our team published in 2019 and 2020, and this was done in collaboration with hundreds of directly impacted community members and service providers and experts across all five boroughs to identify key areas where the city could divest from the criminal legal system and begin to invest in local, community-based programs and resources that improve the quality of life.
and I know, brandon smith is going to talk about his experience with the red hood community, justice or the red hook, community justice court- and that's you know one of the things that we definitely want to amplify and prioritize and making sure that every community gets access to conflict resolution and alternative to alternatives to incarceration or alternatives to detention.
Some of the top issues you want to address are, but I'm going to share in the link a link to in the chat to the 2020 report that our team did definitely identifies areas of workforce development, public health consulate resolution and alternative forms of accountability, and also family planning and family support.
Homelessness, drug use are also the result of a lack of investment in public health in our neighborhoods and I think that's true across all neighborhoods in new york city mine in bed, stuy and euros downtown brooklyn , so I'm excited to participate in this conversation with you all and provide any support I can for my brooklyn neighbors, so I'll pass it back to juliet and brandon smith.
Possibly the benefit of what would be my dream and about this issue is there would be effectively community courts in every local community in brooklyn to handle non-violent and misdemeanor crimes that are are of a substantially different nature than the serious crimes that you see, get that go into felony court systems like attempted murders and armed robbery, and such the community court is based around a theory of having one courtroom, one judge and in many areas, particularly in the red hook, community justice center, which is really the best model of a community court that exists.
The value of it, though, is it instead of having the jail a more meaningful experience is exists for the person who's charged, and it goes along with the overall theory of the court, which is more on the problem-solving side than the penalty punishment side of criminal law and when defendants take a plea that exists to and requires them to complete one of these programs, whether it be for mental health services, substance abuse services, maybe anger management or their specialized services for domestic violence, which are which I've seen been be extremely effective and people embrace and really turn their lives around in a remarkable experience.
Of course, you have to have a judge who's willing to give a lot of second chances and to be pretty tolerant, but when you have that kind of a setting and when it's in a community-based atmosphere like, I think one of the big things that drove me to this feeling is that when we were sitting there with the close rikers hearings last year and having people who come up and talk about their experience at rikers, one of the real things that hit me was the discussion of how dehumanizing the experience was of being there.
Definitely that needs to take place with the prisons, but it also really needs to take place with the justice system, and I think from that you know the thought would be if we, if we would want to have a community court for the part of our neighborhood and community district 2 to handle the these kind of non-violent or in some cases you have some very like minor, violent cases where you have an assault and somebody doesn't have to go to the hospital or get hurt very bad.
You know, have start to focus on that and have our councilman who's still here for a year to who supported pushing through the you know the mega jail plan to start to, let the people in the community have a voice and decide how the funding should be spent sandy.
You have to get department of corrections on board to get, and it takes a lot of coordination and effort to get the to get a number of people on board with the with the idea and then there's also a non-profit that manages these community courts called the center for court innovation, which they're a really wonderful organization, but So it's it is a big process to get a lot of these people speaking to each other, but at the end, if it can work out- and it really has in other parts of the world- there have been these community courts created in places as far away as australia, europe and such that it just it takes a good, a lot of coordination This alternative community courts- You know they that may be a feasible, although it is not as community oriented as I think brandon would prefer it's a real site that could be used to incorporate a community court.
So I think the idea is that the community court would deal with the issues that would never put people in the house of detention.
I think, if you were to demand that 3.5 million it kind of just reinforces that, like 3.5 million dollars, it's not a lot of money to keep thousands of people out of jail when today, it's costing us about 330 000 a year to keep one person in new york city jails.
Because, two years after the after the incident, everyone has a worse memory, oftentimes, the police officer, retired and the there If they want, you know they can accept the plea or they can go to trial, and the system in the community courts allows it to work a lot faster.
Should we maybe support like youth-based programs, and I guess that would be broader than the public safety context Is transitional housing so there's a lot of conversation around affordable housing, but transitional housing for and removing barriers to housing and getting into whether it be affordable, housing or public housing for people who are justice involved.
One thing could be removing police officers from public schools and investing that money and those resources instead in fully staffing guidance, counselors- and you know- mental health, supportive services for students in schools.
What the end result was about 400 million dollars that got taken out of the nypd budget and put into the department of education and that 400 million dollars is still being used to hire police officers to be in public schools.
That city council did to work their way around that, but I think popular demand from many folks, especially parents, has been to remove police officers from schools and put the accountability on doe to hire and staff guidance counselors in school.
We have them, so is there consensus about adding this one as a priority, removing or support the removal of police officers who are now working for the department of education from public schools and increasing doe funding for guidance, counselors and staff?
There are ways to deal with public safety on a personal staff level on you know that is not necessarily police officers.
When you look at non-public, schools know they're, typically not police officers in there, but there is an mou with the department of education and the nypd that says that they have to keep those jobs in schools right now, now they're school safety officers in every school.
The one thing I do have to say is many of the school safety officers in that 400 million dollars of funding are people of color?
Are women and you know cutting them completely, also cuts these people out of jobs potentially I would like to say that when we think about new york city for the next 30 years, we're looking at like pockets of organized abandonment and like austere violence across budgets, and so when we think about spending money on police or school security guards instead of services that is doing harm, especially to people who are black and brown, and I I'm very much in favor of removing all police from schools and removing the security officers in exchange for more counselors, who are also typically women of color emily I just want to say thank you for saying that most of the school safety officers are women of colors.
This is going to take a while to be able to talk to the unions about how it's going to happen people's you know, pensions and all that, but to say we're going to reallocate this money to training you to prepare you to take on these social service jobs that we need I still want to see a world without prisons, despite the fact that my family directly profits and makes their income off.
You know defund the police, people, a lot of people think get rid of the police, and so I guess we allocate would be a more positive word to use more understandable than defund police Okay, so I have this language reallocate funding from nypd support, youth programs, increasing economic opportunities, education, internships, job training, health and mental health, social services, initiatives and I You know expanding the opportunities, also for first responders for mental health emergencies, prevention of violent crimes.
So those people don't have guns like I think oh right, reduce militarization of police.
I don't know that it needs to be a different one, but like if they're going to be these other programs and different kinds of police officers, there could be you know, traffic officers who didn't have reduced militarization works.
and so I would support removing that item actually but totally open to I mean this connects into the pro the possible additions to discuss because, like I think that traffic and placard people we're thinking about who aren't necessarily police are the ones who would care about pedestrian bike safety.
I'm glad we were able to tackle public safety in a in a much more in-depth way, and I just want to let you know I've been around a few other committees also, but I think what we're concentrating on as far as looking at security and things like that, it really shows how much interest we are giving to a very important subject.
