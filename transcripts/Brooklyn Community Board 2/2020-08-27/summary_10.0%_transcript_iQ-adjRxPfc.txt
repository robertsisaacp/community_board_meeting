This block- and there were concerns expressed from the community about the operation of the liquor store, I guess from previous experience- It was not his bench, but people would go to the liquor, store and use the bench to congregate and drink liquor that was purchased at the liquor store.
I do note that the and miss church and made it clear at our meeting that the that the district office was no longer requesting requiring that signatures be gathered for applications during the Covid-19 time because of the social distancing components that come up in that regard.
Opening in an establishment in response, the owner indicated that he would that he would completely adhere to social, distancing and mass wearing guidance that and the original time for closing the outdoor space, which was originally proposed at 12 midnight, was shortened to 10 p.m. Seven days a week, which was more in keeping generally with the standards that we would like to see from outdoor service in really any community, and particularly this block, which seems to be a very residential block by nature.
But it's really a virtue of what you believe in that regard, I think you know the applicant did express a desire to be to be cooperative and engaging with the with the community, and that should be noted as well, so that was the that was the first application that we heard that was approved four two zero.
I think I heard you say it was approved six one, three, six, yes, seven, eight, nine yeah, six, one three by the committee, so that means four people weren't like that happy about it.
The second item I want to report is, you know it's taking us a long time long time and we've had some turnover for a while, but for the first time in a very long time we have actually four members in our office So there are clearly some things that we need to enhance, particularly for those who may from time to time not get the full personal response that you would get in the past when four people were sitting in the office, but I would honestly say from my purview: there's been no real degradation in how we respond to community issues as they come up now.
In our last meeting in march, emotion was made second unanimously approved that the executive committee for as long as community boards were remote, would act on behalf of the entire community board and so what we, what we essentially did, was take on taken our summer policy and extended it, and This meeting will now have a formal agenda because we are going to continue to perform, has been governed by the motion and the vote.
That may require our action and our focus as the exact committee, but, like I said, more importantly, just to have a wellness and a checkup with the members that make up community board 2..
You know lots of people are experiencing a weird work environment and I both brainstorming and how we can better utilize physician support so I just wanted to give an update on the rest of our committee meeting for transportation and public safety.
