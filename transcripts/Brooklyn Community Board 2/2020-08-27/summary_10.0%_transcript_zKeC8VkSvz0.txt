Commission applications, the first one is two now do yourself: first, hmm, you have to introduce yourself: not the community members necessarily okay, First one is 295 cumberland street in fort greene, historic district.
This is the existing condition of the rear and then the new, so large windows on the back, but just under the garden level, the roof deck extends out to the exact same point as the facade of the building.
Moving on our next lpc application is 135 plymouth street in dumbo, and this is from the brooklyn public library and I guess the temporary branch that exists over at that spot and do we have the people from representing the brooklyn public library we do.
I see adam street library, , so we wanted to give a little bit of context to the signage project and also just we are really excited about this project, and you know, I think, it'll be a really great addition to your community.
plymouth street adam street and john street are the the streets Bpl's real emphasis was that this is a community resource, obviously a last truly public building that our cities have our public, our public libraries, and we really want to make sure that this building is embraced by the full community, and so we've done a lot of outreach.
and you know we really want to make sure that the library stands out and that it's clear where this new public institution is and where people can go.
You know this kind of idea of a kind of object that really orients you and tells you where these public institutions are both on the exterior You have these these kind of beacon signs that really orient people and utilize the cutouts, so that you can really see okay You know, with using kind of bold, simple words and simple letters to orient people through the space So the idea is that there are exterior beacons that really announce these important institutions in the city, and we have been inspired really by the neighborhood itself and its history of kind of large super graphic signs directly painted or applied to buildings.
It's completely transparent and it's a black material and on the outside, it's white, so it reflects against the windows this is the public building, here's the entrance and then around the corner on john street, a little bit more subtle just raised signs that read brooklyn public library.
Unfortunately, our public libraries in new york are the hours are not consistent due to budgetary reasons, and so this is a sign, that's changeable, as things change, hopefully increasing the hours and then here's the john street elevation, primarily just the windows with the race letters here.
it's a lot of concern of that particular intersection and want to make sure that it's something that we know we get the heads up on one way or Just focusing on land use right, we're focusing mainly on land use because there's economic issues, okay, so for land use, we're saying, affordable, housing and some way of dealing with the downtown football, perhaps and then homeless, shelters those three things or I mean I only brought up a homeless shelter because I thought that it might over that it might fall into our lap or part of it, but it doesn't seem to you know we can.
I think we have a very strange situation that, yes, we do on one hand this committee going to be receiving a lot of pr of proposals, a lot of projects to do major work in this in our in our board.
The additional street width is on the other side of the street and That's the one right by where I live across the street, from where mr gordon lives, a new building is being built in part of the right-of-way right They had proposed in that for a school, but that did that came off the The best we can do at this point is that we can hopefully convey a conce that concern about the loss of potential public parking for this ashland dekalb development, which is going before the board is standard in appeals.
