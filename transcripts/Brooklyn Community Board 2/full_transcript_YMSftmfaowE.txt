Station and public safety committee of brooklyn community board 2 has been called to order and is now being recorded for the purpose of transparency and for permanent public access on the cb2 youtube archive all attendees. Please keep your microphone muted when you're, not speaking, the district staff will actively assist in maintaining this protocol. The chair, vice chair and secretary, will be unmuted to be able to virtue to be able to host the meeting. It is the practice of a community board to to conduct virtual remote meetings with all community members committee members cameras on for full transparency. We encourage all attendees to also leave their cameras on, particularly if you are given the floor to speak, to maintain appropriate discussion and voting processes. I will make it known when and which topics are open for public comment by committee members board members at large and then the general public. If you wish to speak, please use the webex feature on the participants panel to digitally, raise and lower a hand, and I will call on you in order if you have questions that fall outside of the public comment time. Please type your questions in the chat panel and we'll address them. If we, if time permits, if any attendee experiences technical difficulties with the webex software or features during the meeting, please consult help.webex.com and after the meeting please reach out to the district office at bko2.cb2cb.nyc.gov. It is our desire to provide access for all of our neighbors, regardless of physical ability or limitation. So if you require any accommodation or assistance for full participation, please contact the district staff office before any public meeting 72 hours in advance. We will now begin roll call. Fondue will read the names and committee members should introduce themselves by full name with their cameras on. Please thanks. You are breaking up julia. Did you ask me to call the role? Yes, please yeah john kennedy, our chair is here: cheryl gelbs. I see her she's here, I'm here the secretary john tia, please unmute everybody so that they may respond and we can hear them. Okay, thank you and then individually. If you could unmute yourself, too, julia yeah present cheryl here on quint, I'm here on you here, green gallo, here, ryan howell, here I'm here, but I have no. My video is not working anybody else. I will mark your present. I can see you, but you can't see. Okay, that's just closer john. Did you call me this is powder all right. I didn't get to you yet all right sandy balboaza lackey yup hi hi! Caroline! I see oh hey. Thank you carol, I'm here, okay, so we do have a quorum and john I didn't catch. Who was on the phone? Is that ernie? I didn't hear ernie. I said kids on dudes on webex. He just doesn't have video okay, sandy and ernie are not present right, that's correct! As of now okay. Thank you very much and before since not everybody is identified by their name, whether you're a presenter or when it comes time to speak. Please identify yourself, so I can have your name and and anybody who's a guest who is not who, who wants to be recorded in the minutes as having been present, send an email to the board office indicating you were present during this meeting and your name will be on the guest list. Thank you. No, I would just like to share the agenda. Can I have sharing privileges? Julia go ahead? Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to do that. Thank you, everybody for your patience as we navigate this system. I can do it for you, julia okay, thank you, caroline okay, so, while caroline is pulling that up, I would like to just ask we're going to go through the approval of the agenda and, typically what we do for public comment is we have the committee members comment? First and then we have board members, and then we have the public so we'll follow that protocol. We have bike lane updates tonight from dot. We have changes to proposed if you can scroll down as I'm going through this caroline scroll down the agenda, please so that everybody can see it. Thank you. Those are the bike lane updates from dot. We have changes proposed to create more space for pedestrians and cyclists on the brooklyn bridge promenade on the next page, and that is being presented by paul schreiber, who is a resident of community district 2, and I understand also on transportation alternatives. Then we'll have our meeting minutes during the chairs report. There are a couple items that I'd like to address. There is a a an adam street crossing by the brooklyn bridge that I had emailed to board members committee members last night and had previously been sent by the district office. I would like to talk about the recent events with the protests and the black lives matter movement, and I would like to talk about the statement of district needs that we're supposed to get back to the community board on after that will be community forum and other business and then adjournment. So can I get an approval of the agenda? Please so moved great, second, second from patrick great, all in favor, bye, hi great. So because we have all of these items, I would like to ask a dot to. We do have a strict cut off at eight o'clock, so I may keep the presentation moving a little bit, so I would just like you to keep track of the time and our first presenter from d.o.t. Will that be patrick kennedy? It can be, yes, is: are you presenting smith and j streets? I am nuts I'm presenting fourth avenue, who is presenting smith and j streets hey's lord hi hayes. Would you like to share your presentation? Yes, please thank you and, while you're doing that this is a secretary. Is this going to be available? If anybody after we finish the meeting, is it available online? Yes, it will be posted tomorrow and please send it to the board office, also, so that, if I need it for reference, they will be able to send it to me. Certainly thank you you're welcome. So I want to thank everybody for allowing us to present tonight again. My name is hayes lloyd and I'm with the bicycle unit, with the department of transportation. I will just briefly in the interest of time talk with you about this very terrific project. By way of backgrounds, smith street was introduced back in 2016 when we were advancing the j street project, but because of the different construction projects that were going along. Basically at the intersection of skirmer horn and smith street. We decided to hold off on that, so we are now coming back to the community board with the the proposal which I'll discuss in brief in a few minutes. So just by way of background j street was installed in late 2016. Unfortunately, due to other construction projects, we weren't able to complete the the entire project, so we were coming back now to be able to do that. In addition, we've had the opportunity to be able to see the the bike facility in operation and be able to see what tweaks could be made and additions made. So what we're looking to do is making some some minor modifications to the design primarily around the metro, tech bus, stop which I'll go into a little bit later, as you know, with the colleges expanding in that along that particular corridor, as well as just the the businesses at the time pre pandemic. This whole corridor was very was bustling and a lot of cyclists were coming to downtown, but there was not enough bike parking so as part of this project we're also looking to install bike corrals, we have the partnership with downtown brooklyn partnership, who have been a great partnership with you know, plantings. You know on the planters, I don't know if you've seen it general maintenance along the corridor and and we're very pleased to have them. The other aspect of this design that we started to notice, as many people who have traveled through the tillery street intersection of j street is, is that it's it's it's a fairly complicated intersection. So what we're looking to do is to actually make a connection using johnson street for the one block between j street and adam the atom street bike path, to be able to allow for easier and safer movement to cyclists, who are looking to go to the brooklyn bridge? Hey, yes, hi! Could you just maximize your screen by clicking on the double squares in the upper right? Please sorry, no problem! Oh something's happening okay, you're going to want to click the x next to collections. No, not that one, not that one, this one, no, no to the right of the word collections, go down about an inch about an inch okay. That close that one great! Thank you so much! That's doing it! It should expand in a second, it's okay, okay, so, and then also you probably heard from mayor de blasio that j street has also been designated as a priority busway pilot location. So we are going to be incorporating bus lane designs moving into the into the future. So now, as you can imagine, the smith street design is basically very reflective of what we did on j street. So there's no real changes in that. In that regard, can everybody see that? Okay, yes, okay? So again, there's going to be really no changes just by way of explaining the corridor of smith street very much like portions of j street there's a lot of bus stops so we're unable, at this present time to do anything on those particular blocks. But what you see highlighted in green is where we're going to be putting in the the protected bike lane. The one challenge behind smith street, as you know, is that up until skirmahorn street smith street is one way northbound and then north of skirmahorn, smith and jay are two way so that added some complexity to the design process. Now, as you've probably been seeing over the past several months back in, I believe it was march. We started to install a temporary treatment. It's still a work in progress, especially now that more and more people are are returning back to the corridor as well as more people are cycling. So it's a ever evolving process, but this is just demonstrating that we're very, very sincere and very interested in making improvements along this corridor as a teaser. Our bike volumes along that corridor for the count years that we were able to do. It basically saw over a 20 increase in ridership during that time, and you know I don't have any june 2019 or 2020 counts, but I could definitely say that that volume has increased tremendously so being able to provide more protection and a better infrastructure for a cyclist now is, is really important, so again, j street same design for those locations where we're looking to complete the project. There are no surprises there. So let me draw your attention to the myrtle promenade crossing back in 2016 in consultation with new york city transit. We developed this particular design shown in the existing conditions diagram. But after evaluating it a bit further, we definitely saw abuse of the the the slip lane, which is the the lane just to the right of that crosswalk, and you know people parking in it, standing in the in the in the bike lane or even in the in the slip lane. So we saw it as a as an opportunity to actually make some changes, also because that's a major crossing for pedestrians, going from the north side or the west side of the street to the to the east side of the street. So what we're proposing is really just to eliminate that slip lane entirely build out in paint the pedestrian crossing on the east of the street to be able to shorten the the crossing and then to to be able to change the design slightly for the buses coming into the the metro. Tech bus stop as well as to to add some physical structures to the to the bike lane, because it's also getting periodically parked in or buses or often blocking it. So we wanted to do something just to allow cyclists to safely move this through this. This very large bus stop now in terms of bike parking. Our our bike, corrals, is, are very popular. I'm showing a photograph on the left-hand side of one that we did on fifth avenue in park slope. They typically have four bike racks for eight bikes. They can have planters which, in this particular design, they will have planters and then followed by the linears, where, as it's obvious, where we're planning on putting those bike corral stations are basically right by the colleges and then in front of the metro tech driveway. Now, as I mentioned earlier, the brooklyn bridge connection, we are looking to put bicycle infrastructure on johnson street, we're still sort of deciding what we want to do in this particular location. So we are going. You know we need a little bit more time. You know it's it's funny that it's only a block long, but you know if we just want to do it right, so stay tuned, but I think once we make that connection, it's going to be a great connection to divert a lot of brooklyn bridge, bound cyclists. You know from tillery street. So, finally, you know we plan to to implement this project or all these projects during the summer of 2020, so with mystery, they'll get the the protected bike lanes where we can j street. Similarly, we'll update the design for the the myrtle promenade crossing and then add the bike corrals johnson street. You know that design is is, is to come, but you know it'll be a nice simple design and then all our designs will be incorporating the the bus priority or the busway pilot project, and with that I can open up the floor to questions. Thank you hayes. If you have questions, please raise your hand and in in the chat I will be texted that you have questions. So, while I'm waiting for questions, I don't know how to do that on my phone juliette. Oh, is that john? Do you yeah? Oh, it said okay, said well I'll I'll call you that sounds good julia. We do not currently have any hands raised. Oh I'm, sorry, caroline todd, all right great. Before we get to you sid and caroline, hey, I'm happy that you addressed the metro tech crossing on j street. We did approve that when it came to the committee to put the bike lanes inboard of to make the productive bike lanes, we have found afterwards that there's a conflict with pedestrians and the tricyclists at that crossing, because it's not a car crossing. Sometimes the bicyclists don't stop for the light and unless there's a herd of pedestrians crossing the street, there's there's often a conflict. So I'm wondering if there was any thought to addressing that. I think part of the design is addressing that. I mean you know that right now, I think the cycle because they get you know they are in their protected bike lane and then really have no traffic, except for any buses that are pulling in. You know they unfortunately decide to go through a red light. What I'm trying to mitigate with the design is to have the pedestrians step into the into the pedestrian the painted pedestrian island, so they are out of the way. So if, if there is a cyclist who chooses not to follow the the law and runs the red light, at least the pedestrians will be in a safe place, so that's yeah. Would you consider a bike light just to reinforce that the light is the the traffic light is also for bicyclists? We typically don't do that. So that would be an unusual instance. We usually just use the the green ball, the the typical traffic light, and so that's what we'd like to sort of use, but I can certainly bring it back to see you know what people are thinking, but if we do it at that particular location, then it opens up pretty much doing it almost at every location. So now this this one is particular because there is no vehicular crossing. So that is why the metro, tech location is different from even what you've proposed on smith street, because all of the stop lights are at vehicular crossings. Right I will, I will leave it there and then I'll open it up to other committee members. It was, it was not sid, it was john dew who want who spoke up so oh thank you, okay, so john, you can go first. Can you hear me? Yes? Yes, yes, okay, mr hayes, do you have any accident data for that corridor? That's the first question. The second question is is as it relates to the bus, stop the b-54 terminal. That's at the plaza. We had a presentation from the partnership where a recommendation was made to explore moving that b-54 terminus from myrtle avenue to somewhere under the promenade to eliminate the conflict between the buses and the bikes. Okay, so I'll respond to the second one. First, that is the the first time. I've heard that so I can explore that. Certainly, and then the second of the the first question is: do we have crash data? We do have crash data. I don't have it with me, but we we could get it to you. Certainly it would be helpful to share that with the community board that will share with the committee. Thank you so much you're welcome. Thank you and caroline todd great. Yes, thanks hayes, I'm wondering about the protected lane on james smith, where you turn left onto skimmerhorn, because you can't continue going further. Will there be any proposed changes for that intersection at smith and skimmerhorn? No, that design will pretty much stay the same. Can I encourage you to look at alternative options for making a safe turn from smith because it's a dead end there for down further self-growing cyclists? Certainly thanks you're welcome. I just wanted to let people know if you wanted to raise your hand, you can go to the participants panel, which is the person icon on the bottom, and you click on that. And then you see your name. There'll be a little hand by your name and you click the raise hand icon. That's how you raise your hands, so it doesn't look like there are any other comments. People can add additional questions in the chat box if you'd like and I will move on to the next presenter jill. I have my androids and, oh I'm sorry go ahead. Brian. I wanted to pay attention to the intersection of jay and tillery streets. I know the I'm creating it from the south. You know the lane is incomplete and that, hopefully, will be fixed as part of this project. But if, if the the lane coming from the north is any guide, this will be handled. The protected bike lane essentially disappears into a right-hand turn button for vehicles going south on jay trying to turn west onto artillery, and this creates a a conflict between people who are trying to. You know bike newton south on j street to and from manhattan bridge with drivers who are trying to turn onto tillery, and I know we don't have any examples in new york city, but they you know, are plenty around the world. There are some you know in other american cities. I think nato even has one in their guide, but I really call for a protected intersection at hillary and jay. One of the problems with protected bike lanes in new york city is that they disappear exactly when people biking need them most, which is intersections, and I just think it's really sufficient to have protected by lane disappear into the turn line at a at the busiest crossing of the entire protective icon. Thank you for your comment. Hi juliet kevin duggan's hand is raised. Are there any other community board members before we get to kevin? Okay? Let's get to kevin, then kevin duncan hi. Thanks for taking my question, I'm I'm a brooklyn paper. I was wondering I I'm not sure if you mentioned this, the johnson street design is that also being installed this summer. Yes, okay, thanks and one of the issues. I've I mean our our offices are right by metro tech. So I see this street like every day before the camp. The pandemic and a lot of the lanes are, are blocked by law enforcement. A lot of the time like it seems like a lot of the local police kind of leave their park, their cars there and hang out like in the in the bus terms. You know it's a enforcement question with police themselves or the enforcers, so I was wondering if dot is doing anything about this issue. At that specific stretch, the present time we recognize the issue and we've been addressing it and right now we don't have the the best solution, but we are going to continue to to work on making sure that the the placard parking at particular locations is is mitigated and stopped. That's all my questions thanks. Thank you. Thank you. So now I would like to move on to the next update, which I believe is fourth avenue between 1st street and flatbush avenue, who will be presenting that that will be patrick kennedy. Great patrick you're, on okay, just just have to share my screen, so sure does that work? Can everyone see this? Yes, okay, all right, excellent, okay! Well, hi! My name is patrick kennedy, I'm a project manager with the bicycle program, and I am here to present to you our continuation of our extension of the fourth avenue protected bike lane. So we're going to be talking about some of the background and history of this project. It's been occurring in multiple phases. If any of you are familiar with 4th avenue, you know that this is you know: we've been working on this quarter for quite some time and yeah. This is like the last piece that we're trying to finish. I'm gonna go into the proposal just to talk about the details of what we're proposing, which also, if you've been following. This project, should be semi a review and then I'll be talking about how we're going to make that work. To sort of the issues that we will try to be addressing during the proposal and I'm going to wrap it all up in a nice neat, summary, okay, so first so vision, zero as hopefully, this is a review for a lot of you here at the community board, but it's our interagency plan to treat craft traffic crashes as preventable and try to solve that with through design. Fourth avenue is a vision, zero priority corridor and it's one of the four vision: zero great streets that we have designated a little history on on fourth avenue. In 2013, we had a project where we reduced it to two lanes in most places widened to the the the median and we were able to decrease. You know crashes with injury and injuries for pedestrians and cyclists, so that project in itself was very successful. However, it did not include any protected bicycle facilities. This was something that then became a subject of a number of workshops which were conducted back in 2017 for the most part where people were able to just voice their concerns. Talk about the corridor reimagine it as something something else, and then that led to, if, if you have been on fourth avenue, I led to for the most part that co-worker being transformed into a protected bike lane. We have been able to complete sections further south in the 60s and then from the first to 15th street, and then we are. We were hoping to finish the section in between from 15th down to the 60th. We got very close last last year, we're hoping to finish the rest of that up this year, but this leaves one one one part of the corridor left that has not been started and that's from atlantic avenue down to first street, part of which is in cb2 so for the proposal. So this is the cross section that has been implemented on other parts of fourth avenue. On the top you can, you can see the on the northbound side on the right side. We have three northbound travel lanes on the south side. We have two two two travel lanes and that's that's the typical cross section for this section of fourth avenue. I think there's three blocks at the bottom closer, I think between carolyn, first, where it's only two northbound travel range, but for the most part, it's it's three north and then two south. Our proposal is to much like the rest of fourth avenue to install protective bike lanes along both curves, so we'd have two northbound travelings and two southbound travel lanes parking offset from the curb and then a protected bike lane along both sides. Then of course we're hoping to follow up with a capital design that capital design has been. It's been basically chugging along, and we can talk about that later in the presentation. But right now our this is our proposal to to get that that the the the temporary material design in the ground as soon as possible. So for the intersections we'll be using much like the rest of fourth avenue. We call the offset crossing model where we have. Basically, the intersection is daylight on on both the north and the south sides with the the pedestrian area, and then it forces the vehicles to slow when they're, when they're turning and it allows for lots of visibility for both pedestrians, who are crossing the street and for cyclists. It also requires less parking removal than our more traditional mixing zones which we've used in the past. So here's what that would look like from the interim model that we're we're proposing now and then to the capital, build out we'll be just taking those those painted pedestrian spaces and changing them over to something in in concrete. So for the the specifics of the design, as I said before, fourth avenue is three northbound travelings in from carroll up to atlantic, and with that we for that section, we'd be taking it down from three down to two and then in the southbound direction. We'd be keeping the two travelings that are that are currently there so just to we understand where all those locations are now getting further north up to times plaza. This is where fourth avenue intersects with atlantic and then flatbush. It's a very congested corridor. There's a lot of people moving through it, a lot of vehicles, a lot of pedestrians, it's transit hub, a lot of cyclists, and for this, what our our proposal is is for, and I'm going to start with the northbound section first, so in in that case, sort of the lower right-hand side of the screen of the screen, you'll be putting in a painted curb extension along the east, curb pushing out the curb to provide more curb space for pedestrians who are walking and then having a curbside bike lane next to bath. Northbound cyclists when they approach atlantic would cross at the same time as pedestrians. Atlantic is a three-phase signals. The atlantic and fourth, is a is a three-phase signal, so we have fourth avenue. Northbound goes atlanta goes then. Fourth avenue southbound goes so it's three different phases, so we would have the northbound cyclists be, would be crossing at the same time as as pedestrians who currently go during the southbound. Have a new vehicle face. So when the vehicles that are coming from flatbush are going, that's when pedestrians cross as well so northbound cycle should be crossing during that time, going in between atlantic and flatbush we'll be creating a connection through times plaza in advance of the capital work. You may notice that it's a dotted green line at a solid green line. We are hoping to have there's a capital project that is almost imminently beginning at that location. So we need to coordinate with that capital work, so we're hoping to have either a connection on the on the west, curb for southbound cyclists and then a cyclist either up on the triangle or next to the triangle and protect it in some fashion. But we're going to have to work with the capital construction in that location to try to come up with the the best solution to get cyclists north and southbound safely through that that section there. But to do that, we would also need to remove one lane of travel from that little section between flatbush and atlantic. You would do that by banning the southbound right turn. Four southbound vehicles there and removing that right turn length. So we would take it from three lanes down to two. It is a very, very light movement, so we wouldn't really be affecting much of the movements that are already going on there and then also further north on sort of at the top of this graphic, where there is a big white, a little two-way white arrow we'd be creating a cyclist connection to ashland place and the manhattan bridge. Once again, because there is internet capital work here, we have to basically try try to get this either into the capital project, or do something temporary in the interim to try to make this connection we're exploring both like adding concrete, adding, adding ramps here or perhaps adding asphalt, we're trying to work with work with the existing. You know the the capital project there to try to figure out the best way to do this, because what we don't want to do is try to do something like make modifications to the curve and then have it torn out right afterwards. So we're trying we're trying our best to come up with the best solution that will work for the capital work. That's about to start here for the southbound direction, for for cyclists coming south coming through the the the the times plaza area once again, we'll be taking out that that third traveling for vehicles, so there'll be room for cyclists along the west, curb and then crossing atlantic. Then back back down onto fourth avenue at the south of atlantic. We would need to remove parking on that's on that block there, so between atlantic and pacific, to allow for to basically have room for the southbound bike lane to to be there. Also, while I'm in this location of the slide, removing the pedestrian refuge island with all the things that we're adding to this location here, especially with the extended ped space on the east side of fourth avenue and atlantic sort of noted in the in the to the tan area. There we we just, we need, we have to compress all the travelings together. So we're doing is we're taking the pedestrian space, that's in the middle and consolidating it to the to the east side of the street, so that we're able to allow for the buses to make their movements and to also be able to get in the protected bike lane in both directions on this block so going on to making it work for the parking impacts, we're looking at about five spaces per block to accommodate the refuge, the pedestrian refuge islands, it's about 18 spaces in cb2, about 59 and cb6. So here's an example of that that space we need the daylighting of the intersection on both sides, so for double parking, which is actually a an issue on this this board or sniffing issue on this corridor. We did conduct a time lapse, study to identify areas where the dark double parking was most prevalent and we're looking at expanding our metered parking in in this location. A lot of it south of bergen is alternate side parking only so we're looking at expanding meter parking we'll have more on that later. In the slot later in the presentation, we also conducted an immersion survey to determine loading and delivery needs of businesses on fourth avenue and yeah for, along with what we've done on the rest of the corridor. Our our goal is to install consistent loading zones and meter parking where needed, and then the traffic analysis that we we conducted here initially I'm going from three lanes down to two you'd. Think that there's going to be a lot of congestion caused by that, but we were able to actually without altering any of the actual signal. Phasing on on fourth avenue: we're able to extend green time for for certain blocks leading up to atlantic, which allows the same amount of vehicles that were passing in three lanes so now passing only two, so we're able to basically meet the current demand of the vehicles that are there to allow for us to make all the other improvements for pedestrians and cyclists on this corridor. So, regarding curb management here, is between first and atlantic noted in red are the locations there are eleven locations where 11 blocks, where we're looking at installing a a meter regulation. Instead of the alternate side, so yeah starting down at first we're also and then going all the way up, it's sort of clustered around down by union street and also then again around bergen and st marks. We're also looking at sort of us at the sideways locations. There's one in pacific one on bergen, one on st marks and then another on on union. Let's focus on the cb2 related stuff, like this sure, okay, so that's the only only down to warren. So that would be. I think I think, would only be bergen yeah, only only the bergen location for that we would only be we'd, be looking at, what's called a spur meter location which is basically just on the side street instead of on on fourth avenue itself, really just because there is a high amount of commercial activity, that's happening at that location, but that wouldn't be getting that far into the the side street. So in summary, yeah the cross section again going from the three northbound travel lanes down to two installing protected bike lanes on both sides of the street and with the offset parking using the pedestrian refuges at intersections. Here's another way to look at it, the so the top down view so yeah protected bike lanes head refugees, maintaining all the the capacity for the existing volumes meter parking some parking loss about 18 spots in in cb2 and then continuing to coordinate with the capital, build out of 4th avenue. There's a several different capital projects that are that are happening all concurrently on fourth avenue so working with those, according with our partner agencies, to to make sure that we're able to make a connection through times plaza. So that is the presentation. Are there any questions, and should I stop sharing my screen now? I'm just oh! No! No! Keep your screen up! Patrick! Thank you sure. I think with the questions people may ask to go to different slides. I think I think your improvements to fourth avenue are are fantastic. I I do think times. Plaza is a little bit confusing. We have had a lot of presentations about times plaza and a lot more detailed proposals, so I was wondering if you could go back to that slide sure and maybe walk us through, for example, if the right lane turn from flatbush avenue onto 4th avenue is getting eliminated. Where do you foresee that traffic moving to since 4th avenue is such a strong southbound corridor? Is it moving down to fifth avenue, because third avenue is northbound only so I'd like to understand that, first of all? Well, the you mean the right turn lane that is on fourth avenue between flatbush and atlantic. That one is that what you're eliminating yes yeah, it's like a dotted red line there. It's like that in the in the triangle is that that short block between flatbush and and atlantic. It's three lanes wide and we're going down to two lanes and to do that. We're eliminating the right turn lane. That's it's basically southbound. Fourth to atlantic. It is yes, it is all the traffic from flatbush avenue that wants to get to park. Slope! That's going down! Fourth avenue now, we'll have to go down. Fifth avenue is that, where is traffic, where are you expecting traffic to be redirected, we're not eliminating the the ability for people to to exit from flatbush to fourth avenue? Oh okay, we're it's one once you're on that little that short block there, people making the turn from southbound forth to to atlantic avenue to westbound atlantic. You are limiting the right-hand turn from fourth to atlantic, not from flatbush to fourth, yes, the the what you're describing the the flatbush to fourth is a very heavy movement. I'm describing that's, that's a very light movement, not that not many people actually make that right hand turn there, mostly because they're deterred by the the amount of people who just want to head south on on fourth avenue: how would they access flap atlantic avenue? Otherwise? Otherwise they would- I mean they they could they'd have to go past. I think the fifth and then around or people could go south on nevins and then over on atlantic and be on the other side of the street. Okay, I'm gonna, ask I don't I don't know who has their hands raised, I'm going to ask brian. If you have comments on this as a bike person. I I just said sorry, I must have missed it. Why is the pedestrian, the rubber pedestrian refuge island being removed? Because with the addition of the bike lanes on both sides, we, like we have to deal with the bus turn from resident east atlantic to southbound 4th so we're we have? We have to deal with the amount of like like that. Bus has a has a sweep because it's it's coming from the curb on on atlantic avenue. It goes to fourth avenue because the the stop is right there. So there are challenges with with the turn for the bus, but also because we need to keep all of the vehicle lanes that are here so there's three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes plus two bike lanes, the the space we can't make enough space in the middle for an island, so the the the best place for that space be reallocated is along the east, curb where we already have a lot of extra space to begin with, because there's a shift in alignment on the east curb of fourth avenue between atlantic and pacific. So our our plan is to build that out like to push that further out to make a wider sidewalk to shorten the crossing that way. Okay, just to be clear, the bus is turning from atlantic onto fourth would now because of the southbound bike lanes sweep into the area that's currently occupied by the pedestrian island. Yes, yeah, okay, we'd be pushing all of the northbound lanes a little bit further to the west, so it just narrows the space in the middle of the street when we add in the bike lanes on the first. Thank you juliet. Next is caroline: please go ahead. Caroline all right, I didn't know I had my hand raised, but I I do like the protective bike lights here and I'm glad that they're being extended sooner than we thought. I guess my question is about signals. How much work will go into changing signals for pedestrians and for people trying to cross the street as a car or as a person or a boss, so so there's actually minimal. There are very minimal there aren't any what we call phasing changes. I mean like adding a left turn arrow or something like that. I'm not changing any of that. Most of the changes we're making are in the timing. We don't have to add any new hardware. The only new hardware we need to add in this location is actually at times plaza and that's for northbound cyclists so that they they have. They know when to go cool. That sounds like a great addition, but I I am mostly curious about the timing and how and when that will be determined, meaning the timing further further down the corridor. The timing for someone to cross fourth avenue on atlantic, not making any timing changes to the fourth and atlantic interest section. Okay, that's interesting thanks, yeah, the the the way, the way the traffic works or the the way that we're able to to make this work for for vehicular capacity is actually to change the intersections leading up to atlantic and and forth. Juliet. I have a question: please go ahead, john! Actually, it's not a question in in. In our past communications, with dlt for projects, we had asked that you come with numbers specifically traffic counts, so we can have a greater sense of the kind of track traffic that we are looking to impact. The other thing we had asked for- and we were told, was going to happen with these types of projects- is the time-lapse photography. That would give a sense of how the particular intersection is currently functioning versus what you were going to look to correct. So it's difficult to contemplate all of these changes and the impacts that you're suggesting will happen without actually knowing what is existing today, and the last item has to do with the changes that we are making. I know dlt is hesitant to want to install permanent signage. However, if, in an appropriate location, it would be advisable to install some temporary signage that alerts both pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as car drivers, to the changes that are being implemented so that there is a visual description of the difference in whatever the transacting in that particular intersection is going to be, and it could be temporary. It could be a week or two weeks, but those folks who frequent would understand that there's going to be this type of change in how they're going to negotiate this particular corner, okay, okay, patrick, do you have any responses to that or you're just gonna? Take that back yeah! So so can we for the time-lapse photography and for the the traffic traffic studies I mean we can definitely get you some some of the more concrete numbers we come up with it's just. This is a long corridor and it's a very short presentation with a limited time, so we wanted to try to like if we hadn't included that information we'd still be talking about it now, but we can definitely provide it to you, especially the results of the the time lapse. Photography, it's it's been collated. It's been analyzed so yeah we can. We can definitely do that. Thank you. No I'm! I'm gonna look into oh, go ahead, sid, so we can't hear you if you're talking, you may be muted sid go ahead and talk you're unmuted. He wrote his question in the comments. Maybe it's helpful. If how would the southbound trucks get to fourth ave? You can make the right turn southbound from two lanes and then he notes that it says right here, band right, right from flatbush to fourth avenue right, no, we're not we're not bending any rights from flatbush we're banning the right from southbound 4th to westbound atlantic right. So I think sid was confused like I was kevin. No, I'm all good thanks any other community members want to chat. They can click the talk bubble, that's in their menu bar at the bottom, and they can ask questions in that too. Hello, paulo. We hear you hi, I'm sorry paul schreiber put his hand up a while ago as well. Oh thanks carolyn. I can't see anybody's hands carol, no okay, paul hi, patrick. I really like what you're doing to 4th avenue. It is an area, that's pretty dangerous and I'm glad to see. What's going on, I have a question regarding the blocks where you're looks like partnering with you consider implementing loading zones on those boxes and admitting some of the double parking problems. So, in our analysis, which, once again, I will send the board we found it was actually most mostly private vehicles or for hire vehicles like smaller vehicles that were actually doing all the double parking. Okay. So so, with that encouraging turnover and having having meter parking instead of alternate side is is according to our at least our parking bureau of parking is the most prudent response. Okay, this is something I mean. These are parking regulations and we can change meters as we need to. So. If we find that that we have a commercial parking issue for for loading, that's something we can definitely address yeah, just to add on to that. In california, there are herbs that are created for, like passenger loading, not just metal loading, and I don't know if that's something that's done in other places in europe, but that might be something you could do here to give people like reserve one spot for passing and pick up a job yeah like once again, if, if we like, if we find that there are areas where there's lots of pickups and dropouts being happening and the the rights that we have changed or the changes we've made or not out following parking rates, are the easiest thing to change like they're the quickest. All you have to do is change a sign and update a computer. So it's it's something that we could. Definitely you know modify if needed. Okay, thank you, patrick caroline. Anybody else. Yes, we have one more the trial, mosa board member. Yes, please literally hi. I want to know about the accessibility for people with disabilities. Like visual impairment, with the new changes. Did we think about that piece? I, yes, yes, we do I'm just going to go to a slide which yeah so so here we we keep all vertical elements on the roadway, clear, the crosswalk and and yeah all the installations. We're doing with with the paint at least are are flush with the roadway once the capital version comes in. There is a cut through through the crosswalk for for to preserve accessibility, we'll have tactile warning strips. They have not been installed yet at this location in in the in the paint, but that is something that goes in to to all of our protected bike, lane projects to keep people from black, the blind from walking into the street, so yeah that we are we're. Definitely thinking about accessibility as part of this project and what about I'm, not sure, but when, when you cross the street I know on, I believe it's court street by the durang read downtown brooklyn. They have the button to press, so you can know like. When can you cross the street? Would that be? Is that there already? Is that something that you can think about? Buttons is part of this proposal. I know that there are we we have. We also have the audio the audio pedestrian signals as well. I know that's a program we're rolling out. I can look into that program to see if there are any locations along this corridor where, where they will be making these installations, but nothing's been proposed as part of this project. It doesn't mean we're not doing it, though. Thank you, sid is back sid. Did you have another question? I don't think that we're able to hear sid sid your microphone is unmuted. You can go ahead and talk. We can't hear you sid [Applause]. Can you hear me? Yes, now? Okay, okay, I I'm fine with what's going on, I answered my question. We can move forward goodbye. Thank you all right. Thank you. So thank you, patrick. I think we'll move on to the next part of the bike. Lane presentation, excellent, thank you and kathy preston. Yes, great preston. Are you presenting ashland place? Maybe street navy street okay and are we skipping ashland place hi julia? This is emily. I spoke with rob early a couple of days ago. That said, we're not ready to move forward or present ashland. He just wanted to. Let me to let you know that, thank you and we'll be going into sins. Okay and emily. Could you introduce yourself to the committee yeah hi? My name is emily rickelman. I am the dot liaison for the community board here and just to let the other committee members know. Diana soriano is on long-term leave. Okay preston feel free to share your screen whenever you are ready. Oh yeah, let me get back to that and while he's doing that after a department of transportation is done with these bike, lane updates we would. We would welcome you and we would like you to stay for the subsequent discussion from the resident paul schreiber on the brooklyn bridge. Thank you, justin. If you could maximize your screen, please that'd be great perfect. Thank you! So much okay, my name is preston johnson. Thanks for letting me speak about navy street I'll, be the project manager, I'm with the new york city department of transportation, bicycle unit. Okay, the the project area that I'll be discussing today is only a block long. It extends from sand street to flushing avenue sand street had a separated path constructed in 2009, and that coincided with some of the large increases of bicycle volumes that we began to see going across the manhattan bridge and at flushing avenue. A a bicycle lane was installed in 2010 and currently a separated path is being completed. Navy street has had a bike lane since 2004, but despite these volumes this this one block will represent sort of a less protected bicycle infrastructure than what you're going to see for on sand street and flushing and on the brooklyn waterfront greenway going east to greenpoint. So as a result of the the access to the manhattan bridge, we're seeing really high bicycle volumes. Yet the standard bicycle lanes can be vulnerable to double parking. Sometimes drivers will actually drive in it to to overtake the congestion, as people are trying to turn left this, the northbound vehicles. Turning left on the sand street, and so there are a lot of conflicts here, that we hope that this project can try to resolve and make the streets safer for all street users. So as as I say, this is just a block, long project, but the number of crashes is pretty high and the it's well above average for brooklyn as a whole, and the number of cyclists that are that are severely injured. As a result of these traffic crashes is it's 60 of the total, and so you know it's just kind of more incentive to try to deal with some of these conflicts, and so, as I was alluding to kind of what we have right now so navy street. If you're going northbound. Most of you know, almost all of the people on bicycles and most of the people driving are turning left on the sand street, and so currently there are two legal ways that you can make that left turn if you're riding a bicycle and and arrive on a green light. One way would be to leave the bicycle lane and go into the lane of traffic and then make the turn sort of as a vehicle. Otherwise you could go. You could stay in the bicycle lane and and stop at the intersection and make kind of what we call a two-stage turn a two-stage left turn. You would wait until sand street got a green light and then you would proceed to cross. But what we're seeing because of all of this congestion, and sometimes like I was saying the bike lane might be blocked. Sometimes there might actually be people driving in the bike lane you're seeing cyclists actually go against traffic and ride on the left side of navy street, and it creates like a lot of unpredictability and just more risky behavior that we would like to provide a safer alternative for people on bicycles. So that said, the goals of this project are to upgrade this one block long part of the bike route to the manhattan bridge and also by organizing traffic. Creating some traffic calming we're, hoping that all street users will benefit including pedestrians and we're hoping to improve this comfort and safety for bikes, both by eliminating the double parking in the bike, lane and sort of increasing the the distance between people on a bike, and then people in a motor vehicle, whether it's a truck or a bus, and we're also trying to organize the traffic that can reduce that wrong way. Cycling and reduce the turning conflicts and we're trying to achieve all these goals while maintaining the motor vehicle circulation. This project has no changes in moving lanes or turn lanes, and, and so I will show you what we're proposing. So this is a section of navy streets, you're, looking north here, basically on the west side of the street street, we're mostly keeping things as it is. The parking lane stays there that southbound bike lane stays there, there's a moving lane in each direction and we will maintain the turn lanes at sand street and at flushing avenue and where the difference is, is on the on the right side of the street. The east side, where we are upgrading that standard bike lane in creating a two-way protected bike lane, alongside the curb and so that also necessitates removing parking and relocating a bus, stop okay. So so this is the the intersection at sand street and navy street, and so north is on the left side. So what you see is the protected bike lane, on the top on that east curb and- and you see, on the south side, there's continues to be the bike lane. So, if you're on a bike- and you are coming from the manhattan bridge or coming from sand street- that bike lane will still exist going southbound. If you continue to go to to continue on navy street to ashland place and maybe over to patrick's project on fourth avenue you're, not we're not asking people to like cross the street and then cross back again so, but if you instead are on a bike coming from sand street and intend to go to the brooklyn waterfront greenway on flushing avenue, what you do, your your sort of most convenient option will be to to cross over to the far side and use that protected lane and then be able to make that left turn really safely onto flushing avenue. So what you're? Seeing in this this plan is the where the bus stop at the southeast corner of navy and sand street is going to have to be relocated because the buses split there there'll be two different: two different locations for the new bus stops. The b62 will be on it'll, remain on navy street and be on the north side of the street. Currently, the sidewalk is in pretty poor condition there, and so we will rebuild the the sidewalk and the curb to make sure that that is an accessible bus. Stop and then the other bus stop will be on sand street and that'll have the b57 and the b69, and so, if you're familiar with the area, the those two locations were actually bus stops for this during the construction on the navy yard and they've just recently been kind of returned here, and then we're kind of we are now proposing to relocate them to where they're the temporary stops were previously. So you've already gotten a couple examples of these types of projects, but I just want to reiterate how we've done these types of projects all throughout the city. We see great benefits, 15 drops in in crashes with injuries and even pedestrian injuries, especially pedestrian injuries like 21, drops and so we're hoping by organizing the traffic that we can see those types of improvement on on navy street as well and just to wrap up. I think you know what we're trying to do is to upgrade this. This one block stretch so that it is of the same type of protection for people on bicycles, that they're going to experience on flushing avenue and what they already experience on sand street and I think, by providing people riding bikes a safer alternative. What you're going to see is like fewer people, kind of making that risky maneuver to ride against traffic. I think when they have a protected lane, they're gonna, you know, they're they're, not gonna. Try to weave through traffic is to the same degree what they're doing right now and- and I think that predictability will have benefits for pedestrians, people driving and, of course, the cyclists themselves, and so you know, I think, as I said before, we're trying to maintain traffic capacity. There's no change in the moving lanes. The turn lanes, so I think, we'll see a lot of safety benefits without without any drawbacks and I'll be happy to take any questions. Thank you preston. I wanted to ask why isn't why aren't the bike lanes raised like the greenway lanes on flushing avenue, with a landscape buffer instead of an at-grade buffer with the bollards, the flexible ballers? Well kind of going back for me: is it just budgetary, because it would be a lot nicer to have a continuation of the greenway between flinching avenue all the way around to the the sand street entrance to the bridge, okay, sort of as patrick was explaining in his presentation. We focus on kind of the in-house type of projects that can be sort of quickly implemented, and that's that's what we're showing you know here if a full like if we were to build a build, the greenway to match. What's on flushing, it would entail sort of a street reconstruction that would first of all take much longer, but it also kind of inten. You know kind of incorporate lots of other. You know drainage and all sorts of issues that we're not really forced to deal with right now. Okay, but it doesn't preclude a future style development. Okay, great then it's a great addition. Yeah caroline, can you tell me who have their who has their hands raised? I do have a question for sure. Sorry, oh we have her doreen too john. Can we get let doreen have the floor? Absolutely go for it thanks. Thank you. Well, I I drive this stretch very often, so I'm I'm like love all these proposals. I hope they work out. I'm in agreement with juliet I kind of like that extra added safety feature of like a raised that that bike lane on flushing avenue it's. You know it's so great to see people be safe, you know, and it just looks better. It just feels really like there's a separation, and this stretch I'm so every time I drive there, I it's just it's a nightmare. I'm always thinking that you know I'm watching. Cyclists are forced to have to weave in and out because of you know what the vehicles do. So you know I just really want to commend you for focusing on this one block, but I would in every single case I would just hope that you would go over it again and try to even make it even safer. It's a very dangerous little block here, and but it does a lot of things and a lot of people use it, which is great to see, but I'm always having a heart attack. So is there a way to implement what juliet had suggested about the way it was handled in flushing avenue, especially at the turn I feel like the intersections can be a little tweaked a little bit because, like when you're making the right, I I just always feel like someone's gonna run over a bicyclist, including me. I hope when I die, I have not run over anyone. So sorry I am careful driver, but so yeah. I guess that's. My question is yeah. Absolutely absolutely. I don't know right now like what the the time timetable is for you rebuilding the street there, but I mean it's, I mean I'm definitely a candidate. Have you talked to the brooklyn greenway initiatives, people about this proposal already I haven't personally, but if this is a long standing, they they were waiting to hear from dot about what is happening in this intersection. They have said that nobody has been keeping them in the loop, so please do reach out to them, specifically. Okay, thank you. Okay, hi john john you're, waiting speaking juliet. If I could build on your communication, this street is next to the farragut housing projects and the church of the open door, reverend mark taylor, any changes that are being proposed, specifically with the reduction of parking and the like. I would ask that you consider reaching out to reverend taylor and to the head of the farragut tenant association to give them an update on this. Can you say his name again, reverend mark church of the open door? Thank you and julie. There's someone jq is asking to speak, I'm not sure. If that's john! Yes, it is, it is how many parking spaces are going to be lost. 14. those parking spaces weren't used very often because it was a construction loan for construction zone. For the past three years. That's successful, yeah, they weren't yeah a real loss. I feel well the loss. I'm sorry can I raise my hand yeah. Let me let me finish. Okay, and and and this is sort of doubling going back on what brian howell said about you're building these lanes, but you're not dealing with the intersection you're you're you're, still forcing the bicyclists, the northbound bicyclists, who are going to turn onto sands you're, still forcing them into the intersection, with no real guidance before and because, once they get to the to the to the, there is no sand street on the right, but once they get into the what would be the continuation of sand street they're now out in the open and while the major traffic that's moving on sands turns on to navy makes a right onto navy. It doesn't make a left on to. I guess: that's northbound navy they're still in the intersection, so they're they're still susceptible. And how do you stop the traffic that the bicycle traffic that now makes that illegal switch to the wrong way of navy? How you're going to stop them from doing that? They're still going to be they're going to be imprinted with that's the best way to get to avoid the conflict and and still move into the wrong way on the navy. Well like, as I was saying, our experience is when you provide people a safer alternative, they usually take it. So, for instance, when we worked on prospect park west, we used to see something about like 30 of the people on bike. That's not anything that anyone wants to see, but as soon as we provided a safe and legal alternative to ride your bike, northbound or and southbound that really just evaporated, and you just don't really see that that kind of behavior much anymore, and so you know I mean I we can't you know there. There may still be people that make that movement, but I think by providing people a safe, legal way to to find another way across the street. I think you'll see many fewer people going against traffic and how long has the has there been parking allowed? It wasn't allowed for a period of time, but how long has parking been allowed on that stretch that you're now going to officially eliminate I'm not absolutely sure when it returned? Has it been I spent a year so last fall, so it's been less than a year, but have you do you know what the usage has been? Have you had any photography or or survey to see how, whether that tr, whether that parking's being used just informally, but no, we haven't done a formal. You know time lapse or anything like. What's the informal is it? Is it usually when we're out there observing- and you know I think in my experience- it wasn't a hundred percent, but you know it's pretty: it's pretty stated as brooklyn. What is it now? Is it alternate side or is it yes? Yes, okay, so it's otherwise other than the alternate side. It's available. How do you mean? Well I mean there's no other restriction. You know there was a bus, stop there, john, so that took up a a chunk of it too. Okay, I gotta repeat my point that the community that's directly affected has to be consulted with all of these changes. Emily. That's a general statement for community board 2 initiatives from dot not just reaching out to actually coming to the community board, but we'd like you to reach out to other members of the community that are affected by this as well. Okay, I'm gonna put my email in the chat. So if anybody has any questions or comments outside the transportation community committee meeting, they can reach out to me directly. That's very nice and open. Thank you very much. The trial, we're gonna, take one more question and then anybody else will have to put it in the chat, because we need to move on to the next topic. Okay, I'm going to be really quick. As far as the community, I have family members in fabricate housing, development and there's a like a parking as it is it's very hard for people to find parking in that area and as well as a church. Yes, you should reach out to pastor mark d.c taylor at the church of the open door and the tenant association president is mary andrews so and to let them know, what's going on, if you're planning to make any changes in the community out of respect and also to make sure that if you are putting more bike lanes as a visual impaired individual, I would respect for it to be accessibility for people with disabilities. So we could be able to see to cross the street, and so we, as far as you know, the people on the bike won't get hurt. As far as we won't get hurt in the process. I'm sorry can you repeat what you would like to see individually impaired, just more accessibility. So you know so people by us crossing the street. We won't be heard. You know like we could know, like maybe like I said before, on by the rain we on court street. They have a button that you can press when you cross the street. So just to be, you know more. Mindful are like people who have you know who use canes when they walk, so they can know like there's something there. So it's because right now, some of the bike lanes it's just like nothing's there, so it needs to be more a common, accommodable accommodation. Instead. Okay, I understand all right brian. Yes, you can raise the entire time, so please go quickly brain. So I think this is great. The one like missing link in this is that when pdc built out the flushing greenway me it's still somewhat in construction. There's a about 300 feet: east of navy, I'm flushing the greenway narrows from eight feet to four feet and there is no eastbound bike lane between navy and 300 feet, east of navy, and so this would be great to wrap around navy yard, except that gdc decided to put in a a turn lane for wegmans against the you know, the vote, the wishes of community board 2 for the last 10 years. So I I'm just curious how you expect people who are heading south on navy here to access the greenway going east brian I'm going to jump in that is not completed. Yet there was only a temporary all of that stuff on flushing avenue in front of movement is temporary because ddp's contractors are haven't gotten there. Yet I mean it's ripped up by ddc this summer and they're, putting in the two-way bike lane on the other side of flushing yeah. Okay, because they build new stuff and they put in a trend line. Okay, it was temporary yep. Thank you. Okay! All right! Thank you preston! Thank you. Does that conclude the department of transportation's presentations, yeah you've, asked me to stay on later, so anybody else from the bike unit you guys can well. I would like them to stay because paul schreiber has bike recommendations, so whoever is available to stay for the next one. I imagine it'll be 15 minutes. Okay, thank you, so paul I'll stay on hi, paul, you're muted. Could we would get paul immunity, but would you like me to go ahead? Yes, please all right, hi everyone! My name is paul schreiber. I live in borum hill here in cb2, and I'm here to talk about cyclist and pedestrian capacity on the manhattan and brooklyn bridges over the past decade. As new york city has added safe places for people to bike, such as protected lanes, we've seen a large increase in folks riding bicycles this year. As a result of the coveted pandemic, even more people have taken up bicycling as a way to get to work to home and to pick up essential goods like groceries and medication. We already had a pressing need for more capacity. The pandemic has exacerbated this need. The brooklyn and manhattan bridges are already over capacity and cannot accommodate any more riders or pedestrians. The dot has proposed a study to determine if the brooklyn bridge can hold additional weight. That study and any resulting work will take many years to complete. Converting existing traffic lanes to bike lanes is a much faster solution. I am asking community board 2 to formally request dot. Take two steps: one is to increase bike capacity on the bridges by converting existing car space and, secondly, to improve infrastructure for bikes. On both sides of both bridges by adding protected lanes onto approaches and separately, there's a problem with the overcrowding on the brooklyn bridge. There are too many vendors and there are police vehicles in the middle of this bridge and on the manhattan side, and I would ask that further cb2 asked dot and nypd to come up with a plan to remove these obstacles. Thank you. Thank you, paul. I do have to say that that last part of your recommendation or suggestion is outside of cb2's purview, because it's on the manhattan side of the bridge, but it sounds like he's requesting that cb2 asked department of transportation to study, increasing bike capacity on both bridges and then also having a protected route for the bicyclists on the brooklyn bridge. Correct and yes, and some of the obstructions are on the manhattan side, but some are on the brooklyn side as well. Okay, is there any discussion from committee members first place? Well, may I juliette's john quint? Please can you yes, yes, go ahead. I agree that there has to be some work on that, but I also have to say, as a user of the bridge every day, walking over the brooklyn bridge every day in the happy bridge. Occasionally one of the issues that we've raised before and it's I think it's even part of when we've on our statement of district needs- is that on the manhattan bridge, there are too many bicyclists on the pedestrian side. They are not there's no signage. There used to be signage, there's very little signage on either end of the north of the south side, south walkway. Now the pedestrian walkway of the manhattan bridge to keep bicyclists from going on there, especially with the the way they've changed. The entrance from the from j street that allows bikes to enter into what used to be what is still a sort of a pedestrian park. A small park at the far at the bottom of the pedestrian walkway bicyclists are going into that wall into that area and continuing on the south side of the brook of the manhattan bridge walkway and not going over to the north side, and there used to be when there was work going on. There were plastic jersey barriers that made it with signs on them. That made it clear that bikes were not supposed to be there, but now there's just one small sign for pedestrians and the absence of a sign indicating no bicycles have invited all the bicycles to use that, especially now that they're doing repairs to the fencing along the south side. South walkway has narrowed the width of the pedestrian path to one person wide, and the interactions between bicycles and pedestrians is severe and on the manhattan brooklyn bridge. I've noted recently that the scooters have been gone, which is a welcome sight, but I don't think that's going to be a permanent situation and there is- and there will soon be as the phases as we go into the higher number phases. I expect that the pedestrian traffic, and especially when tourists return, there's going to be a much greater use of the brooklyn bridge, not that there hasn't been a an overwhelming use of it before the pause. That makes it very difficult for four bikes and I don't think the bikes are being there's not enough enforcement to both pedestrians and bicyclists. So it's more than just the issue of of doing all the things that paul has suggested, and I agree with him even though with juliet that the vendors are not part of our purview, but I think when d.o.t takes a look at the entire use of the walkways, they have to deal with the vendors and they should know now that our view is that there has to be some supervision of the vendors and some control of the vendors john. Would you like to make a motion? Well? Can I sit mike? Can I say something? You know you know I the the dot study. I was told that the dot study of adding a more place for bicycles was complete and that I I actually made a foil request for a copy of the report that was denied it because it was an interagency report, but I was told that the initial review by the consultants was in fact complete about adding more to be able to add over the roadway, a additional space for people to either walk or bike emily. Yes, there was a study done for the pedestrian walkway on the brooklyn bridge. The feasibility was unfounded, so all I can tell you is in right now: d.o.t is in talks with the mayor's office and city hall for conducting a study about the feasibility of a bikeway on the main line of the brooklyn bridge, and- and you may hear about that in the coming weeks, when you say the main line, you mean a traffic lane. Yes great, so that's exactly what paul was asking for. So since this study is is already underway, I was I was going to being it's still being discussed. Would it be helpful if we made a motion to recommend that it be studied? If you made a recommendation, I would take that recommendation to to wear the appropriate union, but before I make the motion, let me just ask you again: emily: are you saying when you said because my audio broke up, that the study of changing the pedestrian walkway was unfeasible and therefore there's that the idea of expanding it just is is not, is not going to take place or not going to go any further? Yes, okay, so I would make a motion then, that we urge d.o.t in regard to the brooklyn bridge, pedestrian and bicycle usage, that the dlt study using current vehicular lanes for bike traffic so as to relieve the the overfl the volume of to allow for a greater volume of pedestrians on the present walkway, and that they also look into finding a way of limiting the use of the walkway by vendors on the manhattan side, so that the flow from brooklyn to manhattan or from manhattan to brooklyn would be unimpeded jurisdiction. Thank you sid. This is patrick. Just with a comment. I I I've long thought that the pedestrian bike, interaction on the brooklyn bridge is quite dangerous and then bikes and bikes simply have to go slower, so it would it is it possible- and maybe this was part of the proposal I missed it, but to actually eliminate bikes from the pedestrian walkway so that you'd or or or limit them to like five miles per hour or some some some really constrained, speed, yeah! No, you move it. You move it to the roadway. I guess the question then is is emily. If the is the stutt is the study of using traffic lanes for bikes with the intention of making that the exclusive way that bikes are gonna cross the bridge? I'm I can't speak on it yet there's no, there was. There has not been a study conducted. So I have the information to give you beyond that. Well, I I I I think it's important to include that. As as one of the options considered, I mean I, I think that the pedestrian bike, interaction on the on the walkway is a is, is basically a death or serious injury waiting to happen. I I I I made the motion, I'm going to write it up when it comes out of the minutes, and I would certainly say that that would be. My intention is to eliminate any interaction between pedestrians and bikes so that bikes have their own traffic lanes taken away you by using present vehicle lanes and that the present walkway be exclusively a walkway and not a bike. John, that's perfect. Please make sure to include the manhattan bridge as part of your resolution as well. Well, this is much easier, but I'm not sure are you I I don't. I don't know. I see too many bikes on the pedestrian side of the manhattan bridge, but is there any indication that there is an over since they've already got an exclusive supposed to use it only for bikes on the north side of the manhattan bridge? Is that so busy that more more volume is needs to be provided for yeah? That's pretty busy and it's getting busier and and then you would provide additional pedestrian capacity as well, because you could repurpose that old bike path as a second pedestrian path. I I really don't think my opinion is that the manhattan bridge is not conducive to this. It's I mean that's basically a highway, but I let's take it one at a time proposal first and then, if we want to do one for them, yeah I want to limit. I want to limit my motion to the brooklyn bridge I'll. If somebody else wants to make the motion on the manhattan bridge, because they really are separate, because I think that, even though there are five manhattan-bound traffic lanes on the brook on the manhattan bridge, it would not be hard to take one of those away. I don't you know the. I don't think the geometry at either end would be very good for that because of the the the separation between the the bike lane. The entrance to the bike lanes on both sides of the bridge have no interaction with any of the vehicular traffic. Okay and- and you know it's a completely different issue- wait wait hold on wait. We just I don't want to complicate this, but would it would it be at all possible to turn each bridge into a one-way bike? Lane I mean the flow is so tremendous, so so so manhattan into manhattan, bridge brooklyn back into brooklyn, you know, and that would increase the capacity of that of that bike lane on on the on the manhattan bridge. I think that would be part of their study, patrick we're just asking them to study using traffic lanes for bike lanes on the brooklyn bridge. Okay, why don't we have exposures, one about the brooklyn bridge and one about the manhattan bridge right. My motion was limited to the brooklyn bridge, okay and that's seconded by sid. So that's on the table right now and we're going to take the vote search. Do we need to do a roll call vote? I think brian yeah brian go ahead. I just wanted to speak to like what was said at the beginning. The reason there are so many conflicts on the bridge is because there's not enough space for people to walk and fight and the you know the vendor. Conflicts are really just because of that, because people walking biking are like forced into a path that gets as narrow as eight feet that every every sort of incursion to this path becomes problematic, and just to remember that, like these are symptoms of the problem, which is that not enough space now you know the other problem with the brooklyn bridge is that it has the cables that are exposed on the walkway and then and there are constantly narrowing and widening points. We need to get to a lot of other things. So I want to do the vote unless somebody has something to say about the actual voting. Yes or no I mean we have 10 minutes left juliet. Okay, do we have to do a role called? Will? Caroline? Yes, it's best. Okay, john! Can you read the attendance sheet? Take the role yeah and I guess I think, as ernie augustus joined, because I saw an earnest on the on the participant level is, did either sandy or ernie come on. I haven't seen them. Okay, there was an earned. There was a beginning of the word name ernest on the participant list. I don't that was but he's not speaking up. So you, okay, juliet I daryl hi me I john dew hi maureen maureen. Oh, that's so sad doreen. She left all right: brian hi, sid, hi, patrick hi. So that's two, four six, eight, eight! Yes and no extensions or notes. Now can I make the motion for the manhattan bridge? Yes, I'll, move that we have them study, taking one lane of the manhattan bridge to be a to be a bike lane on traffic vehicle lane, sid on a permanent basis or as a summer street or as a coronavirus mitigation tactic, a permanent basis. You only have two lanes coming in from manhattan to brooklyn. You have five lanes going from brooklyn to manhattan. They can take one lane. Is there a second, it's brian hall of seconds, any discussion? Okay, all in favor caroline? Can we amend it to say at least one lane so that there's room for more than that sure? Thank you. I accept it as a friendly amendment, all right john. Can you do the role again julius? Yes, cheryl abstains! I vote. Yes! Do john! Do yes? Yes! Yes! Ryan! Yes, did you say, patrick yes, okay, yes or or I I thought it was. I either way carolyn, yes at 701. Thank you, john okay. Thank you paul. Thank you. Everybody else. Okay, thanks paul, we're gonna and thank you emily. Thank you for staying well. Emily should stay for the next one too. Today we're gonna talk about adam street crossing, but the other dot by people. If anybody else is on, so you don't have to stay. Thank you approval of the minutes. I think this is the one where we don't vote on it, but if there are any comments, you just tell us that their comments. Okay, if there are any please let the district office know for the chairperson's report. Let's talk about the adam street crossing the presentation that was emailed yesterday to you guys and previously is john. Did you want to speak to that or is the president of concord village here? The president concord village is here. I just want to make a very quick comment. Then barry newmark will, I think, wants to speak, but I, like we've, we've. It's been our proposal, this board, this committee and the board's proposal to have a mid-block crossing, but the surprising part of the proposal that we didn't know anything about until it went to the pdc just before we got it just after we got it is it's hardly a mid block. It is close to, depending on what the block is. It's almost at the end of the block, the and- and my fear is where it's placed both in relationship to conflict village and in relationship to the brooklyn-bound traffic, is that it is so close to the end of the downward curve that that light will be ineffective in stopping the brooklyn-bound traffic and will create a risk of anybody crossing. That's my initial comment, but I think we should open barry, newmark who's, the president of the concord, village co-op board for because he's already solicited the views of the board, which speaks for the entirety of concord village. Thank you, john. Carry your mics open. Can everybody hear me yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, thank you very much for taking the time to have me respond to this and emily. Thank you for staying so that you can hear this before. You see it in writing and I'm speaking on behalf of concord village, which is a thousand twenty three unit cooperative housing, complex situated on adams, tillery and j streets in downtown brooklyn home to more than two thousand residents. We are deeply disappointed and concerned that dot in concert with the nyp nypd ct has been working on and developed a plan entitled the adam street improvement proposal without ever reaching out to concord village to discuss the reasons for such a plan and the details included therein. We have attended well we're attending the meeting tonight to voice some of our concerns. These include again a lack of outreach to concord village regarding this plan. No explanation about how such a plan will improve security measures currently in place, apparently no effort to try other means, such as better and more signage, directing people to the walkway entrance on adam's artillery streets, potential loss of some parking spots on adams street, adding to the 30 to 40 spots. We already lost as part of the brooklyn bridge walkway project potential, negative impact on the entrance exit. Driveway into concord, village situated just south of 175 adams street, the buildup of traffic heading north onto the brooklyn bridge and south exiting the bridge. This build up will increase the levels of noise and air pollution, concord village, already experiences related to the buildup of traffic along adams. Street additional traffic will undoubtedly pilot along tillery and j streets and likely on the brooklyn bridge as well. Non-Residents of concord village may enter a private property after crossing adams street. In an effort to walk from adams street to j street instead of using tillery or sand streets, I would include bicyclists as well driving through our private property. We request the meeting with dot and nypd ct to discuss all of the above in order to arrive at a mutually agreeable plan that addresses all parties concerns as much as possible. I want to thank you again, chairperson, for allowing me to raise our service and heartfelt concerns regarding the whole process and regarding not even receiving a plan worry not for john. I don't know about it. I have a fellow chairperson with us peter liuzzo, I'm not sure if he wants to add anything or not. Thank you. Thank you, mr newmark. Peter. Do you want to add anything he's muted? Could you unmute peter? Maybe you can unmute yourself? Okay, can you hear me hi? Thank you for giving me a minute to speak. I would reiterate everything that barry said and also I'd, be very interested to understand whether all the various potential conflicts with concord village have been considered in developing this plan, essentially implementing a crosswalk perpendicular to the front entrance of our building and our driveway combined with traffic lights seems to you know, present a multitude of challenges and potential conflicts and we'd like to I'd like to understand if these were studied and how they were considered and resolved. Thank you. Thank you peter, so emily I just I do want to say thank you to dot for addressing this concern that has been on our wish list for a very long time. So I imagine with ronavirus it's difficult to do the community outreach that we would like d.o.t to do, but it is important to us that dot does connect with the immediately affected neighborhood in the implementation of its improvements. So it would be great if you or somebody from dot could reach out with concord village. Virtually I'd be happy to reach out towards with concord village. I do want you guys to understand that this is a police department project who, which is now in at ddc's capital program and so they're, the ones design is set and it's ready for implementation, we're going to pdc soon, and so with all that in mind that the powerpoint I did send you that I sent earlier to rob that that he distributed to the community is for informational purposes, barry and peter. You may want to write a letter to pdc. If pdc is the agency, that's considering this right now. Well, if you emily, if you're saying for informational purposes, is that another way of saying it's a state accompli and don't ask I'm not saying don't ask of course you're. This is your community and you're? More than welcome to ask anything regarding it, but I do want to manage your expectations and let you know that the presentation that I sent to you was for informational purposes, from ddc, pd and dot to the board. My mouth is open in shock and awe that a process like this would take place, whether it's dot or nypd, without talking to more than 2 000 residents who live, who will be immediately affected by such a project and we will not stay silent with regard to such a such a abuse of taxpayer dollars. Okay, thank you very much for sharing and I think we'll have to follow up on this on a on whatever regulatory level we have available to us. We appreciate that deeply and thank you again, chairperson for your interest and and you're, allowing us to raise our concerns. I won't talk anymore. I promise thank you, mr newmark. Okay, thank you emily I we're gonna, I'm just gonna mention the open restaurant plan. That d.o.t is moving forward with. Oh, yes, caroline brian, brian, caroline and sid had something to say. Sorry: okay, go ahead, brian first, I did not. I just forgot to think okay, caroline yeah hand, lowered sid. I just said that, if that that they, you better get the city councilman involved. Now, if this is a deal, a good pd project is going to go forward unless someone gets to meet with them. Yeah, that's good advice. Okay, I'm just gonna finish up in cheers. Your part, I'm letting you know that it for the dot's open restaurant plan, they're allowing the use of sidewalks and parking spaces for outdoor dining without going through the cumbersome application and approval process that we are usually a part of. I personally support this for the the restaurants in the community to be able to open up and for economic development it is. It does mean that people that restaurants will have outdoor dining without coming through our committee, so I just want to let people know about that. I sent out a link to the district manager earlier today. So, if you're more than welcome to share that information to the committee, it's public and applications are open tomorrow. Great great, thank you. Are there any other questions for emily before we let her go? Okay, emily, thank you. We're gonna, move on to recent events and statement of district needs. You're welcome to stay, but it's already late. It's only 8 o'clock, so, okay, thank you! So much! Okay! Thank you very much bye. So I wanted to open up the discussion before we get into the statement of district needs with just taking a moment to speak about the black lives matter movement that has been happening as a as a matter of public safety, which is why it's relevant to this committee. I would like to open it up to my colleagues to be able to speak about recent events as well, and you know, although this this movement has been underway for several years, african americans and mostly men african-american men are still being disproportionately killed by police at the same rates as they were five years ago, and we keep hearing the same stories over and over again the same sad stories. So there is a lot of attention on this right now. There's a lot of urgency in the air there's there's. The protests have resulted in very positive legislative progress. For example, the repeal of 50 of section 50a at the state level that increases transparency with with with access to officer disciplinary records. So I think that that we're all moving in the right direction. The protests are helping to generate that broader awareness, and I think we we do need this, this cultural adjustment as a society to to address some of that that that deep-rooted racism and and in inequality in our in our in our systems in our society. So I I wanted to open up this discussion before we delve into the particulars of the district needs of of you know how many police officers we need on on myrtle avenue at you know flatbush avenue, so I'd like to open it up. First to my vice chair cheryl. If she wanted to say anything with regard to this yeah hi, it's you know it's everyone's right to protest for something that they feel passionate about. But what I'm concerned about is, let's remember, to protest in a peaceful manner and also, most importantly, in a safe manner. It must all wear the mask whenever we go out and especially if you're on a protest mask march near your mask, I am concerned about the health set. The health part of this and julia spoke about the other part. I'm talking about the the health part of it mask is important. You all want to go out there and protest hey too, but you've got to wear your mask and it's not easy to stay a six month when you're in the crowd, so protest and protest safely and peacefully thanks. Thank you, john did you want to share? Well, it's it's 804. We had a whole agenda juliet. This meeting is characteristic of why we are where we are today with the black lives movement. D.O.T made a presentation that covered the farragut housing and they did not consult with the folks of farragut housing. That's just another example. I can go back to when I started at this community board and give you a multitude of examples up until last year of how we conduct business automatically, not considering folks of color. I heard a lot of that tonight. We talked a lot about bikes. We talked a lot about bridges, we got to 8 o'clock and we decided to talk and give time to the black lives matter. Movement. That, in and of itself, is an indication of why this country and this world is in the condition that it is. We really have to open our eyes and see the level of disrespect and disconcern that is given to the community as a whole and the black lives movement is only happened largely because we have video cameras and an opportunity to share, so folks are now able to see what has been going on forever and we do this kinds of stuff juliet automatically. I will tell you when I first started on this community's board. My first example at the land use committee meeting was my application, which wasn't taken up followed by another lady. My application was approved automatically that's what was announced at the meeting at at the landmarks committee level. It was for canopies on clinton avenue the blue canopies when you drive by that's what got me to the community board. At my first meeting land use committee, an elderly lady comes in, she sits down. She had gotten a violation on a house that she had just inherited from her sister. The committee brow beat her why she did not know that she had something illegal on the house that she had just inherited from her dead sister. They just browbeated it. So I stayed I stayed at the end of the meeting I was told I had to leave so the committee could go into executive session. I called the board office. I said what's going on here, I had to leave what happened to my application. Oh and by the way this is what happened. I went to my first full board meeting and spoke out. This is over 20 some odd years ago. I've never told this story broke out at the end of the meeting. I got a visit from our council member asking me if I would join community board 2. I said to her. I will not be muzzled. I will absolutely not be muzzled and she said to me. That's why I want your own community board too. That person, who was my council member back then later became the public advocate and then is now the attorney general for new york state tis james I've had these issues at the community board throughout, but we never talk about it. So now I am going to start talking about it in all of these forums juliet. I will not go into it now, because it's after eight o'clock- and we were only supposed to be on this call until 8 o'clock. But again we took care of everything else and then we got to the black lives matter after 8 o'clock. That's how we actually automatically do these things. Can I make a suggestion because it's so common, it is just common to treat this community like that, it's automatic. Can I make a suggestion in response in response to that john excuse me, I was. I had a suggestion in response to that, because I I hear what you're saying can I do that I don't want to. I don't want to interrupt you, but so here's my here's, my suggestion that we have a meeting dedicated to policing issues and it could be organized around a review of the data on community complaints against police officers. Apparently that's all being released from you know from by the city, patrick, thank you so much. I think that's an exact, a fine suggestion. It is only a very small part of what I am talking about into a much larger picture. That's frankly, we have not addressed at this community board. I have 20 years worth of experiences that I could share that this community board has not supported the african american community within its own boundaries. You have not heard me say that before, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. We tend to not want to discuss these things because they're difficult for folk to digest. Well, I'm just I'm just I was just suggesting it as because I I agree. I understand we always end up going into the you know the board discussion at the end of the meeting and and essentially give short shrift to pretty important issues, important issues that are important to the community board members, and but if we had a dedicated meeting and then also working from facts like that, we could have you know a pretty constructive, focused and meaningful discussion. I think, and and okay I hear what you're saying it's. Not it's, not everything, but you know one step at a time right or one, it's it's at least it's at least addressing that one specific issue which obviously is front and center right now, john. I I I hear exactly what you're saying about this, taking this being at the end of the meeting, I I understand that that is that that feels like it was short shift. I did not intend it to feel that way and I may have been too polite in allowing our presenters to go on and on and could have cut off, particularly one of them a little bit earlier, but I also want to listen to the voices in the community and the voices wanted to talk about it. We'll we'll have to set up another meeting like you're, suggesting to more to focus more on these issues and not be sidetracked. With other issues so would appreciate whoa. I will caution everyone that I was removed, as said a transportation committee. For exactly that reason, I will discuss that at a later date, but the doors are open now and, as I said, petition I'm going to speak my mind. I have been biting my tongue for a long period of time at this community board. There are issues that will be brought to the table. You guarantee that, thank you, john. Would anybody else like to talk? Would it so? I just want to put that on the table. The idea of the review of the local data- and I say that by the way with with with a belief that we have we're fortunate to have a pretty I've, had very good experiences myself. Of course, I'm not black, but I very very good experiences with the ncos and the 84th as whole, so, but it would be. I think I think it would be time, not black, so we're not interested in that. Frankly, john I'm talking now john I'm talking now. Okay, john all right anyway, that's that's my specific, that's my specific proposal to look at that data: local local data. Thank you, patrick caroline yeah. I I agree with everything mr du said. I also think it's a good idea for us to have a meeting just about black lives matter and what that means for protests in the transportation spaces in the area and what it can mean for defunding the police or encouraging the police not to be in certain aspects of our public safety in cb2 and new york city. I think that we need to find a way to make space for these conversations in all of our meetings. Not just the one that we will set aside in the days to come because, like, as we heard three different times this evening, police cars are blocking safety for other people, driving safety for pedestrians and safety for people on bikes, and that's you know not the least of it at all like that is the least of it and so yeah. I I just want to throw my support in favor of discussing this more being intentional about it. Thank you. Thank you. Caroline brian, did you raise your hand yeah? I wanted to echo everything that aaron just said speak in support of what what john said. I personally spent a lot of the last two weeks watching I guess three weeks watching the events unfold in our in and around our districts. I been several protests, but I I want to call attention to the fact that a lot of the acts of police brutality that occurred at the start of the protest occurred in and around new districts too. We had an assembly, woman and state senator pepper, sprayed in our district for peacefully protesting, and I I also I agree for the need to have a discussion that is that's centers around these topics because and I'm very much guilty of this myself focusing conversation on transportation. It's just. I don't know what conversation that we can have now, I'm not really sure what this time limit is, but there's a city-wide conversation going on about the role of the police and the amount of money that goes to this department and we're about to talk about district needs and that's a very relevant time to be having this discussion carol ann. When do we have to give our comments on the statement of district needs, preferably by september, because it needs to be ready to go to planning city planning by late october. I think it's actually halloween day, so the board needs to be able to vote on it in october at the latest. So this is our last committee meeting before the summer recess, when only the executive committee will be authorized to act on behalf of the board right yes, so this is our time to give comments on the statement of district needs. Yes, I would like to be able to at least review the public safety components of that. If I could share my screen caroline does anybody else have their hand raised? No, not as we can see okay, so I would like to get into that. If we have some time left, caroline we're not going to be cut off on the webex meeting, we'll extend it. I don't know what that means. Extend the time. Oh excited keep talking, I'm sorry, but just because I think it's relevant to what we're about to do. Is there any way for us to? If, if or remember, our committee members are admitting to doing this again next month, have a public meeting since we must conduct our meetings in public and given that you know, because of abandoning our meetings are taking place on the internet anyway, would it be possible? I don't know what requirement what permission we need or whether everyone's available to it, but if so have a meeting in july, where we can discuss these issues more fully. I think we have available to see what he thinks about that chair, singletary and potentially he may want to take it up in executive committee, as opposed to in this committee juliette. Yes, in all openness, one at least one other committee that I'm aware of is going to ask that question if they can host the meeting during the summer, for the same reason, to review the statement. Okay, well different reason- I mean this statement I think is- is part of it. It's it's the it's also to be able to engage with the discussion about the black lives matter. Movement. More broadly, so I don't want to spend too much time on the statement of district needs, but I do want to briefly review it, and then I would ask if we are not able to have a meeting over the summer, then I would ask that board. Members send me comments by email and the district office comments to be consolidated. I would just like to share my screen. Yes, so one of the things that I've done in the past with the hess committee is that we created a google doc that allowed members to make inputs prior to the meeting. So at the meeting some time is saved and people have thought about things that that can now be discussed publicly. Okay, so you're, suggesting that we do it offline and we collect the comments and then we consolidate those and then try to have a form to talk about it yeah, because then it maintains the public aspect and that that makes more sense. How do the committee members feel about that? Fine with me fine with me, because it gives us a chance to read it and not have to react off the off the cuff without giving it some thought? Okay, so caroline, would you be able to set up that google doc sure juliet and everyone we have to have a meeting on the black lives matter issue over the summer? We can't, obviously we can't wait till september on that. So I mean maybe the board as a whole is going to do this. I don't know I guess that might be lenny's call, but yeah it's going to be lenny's call okay, but but obviously you can't wait till september to do that to have that meeting. It's that that would be not timely, and I would imagine that that discussion might influence might produce some important language for the district needs statements among other, among other outputs. I would think so, and I don't have to be the only person giving lenny a call. So whoever feels strongly that we should be having this meeting please reach out to him as well. So I'm going to postpone, then the discussion of the statement of district needs and follow the procedure that carol anne suggested, and I will I will stop sharing these and then go back to the screen. Okay, you can take my sharing off who up there. Okay, so that concludes my chairs report. Is there any other business to come before this community board meeting and in the community forum? Is there? Are there any other community members that would like to say anything? Okay, then, I think at 8 23 we're going to adjourn the meeting I want to. Thank you thank everybody for participating and thank you for bringing up what you know could be. You know it's. It's not easy to have this kind of conversation, but we need to have a conversation, so I want to thank everybody for being on the call being respectful and continuing to have the conversation. So I look forward to meeting with you guys again, hopefully in in another month, so thank you very much good night good night, john, hey.
