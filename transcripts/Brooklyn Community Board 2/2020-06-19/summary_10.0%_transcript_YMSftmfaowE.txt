If you wish to speak, please use the webex feature on the participants panel to digitally, raise and lower a hand, and I will call on you in order if you have questions that fall outside of the public comment time.
I can do it for you, julia okay, thank you, caroline okay, so, while caroline is pulling that up, I would like to just ask we're going to go through the approval of the agenda and, typically what we do for public comment is we have the committee members comment?
We have changes proposed to create more space for pedestrians and cyclists on the brooklyn bridge promenade on the next page, and that is being presented by paul schreiber, who is a resident of community district 2, and I understand also on transportation alternatives.
There is a an adam street crossing by the brooklyn bridge that I had emailed to board members committee members last night and had previously been sent by the district office.
So what we're looking to do is making some minor modifications to the design primarily around the metro, tech bus, stop which I'll go into a little bit later, as you know, with the colleges expanding in that along that particular corridor, as well as just the businesses at the time pre pandemic.
This whole corridor was very was bustling and a lot of cyclists were coming to downtown, but there was not enough bike parking so as part of this project we're also looking to install bike corrals, we have the partnership with downtown brooklyn partnership, who have been a great partnership with you know, plantings.
So what we're looking to do is to actually make a connection using johnson street for the one block between j street and adam the atom street bike path, to be able to allow for easier and safer movement to cyclists, who are looking to go to the brooklyn bridge?
So again, there's going to be really no changes just by way of explaining the corridor of smith street very much like portions of j street there's a lot of bus stops so we're unable, at this present time to do anything on those particular blocks.
But after evaluating it a bit further, we definitely saw abuse of the slip lane, which is the lane just to the right of that crosswalk, and you know people parking in it, standing in the in the in the bike lane or even in the in the slip lane.
So what we're proposing is really just to eliminate that slip lane entirely build out in paint the pedestrian crossing on the east of the street to be able to shorten the crossing and then to be able to change the design slightly for the buses coming into the the metro.
You know it's funny that it's only a block long, but you know if we just want to do it right so stay tuned, but I think once we make that connection, it's going to be a great connection to divert a lot of brooklyn bridge, bound cyclists.
So, finally, you know we plan to implement this project or all these projects during the summer of 2020, so with mystery, they'll get the the protected bike lanes where we can j street.
I mean you know that right now, I think the cycle because they get you know they are in their protected bike lane and then really have no traffic, except for any buses that are pulling in.
We usually just use the green ball, the typical traffic light, and so that's what we'd like to sort of use, but I can certainly bring it back to see you know what people are thinking, but if we do it at that particular location, then it opens up pretty much doing it almost at every location.
Yes, thanks hayes, I'm wondering about the protected lane on james smith, where you turn left onto skimmerhorn, because you can't continue going further.
The protected bike lane essentially disappears into a right-hand turn button for vehicles going south on jay trying to turn west onto artillery, and this creates a conflict between people who are trying to.
You know bike newton south on j street to and from manhattan bridge with drivers who are trying to turn onto tillery- and I know we don't have any examples in new york city, but they you know, are plenty around the world.
One of the problems with protected bike lanes in new york city is that they disappear exactly when people biking need them most, which is intersections, and I just think it's really sufficient to have protected by lane disappear into the turn line at a at the busiest crossing of the entire protective icon.
I've I mean our offices are right by metro tech, so I see this street like every day before the camp, the pandemic and a lot of the lanes are blocked by law enforcement.
At that specific stretch, the present time we recognize the issue and we've been addressing it and right now we don't have the best solution, but we are going to continue to work on making sure that the placard parking at particular locations is mitigated and stopped.
My name is patrick kennedy, I'm a project manager with the bicycle program, and I am here to present to you our continuation of our extension of the fourth avenue protected bike lane.
This project, should be semi a review and then I'll be talking about how we're going to make that work, to sort of the issues that we will try to be addressing during the proposal and I'm going to wrap it all up in a nice neat summary, okay, so first so vision zero as hopefully, this is a review for a lot of you here at the community board, but it's our interagency plan to treat craft traffic crashes as preventable and try to solve that with through design.
We're hoping to finish the rest of that up this year, but this leaves one one part of the corridor left that has not been started and that's from atlantic avenue down to first street, part of which is in cb2 so for the proposal.
Our proposal is to much like the rest of fourth avenue to install protective bike lanes along both curves, so we'd have two northbound travelings and two southbound travel lanes parking offset from the curb and then a protected bike lane along both sides.
Basically, the intersection is daylight on both the north and the south sides with the pedestrian area, and then it forces the vehicles to slow when they're when they're turning and it allows for lots of visibility for both pedestrians, who are crossing the street and for cyclists.
So, in that case, sort of the lower right-hand side of the screen of the screen, you'll be putting in a painted curb extension along the east, curb pushing out the curb to provide more curb space for pedestrians who are walking and then having a curbside bike lane next to bath northbound cyclists when they approach atlantic would cross at the same time as pedestrians.
Fourth avenue southbound goes so it's three different phases, so we would have the northbound cyclists be, would be crossing at the same time as pedestrians who currently go during the southbound, have a new vehicle face.
It is a very, very light movement, so we wouldn't really be affecting much of the movements that are already going on there and then also further north on sort of at the top of this graphic, where there is a big white, a little two-way white arrow we'd be creating a cyclist connection to ashland place and the manhattan bridge.
You know the capital project there to try to figure out the best way to do this, because what we don't want to do is try to do something like make modifications to the curve and then have it torn out right afterwards.
That's about to start here for the southbound direction, for cyclists coming south coming through the the times plaza area once again, we'll be taking out that that third traveling for vehicles, so there'll be room for cyclists along the west, curb and then crossing atlantic, then back down onto fourth avenue at the south of atlantic.
We would need to remove parking on that's on that block there, so between atlantic and pacific, to allow for to basically have room for the southbound bike lane to be there.
So we're doing is we're taking the pedestrian space, that's in the middle and consolidating it to the to the east side of the street, so that we're able to allow for the buses to make their movements and to also be able to get in the protected bike lane in both directions on this block so going on to making it work for the parking impacts, we're looking at about five spaces per block to accommodate the refuge, the pedestrian refuge islands, it's about 18 spaces in cb2, about 59 and cb6.
Our goal is to install consistent loading zones and meter parking where needed, and then the traffic analysis that we conducted here initially I'm going from three lanes down to two you'd.
Phasing on fourth avenue: we're able to extend green time for for certain blocks leading up to atlantic, which allows the same amount of vehicles that were passing in three lanes so now passing only two, so we're able to basically meet the current demand of the vehicles that are there to allow for us to make all the other improvements for pedestrians and cyclists on this corridor.
Instead of the alternate side, so yeah starting down at first we're also and then going all the way up, it's sort of clustered around down by union street and also then again around bergen and st marks.
So in summary, yeah the cross section again going from the three northbound travel lanes down to two installing protected bike lanes on both sides of the street and with the offset parking using the pedestrian refuges at intersections.
Here's another way to look at it, the so the top down view so yeah protected bike lanes head refugees, maintaining all the capacity for the existing volumes meter parking, some parking loss about 18 spots in cb2 and then continuing to coordinate with the capital, build out of 4th avenue, there's a several different capital projects that are that are happening all concurrently on fourth avenue so working with those, according with our partner agencies, to make sure that we're able to make a connection through times plaza.
Well, the you mean the right turn lane that is on fourth avenue between flatbush and atlantic.
Oh okay, we're it's one once you're on that little that short block there, people making the turn from southbound forth to to atlantic avenue to westbound atlantic.
I'm describing that's a very light movement, not that not many people actually make that right hand turn there, mostly because they're deterred by the amount of people who just want to head south on fourth avenue: how would they access flap atlantic avenue?
Okay, I'm gonna ask I don't I don't know who has their hands raised, I'm going to ask brian.
Because with the addition of the bike lanes on both sides, we, like we have to deal with the bus turn from resident east atlantic to southbound 4th so we're we have.
Okay, just to be clear, the bus is turning from atlantic onto fourth would now because of the southbound bike lanes sweep into the area that's currently occupied by the pedestrian island.
Yes, yeah, okay, we'd be pushing all of the northbound lanes a little bit further to the west, so it just narrows the space in the middle of the street when we add in the bike lanes on the first.
Caroline all right, I didn't know I had my hand raised, but I do like the protective bike lights here and I'm glad that they're being extended sooner than we thought.
How much work will go into changing signals for pedestrians and for people trying to cross the street as a car or as a person or a boss, so there's actually minimal.
The only new hardware we need to add in this location is actually at times plaza and that's for northbound cyclists so that they have they know when to go cool.
Okay, that's interesting thanks, yeah, the the way, the way the traffic works or the way that we're able to make this work for for vehicular capacity is actually to change the intersections leading up to atlantic and and forth.
So we wanted to try to like if we hadn't included that information we'd still be talking about it now, but we can definitely provide it to you, especially the results of the time lapse.
What's going on, I have a question regarding the blocks where you're looks like partnering with you consider implementing loading zones on those boxes and admitting some of the double parking problems.
In california, there are herbs that are created for, like passenger loading, not just metal loading, and I don't know if that's something that's done in other places in europe, but that might be something you could do here to give people like reserve one spot for passing and pick up a job yeah like once again if we like, if we find that there are areas where there's lots of pickups and dropouts being happening and the rights that we have changed or the changes we've made or not out following parking rates, are the easiest thing to change like they're the quickest.
I want to know about the accessibility for people with disabilities, like visual impairment with the new changes.
Definitely thinking about accessibility as part of this project and what about I'm, not sure, but when you cross the street I know on, I believe it's court street by the durang read downtown brooklyn.
Thanks for letting me speak about navy street I'll, be the project manager, I'm with the new york city department of transportation, bicycle unit.
Going across the manhattan bridge and at flushing avenue, a a bicycle lane was installed in 2010 and currently a separated path is being completed.
Navy street has had a bike lane since 2004, but despite these volumes this this one block will represent sort of a less protected bicycle infrastructure than what you're going to see for on sand street and flushing and on the brooklyn waterfront greenway going east to greenpoint.
As a result of these traffic crashes is it's 60 of the total, and so you know it's just kind of more incentive to try to deal with some of these conflicts, and so, as I was alluding to kind of what we have right now so navy street, if you're going northbound.
Sometimes there might actually be people driving in the bike lane you're seeing cyclists actually go against traffic and ride on the left side of navy street, and it creates like a lot of unpredictability and just more risky behavior that we would like to provide a safer alternative for people on bicycles.
Creating some traffic calming we're, hoping that all street users will benefit including pedestrians and we're hoping to improve this comfort and safety for bikes, both by eliminating the double parking in the bike, lane and sort of increasing the distance between people on a bike, and then people in a motor vehicle, whether it's a truck or a bus, and we're also trying to organize the traffic that can reduce that wrong way.
The parking lane stays there that southbound bike lane stays there, there's a moving lane in each direction and we will maintain the turn lanes at sand street and at flushing avenue and where the difference is on the on the right side of the street.
So, if you're on a bike- and you are coming from the manhattan bridge or coming from sand street- that bike lane will still exist going southbound.
If you continue to go to to continue on navy street to ashland place and maybe over to patrick's project on fourth avenue you're, not we're not asking people to like cross the street and then cross back again so, but if you instead are on a bike coming from sand street and intend to go to the brooklyn waterfront greenway on flushing avenue, what you do, your sort of most convenient option will be to cross over to the far side and use that protected lane and then be able to make that left turn really safely onto flushing avenue.
I think you know what we're trying to do is to upgrade this one block stretch so that it is of the same type of protection for people on bicycles, that they're going to experience on flushing avenue and what they already experience on sand street and I think, by providing people riding bikes a safer alternative.
Try to weave through traffic is to the same degree what they're doing right now and- and I think that predictability will have benefits for pedestrians, people driving and, of course, the cyclists themselves, and so you know, I think, as I said before, we're trying to maintain traffic capacity.
I wanted to ask why isn't why aren't the bike lanes raised like the greenway lanes on flushing avenue, with a landscape buffer?
Instead of an at-grade buffer with the bollards, the flexible, ballers well kind of going back for me, is it just budgetary because it would be a lot nicer to have a continuation of the greenway between flinching avenue all the way around to the the sand street entrance to the bridge, okay, sort of as patrick was explaining in his presentation.
So is there a way to implement what juliet had suggested about the way it was handled in flushing avenue, especially at the turn I feel like the intersections can be a little tweaked a little bit because, like when you're making the right, I just always feel like someone's gonna run over a bicyclist, including me.
Absolutely I don't know right now like what the time timetable is for you rebuilding the street there, but I mean it's, I mean I'm definitely a candidate.
Have you talked to the brooklyn greenway initiatives, people about this proposal already I haven't personally, but if this is a long standing, they were waiting to hear from dot about what is happening in this intersection.
If I could build on your communication, this street is next to the farragut housing projects and the church of the open door, reverend mark taylor, any changes that are being proposed, specifically with the reduction of parking and the like.
Okay- and this is sort of doubling going back on what brian howell said about you're building these lanes, but you're not dealing with the intersection you're still forcing the bicyclists, the northbound bicyclists, who are going to turn onto sands you're, still forcing them into the intersection, with no real guidance before and because, once they get to the to the to the, there is no sand street on the right, but once they get into the what would be the continuation of sand street they're now out in the open and while the major traffic that's moving on sands turns on to navy makes a right onto navy.
That's not anything that anyone wants to see, but as soon as we provided a safe and legal alternative to ride your bike, northbound or and southbound that really just evaporated, and you just don't really see that kind of behavior much anymore, and so you know I mean I we can't you know there may still be people that make that movement, but I think by providing people a safe, legal way to find another way across the street.
I think you'll see many fewer people going against traffic and how long has the has there been parking allowed?
What's going on, if you're planning to make any changes in the community out of respect and also to make sure that if you are putting more bike lanes as a visual impaired individual, I would respect for it to be accessibility for people with disabilities, so we could be able to see to cross the street, and so we, as far as you know, the people on the bike won't get hurt.
So it's because right now, some of the bike lanes it's just like nothing's there.
Yet I mean it's ripped up by ddc this summer and they're, putting in the two-way bike lane on the other side of flushing yeah: okay, because they build new stuff and they put in a trend line.
I live in borum hill here in cb2, and I'm here to talk about cyclist and pedestrian capacity on the manhattan and brooklyn bridges over the past decade, as new york city has added safe places for people to bike, such as protected lanes, we've seen a large increase in folks riding bicycles.
I do have to say that last part of your recommendation or suggestion is outside of cb2's purview, because it's on the manhattan side of the bridge, but it sounds like he's requesting that cb2 asked department of transportation to study, increasing bike capacity on both bridges and then also having a protected route for the bicyclists on the brooklyn bridge.
Occasionally, one of the issues that we've raised before and it's I think it's even part of when we've on our statement of district needs- is that on the manhattan bridge there are too many bicyclists on the pedestrian side.
Now the pedestrian walkway of the manhattan bridge to keep bicyclists from going on there, especially with the way they've changed the entrance from the from j street that allows bikes to enter into what used to be what is still a sort of a pedestrian park.
The feasibility was unfounded, so all I can tell you is in right now: d.o.t is in talks with the mayor's office and city hall for conducting a study about the feasibility of a bikeway on the main line of the brooklyn bridge, and you may hear about that in the coming weeks, when you say the main line, you mean a traffic lane, yes great, so that's exactly what paul was asking for.
Yes, okay, so I would make a motion then, that we urge d.o.t in regard to the brooklyn bridge, pedestrian and bicycle usage, that the dlt study using current vehicular lanes for bike traffic so as to relieve the overfl the volume of to allow for a greater volume of pedestrians on the present walkway, and that they also look into finding a way of limiting the use of the walkway by vendors on the manhattan side, so that the flow from brooklyn to manhattan or from manhattan to brooklyn would be unimpeded jurisdiction.
I think that would be part of their study, patrick we're just asking them to study using traffic lanes for bike lanes on the brooklyn bridge.
Let's talk about the adam street crossing the presentation that was emailed yesterday to you guys and previously is john: did you want to speak to that or is the president of concord village here?
Then barry newmark will, I think, wants to speak, but I, like we've, it's been our proposal, this board, this committee and the board's proposal to have a mid-block crossing, but the surprising part of the proposal that we didn't know anything about until it went to the pdc just before we got it just after we got it is it's hardly a mid block?
Is your community and you're more than welcome to ask anything regarding it, but I do want to manage your expectations and let you know that the presentation that I sent to you was for informational purposes, from ddc, pd and dot to the board.
So I wanted to open up the discussion before we get into the statement of district needs with just taking a moment to speak about the black lives matter movement that has been happening as a as a matter of public safety, which is why it's relevant to this committee.
I think that we need to find a way to make space for these conversations in all of our meetings, not just the one that we will set aside in the days to come because, like, as we heard three different times this evening, police cars are blocking safety for other people, driving safety for pedestrians and safety for people on bikes, and- that's you know not the least of it at all like that is the least of it and so yeah.
So this is our last committee meeting before the summer recess, when only the executive committee will be authorized to act on behalf of the board right yes, so this is our time to give comments on the statement of district needs.
Yes, in all openness, one at least one other committee that I'm aware of is going to ask that question if they can host the meeting during the summer, for the same reason, to review the statement.
I don't know I guess that might be lenny's call, but yeah it's going to be lenny's call okay, but obviously you can't wait till september to do that to have that meeting.
Okay, then I think at 8 23 we're going to adjourn the meeting I want to.
