Technology to be used in place of a meeting, so you all experiencing history, Thank, You, Brendan, Smith good evening, everyone, your guilt, yeah, Irene, Jenner, here glad you made it Andrew.
Yet I gave you some comments to rob and Jessica and they were gonna incorporate, okay, great Thank, You Juliet, anyone else with any edits hearing none on the minutes from the meeting of everywhere 20 cliff has been accepted.
We have some representatives here, I think Rob correct me: do we do we have a sense that all these individuals who were listed under number five, all on the call I saw Emily on the call I you know Maron on McHale, okay, give David McCarty on the call and Jessica Christine from MDOT okay.
Mr. Singletary, the an earlier version of the presentation was emailed to the Transportation Committee when we did not know that we are going to be meeting of by teleconference tonight right, but I believe that Emily and their designer to design proposal.
There are several people on the agenda for the presentation today, because this is really a collective proposal between alloy development, the OT, the downtown Brooklyn partnership and in collaboration with Tyler Ken, who is the designer I think most of you know where temple square is, but for those who don't it is a small public space to eat.
If you can see my cursor technically this area of land, it's at the corner of Flatbush Avenue, the third Avenue and skimmer Orange Street, and it's been identified for a long time as a underutilized public space.
Well, can you guys hear me yep great so I mean Ameri a program manager for the deity's temporary art program and through the program we partner with community-based organizations and artists to realize temporary artwork on our property, which includes sidewalks, plazas, median bridges, etc.
So that's it for me for now great the other city program that is instrumental in making this proposal happen is through the Department of Cultural Affairs, and it's a program done in partnership with art, bridge called City canvass, and it is essentially taking scaffolding and other typical d-o-t construction, fencing that would normally be the hunter green spec, that's required by DOB and creating public artwork for it.
Believe Greg is on the line I'm an assistant in a second, and he can talk you through his proposals, but maybe before we do I know Ryan and Brennan grew where he one from downtown partnership might not be, but I think Ryan has presented to your can is certainly present at the Transportation Committee off tonight's and you've met em.
An engagement with creating large-scale public works that really aim to bring in a broader community than is usually typical and working with local craftsmen and a lot of community members are has sort of created a feedback loop with our work, where we've sort of developed a kind of style with our firms work both in the large scale, like interventions that we've done that are more temporary and more, let's say our art works, and if David you go to.
That was going to be almost you know a full city block length along Flatbush Avenue and then also the Temple Square open, plaza on Lafayette, and we really wanted to find a language that worked for both of these things and actually connected them as kind of one larger piece, while still maintaining that kind of lightness and playfulness and accessibility sort of creating a big piece of public art that can be enjoyed by everyone.
So the approach to designing the streets ed was really to work within the confines of typical New York scaffolding and just kind of elevated, nothing too, fancy, but adding just a very limited palette of colors, which would kind of create a large-scale art installation that could be appreciated from different speeds of experience, because you have a lot of traffic along Flatbush and a lot of pedestrian traffic as well.
But really you treat the street shit almost like a backdrop and connected with the plaza in order to create a real sense of space, because as David mentioned right now, the plaza itself is quite small and doesn't really lend itself to any impromptu activity that one usually finds in a public park.
But the idea to kind of knit the background of the street shed with the with a with a design that kind of turns down onto the plaza paving, creates a real sense of space, even though the plaza is still completely open and then just going forward.
This is designed sort of for everybody and that, just by seeing those kind of typical public tables and chairs, people will know that it's okay to sit there, it's okay to kind of enjoy this space, and hopefully that starts to develop kind of a user base.
This slide that you see on your screen was the timeline before the coded crisis really began, and that timeline was for us to officially apply for the street seats application process present to you, the community board and then really start implementation this spring, so that it could be open for the nice weather.
I would like to know what time at night the furniture is going to be taken in and if it's very late, if there's going to be any security, maybe as part of the construction project that might also walk by the plaza at nighttime and then also just thinking about coronavirus, whether there's going to be any waking down of the seats on a daily basis before the furniture is put away.
Ryan is probably going to be most helpful as it relates to this tree furniture, but the street furniture will be purchased by Ali. It will be standard, d-o-t, bistro, chairs and tables that you see at other public spaces in downtown Brooklyn.
Belinda, do you know when second down yeah it'll, just it'll be in line with the other clauses, which is according to the DOE fund schedule, which is generally around 7 p.m. and as to the Sanitation questions?
The intention is that we have part of why we liked Greg's design approach is that it is very easy to maintain versus a more elaborate mural, and so the intention is that whatever and I think it's six or seven discrete colors, that, instead of as you, would typically have the jobsite, you have a big bucket of hunter green paint that you would use to cover up graffiti.
We also think that you know it's helpful, but you can see actually here in this rendering the Katy Mertz mural that we had on the two buildings for several years and it was very well received in the community.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could, you know, modify it so I think that's another thing that we like about the proposal in terms of street trees.
You can actually see it in this rendering it's the one that covers up most of the brick building of 360 to skin oil industry, and we have put in a request to Department of Parks to let them know that it is dead and there is a long waiting list.
Okay, great thanks, any other questions from committee members.
Eda I, think this project is lovely and when you got up close the colors much more inviting if the underlying do that there has been outreach to us saying gave this proposal to the Community Advisory Group.
There are too many planters in this area in general, making it very difficult humor and we address issue of hundreds of new pedestrians being introduced to the area and planters and an art, installation and city bikes already being there that's job, if you wouldn't mind giving him my contact information, we've tried to reach out to the church in the past and haven't been able to connect, so I'd be happy to reach out to them and give this same presentation.
Thank you any other questions from committee members great.
So with that and hearing no more questions, because I've asked several times, you're gonna move in I'll entertain a motion to accept to accept the committee's who actually because scepter right accept the recommendation or the Temple Square design so moved mr.
You get conflicting responses, but I think when I saw this, when I saw this presentation, I thought that was the best thing, because I hate to see that ugly green spread through that interest, such a big piece of you know, I saw a wall green and by time they finished sticking up all these different posters.
You know what happens in the construction site, it'll be ugly, so what they propose is beautiful if they can maintain it and State Street.
Well, the community as a whole, but we respect your position and thank her for her work on the Advisory Committee.
Yes, are you with us, you Thank You Quran, so the next item on the agenda item six man walks and Preservation Commission certificate of appropriateness, application, I really need Carlton or Irene to you know if you this is this is where I need you to step up this chair.
Okay, so I guess we'll start with the Brooklyn Bridge one Brooklyn Bridge, Park I, don't have the agenda in front of me, but I know it's a redo of someone to work around the tower and some of the work of some brickwork along and opening up some area and a grassy area.
Thank you very much and before I actually start my present on the plaza project.
I actually want to thank the community board or helping get some of our messaging out over the last six seven weeks.
Obviously we are living in very interesting times and there are changes to the park in terms of what is currently open and what protocols we are asking people to comply with in terms of social distancing from areas of the park that are closed or social, distancing, practical and the community board has been really fantastic and helping to push out some of that messaging.
Well, having said that, the Brooklyn Bridge Plaza project is being presented to the executive committee tonight, it's actually being put into the community board now really for the first time in this design, we were scheduled and present before the Land Use Committee on March 18th, but obviously because of a that meeting did not happen, and we are very appreciative today board for hosting us evening.
I will note that this project has been presented to the parks, community, Advisory Committee on multiple occasions, its design committee and its full committee, of which it was very well received and Rob Harris actually joined us for that last meeting.
The slides as I speak from the beginning that I'm actually going to turn it over to her for the specific design elements, but the plaza project was actually the first section of Brooklyn Bridge Park to be constructed.
In fact, in 2008 we, after going through community board and LPC review, we removed the purchase building to not only build out this section apart, but to really open up the view plane to both bridges and to the Manhattan skyline and right after we took down the first building in 2008, we were ready to go with construction as the first part of the park to be built, at which point New, York City d-o-t received significant resources through the federal economic stimulus package to do repair work on the bridge itself.
That would help us both from a static perspective, as well as some significant design constraints that the space has and specifically those design constraints are that we need to ensure that New York City d-o-t has the ability for vehicular access to the bridge itself and to the abutment and to be able to drive in on to the site, buy a new dock streets and enter the plaza itself.
We have been having conversations not only with the parks Community Advisory Committee, but also with the folks at City Hall about naming the space or Emily roving that problem.
It is not only the right thing to do, but will actually significantly have significant meeting not just to the park but to the community at large.
We should build out the space, see how it operates first and then pick up that question again, both in terms of ice skating, which again, we think is right as well as any additional season singer gramming.
Thank you, Eric mention this is our updated 2020 design and we've incorporated a lot of good feedback.
There's more seating along the water, the smaller lawn that faces the bridge is surrounded planting, framing the views and the of the bridge in the Manhattan skyline, and we've created some more robust planting, a long Water Street, while still meeting those d-o-t requirements to have protection along Water Street of the abutment, and the new design opens up more desire lines for pedestrians to walk through the space.
So we've worked with MBTA to identify a new paper that is special and unique, but will be fully APA accessible and allow people everyone to experience the entire space and walk along the water's edge here and the paper that we selected is really inspired by the bridge itself.
Proceeding the purchase building filled procurement office that once occupied the positive space that was demoed in 2008, had an old lintel that said, purchase building, New, York, City and we'd actually salvaged that and held on to it over the years and we're going to reinstate it here on Water Street like it once was lighting for the plaza again we're going to be using park standards we're pulling some of our larger light.
Landau mentioned, I was at the last presentation by Van Valkenburg associates, and the presentation was very well received with a lot of gratitude, but how much work the landscape architect here to address earlier concern so I'm not quite sure what to do with a nine-point letter that I received at 5:39 and the last time I was with the same group of people.
So with that, I will entertain a motion to accept the presentation that was given this just now by Eric Landau and the organization's representing the changes to the full temporary historic district I'll move to approve the application, great Thank, You, Carlton and I get a second I.
Long term, but right now the two year-round closest bathrooms or empire stores, and if your house you're your first question about construction and the schedule, you know, look I would say a couple of things number one.
It's first of all, thank you for your comments about not only the design but your current experience in the park, but for your question, and so the short answer is yes, we absolutely have we've been.
What's back-of-house space you need to have available both for state change, locations and ice melt machines and ice chillers, and what part of this design includes that you can't see is that in order to do an ice skating, rink there's a significant amount of electrical power that is required.
You want answer that one first or do you want to ask the UM go ahead, so what I would say is yes, the picnic tables that we have certainly are heavily used there having new picnic tables that have been added outside of West Elm on the on the park side, there are picnic tables that have been added a long time out, market on old doc streets and one of the things that I think that we would look at after this.
Space is built out and we've operated a little bit as sort of a programmatic element is: are there additional pieces of furniture tables and chairs that we could add in this location that could accommodate exactly what you're talking about, but I think before?
They need to come into the space and access it for any type of construction work.
The areas that I'm most concerned about is the extension in the backyard and one of the things you can bring up in your presentation is: how far will it go into what we call the donut and also have you notified the neighbors on either side as to the work you're going to be doing in the backyard in the backyard extension so Rob, do we have a representative for this application?
First of all, my name is pastor Paul Burke, executive director of Brooklyn Teen Challenge I, just want to thank you, Executive Committee, for meeting with us, especially during the trying times that were in right now.
But in order to keep this building on hoppin and to make sure work well point to fit in time and was going to look attractive, we had to do a major renovation well in selling those buildings had to make up some square space which, with we are doing I, have todd philip.
One of the things to be noted with what's going on in our community right now, is we've been able to give away a hundred and twenty eight thousand pounds of food from this from this program.
This trying time for our city, especially we've, been a light in this community, and we want to continue to be able to do that for many more years.
This is time, philippi the architect at all, I'll kind of walk you through the details of the proposal once Paul wraps up, so the building was drawn up with all the things in mind and, like I said, we've been in this community since 1958 we're a historic building.
We have people come from all over the actual world to visit this spot because, like I said, there's over 1,400 centers around the world in 120 countries where this program is helping people that are struggling with addiction, and it started right here on this house.
The way that we feel that we need to Todd if you could want to take over yeah okay.
That would have the nine over zero pattern, so we would be restoring the front of the building and then giving you an aerial view of the existing site plan we're looking down right now.
The proposed addition would extend that by about 20 feet now I'm going to take you where we're standing in back of the property, and we are looking to the south at the six-story apartment building that is next to it.
So if we look on the top at the existing site plan, you can see where the building comes out to now, there's an exterior stair to the basement, and then there is a an entranceway with a little portico over it and then in the slide immediately below you see the shaded area, and that would be our 20 foot extension behind the house and we would be wrapping that around the corner and providing handicapped ramps so that we can.
You know, there's a lot of work, that's being done, but you're keeping the essence of the building going, and this is something that I think that my I would say.
The top is going from Clinton Avenue on the right and then backwards to the addition on the left side, and you can see the shaded areas of floor and the dashed line shows what's proposed to be extended from the existing building, and that section that's marked a is the bottom left that goes through the building, and you can see here the roof terrace, that's at the level of the third floor, and then, if we look at the other section BB, that's where the elevator is that provides access to all four levels of the building and a lobby space behind it that enables it to be accessible for the entranceway.
Now, looking at the an overhead X on a metric view showing the existing property on the left side- and you can see the house that is to the north- it's part of the historic district and you can see their one-story addition with the deck that pops out the back there and then on the right side.
This is a 3d overhead view if there were no properties around it of what the expansion would look like when the construction would be complete and you can see we're looking at replicating the existing back of the building for most part, and then we have the roof deck, which again we kept that one lower in order to preserve the original outline of the rear architecture and yet, at the same time meet the needs of the Teen Challenge program that goes on, and you can see the handicap ramp coming up to the side entrance way and again we showed it going around to the front, but that's something that we do not have to have in order to provide accessibility and when it's all said and done.
I haven't seen you since that I'm seeing you tonight tiny food technology- that's here, but to be able to continue to work as hard as you have I'm Rob I want to thank you in particular not to single you out versus the team, but I know you've been making that conscious effort to go into the office.
I do want to thank the staff for all of their work, which is made much more difficult when we can't just walk around the office and say so directly to each other's faces.
Okay, thanks any other questions from board members.
