I have a second okay, all in favor, aye, okay, We're going to be discussing the statement of community district needs and the committee board budget requests for fiscal year 2022.
So with that in mind, we're going to be focused on what we can do for the district based on that information, we're going to be focusing on things along the lines that we can actually do without a lot of working capital and basically something that we can do as far as doing outreach to those individuals who need it most right now during these stressful times.
And so it's just really important to keep that in mind that we want to get as many forward as we can so that we put economic development as one of the as having like a large, the largest block of priorities and budget priorities, I love your local campaign, buy local hire local, and this was one that was ranked right at the top when we voted last year on priorities, and so we thought it was good to include it again.
It was to also provide opportunities for local neighborhood, revitalization, with recommendations for merchant, organizing public programming, district marketing and branding, and the grants specifically supported that, so the grant provided a consultancy for anyone who wanted to create online merchant, organizing and considering how important an online presence is in response to Covid-19.
I know that this might not be the top of our list at the moment, considering the status of transportation, but it is worth mentioning and considering if we want to prioritize it again this year and finally, from my end, catherine, I'm going to turn it over to you in a second we'd like to expand eligibility for local payroll grants to cover companies with five or more employees.
So this means a way that we can spotlight local neighborhood culture, local, small businesses and community heroes with the work of local artists, and this kind of competition would allow funding for the artists supplies to create things like murals partnering, up with maybe vacant retail spaces as a way to lift the neighborhood, and that would be in partnership with existing organizations like the bids and new york city dot.
I support small business initiatives I think, is, You know a priority, but I want to add on another priority and that has to do with the tenets that are in these nycha developments within community board.
Maybe we could be more specific about delineating an item specifically that would focus on retraining or providing these osha, trainings or, and even maybe, emphasizing a re-skilling so to say of the general workforce population in response to Covid-19 and identifying, like what kind of programs are even needed right now to help people find these new jobs.
I have a recommendation for how to include them in the budget priorities we're making So maybe I think it's two different budget maybe I think, and a way to get more bang for our buck, might be to provide the grants to local non-profits, who are already doing this work and to expand their current programming.
