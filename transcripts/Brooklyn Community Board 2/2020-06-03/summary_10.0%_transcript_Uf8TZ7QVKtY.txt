So we're quite happy about that, and this is an effort, of course, to be able to make sure the businesses, the small businesses that operate on the yard are able to stand back up and be able to start reemployed, new yorkers and so the employment center, which is the area that I lead, wanted to speak a little bit about some of those efforts.
So we've maintained operations through kovat 19 and, although operating remotely, we've been able to place over 75 individuals to date through March up until about last week, I think was our last count and are now helping businesses who are preparing to bring back their workforce with HR related needs, as well as working on retooling programs for the summer that focus on like the future workforce.
Obviously, for obvious reasons, like you said now, may not be the best time to move forward with that being that a lot of businesses making times to two, you know retool and reopen, and then additionally, the social distancing.
It was so good, as I mentioned we had probably about maybe about 40 yard businesses convert trying this time to start producing PPE.
So this includes our larger employees like I mentioned Bednar can do gab well, we've also had our fashion designers start making gowns and masks, and you know people who reupholster and make things.
Yes, as we are started, we're starting to see a bit of an uptick and business is thinking about reopening, and so we continue to do to make sure the community is aware of those opportunities.
We have started a community newsletter that goes out to about 8,000 residents every week, and that has resources both for you know, wellness food, of course, and claimant we're doing a resume workshop tomorrow.
Come you know, okay, so this one last question: does the community newsletter?
But so far we've only had two people, so that's pretty good I opted out of things every week, so, okay, great, thank you.
Someone trying to get attention Catherine, sorry to interrupt, and you just repeat your question and as my service went out right as you're asking and I heard the answer, but I just want to make sure I get.
Thank you for having me the agenda I'm, going to basically give you an update on the Business Improvement, Districts and cb2 for the most part, everyone's working from home, so I've sent out a bunch of emails.
What I've noticed currently right now as I've gone to a few meetings, different agencies and different most part people are doing they've, adjusted very well after the first couple weeks, kind of like guys doing right now with his weapons, okay, trial and error.
For those do we know if there's, if that's happening in our district I'm, going to mention the downtown Brooklyn Partnership is moving forward with some of those initiatives where they are with those initiatives.
You know whatever we can do as far as being community members to support those types of initiatives like the open streets initiative or the sidewalk cafes I, think that would go a long way right now.
