If you're able to improve it- timothy, yes good evening, community booktube, thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak, I'm to make it very brief.
Yes, my name is timothy harrell, I'm an outreach coordinator with the new york city, civilian complaint review board, as most of you may or may not know we're a new york city agency independent from the nypd, and what we do is we investigate mediate and in some cases we prosecute allegations of misconduct against members of the nypd.
My purpose for wanting to speak to you tonight very briefly, was just to inform you that we are going to be having our public board meeting on september 9th at 6 00 p.m. It is also a virtual meeting, it's held in a town hall fashion.
I am calling from the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, I'd like to inform the public and especially cosmetologists, because we do offer free and confidential services to any survivor and their children experiencing domestic or gender-based violence at this time, despite their immigration status, despite their income despite their gender, despite any status.
So if anybody is interested and I'll share my email, if anybody knows of any cosmetologist or someone that are willing to hear more about how they can better interact with the survivor when they do encounter a disclosure and then for also, I will be sharing my contact information and the family justice centers, where they are providing virtual services in the meantime.
This is an august meeting, but we're certainly happy to entertain any reports, and I believe that bob has received some reports from elected officials that he'll be distributing if there are any elected officials who would like to provide a report, if you guys could raise your hands- and I will promote you and allow you to speak all right- I have luke start with luke.
We came out with it's called our safe main street initiative, and I do want to thank cb2 and valerie and the reopening working group.
So the first section is on supporting struggling businesses, and that includes things like providing tax credits to cover reopening costs, creating a new york city tech corps to help small businesses adopt digital tools, so they can transition to online, which is more important right now than ever, or allowing businesses to cure periods.
The second section is on supporting entrepreneurs and new businesses, so providing tax incentives to entrepreneurs in high vacancy areas, which cb2 has some of or creating a re-entrepreneurship program, so that, if you're an entrepreneur- and you had your business for many years and are trying to retire instead of just giving up your business, you can actually sell it to an aspiring entrepreneur.
Okay, any other questions: hey thanks, luke and we're gonna move now to ivy rosado from council member carlina rivera's office.
I just have one really quick update wanted to let everybody know that we're going to get a new green market at astor place, so it is next tuesday august 25th at 11 a.m. Carlina will be there, along with village alliance for nyc and other members to have a ribbon cutting for a new green market which is located on east 8th street in lafayette, so moving forward the market's going to be open every tuesday from now on august, 11th up until november 24th and the market hours are going to be from 8, am to 5 pm.
That's it great thanks ivy, I don't see any questions from board members, so thank you, and now we have eliana cohen from senator brian kavanaugh's office eliana, it's actually brian myself.
At this point, but- and you know you- there was actually a daily news editorial today that cites a lot of scott's ideas and also this idea, but I'm happy to talk about it, give any questions, and that is expressly intended for small local businesses to give them the stability they need to.
If you plan that vote absentee would be a good idea to begin requesting them now and get you know, get that process in early and get them in early, because, obviously, there's been a lot of complicated issues with the post office and with the boards processing them, and we also made it clear that ballots that are postmarked on the day of the election up to and including the day of election will count, and we previously passed a bill that said if they received the day after the election, even if they don't bear a postmark, they will also count.
That will exacerbate all kinds of problems, including the inability of people to pay rent, but we are so we're still pushing for a large infusion of money for a variety of things, but in this case, particularly to help cover rent- and we have a bill that we've been working on that is intended to make sure new york state is ready to move if that money, materializes to cover people's rent and that's been pending for a while and we've been discussing it with the executive branch and the assembly and with all kinds of other stakeholders to get it ready to go, and it's called, we call it c-wrap the covet emergency relief emergency rent assistance program.
I think that I will a couple other things I could probably cover, but yeah, obviously we're all focused on what's gonna happen with schools and, I think, still giving and receiving input about how that's going to work as that reopens, but we're hoping to make sure that is safe and that the schools are ready to accommodate all of the students and the families and the school personnel that have to be involved.
I'm going to start with beau barra cabona yeah hi, thanks carter, hi brian, took two questions, one.
I think that there are many areas where the city cannot act independently and there are many where they can and obviously we don't have the right to simply abridge or void contracts at any level of government in the without some constitutional questions being answered, but I don't have an opinion about whether it's, whether it's something they have the authority to do.
We don't know, what's going to happen in 10 years, wait and the other question is, if you I haven't, heard it yet, but this isn't a time for people wait.
I'm glad you mentioned it, but you should look at the resolution that I believe the community board is going to pass tonight that the school's committee got together.
The ventilation system is a mess, so both the teachers and the children need safe schools, and just please you know do what you can to make sure that we don't open precipitously yeah.
The city's plan does need to be approved by the governor's office and I think a lot of people are gonna be scrutinizing very closely.
I know a lot of the private schools have made the decision that they're not opening at the beginning of the year they're going to delay and see how it looks in, like you know, late september or october, and so again we're looking at it closely we're hearing from all sides.
I think we, I would say we need to get the system our decision right, but even whatever we decide system-wide, you probably want some discretion for people to say I'm not I'm not comfortable and I'm doing what I need to do with my kids too, but I re yes, we want, like the element of personal trust, does not obviate the need for a system-wide solution that is right to getting those questions right, because there's a public health there's public health issues that go beyond the people who are actually in the buildings anyway.
You're trying to do the right thing, you recognize the tenants, don't have money, you're willing to do affordability, you would have to have some longer-term affordability element to participate in that particular program, but we're hoping that the city will be willing to put real resources behind that and make the benefits generous enough to incentivize property owners to take the deal- and you know I will just note that high unaffordability of storefronts to small businesses that we really care deeply about in our communities is not a it's, not a new issue in covert.
We're hoping that this kind of thing will catch on and become a normal approach, because there's a lot of public interest in making sure businesses continue to thrive in our thank you, yep thanks and one last question before we move on from janine kylie hi senator cavanaugh.
Yes, okay, great so whatever happens with schools, reopening students will be learning remotely anywhere from three to five days a week, and I feel that 99 of the education conversation is about open and don't reopen and that's important, that's a safety conversation.
I mean this really needs to be robust and there cannot be minimums that I mean there need to be minimums, at least that each school that each teacher provides- and I know that as a state official- you don't have a ton of power over this, but this is a matter of money, and this is a matter of pushing back on all the different entities that want to limit the quality of the remote learning right.
Why can't our elected officials demand that all teachers in all classrooms in all grades in a school follow a standard in terms of live small group teaching my kids last year, one in kindergarten, a brief question because we really need to well.
The school cuts as well, which you know is tomorrow at 4 p.m. I will be sharing the aforementioned hearing on the courts at that point, but but I mean there's a lot of activities and I will say we're going to have a hard time doing anything that people want if we don't have the funding great thanks, dr smith, quickly.
So I strongly hope that you will consider that, and I would ask you to look at programs that have figured out a way to have live zoom instruction all day long with the kids having to even raise their hands to go to the bathroom act, just as if they're in the classroom, if they're not able to go to school or their family doesn't feel comfortable, so they're still in the classroom, they're not able to just hide behind or just turn in or check boxes, they're, just as present as they would be in the classroom and those do exist.
Just so, you know 65 cut to the weekday service and unless a council member emptied up 100 to the litter basket, pickup cut on the weekend, that's a problem in my opinion and then just finally, I just want to say we're working on two things.
We have to change the open meeting law and I think carter knows better than that about why.
But just let you know we haven't, got an answer on that, but I have heard confidence from people who actually like to be able to participate in a different way.
Yes good evening, madam president, when you were here last month, you said you were going to be speaking with principals in the borough to sort of assess where they are in terms of outdoor learning, and so I'm curious.
Yes, can I'd like to talk if you want later off lying with you about this funding that brian gave to harlem to the school districts?
But I'll put my information in the chat thanks bo forward, hi gail albert hi, I'm just wondering if you felt it would be more productive and efficient all around if the department of ed just stopped the fiction that they will open schools and admit that they won't because you and I think, know that they won't and spend some time trying to improve the quality of the remote education, because it wasn't good in this last few months and we really need to improve it.
Everybody agrees with that and I think all this time spent on this nonsense: they're not going to open the schools.
We know that so let's change your focus, but you also, you feel a little upset, because when people tell you who are administrators at the department of education offline that they wish that the oe had spent months and months working on the virtual right, which is what you just said and did that during this time period, then you know what you just said is correct, but they didn't and so we're in them.
But if 10 schools come there's no way, you'll know the teachers, and so the kids will not be able to get caught up on academics I'll leave it at that one when they get too upset yeah, I get it.
Thanks for your time, yeah I just want to know.
Thank you very much, mr chair, and I think that's all the questions that I see from board.
So if you know of anyone or any group who needs help with that, please feel free to contact our office and that's basically it for this month.
For me great, thank you very much and we've had a few other elected officials reps on the line, but I think that they've all submitted reports in lieu of in lieu of speaking, I see one question from coral.
I think everyone knows it, but having all these public announcements encouraging people to get tested and it's free and you get results and everyone goes and they get worthless tests.
We've had a lot of people that are, you know, work in different things, reach out, and I've tried to help people and they just don't get results or someone pays 800 to get them because they're not insured and they still don't get the results yeah.
It's been, it's been like really great and easy, and quick, so yeah thanks carl one other or two more questions.
So I'm curious if there's been any conversation because of the 48-hour turnaround period with partnering with doe new york city schools thanks yeah, that's an amazing question.
I definitely will bring that back to our office and see if there's anything that we can do and if that's at all possible, because that's a really great idea and super important in terms of making sure that people are properly tested before they get in.
Great thanks and one last question from matt letzger, I'm okay carter.
Guys, okay, and I think that's all the elected officials that we had one second here, that we had that we're going to provide the reports.
We're going to move on to the chairs report, as as we distributed to everybody, really sad that one of our board members, tom connor, had passed away this month.
I wanted to have a moment of silence just to acknowledge him for a few seconds, and tom is also a member of vid, and I know that they had a gathering for him yesterday and I've been in touch with tom's niece, who indicated that they're, putting together a memorial service with greenwich house and that virtual memorial is going to be taking place on september 23rd, and we have more information.
I believe that susannah aarons is going to be addressing that with a social services meeting next month, and we also had a committee meeting for the reopening working group, the restarting together universities that went very well nyu and the new school walked us through their plans for welcoming students back to campus, and that was of note for our local businesses and our community next month.
We are going to move on to standing committee reports, but when looking back at our past meetings, we generally take a roll call vote on the first item, but we haven't been doing that, but I'm going to go ahead and have valerie just take a quick roll call attendance, because I noticed that we had a number of board members that joined us.
So is there any other discussion on items one through twelve, okay, so, like in past months, I'm going to move to move all 12 of these items and these resolutions into an omnibus bill that we can vote on at the end of the at the end of the business session?
Okay, thank you, janine, and to your committee for all your hard work this month and in the past few months on all these items.
I just it's a comment and I just want to thank the schools committee, especially for the second resolution, especially the third item, which is that school should only be reopened if they are safe, not just for children and teachers, but all the other staff that work at the school janitorial staff lunch staff.
So thank you for including that in the resolution yes and yeah thanks a lot great thanks and then coral yeah I so I just have a question as to what safe means, and maybe it needs to be defined in the resolution, because I mean what does that mean you know, we'd intentionally did not define it.
I mean, I appreciate what you've done, and this is a complex thing, but this is more of a political statement, because we've passed many resolutions that have had you know ad nauseam, footnotes and whatnot, so I'm sort of inclined to leave it out because I don't want it the end of the day.
Okay, I mean I just I feel, like the unions are definitely they need to get their act together and figure out how to instruct these kids and yeah well they're only focusing on safe right now, I know you're going to say it's not safe forever, because they don't want to work.
Okay, seeing no objection we're going to move those two resolutions into the omnibus resolution vote and last committee report is the bylaws working group.
We would also have people having sort of a whole year of service before they're asked to vote so that they're best informed about what the offices are and who is running for them.
The belief was that it was unfair to ask new members to vote for candidates whom they did not know, so the elections were moved from may to november.
The point the whole goal was to basically create a detailed standardized process within our bylaws that will allow our candidates to for elections, to run smoothly and for information not to flow through any sort of temporarily established group, but directly to our members and, let's see number three being electronic voting, of course being in the situation we're in.
You know in a timely manner, you know number four being the special elections is currently our bylaws basically provide that if there's a vacancy most important, the chairs vacancy, but of that there's simply a an order of succession that you know if the chair, if the chair becomes vacant, the first vice chair steps in and they sort of move up the ladder the committee felt that it wouldn't be in the boards it would.
At the same time, it would give the board an opportunity to have input as to who would be serving if you're talking about you know eight nine months or more it was.
I do have a question about the purpose of elect and I don't want to seem personal, eliminating the elections committee when when it was not just me, but it was other people as well and also that I'm interested in knowing why a secret voting and third, when we spoke, you spoke about new people on the board.
Yes, no is this second shirley yeah second shirt, probably two section one, please one to do with the term limits and revisions according to term limits right, okay, one yeah and then michael.
I would like to call out section three regarding what I think is an excellent section, but might need a little bit touching up, and that is electronic voting.
Okay, so it looks like people want to discuss sections one two and three so susan, you want to start with one okay, as I said before, we originally, you know we I mean term limits are now part of the city charter.
First of all, as I said, when we changed them five years ago, it was because we felt that newly appointed members, whose terms started in april really didn't have enough time to learn about the people they'd be voting for if elections were held in may so, which is the was the logic behind moving them to november.
However, if you're giving people more time to learn about the board and it- and I think many of us have found that it takes months sometimes years to learn that having people participate in their first election when they've been through an entire year in the life of the board, will actually increase their knowledge, it might even motivate them to want to to run for office.
I understand that I am totally perplexed as to why we're addressing this issue of term limits and aligning people's terms with term limits when term limits has just kicked in and it's going for eight years and this kind of concern about voting for a chair who may not have a full term.
There was opposition tremendous opposition by the way to every borough, president, but one including very vehemently by our own gail brewer, certainly by many council people, including our own council, speaker corey johnson, and I think the feeling at the time was, is that they were going to work to try to take away tour this term limit requirement whenever the next charter is done, and then these recent years charter revision comes very regularly and often and as far as giving people the opportunity to learn about the rights.
Why should we be considering having two elections and they would be two of two full elections, regardless of even if one is only for four months, and why would we want to go to the trouble of that here as it is we're going to have a tremendously challenging thing before us when we are doing the electronic voting?
The bylaws process is going to be going on and going on for a while from what I understand so there's some time if we have to address this still within the process, but a little later give us a little time to get our feet wet with this new term limits idea- and you know, let's concentrate on electronic voting.
You know you wind up with a first a fairly small percentage chance that this will actually happen, but that aside, I just want to sort of second what shirley said in that look at this meeting like we are in crazy times it's and our plate is so full that there's just no rush like it's a great idea.
Well then, I retract what I said, but I just I think that having two elections within four months is really a waste of time.
I I think what beau just said makes a lot of sense to me as well, but at the same time the whole reasoning behind changing the bylaws is a really good one which is aligning terms of office with the terms of other boards is really smart.
So I really do think it's very smart and well written but, as surely was saying and in speaking with corey's office, they're really trying hard to eliminate that eight-year term limit, and there are a lot of years- and I see it as maybe either it shouldn't be a rush to go ahead and do it right now, so that the board actually can decide who gets that longer term in a different way.
I think I know that I think it's a bit premature and I think that I'm okay with the electronic- and I know that you, susan you, put a lot of work in your committee- did a lot of work, but I think that the comments that were said actually, I was in favor of this, but I changed my mind because I hear my fellow board members telling me these things and they make sense.
I agree with shirley and beau and rossia now and I had brought up the same question at exec last week, because I just it just didn't make sense to me to do this separate four-month election, and I and I said at the time- and I you know I gave more thought I was glad some other people are questioning.
Okay thanks susan valerie, thank you and thank you again to all the hard work by the bylaws committee meeting weekly to work on this, and I know that your committee has really thought these things through and has thought and has had the foresight to think of all the different ways that this could go.
So I would like to voice my support for section one and that I think that it's, I think it's a checks and balances on the volatility that we're currently experiencing right now, instead of locking someone into that longer term or perhaps giving someone a chance to try out maybe one of the other offices, but I just I think that, just with the volatility and we're still in the state of emergency, there's still all of these states on this advisory list, there's a budget shortfall at the state and local level we're not getting federal stimulus anytime soon.
Will we be voting on this by different sections or as a whole yeah, when we call when we and obviously it seems like people are going to have different votes on different sections?
It sounds like there's going to be an objection to that, so some allow people to vote on the different sections when we, when we get to that point.
Yes, first I'd like to just say that for the last five years, as things have changed, I want to thank not only the hard-working committee members on the nominating committee of which I chaired as well as the election committee on which I chaired was an honor, and I thank all of the members of my peers who voted for us.
I don't know if, if others who served in the last five years on these various boards would feel that way, but I feel compelled as chair to say that and second with the secret voting, how what well, how did that come about?
I don't think we have anybody else left on this, but let me just make sure, and is there anybody else who wants to speak to number one, the special term, the important meeting I'll call you when I'm finished?
So I think we've concluded the discussion on section one on special terms, so we'll move on to section two, which is the election of officers.
The members on who served in the last five years on those committees also felt the same way I do, but as chair of all of them, and that's what I wanted to definitely take accepted too.
Okay, I just wanted to point out section two, the process I have no objections to, but the dates are already stating the proposed change of dates so, in other words, the change from the current process of starting in september and then voting in november on these.
Okay, thanks adam, I was just going to point out that I'm not sure I see the parallel between you know our voting for our chair and then the american experience of voting for an elected official you know voting for the chair is a it's a part of our deliberative assembly process and I think that other deliberative assemblies have public open elections for those board positions not necessarily universally about I'm.
I think all the other boards, you know, have moved into having these votes confidential.
I don't I've already made my case, but no one has been definitive unless it's a thing you don't want to share I've been on the board for quite a while, and I have never heard of anyone having taking personal reprisals against someone who did not vote for them.
So if you want to share that with me sure I'll show sure my personal experience, I was kept off the board for a year because I would not share who I was going to vote for chair of the board when I was originally appointed by former borough president virginia fields, and I never they never.
I mean this is not you know in that distant the past, but I'm not supporting either way, because I think everybody's got their strong positions on this, but it has happened.
You know in the past and thank you for saying that, but virginia was not a member of our board.
No, I'm not sure what position he had at that time, but somebody from the board called me up and asked me who I was going to vote for, and I said I'm not comfortable sharing that with you and kind of my appointment letter, so that was communicated to the borough president, who then declined to send the letter.
It's I think we felt it would simplify the process if the requirements were actually set out in the bylaws instead of having a committee generate a new report every year.
Then I would not just me I don't know of other people who have worked in the last five years on these committees.
I personally experienced retribution for one of my votes for chair, so I just want you to know it's a real thing.
I understand this hesitation about making it public because people can well what team just said you know be upset with who you voted for, on the other hand, that maybe that problem or that intimidation should be addressed, and I am for open ballot because we're community representatives, you know when other you know when our state assembly- and you know senators, we know what they voted for and who they vote for, and I think that that's an important information that the community is entitled to.
Oh I mean there are other things that we vote on in private people's raises: how much we're going to pay them.
We close the entire board to the public for that there's, no foil, there's no transcripts, there's no video, and I just feel that I'm not sure it's the public's right to know how you voted for chair.
I would agree with you all things that we vote on that affects the public that we that resolutions it should be should be open, but I don't think that this vote, which does have ramifications king just said it.
I just want to make sure everybody on the board that we're clear that the votes within board members are very different from personnel issues within the office, and so, let's not confuse those two issues, because that is that is separate as far as employees of the board right just saying that we do have clarifying because you and separated those out matt.
I just I had a question because I'm for you, susan, because I'm hearing clearly some different issues- is that something that you might consider that we vote separately on that one item, because that everybody- I didn't, hear anybody speaking to any other issues in this section.
Okay, I think, given the fact that there are those of us who don't agree with this secret ballot, that would that be a separate vote.
Sorry, okay, all right so have we concluded the discussions on the election of officers.
Okay, so now we're going to move on to the third section, which is the electronic voting.
I would like to, as everyone else has done, congratulate the committee on an excellent job of putting forward some very comprehensive recommendations to amend the bylaws and I'm only going to address the electronic voting, which I think is very complicated and difficult to figure out in the introduction.
It seems like a very complicated process and I think we want to make it as simple as possible for the tally committee.
I think we need clarification before we're asked to vote on this section as to how that would work.
The question becomes: are the records open for examination, the people who are doing the tallying know what the who voted for whom right?
It's okay, excellent point people who are going to be entitled to know how anyone voted but the rest of us, it's nuts, it's nuts, dr smith!
So, first of all, as others have said, susan to you and everybody on your committee, great work- and I know it was a lot of work.
Who makes that decision yeah, I'm just going to jump in because gail actually addressed this when she was speaking to us, because this is determined by the governor's suspension of the public officer's law without that suspension, we're required to meet him in person, and so that would essentially eliminate this.
I think sandy did see something in the electronic voting, which is true, but the thing is: there's the there's, the caveat that we put in, and we have time to figure out exactly how to do it.
Okay, dr smith, you had you had a comment that you wanted to make on section two thank you carter, yes in the past and for the amount of time that I've been on the board.
I you know people always because they feel they either want to, for whatever reason they nominate themselves, and it was said that- and we always be required in the past- that, if even if it wasn't a and if it was an uncontested line, that the person should at least spend about a cup five minutes talking about who they are, what they bring to that and what would be their vision and their?
Well, that being said, susan there's no yes or n no vote and on the ballot as it is right now.
So I agree with shirley smith doctor that the person who is uncontested should speak the two minutes or that I read it was two minutes, but I think they should have three minutes, because in the past there have been, if you call them candidates, because they're automatically voted in because there's no contest that you don't know who they are, they put their name in.
Why they're running and their experience and, as I said, there's no, yes or no vote for so the person automatically gets in thanks comments, no comment or mac.
Two minutes is an awful long time in communication terms, actually for people to speak and for people to talk, and I just don't think that it should be an obligation or requirement if people feel like people know me and I'm just putting my name up there and they can vote for me or not.
If you really there's people on the board, I don't, I know better than others and for a whole lot of reasons and I'm sure the rest of you all can say that about yourself, but when it comes to vote to putting your name down, this is a leadership.
I think we should consider passing that at this time, but I don't know if the rest of the items need to be passed.
Okay, thanks, georgia, I'm honestly utterly confused about the different sections of this conversation at this point, we're discussing section two, the election of the officers right now.
I know, but we've been discussing this bylaws section and taking it piece by piece and now I've sort of lost the thread, because it's been a very long conversation and I'm curious when we might vote on this or as rocio just suggested- maybe push it to next month.
Maybe we could say that they have the option of speaking or sending in a letter, that's distributed to the entire board before the election, explaining their vision of what they want to do, and I don't think that we have to hear from from the secretary.
I don't think that anybody had called out the last section, but it's just on special elections.
Yes, I want to be sure, thank you, okay, great, so so valerie.
I want to start obviously we'll do this at the roll call, yep bylaws section one term limits this is what are we am I'm asking I'm sorry you've been calling each person and they can get their okay perfect and, if you're siding with the committee.
The special term is how people will vote on that section.
I think when you phrase it as to vote yes on the secret ballot.
Okay, great with that said, we have a few more items to vote on.
Okay thanks, everybody so much second yeah, don't forget to vote and to fill out the census?
