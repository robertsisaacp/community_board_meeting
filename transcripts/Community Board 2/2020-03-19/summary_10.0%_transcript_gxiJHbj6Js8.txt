Meeting, obviously we're under some interesting circumstances right now, and our meeting tonight is to essentially complete our precoded 19 business and move forward into the world declare in this day we're gonna start off with attendance time before we do that.
If you can keep yourself on mute and why you are called on, you can use the raise hand, feature I'm going to try my best to manage this I've got a lot of people who allow them to speak and members to stay on at the end, for an executive session where we have a personnel matter to discuss with that turn over to dollar a dollar.
Do you want to start with attendance and I'm gonna may have to wait a second for people to unmute themselves as we go through the attendance okay, Katie bar, oh I, thought I saw her on there.
Guess the easiest way to do this is if the elected official reps, who are going to be giving the reports, if you could raise your hands so to speak, which, if you click on the manage participants with the participants tab on the bottom of your page, go over to the right and under more, she should be able to raise your hand.
First of all, let me just say to everyone in the board that I and my entire staff upstate downstate, wish everybody to stay safe, and you know this is unprecedented and in Albany we passed a couple of bills and we did so by having a very limited number of people in the chamber to debate.
So we will have detailed information on that going out tomorrow and the good news today for folks who will be there lost a job or laid off or have had their hours shortened and have a mortgage.
You know the governor's been clear that this the city is not walking down, but we are all asked to stay home unless we're doing something like walking a dog or going out for a jog or doing shopping.
So the whole point is to try to stop the spread, and you do that best by staying inside, to the extent that you can, you know special emergency services working for the Transit Authority.
All of those are viewed as essential jobs and so we're all working from home and school children are at home and it's a difficult and unusual time, but I do believe that, as FDR said a generation ago, the thing we have to fear the most is fear itself and so I don't want people to be panicked.
We want to thank you all for continuing to move forward with this and keeping C functioning as we get through this sort of unprecedented crisis together and moving forward a couple of announcements.
We have a pretty robust set of guidance for city, state and federal resources, and we are happy to try to help make sure that people are getting connected in the right way.
That's four million folks in cb2 that are stranded abroad because of commercial flight cancellations, and we are saying we want to make sure that we are providing funding for the State Department to be able to repatriate those standard abroad.
We're also trying something very strange with the Dharma Center we're trying to get the doorman center to so and turns out that in Wisconsin DuPont has thousands of I would say thousands of reams, garment, Surgical, garnet material, raw material, so we're hopefully by the end of tomorrow, we'll know that's available and then it can come to New. York they've got a sense of things.
The issue in San Francisco, even with a lockdown construction, continues the issue that the mayor said is that there outdoors, on the other hand, they are close to each other, so the whole construction issue comes up often so, from our perspective, it's the seniors we're trying to get that early morning time when they can shop.
Think everyone hearing this okay, yes, this is Claudia from Assemblymember news office and I.
It is absolutely harmful and unacceptable, and the assembly armor calls for the community to continue to stand together and remain educator, ANCOVA 19 and keep an eye out for all the misinformation that is circulating and it's kind of wild these days to see what comes up on Twitter and gets flat out very quickly in terms of our work, we have done two letters to Governor Cuomo one was for at-home testing kits for equipment 19.
All the residents have told us that they have not seen much of an increase in terms of the cleaning, especially in high-traffic areas, so that was one of our letter calling for them to really be fully aware of the areas that need constant cleaning where people are touching a lot or just brushing past all that, and that is as far as what we've done so far, and we will continue to work along with the community as we go into very new uncertainty.
During this time, we've also called our number of proposals to be enacted at the city and state level or at the company level to make sure that small businesses and families and workers are able to survive this downturn.
We know that many of them are struggling or forced to close making sure that when their workers are protected- and that also goes for the arts and creative communities and the independent gave workers who right now might not have their normal income stream during this time.
So we also, lastly want to thank all of our state and federal partners who are working so hard and advocating for new yorkers and our office is once again open on the clock I'm available with anything that you guys might need, or people's backgrounds, that he's got this ocean in the background.
Assuming it's a blue screen or he's having a really good time somewhere, I'm, not sure, and thank you to the President and Bob encourage were utilizing this kind of technology.
You know, caught in the void here, the governor issued an executive order following my introduction of the bill to allow this, but I still think it should be done automatically whenever there's a state of emergency declared.
Obviously, there's a lot moving very quickly hour by hour and I know that the president mentioned its signing up for text alerts at six nine, two, six, nine two or calling the New York State Cobin 19 hotline, which is available on my website for more information.
You know good sense and staying home when they can so I really appreciate that yesterday that the Legislature passed comprehensive, paid sick leave for those subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine and as the economic impact of the virus becomes more evident to us, I'm calling on all levels of governments is for a restaurant rescue plan, a small business bailout and a wage worker and gig workers support fund so that we can save as many jobs as possible.
Our office is closed, but you know one of the weird results of this kind of virtual world is that we've been so focused on constituents because they and Jacob come back with stuff he's on here, because they've been contacting us by email and by telephone we've been really on top of those calls.
If you know of someone who has medical experience, they're looking to bring those folks out of retirement because we're gonna probably need them in the next weeks and months ahead, but this is showing me really truly how strong our community is and I'm certain we're gonna come out all the better for it.
So I wanted to thank all of my colleagues and government and the community board for all the work you've done already.
Oh hi, there two things with respect to health care number one is: are there plans to loosen the requirements, the HIPAA requirements for Medicaid recipients in order to allow broader appointments through telephone and video conferences, issue will follow up and see what the state is recommending to the feds.
In many cases, the ability for practitioners to be all things to be billers, to be doctors to be counselors presentation from Lennox village in a few minutes, so they'll probably be able to jump in with some more details, not on the legislation side, but on sort of the technicalities of some of those different areas change since yesterday, but Greenwich House is initiating a program where they call all of their members a couple of times a week just to make sure that everyone is okay, but there this is pretty small, because their membership is pretty small and they would be enormous Lee helped by any context that you guys are able to share with them, because the hope would be that we then find a kajillion volunteers.
All right thanks, guys we're gonna move on to the next elected officials report from eric bakker from speaker, Cory Johnson's office, Eric - for doing this broadcast.
Thank you very much thanks Eric, and thank you guys for all your work and the trees to who I spoke with the earlier today is also on with us, and also Eliana feeling, okay and getting some fresh air with social distancing still in mind, with the focus on senior centers naturally occurring with retirement communities, youth organizations nonprofit small businesses, like everyone, has been saying, I heard from a lot of folks in the community and we're doing our best to make sure we're listening to what folks are saying, and one thing that I think someone brought up that we're looking into right now, it's around the telehealth calls and making sure that those are still getting covered.
19 is, and if anybody needs to get in touch with them for constituent services, you can email him directly at a Drummond council button, YC gov or call their office directly or his cell phone, which is three two, eight seven five 374, and if you need that information, you can email info at cb2, Manhattan or directly link to Bob Lanier district manager on our on our homepage: Alex Hellinger, who's, the executive director for Lenox house furniture, Ilic Thank, You Wayne.
So any of those government regulations that can be moved in to help that would always would be very hopeful, but times like this, where people really want telemedicine, they don't want to go out of their homes and go to the doctor's office.
So if it's just for comfort, things like it's like zoom Skype would probably be better, but we are trying to seriously limit the amount of folks that are coming into the facilities unless they truly need to be here.
Thank you to community board too, and all the members for you know getting us the opportunity to speak to you guys tonight.
Yes, could be signs that there may be a more serious infection going on and you know we would encourage you to come and get evaluated now, not everybody that comes into the emergency department at this point were able to test and sort of echoing what Alex had said as our system, not only core lab we're, also partnering with LabCorp and quest and some other private labs, as our capabilities to test expand, we'll be able to test more and more people.
So we're trying to find the right balance in terms of keeping the right people in the hospital and making sure that the folks who are sick have other mechanisms to get tested.
So that would be the you know, take-home advice, I have for them, and the folks on the call tonight is that everyone should sort of have a contingency plan and do a little bit of research on their own so that if they do feel sick and potentially not sick enough to go to the hospital that they at least have alternative mechanisms to get tested.
I'm sure this is incredibly stressful and busy time so I can certainly understand the need to project calm, and you know that it is under control, but I guess my concern is that there's no physical way to know what is in store for us and that 25% infection on 1% case fatality rate, there's no physical way.
I would say that if you're coming to the emergency department in your sick, you would you get an emergency department bill I, don't know that the tests would be separate there and, as far as the drive-throughs are concerned, quite honestly, not sure how that's working a couple of days ago.
I've also got a really good question from one of our board members and people who do not have a primary care doctor, since many insurance plans no longer require it.
It may be something different for everybody listening to the call, but certainly if you don't have access to a health care provider, you're feeling ill, you could certainly come to the ER to get evaluated and that's what a lot of people have been doing and will continue to do.
Somebody I think an urgent care is a nice in-between there, they're not open 24 hours a day, but typically most of them are open 12 hours a day, and you can always you know hop online and check out, go health and see what their hours are and you can even make appointments ahead of time.
Okay and we've got one last question which I think it's a really good question, actually two more questions: one does the painters mask or a construction mask work at all, or does it need to be a medical mask, yeah, I, guess an n95 mask, yeah, I, think yeah and then 95.
Take a look and see what the actual structure of the mask is if it can be utilized in the same environment that we're using the n95 and so I would probably took that question to one of the materials management, people and then a question which my sister texted me but I don't think she's actually is to my guts and just you know what is safe, what precautions should older people take they're going shopping at the grocery stores?
What should they be doing if I'm sitting in the king board conference room right now, I'm across the street, from Morton Williams and you know, I when I came in I saw a couple of people older people going in and what should people be doing it yeah I think that's a challenging question I think whatever you can have delivered.
You know whatever resources you have available and really keep the space issue, we're using ten feet as a number that we're sort of telling folks in the hospital is a safe distance.
And it's interesting you bring that up, because that's actually what my sister texted was, you know what should they be doing during senior hours and I've got one last question from time.
Should you notified the urgent care before you show up put your name in for an appointment online before you just go right in they've made it very easy for you just a quick aside about at least ago Health they've put in a mechanism where, if you're, making an appointment to go and see them, they'll communicate with you before your appointment and ask you if you're having any true like symptoms, and if the answer to that question is yes, they'll arrange for someone to meet you outside of the urgent care and hand you a mask before you come in, so that they can at least create an environment, that's safe for other patients for maybe in the waiting room.
I think you know some of the information that we've gotten that we've seen tonight is it's pretty young I see somebody who said.
One of the things that we heard a little bit tonight is you know, what can we do, and one of the things that we can do is really reach out: help the most vulnerable in our community, our neighbors, that people are next to us.
People get sick, there's a link on our website on our calendar to the day and we've sent it out multiple times the New York City, Department Mental Health website.
I keep having Bob put it on there and sending it out because it is so informative and it's constantly updated along with York State Department of Health website and CDC, as we kind of move forward tonight, I'm trying to keep the committee reports, succinct, I think the most of the chairs are aware of that.
As far as any committee meetings as we go forward, we are going to have a weekly executive community meeting, virtually unzoom to just sort of discuss where we are each week.
In fact, they have scheduled wonderful, April, 7th that subject to change, didn't change and the best ever want to please check the website for regular updates, has temporarily suspended all of New York City's land use decision making processes.
People understand that some businesses is moving forward in different agencies in different ways, and we have we play a role in that process and to not have committee meetings should we need to in the coming weeks and months would be to sort of abdicate our responsibility providing for providing guidance to those agencies.
So we're gonna move on now to our business session and you get a motion to approve of February minutes which were distributed by email to board members by Bob, sir, maybe I like to make a motion.
Something got mixed up in there for all individuals in who are incarcerated in New, York, State, incarcerated individuals and I will fix that and send that to Valerie okay, so actually neglected to mention at the beginning of this the way we're gonna conduct our business session is that we're going to keep adding the committee resolutions into one large omnibus, though, however, if somebody wants to call out an item, we can call it out and discuss it and vote on that separately, but because we're doing a voice rule all boats, I thought that would be more expedient.
Does anybody have any comments on either of these resolutions or you need to raise your hand or okay, so I'm, seeing no discussion one to thank you for the great work that you're doing.
Would anybody like to call out any of those items or have any comments or questions on any of the resolutions which you know put forward?
This application was heard I think about a year ago in the one committee that was approved just like this one is denying less with stipulations.
They might like to call out any of those items if you could just speak up or raise your hand Carter yes, I need to recuse myself from number three, the other, so I was gonna.
The applicant stated that they're working diligently to get up to code with all relevant city rules and regulations and cleared up all violations from the last two years, including getting a landmark permit for the existing mural, which is adjacent to the unenclosed sidewalk cafes, some lights or some other things like Mike said there may have been an objection on the Sun Street there I'm, not sure the suggestion have it without this being like certification, that the landmarks have been corrected.
Let everybody know that we'll be going through the list on zoom' and making sure that it's just for members.
Does anybody have any new business they'd like to raise okay, I'm gonna, just jump in and say that one of the things that his new business is co, vid 19 and we're going to be addressing we're gonna, be having we're gonna like to ask for the new way of doing of this uncomplicated technology meeting?
There's less of an of a need, I think at this point for us to schedule at this point any committee meetings something certainly we'll consider as things come up.
You know we reacts to applicants and if people are going to be making applications, we don't want to give up her voice and provide those recommendations.
Point I had a discussion that evening before the meeting of the late afternoon, with respect to the agenda items on our land, Landing establishments that were for 10 years issues with you know, I've been sending out emails to the board myself to the board members directly, and you know I'm gonna send out another one in the next few days and ask people if it would be okay.
I've been blind copying the members, so if people wanted to be involved in an open discussion, I think that would be a good format and also with our weekly executive committee meetings that were going to be doing I believe that we're going to be doing them on Tuesday nights at 6:30, which is the normal time that we do our executive meeting, we're going to be doing them via zoom and any of the regular board.
As far as you know, anything that comes up- and you know we're gonna figure out ways that we can better keep the community informed of specific issues that are happening from south of 14th Street, north of canal, west of Bowery and 4th Avenue and to the river.
Certainly, we as a community board are here and are serving our purpose, and you know I, really it's really impressive- that everyone's done this tonight and it's wonderful and sort of the new way of life.
Think that the best way to get through this crisis is that to make sure that no one feels isolated reality is that we're gonna have a lot of people who are sick in our community and around us.
Yesterday is not the where help is needed tomorrow and I know that Brad's office has been sending out updates and as well as our other elected officials, so signing up for their emails as well is a good way to keep on top of things and we'll be doing the same, but do check when you hear that a need is necessary, verify it and just keep up to date, so that, if you've got time that you're putting it putting it forward in the best way possible on something that new needs that come up.
You know this is truly every six hours 12 hours we've got new information and staying it up in front of that is really important, and it's a big part of why I keep pushing the links for the Department of Health for the city for the state and CDC they update information.
You know just an example of the information that's already there and in it and if you're hearing questions in the media a lot of times, they'll be addressing those just as quickly on those websites as well and I, think that I saw in a email notice earlier from a one Lock sociation Lennox, Hill, Greenwich Village.
Carter I thought you ran a very good meeting, so I think this might be a new standard moving forward for us the reality world that we really have to address changing that law at the state level.
So please send the ideas you know to me in to my colleagues and elective offices before we're gonna move into executive session to discuss a personnel matter, so there any other any other comments from anybody.
So yes, the live shoes off I just want to say thank you to all community board to members.
