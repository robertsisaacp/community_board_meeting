Here I think we've got just making sure we don't have any board members that have registered in the public side of things.
Lois got you bo as well robin rostin here, thanks sandy russo here from rocio sands, here great scott sartiano, shirley, secunda, yeah kristen shay, I'm here thanks, roderick siegel here, georgia, silvera siemens, here shirley, dr shirley smith, president thanks chanel spence, here, kathy sullivan eugene, you here and susan wittenberg, here anthony wong here and adam zeldin mara's here.
Notwithstanding the fact that we're having an enormous financial, you know crisis at the mta, we need a public hearing on service and that's what this bill would require and then another bill I passed just today is banning ghost guns.
You assemble at home without serial numbers, so they're not traceable by law enforcement and because we have such tough gun laws in the state of new york, which is a great thing.
Once we hear what the federal response is to additional need by the city and state, we know it's great everything, ranging from tenants to small landlords to to our small businesses, our hospitals, our public schools and our mass transit.
We're gonna need federal aid to to dig ourselves out of this crisis, not to mention you know the health crisis that still is ongoing and then a final word carter on my legislation to make permanent the governor's order for alcohol to go and as well as deliveries.
I we're we're putting that we're putting that bill on ice right now, given the really disappointing response by many patrons who are violating social, distancing laws and causing havoc on our blocks, we're going to you know continue to evaluate the governor's order.
You know what what are you expecting so so we've looked at potential amendments that would tighten the the governor's executive order in that regard, but I think I'm gonna leave it to the governor to step up enforcement or at least make it more routine and predictable for everyone before we try to pass a bill at this stage, great I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask everybody to please be recognized to not just speak.
That's my daughter's chicken nuggets I'll turn that off sorry, okay, we do have three more questions from you from the community board.
You know free of that type of harassment, of of litigants and and witnesses and family members, but I honestly think most of these bigger picture issues are going to be decided in november and you know urge everyone to to participate and in elections, no matter what their political preference is.
So I would you know, I'm going to be stepping up my public campaign and in connection with that, I sent out mailings and and and put it in my newsletter to my newsletter this week, but we have to do I think, in all hands on deck approach before before we lose out on on lots of federal aid and then and then finally, I would say that you know new york's doing a a you know.
Thank you something that people don't know enough about and haven't studied necessarily as much as they should, but my question's in further regard to that.
You know: well, speaking of pfas, there's a great movie called dark waters which I think is streaming now starring mark ruffalo and it really encapsulates the the whole fast environmental crisis takes takes place in a town not far from where I grew up in rural west, virginia parkersburg, west virginia, which was contaminated by a pfest plant.
We we had our own pfest debacle in a in a small town and and resulted in you know a lot of people who may develop health conditions down the road, including infants and and children, but one of the things we did pass this session is a bill to to make illegal dumping a felony and to really toughen those penalties.
I just want to let everyone know that questions are only reserved for the community board members and it won't be open to the public.
Oh, I know leslie we've spoken about it great, so leslie you wanted to speak publicly, I'm giving you your chance if you're around.
I I wanted to support the resolution because I think it very accurately reflected the testimony in two different sla committee hearings against the bill: the union, the unanimous opposition by residents at both of those hearings.
I also supported the resolution because it admits that new york state liquor authority currently has no ability or legal mechanism to enforce transgressions by patrons drinking in the public domain, and I hope we can also admit now, after four months experience that there won't be any enforcement mechanism under any future bill, such as the one that senator hillman has proposed.
That's why we have alcohol beverage control laws in the first place, I believe the governor's executive orders have basically gutted the abc laws, and I am opposing senator heyman's bill and in favor of the sla committee resolution, because I think that that bill would also gut the abc laws.
That's really great one more speaker and then we're going to go to gail brewer after this one public comment: hi everybody, yes, hi elizabeth here hi, I just I'll, be brief.
I think that there are other ways to secure revenue for new york state that do not involve alcohol, and I think that if we were to put this to a referendum on the ballot that most of new york city residents would agree, so at any rate, thank you so much for the clarity of your resolution, and while I appreciate that this bill right now is on ice, I would prefer the language in this particular case that it's tabled.
You know initially, and then we saw the explosion of violations of social, distancing and and people not wearing face covering so like with a lot of legislation.
What you do and what I did you introduce the bill and you get public input, you don't introduce a bill and just plow ahead, and that's not what I was trying to do, but I think, though, it's a bit of a fantasy to think that there's going to be, you know, checks from the state of new york given to struggling small businesses.
I know we're sick of it, but just a there's, a wonderful cuny census, hard to count map, and I think, you've heard that the state of new york is around 57.9.
It's not washington heights, it's the east side and board too so on july, 31 with the us census and people who have ipads from four to seven we're going to be walking around the soho community and we will make sure where we meet.
We did a huge drive-through last weekend and we got quite a few people because of the noise and the hoopla, but we could use all the suggestions, but you really are very low and it's just because people are not filling it out because they're not here, so I'm letting you know you're at the bottom of manhattan and we certainly need to get it up because you're, bringing not just you but people have left, are bringing the whole borough down number two.
I just want to respond to this mass drinking without being specific, but I sit on the governor's recovery task force along with other presidents and labor and business and the mayor's office and the speaker and the governor is pretty serious about what you're describing in terms of the drinking and the no mass that's not supposed to be happening.
I was worried last semester, 178 000 summer school kids and I believe 36 have not opened the device, so it seems to me- and you are educators on the community board and there may be principals and teachers listening, but my friend who's, the principal said that he's not sure most of his teachers are not coming back.
So I know that in the communities this is a huge issue and I I think we have to find a way to reinstate the budget.
I understand that, but to the credit of new york university and a group of solid waste advisory boards, manhattan and two other boroughs, they are doing and have raised funding for a year-long study of how to make the organics something that is able to produce revenue, and I think if the board wants to have a participation in that we would love to have your input.
It is incredibly important if you know organics now wasn't making money cost the city money et cetera, et cetera, but it's heavy and it's going right to the landfill.
Also, as you know, there's something called the ebt card and it's basically for people who get food stamps people get food, stamps people get funding in terms of public assistance and the reason I mention it is that there is now a pebt which means that every parent and every student at doe will get 420 added to their card automatically.
I know that this is an endless story, but with europe starting again in august, as we understand it and the issue affordable housing we're talking again to all the people and the groups who have been working on this issue forever and just trying to see if we can have a real, clear understanding of what is or isn't possible.
My like today, I talked about ccrb and I got oh goodness I didn't know.
So I haven't, you know, spent a lot of time on it because I have so many other issues that I'm trying to deal with, but I am somebody who generally I want to change.
We we have a resolution tonight, so cb2 will be discussing it, but we wanted to get your support for really helping to fast-track open streets or play streets for schools.
We have a lot of different ideas in our resolution, but this is one that is essentially budget neutral because you know other than staff putting an nypd barrier on there, there's obviously opportunity costs, but there is no cash outlay to open up streets adjacent to schools, to create additional space for social distancing, but we need everyone's help to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and make sure some of these things can happen by september.
We already know that ps3 ps41, cydia's school and likely 75, morton and I'm sure others have specific streets in mind.
Thank you, susan, so we're going to move on to our public session as a reminder, if you, if you want to participate, you need to write to our district manager, bob gormley by 5 p.m. If you don't we, you can always write for the following months, full board meeting, but we're not going to be recognizing any attendees without you have to email, and you can find that email on our website.
So once we receive that approval to reopen and the institution decides on its reopening date, we plan to share out our reopening plans more on those procedures or hours, exhibitions that we'll have on you and the opportunities for new yorkers to come into the museum, so I'll be in touch with the community board at that time and in the meantime, we continue to fulfill our mission by offering virtual programs I'm grateful for the board president for including in her newsletter that our summer studios program for six weeks this summer, we're offering free online classes for kids of all ages to experiment, create and learn together with at-home art materials.
The governor has stated in in unequivocal terms that patrons going to restaurants because they're all outdoor now the a patron sits in a seat at a table to dine alcoholic beverages are up to them whether they want to order one, and there is no, he said no milling around, so that pretty much cuts out having parties et cetera, et cetera just so we can all get on the guidelines because we really have to deal with this issue in the next few months.
So, if I think, if we're all clear on that and when people call into the community board, the the the law of the land is, is that right now?
I'm just saying: please support our public schools in giving them this low-cost logical tool for planning that they need, and I thank you very much for your consideration.
I'm here representing a group of community members who are are people of good heart and conscience who want to support the city's attempts to deal with the homeless crisis, but they are here to say to you one very simple message: please slow down.
I don't think that there's any chance that you would be able to squeeze 90 people plus 25 staff members in that building, even if it did get approved, but there is a way to bring the whole community together.
But the way to do that is to give people a little bit more time, more diligence, more information and make sure that it's an informed choice by this community board to approve the project and with that.
Having had the opportunity to voice what are valid serious comments, we of course are sensitive to the need for housing of the city's large homeless population, but we just don't understand why, with the city's vast inventory of buildings, it owns that it chose this small building dead center in the middle of a quiet, residential landmark street in the heart of greenwich village.
With regard to issues of community safety, public health and fire hazards, therefore, I would like to suggest that the community board delay their recommendation in order to give time for the community to fully evaluate and have input into this situation.
You sound great thanks, danielle danielle, you ready to speak okay, so we're gonna, we're gonna move on to the next speaker, which is nathaniel weiss.
No, I think what we need to do is actually yeah we're going to mute, harmon and we're going to start the timing of fresh for nathaniel.
I understand it would be unusual for community board to usher in a shelter and perhaps unprecedented in new york city history, but I think this is an opportunity we can seize for the village in downtown to show the way to do right by our distinct cultural legacy and to strengthen our community's sense of purpose by welcoming project renewal and the women it will serve.
The shelter at west 11th street we'll combine our shelter and housing expertise with employment programs to help women exit homelessness through work, we're happy to discuss programming in greater detail offline and we can share with anyone the presentation that we gave to the social services committee, which the rest of the board members have.
I spoke to bob and he told me to speak to project renewal, but right, I'm looking for a middle person to work the problems through someone with an impartial middle I'll reach across the aisle, but I want there's someone to be in the middle to kind of negotiate.
You know of this project and obviously there's some issues, but I think project renewal has given a pretty strong indication that they're willing to work through those issues with the community and certainly follow all the rules and regulations of the city and I'm looking for the middle person just to guide us all through this.
So I'm going to summarize her letter that she wrote to the community board, which is very much a lot of the points we just heard from richard and other speakers that were not in favor of this particular development at this very moment, but is welcoming of homeless, shelters and affordable housing to our neighbor and neighborhood in general.
Next to the first presbyterian church, which continues despite calls to 311 over the last eight years, amy respectfully asked that more thought and planning goes into our community's investment in project renewal and seeing no other questions that ends the public session.
Is there a motion to adopt the agenda she's distributed to all the board members good mode back end great thanks everybody.
If you could raise your hands as the attendees and we can we'll have you speak in the order that you are called all right, I'm going to start off with luke luke wolfe from the controller's office, hi, everybody lukewool from controller scott stringer's office I'll.
The first thing I want to mention is that we have an upcoming town hall with your local representatives, including state senator brad, hoyleman councilmember, coronian rivera as well as assemblymember, linda rosenthal, in it on monday july, 27th, 6, p.m, the chance to listen to and ask them questions of your local elected.
We also need to make sure our businesses know how to access that federal support on the school reopening side.
Councilmember chen has been exploring the tools to help make sure tenement buildings in chinatown little italy and the lower east side stay, affordable, housing, rent stabilized tenants, we're facing rights and operating expenses, family of small property owners and family associations have been asking for some relief, so council member chen passed legislation to help small property owners who have been affected by covet 19 at to defer their july 1 property taxes to october 15th at a reduced interest rate from the 18 percent that was originally down to 7.5 and my last second last item.
Council number 10 worked with their colleagues to make sure that funding for seniors education, health services and food pantry programs got to communities who can't afford to wait for release.
We may oh okay, okay, because I I understand some boards are not meeting in august, so I thought we're going to make that decision in the next few days and okay, let everybody know, but what we may ask is that the elected official offices not provide updates, if there's nothing of too much substance in order to allow it to be a business only meeting okay, we can move it along for all the board members in a timely manner, but that was one of my few items during my chairs report, but you you beat me to it, I'm by bringing it up thanks, anthony and next I've got tracy tracy.
So all of those hearings are available to be live streamed on the assembly website and I urge you to check the schedule which I've provided the written report or it's on the assembly website, and we encourage you to view these hearings and then finally, I know we've talked a lot about the open, dining and I just wanted to say: we've been hearing a lot of concerns about a lack of clarity, inconsistent enforcement of concerns about which city and state agencies are in charge, arbitrary decisions by inspectors about who gets a violation and who doesn't so we're working with the governor while we're talking with the governor's office and then with our city and state partners, including the borough president's team, to try to get some clarity.
So this legislation would make it so that they would have the opportunity to get that same information provided to them, but in a bigger font so that it's more understandable and then the rivington act, which is named after the rivington house in the lower east side, basically sets up a a system in which the community is informed and that the the state is able to ensure that the same resources are available if they're going to shut down something like the rivington house.
Give a couple of quick updates not to beat a dead horse about the open restaurants, but you know we've heard many of the same concerns we're actually working on a response to dot and the administration in a letter kind of talking about all the different aspects of open streets, open restaurants.
I may most importantly, a tracker so that people can identify where their absentee ballot is in the process, so they make sure they get it on time and that it's getting heard and actually counted and then finally, a quick update on a local issue.
I know there's been a lot of concerns from folks in cb2 about the bus way and the way that dot went about making that permanent we conducted a walk through a bunch of cbt residents in december, brought up a lot of improvements that we wanted made to the program street sign changes marking changes.
Some number of different people are on vacations and andrew we've already heard from from bro president brewer, so we're gonna move from that and now on to the chairs report, it's already 804, which has been quite a while since we haven't started our business session, I'm going to keep it brief next week is the census week of action as you've heard from a few people, the census is a very important is described.
As you also heard from a few people, the open restaurant program, all the various iterations has been a great success in our community board.
I think that there's been from what I've heard, not necessarily judging whether it's appropriate or not the the the violations that have been issued, but it seems that there's been some overzealous enforcement of establishments that are trying to follow the rules and have been working really hard in limited enforcement on places that are blatantly breaking the rules and that's raised a lot of issues within the restaurant community.
Well, for the people that are able to participate in it, the small number of bad actors that that I think have been very high profile and, let's see at the borough president or excuse me at the at the borough board meeting this week, there's a presentation by revel scooters which I think is going to come to us in the fall.
I mean it's, it's there's some messaging that needs to significantly be improved, but it's it's it's whatever is going on right now, it's a huge issue and it's just it's not safe, and so I think it's really on revel to improve significantly either their education, their ridership, the screening being able to track how their users are are moving around.
So what the reason that we chose them was because they had already attended community board meetings, so they were familiar with the process in which we worked, and I think that when when they first went to cv3, that was something in discussion with their district manager that she had indicated being familiar with.
I think on channel 7 abc, but what I wanted to mention and brad did give credit to corey corey johnson's office deserves a lot of credit for having that removed.
I just want to let everyone know that, like many other people, the staff are still working from home, we're trying to get work done by phone email text and zoom.
I don't know like a lot of folks, but I don't know when the staff will be coming back to the office, certainly not before a month or two ago I would have said maybe after labor day, I'm not sure, if that's even an accurate projection right now, tomorrow, at the borough service cabinet meeting department of citywide administrative services will be giving a presentation regarding reopening city offices, so I guess they'll.
Secondly, the manhattan district managers have met twice in the past month to review questions that will be submitted to that have been submitted by now to the various city agencies in advance of the budget consultation meetings in september, which is part of the the budget process that the community boards are involved with related to that is, that is our district needs statement and I've reminded or asked the the chairs, as they do every year, to take a look at the district needs statement, particularly with regard to the areas of concern or areas that their their their committees oversee.
But I was I wanted to extend that to all the board members, and especially the new board members, and take a look at that statement, also with an eye to the committees that you serve on, but also, if you can, if you see anything that looks out data that needs to be changed or added, you should let let your chairs know so that we can.
We restored hundreds of millions of dollars, 700 million dollars in cuts from the mayor's proposed executive budget, to education, to social service, to mental health, to seniors to all the things that we care about, and it's going to help countless people.
I've been working, and I know my team has around the clock on trying to help gene's restaurant and I got on the phone with the mayor personally last week and made the case of how we needed to help them.
Of course, we want the community board to participate to try to help prevent some of the rampant, rodent infestations that we've seen in some of the local parks and on the side streets.
So there's a lot more, I could talk about, but I just wanted to give you some highlights of some of the things that we've been working on and some of the things we're able to do in the budget and, as always, I'm on cb2 for your leadership during these hard times and your partnership with my office to continue to work on behalf of the residents in community board 2 and for the small businesses.
Thanks corey, I I wanted to really thank you for for for jane street, really working on that we've been discussing sort of some of the inequity for a lot of restaurants and that's a case in point.
So if I could just ask people if they've got just brief, one-sensing questions that would be great georgia, it's more of a comment, I guess, or a request, in the same way that we're going to bat for small businesses and open streets.
You mean, I won't speak about it for too long, so we can have more questions, but you know there have been a bunch of interesting proposals about trying to do some of the teaching outdoors depending on the location of the school for some of the older students.
As you know, rat ice is incredibly effective and yet the parks department, as at least as of last year, was limited in its use of it, because in order to get rat ice, it had to spend an entire day going out to the one distributor in brooklyn or the queens and getting it, and I asked even mitchell silver why they couldn't make the rat ice come to new york because I'm sure it's a pretty big contract, and I I was given a quizzical look, so that might be something to explore as you look at the rat infestation.
You got a big commendation from andy slavitt, the other day for being well ahead of the curve and calling out the seriousness of covid and and screaming, and shouting trying to bring people's attention to it earlier on this year, but now that we're several months into it, I wanted to ask you to comment just on some of the threats that the trump administration has come up with in terms of sending in federal troops into cities, including new york.
Great thanks and I think I'm beau we've got one more question from beau ricobono yeah hi, corey hi.
I'm just wondering I mean we all know how things work in new york.
Critical, I think, to the school's reopening is the uft's position, which of course, you know, and I'm just wondering if you could share any of your.
You could have staggered schedules, you could have the the adults wear masks in the schools, you could have the janitorial staff and I think their opinion is the uft's opinion is that the doe and the mayor's office have not really done what they need to do to create that type of plan to give people the peace of mind that there would be a safe possibility of of reopening.
I mean, I think, the we have not seen fatalities amongst children- very, very few, not just here in new york but around the world in the united states, but we do know that children can pass kovid to each other and to adults, and so, if you're going to ask teachers and and staff to go in, you need to make sure that you have a plan and then you need to make sure you have to be concerned about if kids can bring it home, what does that mean for their parents or grandparents?
That's I mean we all know, that's the critical thing and I I doubt the schools are going to open, that's just sorry to say, but thanks corey.
So you know no one, I think, has started to sort of plot that out we're kind of looking at the other type of industries and seeing if we have a secondary spike in infections over the next many months and that's what will determine some of the the the other things that are gonna impact.
How we have these broader discussions thanks, okay sandy, you got one brief question.
You have to wear a mask, but if people aren't doing it, you know, I think we kind of have to use some peer pressure a little bit on folks I mean luckily- and I don't want to jinx us.
We need to make sure we keep doing well and the best way to do that is to socially distance and continue to wear masks thanks.
It does look like we are going to have a a brief and what we're full board meeting in august we're going to try and make it a business only session.
There are a few items it's looking like it will will confirm it next week, but it it should be the same second to last thursday of the month, which would be august 20th, but we'll let you know as we move forward.
Okay, so we're going to move into our first standing committee report, janine kyleigh for schools and education committee hi good evening.
The second resolution is in support of immediate solutions to reduce the digital divide by fall, 2020 for new york city public school students, and this has been identified by many advocates as one of the most important equity issues.
Our third resolution is in support of new york, university and trinity, real estate commitments to new york city for the bleeker school in hudson square, school and public recreation space and therefore be it resolve that community board 2 urges our elected officials, new york, university and the department of education to ensure that the bleeker school option is exercised and continue to explore the possibility of creating a doe public school program for dyslexic students at the bleeker school site.
Okay, but the footnotes are, are are plentiful and and it's great thanks janine- is there any unwillingness to move these three items into the omnibus vote?
The three resolutions we're moving them into the omnibus vote, which so we're gonna do a roll call at the end of the end of the meeting, unless somebody'd like to call it out was that was that was that rich yeah?
Is that possible just for our records, as opposed to going through all the names yeah, okay, great and so moving on to our next committee is land houston housing committee federico hi everybody good evening.
And yesterday, at the end of the day, we got a letter from the developer offering to explore our suggestion that would allow customers to enter the cafe area from the plaza rather than directly through the restaurant, and they were willing to explore the feasibility of a walk-up window that would a restaurant and they were willing to explore the feasibility of a walk-up window that would allow the public to purchase items directly from the plaza and a brief canvas of the committee members didn't change any minds about our decision to deny great thanks, federica.
The committee heard a bunch of additional people coming in against it, just like they had the first time we thought of ways to to provide suggestions to see ways in which it could work.
Yes, it's a very good resolution and definitely, I think, captures much more of what the sentiment was at the last full board meeting.
You've got your hand up first, okay, thank you for an excellent report and I'm just seeking a little clarification.
So am I correct in saying that there is no formal action by any city agency that will come before this community board for approval that everything that we're doing here is for information of the board and to indicate the support of the board for this project.
So my question is: how do you feel about that susanna and do you think, perhaps that the resolution should encourage more dialogue between the neighbors and project renewal before going ahead?
The discussion doesn't include the community board where you know again we're weighing in on this, because we want to support this project and we want to outline the concerns and that's what the resolution right.
I mean the process itself is going to take time, and actually I think it was pretty good that dss pushed us to have this meeting to me.
I mean a lot of these are the mechanics of the operation of the facility, and you know if the city is approving the safety.
Thank you also for that great resolution and, more importantly, for the report and the support.
So I just sort of reject that as sort of a reason to oppose this, and I think there's we have an applicant who's really interested in working with the community, and I also want to call the question since I don't unless there's other questions, but I don't see any, I don't.
Okay, I'm not seeing any any any objection to moving this into the omnibus vote, so we're gonna move the resolution from the social services committee into the omnibus vote.
That was unanimous, and I will read that okay resolve that cb2 requests that mta in new york city transit, restore 24 7 service as soon as it is safe to do so.
I guess I was just thinking that, since that is, I use the buses a lot now and- and I don't know, if seven means it's still like in your I'm- trying to sort of see how that might be woven in since it does seem to be an important facet of preparing whether or not one is going to go on a bus.
Just you know just tell us what you want and sure I'm just simply saying it's out there.
This is kind of telling mta what we'd like them to do, what to consider a chirp so just to clarify what robin's point so that the app provides the information, but it doesn't limit the occupancy, and so the information is so that your gives you the choice of whether you want to board or not based on how crowded the bus is, but they haven't determined an occupant, a safe occupancy right on the bus, no right, okay, so that just I think, the more I think about it, robin we're asking mta new york city transit to do certain actions.
I think I think I mean just if I'm hearing robin wright she doesn't know when too many people are on the bus because they haven't determined what a socially distanced maximum occupancy is, so that if you were threat, you know, if you had some health issue, that you really didn't want to get on it.
Okay, would you like to phrase that in that way, I understand what you're saying carter, in other words, a request to mta new york city transit, to determine what the safe number of occupancies or save social distancing right right?
Otherwise, it's yes carter is not asking them for the right thing, but yeah asking them for to try to estimate what the safe capacity is, your social distance intervention and it would be translated in the app since they have it and people use it.
Yes, I I I if, if, if you're going to vote against something you can't be in the omnibus right, I mean if you need to vote differently on it than you would otherwise, and we will.
We will allow okay, but we're just trying to enough the roll call votes because of the amount of time that it takes, but thank you allow you just keep track of which one.
I don't see any objections, so we'll move those three items into the omnibus vote and now we're moving on to the last committee report, which is landmarks and public aesthetics, chanel spence.
The fire escape thing only happened after the meeting, so that the resolution is a point of information that they later did what we asked to be done in the second recommendation.
Okay, so we have items one through four and I see that I've got a handout from beau who, I think, is going to address the issue of calling out the first one.
I need you to unmute yourself, yeah, sorry, thanks carter, the the 351 canal canal and worcester street.
It's an absolutely stunning building of tremendous architectural significance, and you know I understand why they want to remove the fire escapes two things on worcester street the fire escapes had been in scotl installed in the 70s.
It just is on two of them and I think it it's it's an important important characteristic of soho buildings to have certain fire escapes remain, so I don't know how china wants to handle this and how parliamentary procedure would dictate that we do this, but I I'm suggesting that we allow the removal of the worcester street fire escapes but maintain the canal street small fire escape.
We've got a number of people who want to speak on this bob ely yeah.
I think we should hear from a few more people hold on I'm just okay.
Well, I I I think I hear three different things that are going on here right now.
Are you willing to accept one or the other or if you are not, then I think you need to let us know so we can move on.
I think that people have heard that I mean I'm letting them hear it again.
The fire escapes require a lot of maintenance and yes, they're they're kind of sentimental, but on a street like this, I think it's lost and I must say I I really enjoy seeing the building without it.
Okay, so I don't see any seconds all right now, susan now I just wanted to say very quickly.
If you want to substitute or say we move one okay, so no, if you want to put a substitute, is that what you're suggesting as a substitute resolution or we vote on what the committee recommended, I think we can vote on what the committee recommended, because that's what we're debating, which is removing both of them right, we can vote yes or no to that, got it all right.
So the resolution that chanel that was voted 6-2 at the committee level was that that the board recommends approving removal of both fire escapes.
Yes, I I just got it and then, and that's because you're a member there is that correct, yeah, exactly great jim, all right!
