Is the presenter here going to the goldfish I, don't see them arriving as of yet we do have the person from the Census Bureau here, if you'd like to go in that direction and start that way.
There is the drying area, the changing Hut's for the children to change after the lessons, and maybe if you just want to go to the photo, then so you get a better idea of what the swim school will look like these photos are taken or another.
Excuse me for students to one instructor, there's always lifeguards on duty, as you can imagine, that's very important, and if that I'll, just so the Swim School that you're looking at here, like I said, is it is in Farmingdale in Long Island's.
Yes, the it is handicap accessible pursuant to code were required to provide a lift, an ad, a lift which will allow anybody who needs that to have access to the pool, and will that so then the entrances is a code compliant for, as for a new use right, yes, so in actuality, the envelope of the building is being renovated.
Currently, by the landlord and as a part of that renovation, they will be providing a an ad, a accessible handicap ramp along 34th Street, which is a main entrance to the Swim, School and 88 bathrooms, and all the ADA requirements as if it was a new use correct.
The only thing that happens, on-site every single day is arraignments and most of the executive staff and Chiefs are on site, but we do the arraignments on site because if anything goes wrong, we want to make sure that people's rights to an Iranian more than 24 hours are never violated.
So, please, you know I just want to thank everyone for the work that they have been doing.
It is just so important for us to get the funds we need for education, but that's not why you had me on the call so I'm just going to say thank you for all the work that you are doing and please we are here, follow us on Queen, CA cats on Facebook Twitter and keep in touch with us.
We actually came out from the protests which we also dismissed so at the end of the day, I'm happy to talk to the 114 and see if there was any reports that we should know about, but that's how we handled it.
Secondly, when people actually are arrested and brought in, can you tell us what kind of social distancing and sanitation procedures are being used as they're processed and, if they're being held, you know for hearing or something like that, because we do know that right now, the Kovach spread is very dangerous in places where people are held in close confinement.
So you know the interesting thing about running many offices in my life and in my past life is that we actually saw this coming very early, so we started realizing that grand jurors we're not showing up a lot earlier than a lot of people realized it.
So if they were sentenced to six months- and they did five months- you know- and it wasn't violent crimes or sexual abuse crimes that we redid time served so that they could social distance better and then there was about 120 or so there were parole violators and if they weren't offenses that we would prosecute for or prevail on, we said we have no objection to letting them out so I think.
There was such anger in the streets of the United States I mean you know so immediately with George Floyd I think it brought out a lot of past inequities in the system and I've been very clear about it.
We have to get younger people out of the system to make sure that we are training police officers to approach people in a better manner to make sure that across the country they realize the system hasn't been very fair and it's been a lot of inequities across the board and I think the one thing that is amazing about all these protests that happen is number one I think you're going to see a lot of good changes in the system, while still making sure we're prosecuting.
You know we need to make sure that we keep our streets safe, but at the end of the day, I would argue that trying to get people out of the system and trying to do pretrial, diversions and teaching and cure violence and drug rehabilitation, and all of that, when we hell is probably going to keep people safer than they ever did before.
Good question I have a question: yeah I got time for two more I'm, just letting you know, yeah I wanted to ask about the hate crimes Bureau and does the hate crimes Bureau deal with issues relating to crimes perpetrated against people with disabilities and if it does, how are you out reaching to organizations for people with disabilities to let them know that I think we should do that more so, whether or not they attack you because of your disability and I.
Okay, this is Richard cuz I mean how you doing Melinda very good one question: what's the DA's position, the quality of life issues particularly having to do with outdoor dining and alcohol being served outside and some of the rowdy isn't that we've been singing and also I'd, like your take on why it sees many of the demonstrations that have been happening in Queens have been pretty violence free compared to the other boroughs.
But I do know that when we had issues we were able to call up people straight away and say what's going on out there and how can we help and I do think that camaraderie is somewhat helpful at the end of the day, but I can't tell you that's the reason.
So thanks for the time and Murray I will go Murray just so you know in Florence there will be someone at your community board from the DA's office every month, so we will now have a representative there to take back any constituent issues or anything that we can be helpful with, or even if you just need information on a case or something like that, we're happy to help within the purview of how we can it's cats at Queens da dot org.
Sorry I'm miss Botti movie presenting the Crescent speed protected bike lanes.
Everyone we were happy to be here tonight, share our proposal for the Crescent Street protected bike lanes.
It should take about 20 minutes I'd like to hold our questions until the end, we're going to share some of the background on why we're proposing this route and some of the details on what the project looks like how it would work.
Why that's the case, protected bike lanes can help to calm traffic, shorten the crossing distance for pedestrians and calm the turning vehicles with some of those painted markings that you see with the islands.
The pink lines are the shared lanes or sharrows, which are helpful for connecting different bicycle routes together and the dark green lines are the protected bike lanes.
There are some streets that don't continue all the way through some destinations that are just tough to get to so our next step in building off the network is bringing a protected bike lane to the middle of the neighborhood and also building out some additional connections.
This workshop in February vast majority were residents of the district, and some of the themes that we heard from participants were an overwhelming support for a bike lane that connected the RFK and Queensborough bridge together this bridge to bridge connection specifically on Crescent Street.
There are a lot of questions about how this would work in front of their building and so we're continuing to meet with them and discuss how the design would function at their location.
In addition to this broad overview of where people want to connect to and what these routes would be, we talked about two different design concepts for a north-south protected bike lane.
Some of the reasons why or that this is a simpler or more standard and that we can implement when a quicker time frames it's less resource-intensive, whereas 31st Street involves significant, concrete construction for singles, like boarding islands.
So this map shows how a conventional bike route network and a protected lane along Crescent Street would fit together.
Those are simple bike lanes that do not change the travel lanes or the parking lanes just very straightforward, and this would complement a Crescent Street protected path.
If you're writing stops on Crescent Street, it links you directly to the Queensboro Bridge, which is the main access point into Manhattan for cyclists in this area.
So recently, d-o-t has been introducing temporary bicycle routes throughout different neighborhoods in the city to provide quick, short-term transportation options for this time, when it's challenging for some people to travel by subway and bus when those options are limited and we do expect to see more people continuing to ride as this goes on, it allows for people to social distance.
Essentially, it involves either repurposing a parking lane or a travel lane into the to a bike lane, and so, as I mentioned so far, the barrel lane is in place between Queens Plaza North to 34th Avenue, the first block.
We use the additional travel lane on the east side, that's repurposed into the bike lane and then the majority of the project is the green line on the map from 38th up to 34th Avenue, where the parking Lane has stripped it off from the curb in place of that second travelling.
So the project route of Crescent Street is located in a vision, zero priority corridor, which means that it has a relatively higher rate of crashes involving pedestrians, and so this is a high crash corridor with nine people killed or severely injured over a five year period.
Well, we have the data to prove that these types of designs that we're proposing tonight and that we've installed previously over the years, how that trend of 15% injury reduction, so the majority of our project proposal includes a parking protected bike lane and before we show this.
So it creates a new transportation connection at a really important time, as I mentioned earlier, that we expect to see a lot more people starting to ride as their main transportation choice.
So going through the different project segments will go back by block these sections are broken down based on the existing conditions of the street, so we're gonna start at the southern end and we'll work our way toward the north.
As many of you know a lot of times, people will use that third right turn lane to kind of jump ahead of the other cars, and then there are three lanes merging together into the intersection.
We are introducing a second lane in the performance condition along the West curb so with these two blocks combined in the proposed condition, it actually creates more consistency from block to block from blocks have two travel lanes as well as the bike lane, and this should also take some pressure off of what some drivers do when they block the box and things like that.
Currently, there is one traveling with a person layin on each curb our proposed condition: repurposes the parking lane on the east curb to the to a bike path.
The next segment is the largest portion of this project, and this is that parking protected bike lane design we talked about earlier.
We did look at the traffic volumes and turning movements and so at key locations where we saw that there is more traffic along this stretch, we're planning to introduce some right turn lanes, leading up to the intersections, as well as some rush hour regulations on the west side to alleviate places that have a little bit more traffic.
So throughout the city, when we've installed protected bike lanes at unique locations such as hospitals, health, centers schools, hotels that have some different unloading and loading needs for passengers, we use special.
So, when does redesigning the street to include the parking protected bike lane, it allows for an opportunity to introduce pedestrian benefits at the circles that you see on the map in orange.
If that vehicle were turning right, they would have much better visibility and be slowed down in advance and be able to see that person crossing with a stroller, as well as the cyclists traveling through the intersection, so something that really cleans up the intersection, but also allows for an area for vehicles to queue as they wait down at Queens.
A lot of different sections and I just wanted to give you an overview of how our proposal actually really breaks down into two different design types for the bike lane.
There's some extra flexibility where you know a vehicle could pull over to drop someone off without blocking the traveling, but without encroaching on a bike lane as well.
At this time, I'd like to open up to questions I have a question is he's on his way in to turn up yet ok, yeah I have a question about inclement weather, snow ice, sleet things like that on the lanes that have the vertical elements between them and the debt and the curb will a snow plow be able to get in there.
My question is in sections: they need to be protected, the same way the actual streets are and it's you know.
You know I've seen some of them on Second Avenue in Manhattan places like that, but I think that at this point, since bicycles are going to become such a large part of our transport community for the foreseeable future, I think we start.
So one of the reasons why the bike lane is along the east side of Crescent Street is oh, that turns the left turns which would run across the path or actually a lot lighter, even on the other side of the street.
The reason why we are proposing this bike lane is to make it safer for cyclists, and obviously you know where we do put these protected lanes down.
We use in-house crews, it's part of our business as usual' expenses, but what we've really found and I think what New Yorkers really appreciate and what our city needs are safer streets and especially in the time of kovat, where some folks are still trying to figure out how they're going to get to school to their families to work.
A north-south connection is going to provide a reliable, safer transportation option for the folks in Queens, and particularly in your community board.
The there's a pop-up lane now for Crescent Street, which is intended to help us during Kovach, because biking has increased it's very obvious visually, as you're driving as you're walking, there's more cyclists using the Queensboro Bridge to get to Manhattan, that's not being very well maintained and I'm wondering who responsible for its maintenance and how often is being checked in on.
It's not always ideal in the way that it's set up right now, but it has given us a chance to see a lot of different curb uses that we can accommodate and design interventions to include with the more standard proposal, so in some way, as we've been able to really test out the new layout as well.
I know there are a few people from our bike unit that are also tasked with going out once a week.
What - will vehicles, and there are dozens of different vehicles- are actually authorized to ride in the bike lane I mean I mentioned one like a Hoover crafts allowed to ride in them or segways allowed to ride in them.
What I can say is things like and if anyone you know is a rebel or I've heard, other people call it rebel the mopeds, those are not supposed to be in bike waves.
No sir just seems like any powered wheel vehicle it's being used as a bike lane and there are pedal, assists no I know that I'm saying I'm going extreme you're saying with uber craft and segways and the scooter the electric skateboard you skateboard.
You know sorry give way to two vehicles going straight: can we educate the community so that everybody, so that interface of bicycles and automobiles and an interface of pedestrians, is more, is more managed and the role the rules are?
You know again reiterate that I think that 31st Avenue is an appropriate, east-west connection, again appreciate all the hard work that Tod is put into to the Crescent Street working.
I think it's ending next week, I'm not sure I have to double-check, but when that does get lifted like the mayor did that a couple of weeks ago, just so that the Sanitation trucks could get in when we sent our crews out and we've sent them out several times to Crescent Street, we can't get to all of them like in the parking lane, or you know, people as they were when meeting to the temporary bike lane.
Okay, I have a question from a public member here, Marie one second Marie, yes, I never got to answer to the car education course in the Dominic answer.
In a long time, but we do have campaigns specifically focused for drivers to slow their turns to five miles per hour, so I know that there are posters in several places throughout the city, so there is kind of that type of touch point with the general public.
Actually I just wanted to bring out to the larger group a couple of the smaller details we discussed on the transit committee meeting about this presentation, notably Helen I, believe brought up the kind of sewer grates that the bike lane will be running through which are not too good for bicycles, and we also discussed the creation of a bicycle lens traffic signal at Queens Plaza to protect bicyclists as they make that right turn across the two lanes of traffic toward the bridge, Helen or Dominic.
Have you guys dressed the issue of people using wheelchairs, powered or manual travelling in the bike lane quite often which a users would rather ride in the street?
The VTL, the vehicle traffic law I think how it's how it is written, says that you know my clans are for bikes, but obviously there's been change.
I don't know if NYPD has a position on that I would be interested to see if someone in an electric wheelchair has ever been summonsed, because you know people need to have an accessible way to get from point A to point B I'm, not the authority on that and I'm gonna have to take that back to legal and I can consult with NYPD yeah, just a little more on that and that people with powered wheelchairs, where there is no bike lane on just a regular old-fashioned Road.
But if they're in a protected bike, lane and bikes want to come behind them or whatever there's going to be a traffic jam in there.
And so you know that's why my question is here: he's on chat and he says wheelchairs can use the bike lane using bikes I'm.
Just passing that on okay pleased to meet you the question from the public, if you don't mind, Commissioner or whoever, why is the lane on the east side when the connection to the borough, protective Lane is on the west side of precedent?
Gonna read another question: if that is okay from the public, much of the city has a huge problem regarding vehicles, parking and bike lanes.
So with this section, where we have one traveling, it is important to provide the ability for an emergency vehicle to pass through that bike lane and for sweeping and sanitation as well.
One thing that we are, including with this proposal is there, are a few locations where we're updating some of the regulations on the West curb which can be used as a quick pull over spot for delivery instead of blocking a bike lane, so we're taking a close look at the regulations to make sure there's a little bit of wiggle room to prevent some of that behavior.
His email says: please make a permanent protected bike lane on Crescent.
I am writing in support of the bike lanes being planned for Crescent Street between the Triborough and the Queensboro Bridge.
Too. I go out of my way to avoid using Crescent Street when biking with my children, because of its danger now I can safely bike them down to LIC without having to add an extra mile to the route or biking through industrial areas near 21st, Street I can't wait for this bike lane to be implemented.
Let's say this: one is from Gabriel Torres and he writes resident of the area for 28 years and I've been dreaming of this day, since, thank you so much for putting these in finally definitely need some more bike parking stations in Astoria as well.
It would be it would really help along the Crescent Street bike lane with all the supermarkets and such again.
Crescent Street is the ideal location, because it's the only direct route for people living north of 34th Avenue I'm, also hopeful that the addition of the bike lane will help slow traffic on the street, making it safer for pedestrians, okay, I have four more also.
The first is from Jennifer chocolate party and as a longtime, Astoria resident mother and frequent bicyclist I'm excited to learn that a permanent Crescent Street two-way, protected bike lane is in the works, especially since the temporary one is an absolute deathtrap.
Members I would like to say that the recent bike lane has been an absolute, absolutely terrific and welcome addition to Astoria.
Lastly, I would like to say that, with everything that is happening during Colvard 19 I am looking for new ways to travel, to and from work while having to enter a crowded, subway I, generally love taking public transit, but will be limiting my commute in order to reduce the chances of coming into contact with the virus.
I would like to thank you for your work and helping implement this bike lane.
We currently have partial bike lanes on 29th and 28th streets allowing for bike travel to and from the Queensboro Bridge, but they are neither adequately maintained or protected when traffic increases drivers often take their road rage and careless habits out on law-abiding bicyclists I have seen it and suffered from it several times.
A protected bike lane on Crescent would increase safety and traffic flow for commuting, astoria LIC cyclists tremendously and serve our community well, I'm, Scott, Phillips and last.
One I write to express my support for and encourage you to vote in favor of their proposed bike lanes over Crescent Street Astoria.
Having a designated bike length lane for bikes is crucial to protect the safety of our districts residents according to the Department of Transportation creston Crescent Street is a vision, zero priority area, meaning that it is an area in which at least nine persons have been killed or severely injured.
In addition to improving the safety of our community bike lanes will promote participation in physical activity and support cyclists, who are of all ages.
They voted unanimously in support of the question street bike lane with the stipulation the duty would accommodate any specific matters or issues raised by the community board office in regards to the finalization of this plan.
No okay, unanimous, thank you so much ADOT and Tom for stepping up and all the board members for their input and the public.
Yes, thank you very much chairman and also district manager and over the board member yo.
Now. Having said that, the committee board one area, Astoria older storia, Woodside and parts of Long Island City- is currently yet 52.7%, so your district is certainly doing well for that matter.
That's one to save us a lot of time and, of course, money also I wanted to let you know that we do have a self-response rate map that is available to the public by visiting the 2020 census, gov, where you could look at your community.
So my message to you is very simple: today: you understand your community are the people and their priorities and their needs, and you know how effectively deliver the senseless message to them in ways that Census Bureau can never cheat.
So if anyone has a know of a space where we can hold training for our numerators as we start to bring them on board that you can reach out to Florence and get furnace, it's okay, if you don't mind that they can give, my number out is nine one, seven, three, four, eight nine one, eight one is where we're looking for a space where we couldn't get so allows us to be able to do some training, and they can go through me for that side.
Everyone, Thank, You, Marie you're, welcome, okay, Joseph, hey folks, thank you, madam chair Thank, You Florence and all board members hope you're, all well and safe quickly.
Lastly, as we continue to work remotely- and it's unclear when we'll be back in the office, continue to call us or email us with any questions or concerns that you are the community members may have.
So, just you know, leave a message and we'll get back to you by the end of the day other than that I wish you all great health and welcome to all of the new community board members I'm, looking forward to speaking with you all speaking with you all and working with you all much more closely.
You have all of you together here that I'm introducing of you, the good people that had been working for the community long time and it's my pleasure to be with you, and it has been excellent, that the thing that you've been doing the bike, land and I saw the board work on the ferry ride and all of those things that, when I'm being couple of meeting before so it's just I'm very excited to work with all of you and we will together will make better storia and queens and I look forward to in-person, see all of you.
Actually thank you and thank you for being here and we look forward to one day being able to meet personally as well: Marie yeah, very big Irene from sending the generic office just trying to get in okay, hey guys, Irene.
So that is a great thing and I'm going to ask Lawrence could send out information Florence on this to all our board members, so we can pass it on and get the word out there.
They have to report to the community board when there's a transfer of ownership of more than 80 percent of the business here, there's going to be a hundred percent transfer of ownership to a completely new owner of the applicant entity, les amis Cafe Inc. Now the business is not currently open from what we understand and the committee has been told by the new owner that it was actually closed since February.
Yes, I am I had to unmute myself, okay, so the item on the agenda we have for tonight for land use is, you should have received a report in by email prior to the meeting, which explained the public hearing item the goldfish Swim School thoroughly and also another item that we discussed at the G.
I would just like to let the board know that the Land Use Committee is meeting on July 1st, the first for all of us, but to meet in July, but we have some items to become informed about, for that will be, will be handling in the fall and winter I just want to wish everybody a nice summer and enjoy it, and I will talk to my Committee on the first.
The work she helps start should not stop our Executive Board as well as any of us who desire should continue to push for structure, clear definition of roles and responsibilities with the district office and, in particular, the district manager and ways to improve our engagement and outreach to the community through stronger communication strategies.
Thank you and I add something this is Katie Elmen miss Katie I want to also welcome all the new board members.
I want to publicly thank Nancy for mentoring me when I started on the boards and welcomed me as her Vice Chair for the parks, rec and Cultural Affairs Committee I also would like to understand- and maybe there's not time now- and this is something we can work on over the summer- how and really just try to drive home the point that we need to have transparency, if we're all volunteers and we all care about our community.
Thank you, I'd like to welcome the new board members.
So much I also like Tom, welcome all the new board members and I look forward to on game which, together with everyone we get a chance, say hello to my granddaughter.
Kazami I'm, again also want to thank all the new board members for coming aboard.
It also requires you get to know the bylaws of this board and the rules inside open meeting law of the city of New York and that you ensure these rules are followed if they're not funded with a copy of the bylaws.
You are committed to whatever power you think, being a Seabee member brings to board members who do the hard work of serving our community by ensuring fairness and transparency and who get to know the issues in the action.
Thank you I, hope you'll reach out to the new members and mentor them in order to serve the community.
This board needs the support of staff, requires a district manager who is competent and committed to allowing board members to do the work not getting in their way ages.
Amy Thank, You, Marie I just wanted to reach out and say you know through these time, trying times that the communities of color it's dealing with.
