We're gonna try to follow as normal as possible the board meetings that we normally do so, in other words, the public galleries we're starting a little bit late, but I would still like to at least a lot a couple of minutes, maybe 10 to 15 for a public gallery session and then we're going to follow the agenda as follow.
Hopefully we will, but you know, madam secretary call the roll and we could see who's on who's, not so this may be for information only, but nonetheless, like I said I just appreciate all of you actually attending this meeting.
So with that being said, I'm going to actually do one thing before we actually begin the meeting, which is something that we always do at community board meetings.
If you use a chat function, if there's something that you want to say, then just let me know, I can unmute you and then you can address the body as well.
Really don't want to do that so I'm, hoping that for those community members that do want to have something to say to the body that we want to welcome you to say that, and so with that being said, I'd like to open this up for community speaks okay, so I did not see anybody for whom you speak so up miss Johnson.
Do you like it yeah, okay, so I, don't know how we came to be the worst two ZIP codes in the city.
Okay, so I hearing them seeing none so normally we would take a motion to close community speaks, but since we were doing this, virtually I would like to think that the board would give me the authority to close community speak so and I need to get my gavel so community speaks is now closed.
It's still a big issue, but it's easing off because the state is doing much better than they were, but questions relating to nursing homes, I think we all know- and there are a lot of nursing homes or twelve nursing homes are probably the worst place.
People have meetings like this nobody's having you know normal meetings right now, mrs.
But if you are a member say of 1199 you're in you know in the health care area, if you are in the TWU you're going out to work every day, so that alone increases the odds of something testing positive and it's unfortunate.
But the people who are doing that these are the looking are city running so I for one am very grateful to all of them, and one of the things that I think we have to deal with now, but deal with over the long term is the fact that there is obviously tremendous disparity based on ethnicity based on race and also based on gender, by the way in terms of who's susceptible to catching the virus, who is more likely to die from it or what the underlying conditions are to make.
But I just want to thank everybody for the work you do in the community, especially now it it's really making difference, making a difference in a lot of people's life.
I had a question, if you mind regarding the budget, if you don't mind telling the board and the community at large what transpired, with the budget that just passed and what could we look forward to in the coming days?
Okay, you're off to stay home anymore, I like to go to you know to Yankee games and yes, bets games.
They had a testing site Oh, a basically a bridge, table I, think or a table set up in front of one of the supermarkets in my district earlier in the week, and they were testing the antibodies, but it was being done randomly because they want to get an idea of how many people probably have the antibodies, because that will give scientists and the medical very important information that they know that they they need to know.
Okay, thank so what I'm gonna do is open it up to the board members about.
Maybe, hopefully you can give one or two questions in to the Assemblyman and then we're gonna move on so because there are some other elected officials are the representatives that are here so for any board members.
So if people could kind of mute themselves and then unmute when you're ready to talk, if you can, you can figure out how to figure out that about logistically I mean that's just one thing you write, miss Bennett, I, think most of the people who meet what I did was.
Okay, mister dinner, I just want to say that I appreciate you getting on the call and being on this with us right now in in terms of giving us an update, an update about what's going on and how things are going on.
So I'll also put that information in the chat box, so people can sign up if they choose to and and get any information that they need and if there's anything else or any other concerns that any community board members have or any constituents have -, please don't hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.
So we yesterday was our first dated meeting with all of the council members that was actually pretty extraordinary sort of like we're doing now on and there's a ton of bills that the City Council has introduced yesterday, just to bring some relief to different different communities.
Different freelance workers on you know just certain things that needed to get introduced during this dated and hopefully passed within the next few weeks, to make sure that we bring some kind of relief to all different kinds of communities and I'll be more than happy to also send a link with just a summary of those as well, because it was quite a few okay, okay.
Thank you very, very much and again, you know we welcome you board members I'm looking for any hands.
Does anybody have any questions and again you can either pose it in the chat or I'm not trying to scan to see if I see any hands that are raised from board members and I do not so hearing that seeing none we'll move forward.
So next on the agenda is the Bronx borough president support, so is a miss Ruiz on it because I'm looking to see if I see Alexa on here and I, don't know if she made it and so I'm gonna ask mr.
Can yeah I just you know, I know background on the phone, so you know, while we're talking we're muting and celexa time, unmuting the phones at a certain point, at a certain absolute light right now, Miss Louise is gonna, give them or from the breath net yeah Avenue to all the phones, because, what's happened is a lot of reverb phones?
Let me ask this question: does the borough president have any discretionary funds or that maybe he can contribute to testing what community residents cuz I know we're gonna have a guest presenter.
We wanted a little bit but I think that was one of the in all the meetings that I've been in one of the things that we've been hearing about is testing testing testing, in particular, how it hits communities of college.
The Senate has been busy around the district holding virtual town halls, I think she's been trying to connect with district district, manage his community boards.
Also, we want to test the telephonic capabilities to see whether or not this is something that we could do in the future, and it just so happened that two things that I was happy about a the amount of people that were either on the call or try to get on the car, because we had some technical difficulties but, more importantly, it wound up going from a welfare check to board.
Some updates, as some things that had transpired since the February meeting, then akin technology creeped in this ugly head or so exact cutoff, and so we'll talk about some of those things I'm just evening a little bit further along in the agenda, I want to say after after our guest speaker next, of course, everybody's been doing everything virtually so again, you heard from mrs.
Johnson's meeting so I, like you, know, thank her for her leadership on the sports ever precinct council.
We did our first virtual meeting with the Economic Development Committee, in which miss Benitez led that meeting in which, when she was a pretty good meeting in which we talked about ways in which we can really uplift White Plains Road corridor in particular, and so I think a lot of resources that she'd made available and had on that meeting, discuss that, and so that's something that that they're working on a little bit earlier in the month I had a conference call with mrs.
You know lead and get back to the board have somewhat of a homework assignment, to figure out how to do some things and then get back to us, and so I want to spend a lot of time on that, because again, I think mrs.
bond wants to you know we were about making up lifting her and making sure that she gets that done, and so I want to thank her for leading her very first meeting and her first thing, the community board.
I'm you know we learned quite a bit and so again what I'm gonna hope happens is that they produce a report because, as you know, that's one of the things that we're going to talk about a little bit later on is being accountable.
Q. What members, because I think knowing what they know, what happens when each committee always helps us to be a better board, but one of the things that came out of that, of course, was mental health of not only the students but as a teachers as well and our resources, which hopefully we can talk about a little bit later on this evening and so again, wanna label 2.2 much longer, but I just want to again just share my report with you and then what I like to do now is to keep one moving on the agenda and ask our wonderful district manager.
Mr. George Torres, to you know sure I really don't have a report other than to it looks really good to see all of you I miss you all I hope all of you are taking care.
So you know we'll need to work with all of our elected officials and community members, because it is really really gonna be hard.
As I look at the agenda, we need to vote on committee recommendations, but really, since we didn't really have our committees meet like, we normally do, and really only three or four committees met and really no recommendations came out of there we're going to move right along to the next item of the agenda, which of course is approval of the board minutes, and you know due to the nature of the virus.
Some of its technical but I think it will help not only board members, but the community see how covert 19 is transmitted in a lot of the biology that goes behind code 19 and then what we can do to help ourselves be this toggling virus.
So that means we're just trucking right along here, so we want to go into old business and want to talk about committee structure right, quick and soul and I'm not gonna share my screen with you just yet, but I want to talk about committee structure and in vice-chairman, so we have the nice thing about what we've been able to do recently is that we've been able to appoint vice-chairman to our committees and the reason that this is important is because, if, for instance, if we have an executive committee meeting or if we have some sort of meeting in the chair, man at a chairwoman isn't able to attend, then we have somebody that will be able to attend on their behalf and be able to represent us as a community board and be able to give pertinent information to whatever agencies that we need to meet with.
So for many of you that are where we had a meeting with them back in February, I want to say February the 25th or 24 the 25th, and so we had a meeting with them and we discussed that I'm, not only an executive committee, but we expressed also talked about that at the full board meeting and one of the outcomes was of course was to we voted on writing a letter to our elected officials.
If you remember near the end of the meeting, we discuss stacking one of the motions that we stack was to write a letter to our elected officials, and so that's one of the things that we had been drafting and that has been and it works, and so I would like to you know: have the district manager give us an update as to you know what the status of that is.
There any questions for our district manager in regards to not only the letter that we voted on, but the form that we want to have what I elected officials to express our voice needs and concerns.
She has a question yeah I just wanted to know like as far as the letter is concerned.
That's what's one thing and the other thing is to be real, honest like as far as the community members who knows what's happening with the shelter's.
So if we look in the board meeting and saying how many people are in that building, that's how many people know, because I have found that when I spoke to certain people that I know in the immediate neighborhood like do you know that this shelter is getting ready to open up one on on to 33rd Street they go.
Express I were once in need, and so to that end you know, I said he and I had been in discussion a prior to the board meeting in February to do just that, and so in his report.
The letter have actually sent out to the board prior to the March meeting for your edits as a district manager always does he always sends out notices and ask for solicitation, so I don't think it was.
What's going on, but okay, if you're coming to me offline and then you know we can, we can discuss that clear about I'm George having to do that letter and all of that and I'm.
Just saying that I think that, with the letter with the letter, there's also a thing about how many people are going to be behind the letter right.
You know, and that's it it's just that the numbers and the people that we're able to get this information out because I know I'm, not block people, don't have the information, people always say I'm going to come to the me I sit and I talk to them about the meetings they said.
Oh, what meeting you know and I think that has to do with a lot with Georgia's hand in terms of how he's able to maneuver the information out to the neighborhood based on what resources he has.
The letter is account of is: is the community board going and sending out a piece of what our objectives are through the elected officials?
There's a hundred and fifty thousand people that reside within community boards, 12:00 you're right we're, never gonna have the resources to deal with them all the time, but this is a common refrain from everybody.
You know I'm, not gonna, twist anybody's arm and I, think that that's one of the things that, before this whole thing happened, we have been talking about holding even board members accountable.
So you know again: I'm I work for you guys I'm accountable to the community board.
Some people are mad at me right now and not said, I, don't care, but I really don't because it's about accountable, just like I expect board members to hold me accountable in my role.
So one of the things that we have wanted to address was that, if you've noticed you've seen it in the agenda about regarding board members.
That's one of the things that we'll be working on are taking care of that to get those numbers that you're talking about because I mean I can I can list board members who are very passionate.
Those are interesting questions, but we don't appoint our members, so yeah I'm, Sadie, just came back I, don't know if Sadie heard me speaking earlier, I said Sadie that you were on the Wakefield taxpayers, you and Joan I believe maybe you're the secretary or the first vice-chair.
I didn't have a question: I wanted for a new business if possible just on what happened: the Department of Youth and Community Development for all that kids excuse me, you can live on 2dy, CD, discover and just input your zip code and you'll be able to get some resources for your children as well as some of the services that we have in our areas.
You know we really see eye to eye on a lot of things, and we've talked about that for quite some time in regards to getting a resource guide or a member guide, for that contains everything that a new member is expected to learn, in particular from community board 12 standpoint.
So first hope everybody's going good staying safe and hopefully we could get over this madness regarding that resource guide, I actually got it from CB twelve Herman Han I was at a meeting there back in October, and you know I just brought it.
Has you know, information on everything that happens in community board?
You know to the board members and they think give it to some of their people in their blocks and stuff, and it basically just showed: what's within our community, you know, I mean any any and everything that's with and I think is even down to the you know all those service stations where they put it together again, it's gonna take time to do you know I mean, but it's actually very interesting and I think could be very useful.
Well, you know what I'll try to bring it to the next meeting, but in any event, this is a guy that is like say this is gonna, be labor-intensive, but as I say, this is a work of love and I said: I, think it's an excellent resource and so on again I'll make sure I try to bring it the next meeting because, as I said, I think it's good, that it's fantastic I, see a question that is being asked in it just be sent electronically, so I'm going to turn it over night I, don't think it can, but I'm I have mister.
If you want the community the handbook for community board members that is available on the grow presidents website, I'm just gonna, say right now.
bond and I'll be I'll, be working with her and you know trying to help educate, not only the board, but the community is how to look for these things and to you know, raise some issues.
So that's something that board members I want you to think about.
You know and making sure that you know everybody is okay, so I guess at this point we could you could unmute ourselves if you want to and just do that because, as far as the meeting goes, I'm actually done, but I just want to thank everybody.
