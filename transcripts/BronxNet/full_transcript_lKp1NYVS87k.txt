Welcome everybody to this virtual community board meeting that we're having so again. First of all, let me wish all of you well during this time. This is a precedent at time in really world history, where we have the entire planet, which is undergoing this endemic, that we are undertaking so I'm asking that each and every one of you stay safe. So one of the ways that we're doing that today is actually carrying out this meeting virtually so. First of all, welcome to all of you who are on this meeting and again I am your first vice chair, dr. Michael Burke, along with our district manager, mr. George Torres and several of the board members. Our second Vice Chair is own. I, see several board members in committee. Many members on as well. We do have a chat function, as you can see. I see were mr. Alfredo was chatting, which is fine, please feel free to use the chat function. So again, this is our first time doing this and again I'm gonna. Ask that you mute because I do have some background noise. What we're gonna try to do is father. We're gonna try to follow as normal as possible the board meetings that we normally do so, in other words, the public galleries we're starting a little bit late, but I would still like to at least a lot a couple of minutes, maybe 10 to 15 for a public gallery session and then we're going to follow the agenda as follow. So what I'm going to try to do is again for those of you that were on earlier, you able to see me share my screen and so I'm going to try to do it again and, as I said, my computer is a little bit slow. Hopefully can you see my screen? Everybody? It's dark! Yes, yes, okay, all right! So what you could do is you? Could you can see the agenda so we're gonna. Try to do is follow the agenda as much as possible and doesn't say getting and getting through our meeting. You know in a relatively quick amount of time: I don't know if we're gonna have a quorum or not. Hopefully we will, but you know, madam secretary call the roll and we could see who's on who's, not so this may be for information only, but nonetheless, like I said I just appreciate all of you actually attending this meeting. So with that being said, I'm going to actually do one thing before we actually begin the meeting, which is something that we always do at community board meetings. We actually say the Pledge of Allegiance, and so in this particular case I have my little flag and so I'm hoping like I. Have you know you can see the flag so I'm gonna. Ask that you know we do before. We continue say the Pledge of Allegiance, okay, I, understand I, pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God with liberty and justice for all. So, thank you very, very, very much everybody, and so what we like to do again is right now open the public session up for discussion for those of you that are unfamiliar with Cisco WebEx. Here's how it works. When you scroll over your name, you will see a little hand gesture if you raise your hand and hopefully, like I, said I can scroll through here and be able to recognize you also. If you use a chat function, if there's something that you want to say, then just let me know, I can unmute you and then you can address the body as well. So with that being said, the came-- excuse me. The community speech still works as it does in the regular board meeting. You would have three minutes to speak and, of course, after those three minutes, if you're still speaking in the nice thing about this folks, is I, have the capabilities to meet you and I? Really don't want to do that so I'm, hoping that for those community members that do want to have something to say to the body that we want to welcome you to say that, and so with that being said, I'd like to open this up for community speaks okay, so I did not see anybody for whom you speak so up miss Johnson. Okay, hang on for second, let me see all right. Let's see mrs. Johnson all right. Yes, just a question in reference to and I know, George made reference to it, the education mini committee, but could he elaborate on how the zip code one oh four, six, six one! Oh four, six nine are now the most cases of Kovac. You know you want me to speak. Can you hear me George? Do you like it yeah, okay, so I, don't know how we came to be the worst two ZIP codes in the city. We weren't the worst zip code, but one. Oh four, six, nine and one. Oh four, six seven four weeks were the top were, in the top five of the word zip codes in the city and relations to those people who contracted the virus. I'm, not an expert I, just Community Board, 11 I'm on their Facebook page. They would send out the information and it would have the statistics it's actually broken down also on the city's website. So if you wanted to see it, you can have it while we're having this meeting. I can email it to you, Pam, just so that you can have it, but it is not a secret that some of the Unity's that were impacted the most with communities of color early hours here in the Northeast branch we already suffer from in in or in with poor health for a lot of our people. I just read an article this morning. That said that people who have diabetes, hypertension and I forget what the third issue was: asthma, I, don't yeah as Anna. Thank you ones that were most acceptable to contract the disease and actually have fatality as a result, again I'm an expert. We had a doctor banks from BCC on the phone with us yesterday. She probably could speak more to it. She I think she might even try to call in and refer her to her question or you can refer this question on her, but I'll send you the stuff that the city has Pam so that you can see it I appreciate it. I'll, send you my email in the chat. Okay! Thank you. Thank you, mrs. Johnson, so, just for the record for those that are unaware, mrs. Johnson is president of our 47th precinct, Community Council, and so their meetings are normally on the second Wednesdays at the Mont, so I'd imagine that their next meeting will take place on May the 13th. If my eyes are okay, thank you. So I made it 13. So I guess for those of you that are in here that you could please attend those on your meetings as well. Okay, dr. Berger one other just so that we spoke about this earlier for people who are calling in over the phone. They don't have the option of raising their hand, so unmute them in order to participate or, like I said they also don't have the chat function because they're only calling it right right right. The question is I. Don't know right now, you're, absolutely right. So let me unmute right now. People who are calling in and yeah okay, so with community, speaks I see. Is there anybody else? Johnson say something: I, don't see anything in chat function right now, did you? Okay? You know we're still getting it. So I did not get it, but just once that time that my team is still out there within our catchment to 22nd 227 bars and 14, we've had to shift a little bit from being on the streets hitting the grounds we're actually doing services virtually I'm. Just one of the community know that we still are continuing to reach out to our high-risk participants and high-risk people through the community through this time through this pandemic. Okay, do you have a contact address for anybody to reach you that needs your services? Yes, what I'll do is in the chat I'll put in my contacts, so Agency number and whatever information that's in the program or in terms of assisting individuals within our community, please feel free to reach out. Okay, thank you. Everyone and I hope everyone stays safe, not a problem. Thank you very, very much. Okay, I'm. Looking to see George, you have your hand raised again: okay, okay, George I, see you have your hand raised. No, no I'm, okay, okay, before okay, okay, okay I was before all right, I'm looking to see. If there's anybody else has their hand raised and it I'm gonna unmute the people who have called in before we move on I'm on meeting the people. Would you on the phone call we're doing community speaks at the moment? Is there anybody that is called, and that is not a board member that has anything that they would like to contribute to me. They speak okay. We got to miss Gibson, so I am looking right now, I'm. Looking again before we call closed community speaks just to make certain that I'm not going book crazy here so minutes, okay, George. Okay, so I hearing them seeing none so normally we would take a motion to close community speaks, but since we were doing this, virtually I would like to think that the board would give me the authority to close community speak so and I need to get my gavel so community speaks is now closed. We're now going into business session, and this is around the time that we have our elected officials. The only representatives come through and speaks, and so neat thing about this. Of course we have assembly when dinner, which was actually here on the call with us, so I, muted, so Assemblyman didn't, which can you hear me I sure, can okay great, please feel free to address the audience. Okay, I will and I will try not to talk too long, because if I do you can always mute thing? You can't do in person. It's really good to be here. I find this technology. Amazing I can't tell you how many zoom meetings I've had over the past weeks, but it's amazing that we could all get together, even though we're not really together and I, certainly look forward to the day when we can be together in the same room. I hope everybody is well I, hope everybody is staying safe, ah 12 for a few minutes, I wanted to let you know and I think some of you may know. We. We had a town hall meeting the other night on Tuesday on zoom', congressman eliot, engel state, senator Jamal, Bailey, councilman, Andy Cohen and myself did a virtual town hall meeting and we organized it. I think starting last Thursday, so I'm pretty much four days notice or five days noticed. We had almost 250 people from around the communities that we represent participate. I mean it's not quite the same as a an in-person Town Hall, because people that was not the back-and-forth that we would normally like, but people had the opportunity in advance to submit questions and we try to answer as many them as possible, mostly related to the virus and and people. You know you see stuff on TV all day long, but there were still a lot of questions you know, and each of our offices are getting questions, whether it's on unemployment seniors getting food, you name it. There are so many issues out there and it's really a horrible situation. I can tell you that my office, like I, assume pretty much every office. We are closed, but my staff is working longer hours than they normally do. They're working from home off their computers, every single phone call back whether there's a message in my office. Every single email will respond to pretty much the only thing we can't do that we normally do is we can't provide our military service and we've gotten hundreds of calls or emails. A lot of it had to do with mail service was one of our zip codes, post office kind of shut down for pretty much a couple of weeks and unemployment was was probably the biggest issue. It's still a big issue, but it's easing off because the state is doing much better than they were, but questions relating to nursing homes, I think we all know- and there are a lot of nursing homes or twelve nursing homes are probably the worst place. Anybody could be right now. People are sitting ducks there and a lot of people are dying in nursing homes. I spoke to one of my captains, one of my precincts, and he told me that the number of people that the police are basically finding dead at home. You know, normally they will. If a relative falls and says you know, my grandmother is not answering the phone I'm in California I can't get there, the police will check on them, and the number of people who they've discovered have passed away in their own homes has actually been a significant number, and that tells me that many more people have died from the virus. Then the statistics we're hearing every day tell us and that's that's very scary, I'm very proud of our communities. People are doing what they're supposed to do, which is to stay home as much as possible. Wear masks when you're outside don't get you closer to people. People have meetings like this nobody's having you know normal meetings right now, mrs. Johnson had asked before about the high number of people who have tested positive in 104, 66 and 69. I can offer a few theories, although of just now, gesturing but I believe that in those two zip codes there actually are a very high number of people who are going out to work everyday I'm, one of the fortunate ones I can work from home and do my work over the computer. But if you are a member say of 1199 you're in you know in the health care area, if you are in the TWU you're going out to work every day, so that alone increases the odds of something testing positive and it's unfortunate. But the people who are doing that these are the looking are city running so I for one am very grateful to all of them, and one of the things that I think we have to deal with now, but deal with over the long term is the fact that there is obviously tremendous disparity based on ethnicity based on race and also based on gender, by the way in terms of who's susceptible to catching the virus, who is more likely to die from it or what the underlying conditions are to make. People walk vulnerable and those conditions, as was mentioned earlier, whether it's diabetes or asthma, for example, are more prevalent in some communities and in other communities. So these are really issues that I think we have to tackle, and right now that we have to get through this emergency and again I'll stop here. But I just want to thank everybody for the work you do in the community, especially now it it's really making difference, making a difference in a lot of people's life. So thank you well. Thank you. Assemblyman didn't wish for that. I had a question, if you mind regarding the budget, if you don't mind telling the board and the community at large what transpired, with the budget that just passed and what could we look forward to in the coming days? I've mentioned a few things. One is the budget was a difficult budget before things got even worse, we were hoping to increase education funding by a significant amount of money. It turned out that we barely increased the money healthcare. There was some serious issues Medicaid this year, there's a provision that we passed in the budget- and this is unfortunate, but probably necessary- that gives the governor authority to make mid-year cuts in the budget based upon revenue not coming in, and the truth is in New York, City and New York, State, lion's share of revenue sites of income. Taxes, of course comes from tourism, industry, real estate and the taxes that people work on Wall Street pay on their bonuses and those three industries have all no cratered and, as a result, we're facing a deficit which could be as much as fifteen billion dollars. I know, despite the efforts of Congressman Hank though, and Senator Schumer and others, the amount of federal aid coming in is not what it needs to be I think many. They have heard what US the majority leader of the Senate the Republican said yesterday, where he pretty much said that we shouldn't be giving money to blue states. That was the most outrageous thing that he should go into bankruptcy if we have to so we're really facing probably the biggest budget challenges that we have faced worse than after 9/11 and we may be being the infant tough times the unemployment numbers came out today and we are facing unemployment levels that possibly would exceed, or certainly rival, that of the Great Depression I. Don't think any of us were alive during the Great Depression, but it was. It was the worst economic disaster of the 20th century and that's what we're facing now and things probably I, don't see how they can get back to normal so quickly, because I mean even after they say. Okay, you're off to stay home anymore, I like to go to you know to Yankee games and yes, bets games. Also I like to go to concerts I like to go to political rallies, I'm, not gonna, be so quick to go to any kind of event that has so many people in it. Even after they say you know the lockdown is over and we can go out again and I think most people are also going to be reluctant people aren't going to crowd into restaurants or bars the way they have in the past, at least not for a while. So it's it would seem to me that business is not going to even after things are better. So we have. We do have some big problems ahead and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Okay, okay! Well, one last question from me to open it up to board members in the budget. Is there any monies that were made available to Cova testing? Well, the budget was passed, approximately April first I believe there there is money or the governor is making money available for the testing, but his how the testing is working. First of all, the the Trump, as you could imagine and as we know, has pretty much abandoned state as far as I'm concerned, so we're on our own in large part. There is. There were two types of testing that going on the testing to see. If you test positive for the virus, that's becoming, there are more and more tests are tests being done as the week's go on, but not nearly enough. I was determined the other day that there's going to be massive testing done in the night buildings which are they very appropriate I think we should be the same thing: the nursing homes not only for the residents, but also for the workers- that's very important, but I- think people in general we have to. We have to have wide scale testing, even if it costs huge amounts of money, because otherwise it's very hard for the professional scientists, really know where we stand. But in addition, as the second type of testing that's ramping up now, and that is testing for the antibodies it's been suspected. And now the first data is coming out that many many more people have the antibodies than one might have thought, meaning that they were exposed to the virus. Even if they didn't know they had. It doesn't doesn't affect everybody in a significant way, and that testing, though, is being done on a random basis. They had a testing site Oh, a basically a bridge, table I, think or a table set up in front of one of the supermarkets in my district earlier in the week, and they were testing the antibodies, but it was being done randomly because they want to get an idea of how many people probably have the antibodies, because that will give scientists and the medical very important information that they know that they they need to know. But in terms of funding. Yes, money is being spent by the state to deal with testing, but we need to do a whole lot more to get the job done properly. Okay, thank so what I'm gonna do is open it up to the board members about. Maybe, hopefully you can give one or two questions in to the Assemblyman and then we're gonna move on so because there are some other elected officials are the representatives that are here so for any board members. Are there any if you there, please unmute yourself raise your hand. Actually let me recognize you and then in goes the board members and then have war. Assemblyman dinner with the question question Algeria had a question: okay, I didn't see your hand. I was just saying that, as far as you know, us being on this line is hard like really here everybody. So if people could kind of mute themselves and then unmute when you're ready to talk, if you can, you can figure out how to figure out that about logistically I mean that's just one thing you write, miss Bennett, I, think most of the people who meet what I did was. I unmuted the people that are on the call. The people that don't have it bill is that you and I have so I need you to did him because I didn't know whether or not they have, for instance, like mr. Gibson I, don't think she has a capability, so I unmuted her. You know she could if she had to ask a question to the Assemblyman did, but most of you, you know doing that. Okay, mister dinner, I just want to say that I appreciate you getting on the call and being on this with us right now in in terms of giving us an update, an update about what's going on and how things are going on. I just wanted to make sure that I acknowledged that okay, thank you I, did it? Okay, okay, so I think any other board members. That's everybody! No problem! Thank you! Cinnamon dinner wits. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. Okay. So next we have Councilman McCombs chief of staff is that Arianna Carlotto am I, saying it properly all right, yeah, that's pretty close enough! Okay! Great. Thank you. Welcome to our our board meeting. Thank you. Thank you, I'm. Actually, a constituent as well so I live over here on a few blocks away from last up of the five train, so I know the community very well to see you, you don't mind. Do you just today, because I wasn't I wasn't, let's just say: I look very quarantine, but definitely next time I was going with video, my handsome gentleman mr. Torres mr. Biggers role, myself. You know we're all growing beard see exactly so. You know I just wanted to say. Like Assemblyman Irwin said our office is open as well and as long as any issues or any concerns that anybody has. You can just give us a call and I'll put the phone number in the chat box as well, and just leave with some voicemail and we'll give you a call back the same day. I know that there's a lot of different issues going on whether it's unemployment issues or food acts accessibility. We can definitely help with that as well. I also wanted to mention that we also have our newsletter that we send out daily, which has a ton of information, and we also provide a link to the newsletters we've sent in the past. So I'll also put that information in the chat box, so people can sign up if they choose to and and get any information that they need and if there's anything else or any other concerns that any community board members have or any constituents have -, please don't hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. Okay, all right! Well, does anybody ask you this question? If you don't mind, can you give us the City Council, had a virtual council meeting pretty much what we're doing here? What was some of the outcomes that would benefit us in a community board so how they came out of that meeting? So we yesterday was our first dated meeting with all of the council members that was actually pretty extraordinary sort of like we're doing now on and there's a ton of bills that the City Council has introduced yesterday, just to bring some relief to different different communities. Different freelance workers on you know just certain things that needed to get introduced during this dated and hopefully passed within the next few weeks, to make sure that we bring some kind of relief to all different kinds of communities and I'll be more than happy to also send a link with just a summary of those as well, because it was quite a few okay, okay. Well, thank you. Thank you very, very, very much for attending our meeting and and thank you guys for organizing this I am completely impressed with the fact that, despite everything that's going on, we can still find a way to get together and discuss. What's important. Well, not a problem, not a problem. Thank you. Thank you very, very much and again, you know we welcome you board members I'm looking for any hands. Are there any questions for and let me unmute, he calls right quick. Are there any questions for councilman? You know I'm, watching staff. All right so what's happening is I, think that I'm we're being seen on TV and there may be a slight delay and so I went on a tandem you to that. So thank you again. Next from our elected officials, we have Miss Mary Lex Santana Taveras from a district attorney Darcelle Clark's office hi. How are you good evening? Everyone I'm just here to short support I- did want to mention that our office is completely working remotely everything that consists of trials court appearances.

Additionally I've emailed a few people about a list that we generated list list full of resources for anyone, that's experiencing any anxiety, anyone that's experiencing depression, domestic violence and etc. That's it okay. Does anybody have any questions and again you can either pose it in the chat or I'm not trying to scan to see if I see any hands that are raised from board members and I do not so hearing that seeing none we'll move forward. So thank you very, very much up I say over there's a question from earlier. So can you unmute yourself please trying to login I'm going to Center? Okay, he asked again. Oh yes, present us! Yes! So yes, sir dr. banks, okay, if you can give her that out, appreciate it. Okay, all right great, so we are moving right along.

Torres. Do you know if if Alexa was able to make this your honor alexis was on here she was a caller I, don't know which phone? How are you yeah? You may have to unmute, okay after I need to call okay? Can you hear me I?

Again, I don't hear Alexis on the phone, so if she's on I'm hope so Tom looking is on Tom. Can you speak is easy on easy on the phone I believe he is on the phone he's a well I. Don't want to give out his now right, yeah, Alexis I think that's her hi dr. Berg. How are you sorry I can rejoin. It was an issue with the phone. Okay hi. How are you I'm doing great we're?

Okay, well, thank you. So I would imagine that there's you know outside of regular meetings. There's really nothing. Let me ask this question: does the borough president have any discretionary funds or that maybe he can contribute to testing what community residents cuz I know we're gonna have a guest presenter. We wanted a little bit but I think that was one of the in all the meetings that I've been in one of the things that we've been hearing about is testing testing testing, in particular, how it hits communities of college. So I, don't know if the borough president has talked about that and not if you could elaborate on that. If he has or has not yeah, we there's been conversation about it. I could definitely have more information for you from Tom and from Nancy. So I'll follow up with you on that, so that you will be able to share with the community. Okay, okay, all right so I'm, seeing something in the chat so afraid you have a question: no okay! Yes, let me see gotcha, okay, I think I got a moment. I, don't believe that there's any discretionary funds for testing, but I'll definitely get back to you on with any other additional information. I may have okay, you got it. Okay, afraid you had a question for I'm Alexa, no, okay, okay, okay, that's just something! I thought! I saw okay! Well, thank you! So so much mr. wheezing and now I guess we're moving along in the agenda. What we have I, don't know from area I want to species from senator Biaggi Belkis. Oh really, okay, I didn't see her.

I can put my email address in the chat box, we're operating as most as as best we can business as usual constituent services staff is available to help people we're getting a lot of questions, as you might imagine, on unemployment assistance, people who need access to food access to cash benefits or snap, so we're trying to help people navigate those systems. The Senate has been busy around the district holding virtual town halls, I think she's been trying to connect with district district, manage his community boards. Civics trying to set up meeting she's in a town hall tonight with the comptroller's office got string up what else we were supposed to have a legal services van, my legs mobile legal services being supposed to be parked outside on to 31st, in conjunction with Assemblymember dinner, witches and councilmember Cohen's offices.

So you know I wish you will. Please give the senator our best and, as I said before, you know we will definitely yeah rest of what's happening on our end. Okay, great and I. Just also wanted to say on the issue of PPE and testing, you know our office has been or the senator has been active in trying to push those issues on the state level. So if there's a particular need in a particular area that you all become aware of, please let us know- and you know so- we can weigh in on that or bring it to her attention so that she can weigh in as needed we're not a problem and, as I said I'm you know again.

I'd like to you know, listen in on that. You know you know we can go forward. Okay, yes, thank you very much, not a problem. Thank you, so I'm going to mute you and we are moving right along and so I'm going to now share my computer because I believe it's time for me to give my report as we're looking on the agenda. So if we look on the agenda and when I ask you to be patient because, as I said, my computer is a little slower than it should be, and it's probably because I have multitude of apps that are that are available. I mean that are on right now. So does everybody see my computer? Yes, no. You do! Okay, great! So yes, oh great, okay, so three! So what I have is my reporting so again I'm just going to go through this ever so quickly, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it because I give this out to the board members so that they can go about it. So so, since we met last in February, we attempted to have a conference call just to try this out last slug and that took place on I want to say the 26, if I'm not mistaken, of March and really the general purpose was twofold, really just a fellowship with the board members just to see how we were doing in its time of isolation and just a welfare check, and just to see. Also, we want to test the telephonic capabilities to see whether or not this is something that we could do in the future, and it just so happened that two things that I was happy about a the amount of people that were either on the call or try to get on the car, because we had some technical difficulties but, more importantly, it wound up going from a welfare check to board. Members actually said: look let's take care of some business, so we actually started talking some business in which our district management was given us. Some updates, as some things that had transpired since the February meeting, then akin technology creeped in this ugly head or so exact cutoff, and so we'll talk about some of those things I'm just evening a little bit further along in the agenda, I want to say after after our guest speaker next, of course, everybody's been doing everything virtually so again, you heard from mrs. Johnson as she's on householders, though you know she posted her meeting virtually earlier this month and, of course that hit me even more confidence that we could do this. What we're doing tonight, based on you, know, attending attending on mrs. Johnson's meeting so I, like you, know, thank her for her leadership on the sports ever precinct council. We did our first virtual meeting with the Economic Development Committee, in which miss Benitez led that meeting in which, when she was a pretty good meeting in which we talked about ways in which we can really uplift White Plains Road corridor in particular, and so I think a lot of resources that she'd made available and had on that meeting, discuss that, and so that's something that that they're working on a little bit earlier in the month I had a conference call with mrs. at Grossman who works out of Congressman Engels office. In that you know, he and I are working on a project that I don't want to give up just yet, and so you know, we know for a fact that we get the favorable outcome that we're looking for so again. You know mr. Grossman and I are got the closely to work on the project that we're talking about and so I want to. You know thank congressman Engel for and his chief of staff, mr. Wace, for making mr. Grossman available to us, mrs., mrs. Denise bond is on our call tonight. She actually led her first committee meeting this past Tuesday, and so you know we discussed some things in regards to parks and recreations which actually be beneficial to us or there's some things that you know she and the chairman. Mr. Ivan Boris is gonna. You know lead and get back to the board have somewhat of a homework assignment, to figure out how to do some things and then get back to us, and so I want to spend a lot of time on that, because again, I think mrs. bond wants to you know we were about making up lifting her and making sure that she gets that done, and so I want to thank her for leading her very first meeting and her first thing, the community board. So thank you, mrs. bond and last but not least, education committee met last night and so on. You know, I'd like to thank you know. Dr. Gough was on that call, as well as mr. sinan mr. Reid, who will always lead the education committee in that was quite a meeting to say the least. I'm you know we learned quite a bit and so again what I'm gonna hope happens is that they produce a report because, as you know, that's one of the things that we're going to talk about a little bit later on is being accountable. Q. What members, because I think knowing what they know, what happens when each committee always helps us to be a better board, but one of the things that came out of that, of course, was mental health of not only the students but as a teachers as well and our resources, which hopefully we can talk about a little bit later on this evening and so again, wanna label 2.2 much longer, but I just want to again just share my report with you and then what I like to do now is to keep one moving on the agenda and ask our wonderful district manager. Mr. George Torres, to you know sure I really don't have a report other than to it looks really good to see all of you I miss you all I hope all of you are taking care. I hope to see you guys really really soon. A new appreciation for working from the office- the only thing I will say is we spoke a little bit about it earlier budget cuts. So this is impacting the community board as well. The city instituted a program to eliminate the gap they refer to that as Peggy eg, so it it includes a hiring freeze and every Community Board in the city for fiscal year, 20, which ends June 30th of this year, we're getting a four thousand dollar cuts that is coming out of our personal services budget and for next year's fiscal budget for fiscal year, 2021 we're getting a eight thousand seven hundred and twelve dollar cut. They are not significant cuts. I think OMB tried their best to hold this harmless from these cuts. Other major city agencies, I, could see here so the shaking her head. Other city agencies took much bigger cuts than we did, but this will impact it I mean the stuff that we're doing tonight we're on Bronx Ned. We pay for these services not only for bronze net for the, but also for the team that produces what we're doing, and that might be impacted next year, depending on what the budget looks like. So you know we'll need to work with all of our elected officials and community members, because it is really really gonna be hard. I, don't know how the city recovers, I, don't I, don't think it just ends there with the four thousand dollars this year and eighty seven hundred dollars next year. I think it goes deeper than that. We may lose the forty five thousand $42,000 canary money that we get from the City Council next year as well, so it is going to be really rough and how we deliver services go moving forward, might look a little different, but that's basically my report I wanted to put it out there and that's pretty much it I hope. All of you guys again take care I hope to see you all again in the near future. Stay safe out there take care of your loved ones, really good to see you all! Okay, you got it so does anybody have any questions, any board members that is have any questions for Georgia? Yes, no, okay, all right! So with that being said, we are moving right along and so on. As I look at the agenda, we need to vote on committee recommendations, but really, since we didn't really have our committees meet like, we normally do, and really only three or four committees met and really no recommendations came out of there we're going to move right along to the next item of the agenda, which of course is approval of the board minutes, and you know due to the nature of the virus. We don't have any Minnesota minutes or are able to be done so we're going to move right along and go to the presentation of our special guests, so I'm hoping so I'm gonna. Ask the question on her I'm gonna unmute you as I, have a question that is dr. banks on the call yeah. Do you know she, oh she's, not on yet yeah? No, we we sent her. You know she's a professor or a program director at BCC Ursula sent to the information, as did I. She has not responded to our stuff. Well, I know, I think she had another room. You know she had another call at you know she said she was on, but you know we have. She sent us some slides and so on. I don't know if [Applause] one of you two can get that out to the body she said: what's that, okay, she sent us a YouTube video. We did. You have slides in it. Oh yeah, the YouTube video has the slides in it. So if, if you could send it out to the body, that would be because that's a good look at it and it's got some pretty interesting information. Some of its technical but I think it will help not only board members, but the community see how covert 19 is transmitted in a lot of the biology that goes behind code 19 and then what we can do to help ourselves be this toggling virus. Okay, so if when you guys can send that out, I would deeply appreciate it. So that means we're just trucking right along here, so we want to go into old business and want to talk about committee structure right, quick and soul and I'm not gonna share my screen with you just yet, but I want to talk about committee structure and in vice-chairman, so we have the nice thing about what we've been able to do recently is that we've been able to appoint vice-chairman to our committees and the reason that this is important is because, if, for instance, if we have an executive committee meeting or if we have some sort of meeting in the chair, man at a chairwoman isn't able to attend, then we have somebody that will be able to attend on their behalf and be able to represent us as a community board and be able to give pertinent information to whatever agencies that we need to meet with. And so that particular vice chairperson can then bring that information back to the board. So what has happened is I've sent out the list of chair committee chairs and vice chairs to the board. So you have that already. But if you don't have that- and you know, please feel free to send either myself or you know: Georgia Ursula, an email and they'll be more than happy to get that tea, but all of our standing committee chair men and shit women and in their respective vice chairs, are available for us to review. The next thing I wanted to talk about on the agenda was an action item that resulted from a meeting with the Department of homeless services. In regards to these shelters that, yes, some money, someone had a question. Yes, no I thought I heard Maddie's, mom, okay, so issue and I mean a question: I mean when it came to the Department of homeless services. So for many of you that are where we had a meeting with them back in February, I want to say February the 25th or 24 the 25th, and so we had a meeting with them and we discussed that I'm, not only an executive committee, but we expressed also talked about that at the full board meeting and one of the outcomes was of course was to we voted on writing a letter to our elected officials. If you remember near the end of the meeting, we discuss stacking one of the motions that we stack was to write a letter to our elected officials, and so that's one of the things that we had been drafting and that has been and it works, and so I would like to you know: have the district manager give us an update as to you know what the status of that is. So the letter is written, it's still in draft form. It was gonna, be brought back to the board just to get your approval before we actually sent it off. But then this happened, I will ask I, think we shared it with everybody, but I can share it again after this meeting is over with the board just to make sure that everybody is on board. What's the language, obviously it's gonna have to be sent electronically because nobody's in their offices, the elected officials that is but I will say. One of the requests which I guess we might have to rethink is a request to actually have a community meeting, so we might actually have to have one of these things. You know either a Cisco WebEx, meeting or zoom meeting with our elected officials and speaking about non on the shelter there on Furman Avenue, but also the one scheduled for 33rd Street, but that's basically where we're at okay Thank You mr. Torres board members. Are there any questions regarding because that takes care, the two items that were on the agenda to that end? There any questions for our district manager in regards to not only the letter that we voted on, but the form that we want to have what I elected officials to express our voice needs and concerns. I see Miss mr. Bennett. She has a question yeah I just wanted to know like as far as the letter is concerned. How soon can we see a draft of the letter just to be clear? That's number one and number two when this letter is produced when we send it to the elected officials, a letter from a group of how many people are we talking about because it just seems like if the district manager is the one that's taken the lead on this. If he's really the one, how does that reflect on how many community members are saying yes or no to the shelter's? You know, I, don't think that a letter I mean the letter is good, but the letter without a series of names or numbers or something attached to that I. Don't know how effective that is. That's what's one thing and the other thing is to be real, honest like as far as the community members who knows what's happening with the shelter's. We get the information out to them. As far as the people who come to the board meetings, you know they come to the board meeting. So if we look in the board meeting and saying how many people are in that building, that's how many people know, because I have found that when I spoke to certain people that I know in the immediate neighborhood like do you know that this shelter is getting ready to open up one on on to 33rd Street they go. Oh no, I didn't know they don't know they don't come to the board meetings and I wonder also. How do they get to know about the board meetings? How do they get to be really clear about the board meetings? I know that and I mean we have kind of you know, taking a back step to snail mail or putting information out so fliers and things like that. I know there might be budget constraints, they might be staffing constraints where that's concerned, but I. Also wonder how about like say me: if you gave me certain flyers and information about you know these particular items happening, you know, maybe I could take flyers and I could distribute it to the people that I do know who might be interested. So let me address one of your questions first and then I'll turn it over to the district manager. So one of the things that we did in far as the letter is concerned, so I think so, let's go back over the chronology. So if you remember, the district manager stated back in February of during his report that this is something that that he thought that we needed to do in order to express on behalf of the board. Express I were once in need, and so to that end you know, I said he and I had been in discussion a prior to the board meeting in February to do just that, and so in his report. He actually he said this is what we want to do and is what we need to do and so to that end we voted on it in February and then the letter was actually drafted and constructed in March, and so I took a look at the first draft as well as dr. hall, and so you know we made our. You know. Dr. Hall and I made our initial edits to the letter. The idea was is to have a March board meeting and have the board review. The letter have actually sent out to the board prior to the March meeting for your edits as a district manager always does he always sends out notices and ask for solicitation, so I don't think it was. This was just you know him pushing this. Miss Bennett I think that he was writing it on behalf of all of us, because you know he's knowledgeable. You know I'm again, I'm. You know a little knowledgeable in the role that I'm in, but for everybody else you know he would be an advocate to be able to address all of the issues and so I think that's how that came out. So, unfortunately, due to the fact that we aid due to the pandemic, the letter was not sent out to the board, so I think again, we're gonna make certain that that happens, so that you can review. So it's not you know. I don't want to make you seem like you know. Our district managers is doing this. You know out of whim no he's doing this on our behalf, and so I said dr. hall and I have seen it we've, and you know now we're going to ask some of Turner's over this mention see what he has to say about it, but you know that's the way that this was going for so that's how it was constructed and just to give you a little bit of background as to how we went about George, you want to chime in I really realize. I know that you guys are working. I truly know that you're doing all the things that you can do with that I'm. Just saying that, as far as having the numbers really to support the letter and that's an S, that's the other thing now. The other thing I want to ask is what is happening with dr. pol how come we are always seeing you. It's all great I, do love you you're doing a great job, absolutely you're doing a great job. What is happening with dr. hall? You know like there's only, but so much time we don't get any information. As far as just I mean we don't, let me just say it is this: is this? Is a public forum Ness going out to everybody, so I think that you know right now. I know that I'm I don't want to disclose. What's going on, but okay, if you're coming to me offline and then you know we can, we can discuss that clear about I'm George having to do that letter and all of that and I'm. Just saying that I think that, with the letter with the letter, there's also a thing about how many people are going to be behind the letter right. What about the tax payers, Association I mean have they been contacted to? Let them know the impact of what's going to happen with these housing. You know, and that's it it's just that the numbers and the people that we're able to get this information out because I know I'm, not block people, don't have the information, people always say I'm going to come to the me I sit and I talk to them about the meetings they said. Oh, what meeting you know and I think that has to do with a lot with Georgia's hand in terms of how he's able to maneuver the information out to the neighborhood based on what resources he has. He doesn't have the resources in terms of the financial resources. He doesn't have the resources in terms of the staffing resources to get the information out as far as like I said snail mail, because everybody is not computer savvy, everybody is not computer savvy, you know and his hands and Ursula's hands they're tied there. There is our time and I'm just saying that. Maybe we need to appeal to individual board members and say: look take this information. Take these flyers and as best as you can hand the Flyers out to your local neighbor, you know just to get the information out to them. Okay, what listen I think you hit the nail on the head, but this is 2020 and we don't do lit, drops anymore I'm preaching to the choir here. All of you are participating. You are taking part in what we do, which is our civic duty. I cannot hold people's hands and tell them to come along. The other thing I want to address and actually what this whole thing speaks to is accountability. The letter is account of is: is the community board going and sending out a piece of what our objectives are through the elected officials? It is incumbent upon the elected officials if they are community oriented and they all are to then come back to the community board and have the meeting that was actually what the request was so to address two of you, we sent the letter out to the whole community board, I just checked with Ursula everybody got a copy of that letter. I just sent it to her again we're sending it to you again tonight so that you can read it. But again, it's incumbent upon all of you read it to be active, the talk to your neighbors about it and that's what happens? We're never gonna be in a situation where I can knock on somebody's door and have a 20-minute conversation. There's a hundred and fifty thousand people that reside within community boards, 12:00 you're right we're, never gonna have the resources to deal with them all the time, but this is a common refrain from everybody. Oh I didn't hear about that. Dr. Burke will tell you even amongst our board members, we send out tons of information. They'll tell him when he calls to follow up with them. Oh I didn't hear that I didn't see that again. The letter we said was sent back in March. Again we're gonna send it again. You can read it every piece of mail just so that the community board understands it goes out. Has the Chairman's name on it? Does it have George Torres his name as a Chairman's name on it? So it goes out from dr. hall and when the elected officials respond, they come back to the community board, which is what he chairs. So again, you know that's how we've always done it and that's what we use for accountability. We write it down. We send it to the whoever party is, whether it's the Department of homeless services or the elected officials, and we have a conversation about it. The meeting that we had with the Department of homeless services would have been a better meeting. We I think dr. Burke. We only had like 40 people. There is something like that: yeah yeah, we should have had more people. We should have had the whole board there, why? You know I'm, not gonna, twist anybody's arm and I, think that that's one of the things that, before this whole thing happened, we have been talking about holding even board members accountable. If you don't show up to the meetings, we only have 33 participants on tonight's call or tonight's Cisco WebEx and less than half of them are board members and that's problematic. So you know we have to address that. We have a lot of board members that don't participate. The Chairman is one of those people that is not participating. He has been m.I.a. That is something that we're gonna have to deal with. You know his brother they're, both living together in the same home they're both not participating in tonight's. All there are a number of other board members that have not participated for over a year, yet the borough president keeps reappointing these people. We have had conversations with the borough presidents office about why you reappoint these people. The BP's office responds back to us. They say: oh no George, that's the community board the responsibility. You have to vote them off the board. So again, that's a conversation that we've had for the last two years with the executive leadership of this community board, and we haven't done it. So you know again: I'm I work for you guys I'm accountable to the community board. You guys are accountable to each other, so you need to hold each other accountable, especially I mean when we came back when we come back from this. That's actually going to be one of the themes of my conversation with the community board is we're trying to create magic here, we're trying to create something special, and we can't do that when people are not participating. We have 47 board members. We have one of them: the highest board members in the whole Bronx other community boards have 30 board members. Some have twenty board members. We have 47 that makes quorum difficult. We didn't make quorum last year twice because we didn't have enough board members. I know earth will wanted to say something so yeah Sara, Handa, yeah, no I just wanted to say that Robert Hall did contact me and he's doing right, and so let me let me answer your question as well: miss Bennett! So if you notice one with the ways that operate is you know, I haven't trying to hold people accountable, you know what I mean and I know some people, and some people on this call will know. There's some. Some people are mad at me right now and not said, I, don't care, but I really don't because it's about accountable, just like I expect board members to hold me accountable in my role. You know if I'm not doing my job, you know, let me know, but I work as the district manager says he works for you soda. Why you know I was not elected to this position. That people didn't have faith in me, so one of the things that I do is I hold myself to a high standard and likewise I hold a board members to a high standard as well. So one of the things that we have wanted to address was that, if you've noticed you've seen it in the agenda about regarding board members. Unfortunately, you know things have always happened where you know whether we have a pandemic or whether an emergency is taking place. But we haven't been able to address that. However, rest assured, as long as I sit in the chair as long as you guys have me as your first vice-chair. That's one of the things that we'll be working on are taking care of that to get those numbers that you're talking about because I mean I can I can list board members who are very passionate. I can list board members who have been reinvigorated and you know there are board members who are you know less than ideal, and so you know my job is either to motivate them or to help create a board similar to what you're talking about. So you know rest assured, that's something that is ongoing. It is not we're not sitting on our Duff's and not trying like say it is. Is this tremendous you can tell you that's something that he and I talked about on a regular basis, so you know we're trying to make that happen. I've told the chair that as well, is that you know and he's agreed that you know we need to hold more people accountable. So you know that is you know, chair agrees with that assessment that I've made so like I said we will be doing that and, as I said, change is hard. You know. Change is very hard, but make no mistake about it. Hopefully, as the district manager says, and backing them up we're going to be a well-oiled machine I'm in the coming month, yeah I realize organizational change is hard. Okay, there's a whole psychology that goes through organizational change. That's true. The other thing I want to say is about our relationship with the tax payers, Association because being involved with the tax payers, it's all just getting them involved or just going to their meetings. Maybe just you know being the thing where we reciprocally go to their meeting as well as the 47th precinct council meetings, you know, but the tax payers Association is critical because they are taxpayers a lot of the things happening in the neighborhood where there are houses and spittin. You know blocking lot. Numbers that are available for people to come in and develop is because people are selling their houses. You know people that send their houses and they go they're out of here. You know they rent to people they're people that lives in the houses are not necessarily people their own, so the tax payers Association really has kind of a basic thread into what we do. Hello, miss Bennett, a Giri, you couldn't be more right: I will I only I'm only talking, because Sadie walked away actually, but she's still on the phone call, Sadie and Joan. The old was on the call earlier, our members of the Wakefield taxpayers and their board members community board. 12 has the benefit of having two and in presidents for Nitra facilities, Walter, McNeil and Robert Hall, both of them I, don't think are on this call. We have Pam Johnson on the call who is the president at the 47th precinct council, dr. Burke, regularly attends the precinct council I also attend the East to 22nd Street meetings on today's no I don't go as often as I should, but I am a frequent visitor of many of these meetings. I go to the NCO, build the block meetings that are hosted as well. This community is actually very well interconnected. We have a lot of juice, a tax payer associations they're, mostly known as community block associations and they're all interconnected one of the questions and the curious things that I've always wondered was. Why aren't these people on the community board? I know Pam used to be a board member she's no longer aboard now. I know who's the lady 4:20 Ruby more I, don't know why Ruby more or the other one from Big East to 22nd block Association is not on it. I, don't know why the wood Woodlawn taxpayers are not on here. Those are interesting questions, but we don't appoint our members, so yeah I'm, Sadie, just came back I, don't know if Sadie heard me speaking earlier, I said Sadie that you were on the Wakefield taxpayers, you and Joan I believe maybe you're the secretary or the first vice-chair. You have to unmute her yeah mom about a meter right now. Ok, miss Sadie, no good evening. Everyone, oh ok, I, just go to the meetings that I'm not I did not take on any position at that meeting. June position, no I know I, don't have a position there I'm just a member. The miss Joan quad take a position. Yes, she I don't know if she's on, if she's on the on online she's, not here she was earlier. She was yes yeah yeah, yes, so this so Geryon. My point is again interconnected community and you have a lot of, and part of the expectation is that these we also have Michael felter, who is the head of the East to 33rd Street Merchants Association. So we have individuals who are participating in tonight's meeting and who participate on a regular basis that we expect that I certainly expect if they're also conveying and pushing the message that we're you know sending or that we're giving yeah, even if we all get together because, like you said you're mentioning all these people I, don't know that's cool, but if we could just get a concrete, similar message that we do all distribute, you know what miss Bennett. That's something that I'm so glad as you here, because I want to I want to move this along, but I think that you know let's work on that, so I mean you have my. Let's make sure that you and I touch base. If not tonight, then in the coming days, and then maybe we can have you leave that effort for us I was that I have you do that for us and then I'm? You know do that: okay, great, so thank you! I saw Lisa. Do you have a question I thought I saw you had a question. I didn't have a question: I wanted for a new business if possible just on what happened: the Department of Youth and Community Development for all that kids excuse me, you can live on 2dy, CD, discover and just input your zip code and you'll be able to get some resources for your children as well as some of the services that we have in our areas. So just wanted to share that okay! Well, we actually bought the tough, strong, new business right now, because mr. rolled on I, don't believe is on the call and so on, because I wanted to update on the 501c3. And if you remember, we voted on the ad hoc Budget Committee and, as I certain none of them are there so we're gonna move on for them and we're going to get to the the on under new business. We are all going some new business, we're almost done I'm. So if you don't mind, I'll share my screen with with the participants. So you can see we're at on the agenda, so I'm gonna do this and then because we're almost done- and it's not even 9 o'clock yet, which is great. So hopefully everybody can see my screen. You would see. Where are we voila? And so hopefully everybody can see so we're under new business. Then we're a couple of things: we're gonna go through this relatively quickly. Unless we can eliminate D, unfortunately, I think is we don't have we don't have a quorum. So one of the things that we need to work on is our elections for 2020. But again we don't have a forum and because I'm we're still working under the old bylaws. We were supposed to have elections in June, but, as I said, there aren't enough members on this call. So that's to your point, miss Bennett. That's something that we need to talk about I'm a little bit later on, but I want to talk about the new member guy in and that's something that yeah yeah. That's something that came out of the and how I came out that came out of the new member, the new member meeting, but I think you know mr. Torres, our district manager is actually pretty. You know we really see eye to eye on a lot of things, and we've talked about that for quite some time in regards to getting a resource guide or a member guide, for that contains everything that a new member is expected to learn, in particular from community board 12 standpoint. However, we realize that there are some old board members that, quite frankly, could use his resource as well. So what what we did was you know was in the budget and so what our district manager did was he went and he compiled or a guide for all the new members, but at the same time, that kind is going to be also passed out to a lot of us seasoned members as well. That may not be aware of some of the procedures that's going on, so those are ready. We were supposed to give them out or the March meeting but of course pandemic it and thus they're sitting in the community board office. So once we all get together again, we will be passing on those out, but those are ready for all board members. The new member guide, additionally, as you're at me, say back in February mr. Alfredo I'm, just going to miss Alfred Figueroa, who was on the call along with mrs. Martin, both of them. It's amazing how the good Lord works on the same day approached me about a resource guide and I, just realized that it's in my office in the back and I don't want to leave the computer to get it, but mr. Alfredo actually gave me a resource guide that I'm afraid it completely mute yourself. I want you to talk about this for a second, because this is your idea. You and Lucy. You and Lucy brought this to my attention, but they came up with a resource guide. I'm one stays out a community board 11:00 in Manhattan, but I want I want to have a freak. You can even meet yourself. You can't okay! I'll! Do it hang on hang on hang on, hang on there you go okay, you could talk about it, please, but because this was your idea: hey Amy, yeah yeah. We can what's going on everybody. So first hope everybody's going good staying safe and hopefully we could get over this madness regarding that resource guide, I actually got it from CB twelve Herman Han I was at a meeting there back in October, and you know I just brought it. Maybe we could do something similar, not the same but similar, and basically what that pamphlet has is this. Has you know, information on everything that happens in community board? Well at least hitting 412 in hand, local presense, the local hospitals, elected officials, everything that has to do with in the community is which is actually I found it to be pretty interesting. That's why I brought it, and maybe we could you know not happy it, but you know do something similar and maybe give it. You know to the board members and they think give it to some of their people in their blocks and stuff, and it basically just showed: what's within our community, you know, I mean any any and everything that's with and I think is even down to the you know all those service stations where they put it together again, it's gonna take time to do you know I mean, but it's actually very interesting and I think could be very useful. Actually, dr. Burke has it there right right. So this is yes, so this is what Alfredo gave me that night or mr. figure I should say we were dressing properly. This is what he gave me that night at miss Johnson's meeting I said was that I was back in the Oh? Wasn't it yeah something like that it was. It was back in the fall, but anyway this boy- you can't read this, but what this contains is I'm gonna see if I can hold us up and if you really great, if not then I'm gonna try to bring it to the next meeting. But it's a table of contents and there's mr. Figueroa who says I, don't know. Can everybody read this? No, no! Okay! Well, you know what I'll try to bring it to the next meeting, but in any event, this is a guy that is like say this is gonna, be labor-intensive, but as I say, this is a work of love and I said: I, think it's an excellent resource and so on again I'll make sure I try to bring it the next meeting because, as I said, I think it's good, that it's fantastic I, see a question that is being asked in it just be sent electronically, so I'm going to turn it over night I, don't think it can, but I'm I have mister. Who answer that question for you wait if, after is done by us, if we do it, I will see. Why? Wouldn't it be said that electronically, but to send that or kicked in one I, don't know if I'll be able to do that better than you know. I'm sorry I was asking the question. I wasn't answering the question about your died. I was asking the question about the new member guide if it could be sent electronically, since that was already done. Oh okay, yeah I forgot all about that. Thank you, dr. Berg, for raising it. This was born out of a conversation that Carla and I had I only printed one and again we were going to take it to the board so that you guys could see it. If you guys were cool, if it we were gonna, send it out and basically what's in the thing is already available electronically on the borough presidents website. So it is the handbook on how to be a community board member. It is the EEO stuff that all the training that you guys do every year for board members on EEO training. It's on there. The Disciplinary information is on there as well and one of the cool things that Ursula was able to negotiate a great deal on some planning handbooks, Oh Alfredo you're, familiar with the zoning and planning handbook, the orange one. We got a copy for all 50 board members well 50, but we got a copy. We got a great deal on it. Ya know it was really. It was awesome. So did a really good job and we got that so to answer Miss bonds question the guide itself I think was about two to three hundred pages I'm. Not recalling it didn't have any part work. It's very plain, like the the community boards fall, has a picture of the GW bridge on it. We had nothing. So this was one of the things I was gonna. Ask the community board was hey. How do we jazz this up and then we were going to use one of our local printers to print it out. But again, literally, all this stuff was for the March meeting, and you know it's kind of employers right now. Okay, any question and the stuff is available on the. If you want the community the handbook for community board members that is available on the grow presidents website, I'm just gonna, say right now. It is very lengthy. That guide book alone is about like a hundred and fifty pages. So you know that's why we printed it, and that was a suggestion, because I think Carmen, who was on the call earlier complained that she didn't want to have to waste her ink or her paper to print out such a lengthy booklet. Okay, so we are almost done boy, remember so and my last once again, since we really don't have a quorum or something I wanted to discuss and bring to your attention. This is somewhat to mrs. Bennet's point. So if you remember the last time we met, we actually gave a presentation on what was a result of the rezoning that we vote, that we took back in 2011 and to your point you know mrs. Bennet, that's why we have some of the things that's happening now. One of the things that came out of the parks committee meeting was that that mrs. bond led on Tuesday was ways in which we can start flagging. Some of these things that have taken place and how to prevent it, and so, as I said, you know, mrs. bond and I'll be I'll, be working with her and you know trying to help educate, not only the board, but the community is how to look for these things and to you know, raise some issues. One of the things that I would like for us to think about and again I could is only a recommendation, since my form is to think about taking a vote on down zoning. So, in other words, excuse me as a result of the up zoning. We have a lot of you have a lot of developments. That's taken place, that's really not that the remedy was supposed to be a contextual architecture when, in fact, that's not the case now I know mr. Legare was on the call earlier I, don't know if he's still there or not, but as I said before, I doesn't look like years, but but City Planning Commission, you know came to us and for those that went to that meeting talked about different types of architecture. This is why you need different types of zoning. Well, it's really not benefiting us, and if you remember after my presentation, you know mr. Lanza know stated that the reason that they took the vote was because they want to have more to say so. Well, in fact, we as a board have not had any say so, because developers are still do what the heck they want to do. So one of the things that I would like for us to do. One of the solutions and I think I've mentioned is then, and it's something that I want board members a community for those of you that are on the call I like you to chat with a board member at some point either in a chat session, or you know so or another is, is to you know, figure out. If we want to down zone I said we should, because that way we would have more of a quote-unquote say as to what these developers will do. So that's something that board members I want you to think about. I, see a question here from mr. James asking about the project on 211 to 212 Street, which is a B&B urban, which is of course one of my favorite projects, as as many of you know to answer that question I don't want to give up too much. Mr. James I will say that we're working with some very high-powered officials and progress is being made so I think I'd rather talk with you offline on that, because you never know who's watching us, and so you know, if you can hit me up either give me a call or send me an email and I can tell you. You know, what's happening behind the scenes. Okay, thank you. So I am pretty much done for the meeting. I mean other than likes it because we can't do elections right now, even if form a nominating committee. So the last thing on my agenda for journeying is just checking on everybody's well-being. You know and making sure that you know everybody is okay, so I guess at this point we could you could unmute ourselves if you want to and just do that because, as far as the meeting goes, I'm actually done, but I just want to thank everybody. You know I know I'm that attended this meeting and I want to. Thank you for your passion. You know. Each person on here is passionate about what they're doing from our elected officials I see. Mr. Martinez is here: I'm Scott stringers office. I'm, you know usual worried. Did you want to say mr. Martinez hi? Yes, everyone? How are you I'm?
