What's it, you can sorry I missed that phone call yesterday, Jennifer, Ian and Janine - up so Terry retarded burglar, just joined also she's, the landscape architect for the project, hi Terry, all right nice to meet you all, okay, see you again, oh I think probably saw some of you remember yep.
Think you're gonna, like the design that you're going to see but I also have some pretty good news and that, thanks to speaker Johnson, the replacement of the synthetic turf field is fully funded, so that is now officially part of the project.
Oscar and dog users in March in my office, just to get some thoughts on how the dog run could be improved and then we've been having kind of random interactions with other people and gathering information and working with ABB quite a bit, and so it's all come together.
We want to look at some green features for the comfort station, that you'll be seeing some green roofs and photovoltaics, and we also need to respect the flooding situation because, of course, we're right on the river.
Think with that I'd like to turn it over to Terry who can actually walk you through the design based on those goals, next slide and Kerri, take it away so we're meeting today in the orange space and from this point incorporating whatever feedback input we get from you today we're going to move on then to design development.
Opening at the moment, we've been talking with the trust about probably us spring 2021 start April construction is what we're looking for, and we think that's achievable at this point next slide.
Please let me just say: when we the next time we come back, I'm sure everybody we know we want to start in the spring.
May have potential for reuse with you, know new bench seats and backs and we're gonna look at ways to repurpose those kinds of things.
Next dog ROM in the upper left corner there in in our conversations with the community, there were lots of things about the dog round that did work and things that the dogs take advantage of, like the mounds like the boulders, and then there were things that didn't work so well like the water situation, the seeding, and so we were going to incorporate what works and look for other ways to address the things that aren't working on the upper right side.
The seeding steps again, as Kevin mentioned this area due to its elevation, it's really disconnected from the rest of the park and it, although these are intended for like feeding and I, assume spectator seating, they aren't the greatest position or not the most appropriate position for viewing the sports field.
Two things one is to provide enough space, get organized and define stroller parking in adjacent to the entrance, but it also gives us a little breathing room so that we can include some nicer fencing at the front and along the side of right now.
It's chingling facts I think we're looking to potentially upgrade that fencing and then, if you shift up north and west to the sports field, you start to see where the limits of the sports field were previously, and you can see now how we're starting to incorporate the overlooked area to a space that then becomes contiguous with fields at the same elevation and offers the opportunity for a new practice area.
This is nearly double large and the small dog areas is now double the size of the existing run was and the synthetic turf field, although we are see right at the lower left corner of the sports field, which we'll get into but we're taking away a little bit of space there from the from the sports field.
The building configuration as your gateway to sorry Terry, but just to jump in one more time also worth mentioning I think is, if you look at number 10, which is just off the entrance of the 11th Avenue entrance of the park.
We reach out to a concessionaire, get somebody in and work with them to design that box, but that's kind of a placeholder for it and I think it's important for you to know where we anticipate putting that Terry.
We are anticipating a some level of tree canopy within that picnic area to provide shade, and then I think this starts to give you a good sense of how the conversation overall spaces, with just a little vignette of a picnic area so start seeing that we've got this tree.
You need to be very cognizant of how circulation is working and some of the topography changes that we're doing is to help us direct circulation through the park in a way that will help the landscape to be sustainable and help these areas to be better decline, start to see that this is a place where we're going to do some specialty, like one of the ideas we have is to do this sort of best student lighting.
We haven't selected furniture at all for this, so I when it comes time for the members of the community board to offer comments and what I definitely be interested in hearing your thoughts on what type of furniture you would see here and do you like picnic tables and that type of things please put that in your brain for for later yeah?
Okay, so now we're going to take a look at the dog run next time, something a little bit more detail.
On the north separating the two, we are: anticipating reusing, some of the different granite walls that exist, repurposing them and then we're actually using that wall to help define and separate a water feature, one for each side of the dog run kind of analogous to the other water sprayed pool areas that you have we're thinking.
I. Think we effectively done that in addition to the tiered seating, there are some other students at the edges, but all of the seating is facing inward and it's all directed towards sort of the usable play spaces within the dog runs all of the entries into the background are the double gates and fencing here will be all new we're looking at using in some locations, particularly where we have the tiered seating.
We've got a long way to go here, but you just you start to get the idea of the elevated seating and how that relates to the existing treaties that we are going to be preserving next furnishings that we talked about with the dog user group and I.
Ok, so let's talk about the comfort station hi thanks everyone we're looking forward to getting comments and feedback.
We do think it's pretty far away from the playing field, but we just want to make sure there's kind of a buffer between that activity and the panel's the entrances are clad in weathered steel, something warm we think and durable, and we think that the ladies were sorry.
Maybe the seeding and everything else going on, but I think the general picture of it looks real good in terms of making it more interesting and keeping people in the park rather than just- and he said just as a pass-through.
Or will the folks in the park need to put on brothers in the furniture for shading until things go away, so those will be new trees and we are talking about trying to source some larger trees to go in just that particular area, because I think it's important that you know they have a little bit of a head start because you're absolutely right.
Think the separation of of the large and small dogs will help us sort of you know manipulate those Heights appropriately, because my concern right now between the bench and the mounds is only about four feet of runway of asphalt.
So looking at the design, it looks like you've got more space between the new seating and the mound, which is a good thing because it gets kind of crowded if the dogs are in about a 4-foot space that that's in there now personally, I'm, not I'm, not a great fan of stating seating I think it could be a problem with dorks going up and down falling, that sort of thing there might be people who want to be sitting there and that want to be bothered by someone else's dog kind of like running up the step.
Now what the expansion is going forth before you go into the the small dog area, I mean right now you it's about eighty two feet from the north end to the corner to the south end.
If there's a new dog run right now, everybody's in there and did small dogs have big dog friends- and you know all that kind of stuff and I think the small dog area might be scaled back somewhat to give the larger area some more space, because the people, some of these folks have large dogs and a small dog and the folks who've been using these dog runs for the last X number of years have been bringing that small dogs into this space.
So if this was a new dog woman from scratch and you set up space, the small dog people would gravitate to a small dog area, but you know you know I, think we sort of talked a little bit about the camaraderie in terms of the folks who are using the door grown now.
You don't want to echo thanks and I appreciate incorporation of the feedback, so just a couple of thoughts, one is you know, is interested in the east side of the meandering path.
The idea that it's becoming more of a you know, meandering more of a park feel I would just want to think through the plantings that are on the east side of the space in the middle.
Currently, the second thought is, you know: I'm, not a huge fan, the bathroom area, the comfort station I should say being the kind of gateway into the Plainfield area and I think you know in the concept drawings, it really looks great and you know I think at the outset, it'll be really nice.
As you know, the maintenance is maybe to a varying degree, upkept of that comfort station that it's still you know a nice entrance point into the playing field, and so you know if we are keeping it as kind of a gateway into the Plainfield area.
Is you just there's nothing there, it's empty, which I like too that's really thoughtful, because when teams are waiting or families are there for their turn, I think you don't have to fill up every little space people can kind of congregate there and I thought that was great um.
I do agree with Blake that maybe as nice as the comfort station is it shouldn't, be the only gateway into the field, because then people will Trek back and forth back and forth through that kids will be running if it was just over to the side, and there was a separate entrance way.
I mean it's a possibility that that that the the plans you have for the solar panels in that limited space could power the lights of that Park, full time or not, I just got I, don't know the metrics that well yeah, so, probably probably not, and the other issue with doing that is that you need a bit more infrastructure, because, if you're going to use it right, if you're going to use it, you need to have your own inverters.
You know how much power we use versus how much the panel's produce they may not necessarily feed them at that, at the same time or whatever, but overall net we'd like to reduce our or draw yeah that'd be great um and if you are taking comments or suggestions about picnic that the big long harvest table is great, because when we're done with our soccer games or whatever the kids are, gonna go and we're gonna all eat together.
I realize you're still going into designing development, but I think maybe that could work together, better and I'm wondering also if it seems like there's a fair amount of space there.
Of course, there would be doors at some point to lock the things up at night, but they would stand open, otherwise and I wonder if you actually need steps outside that the comfort station, presumably you've got a path of like a slope of five percent or less for the adaa access you know, could you simply eliminate the steps in the interest of having universal design access and maybe have that the area where the steps are given over to planting it would be a less to maintain in the winter of less of a hazard I also, you know, notice the water feature and the dog run.
Just to thought about that and the garland of Lights I think is a really nice idea going back to Madison Square the area around Shake Shack, it's a very simple thing, but it creates a really kind of elegant outdoor space, especially in the evening just said, and is there any chance that our food concession could be a shade traffic, so second I?
There's a lot of space on the benches are well spaced you can, you can choose to sit with somebody on the bench or you can or you can choose not to when it comes to the conversation which is kind of a key touch point for people we're going to design it, so you can get in and out without touching stuff.
It's hard to design a field to allow for social - - for social distancing, but there's no dense clusters, I guess maybe I'm fumbling, for my words, because it's a really good question and I think in particular the picnic area.
You know, as you know, that area is well canopy, so if we thought that that water play area really needed to have some sun exposure, so that says those trees are that one tree is pretty mature and we are looking to the movie park, speeding like the replacement value or size of those trees that were taking out with new trees that we would be installing.
If that's something that is decided to explore further I think one other thing worth noting in terms of lighting is: we are looking at taking the existing sports field lighting and converting that to LED, so that will give you some energy efficiency and I'm, not sure if Terri touched on this, but we are proposing LED pedestrian scale lighting throughout the park to match the playground as well.
If she has anything and I know, we have a question in the Q&A regarding the dog run, which I will read through in just a second um I recognize and I've come to understand the concerns around the bathroom and the Gateway to the field.
Yeah, okay, I, don't want to give the impression that the entire park will take a year and a half to build we're gonna do one piece open another and try and inconvenience people as little as possible.
Thank you Sarah a question in the queue a regard the material of the flooring of the dog run can do we do you have a proposal of what that's going to be there's concerns.
People you know, do a lot of things that you would be surprised at and so having as robust a structure and every single piece of it means inside is as important to our team as it will be to you and that's very much something that we look at with the design team as we're building structures.
What a beautiful look that was I, particularly like Blake's point of making sure that the planting, which you guys think you guys described, is a berm make it so that folks have to stay on the path and they won't end up.
You know this is just another dog mount and I could see dogs tumbling down hurting themselves, maybe with with two it might be a little bit easier, might be a a better plan because it doesn't seem like his room for a lot of other seating.
Could you clarify your first comment was regarding the opening of the gateway, I I, wouldn't change a thing I really like it, but you know I want to reflect the committee's interest.
There was another entrance to the field just bit further west, then the the comfort station was and then again to the north from 24th Street, so I really like it, but there was concern from the committee, so I guess I'm, going back to the committee to see when you guys hear 17 feet.
I would also add that that gate is designed to basically be where the solar panels end, which is porous so we're not creating a shade or rain canopy after hours for people to camp out in either it's there's no protection area for somebody to camp out and they'll be secured, which is probably a concern.
Is there other snow, scattered seating throughout and some of the other areas, or is that excited notice on the plans that there were, like you know, a little scattered tables chairs?
Maybe you know small tables people coming from work just want to grab.
We looked at some options, but it sort of meant increasing paved areas, and we understood that that was less desirable generally speaking to the community, so I think it's something that maybe the trust should respond to you about how they see it operating as well.
So this design has the concentrated kind of tabletop eating area in one spot, which is the picnic area, but then there are also benches all along the south side of that windy, central path, right, I, think, there's I want to say: there's almost 20 20 benches I'm, okay, which is pretty significant.
Don't know good unequivocally state that, especially if we're going to consider finding it to be a convertible faith in some manner or another, which I think would be a first of its kind of could be interesting.
But we thought operationally it's a really difficult thing to implement agree with with Kevin, but I think when we spoke, we thought perhaps, when you configure the defensing, that if down the road you found that the small dog space was underused at some point in time you could you could bring that into the lowness dog run, but not to me I, just wonder if you, if you're comfortable with your small dog being with big dogs, you just put your small dog in the big dog run area and that protects those who are not necessarily comfortable with their small dogs mingling with big dogs off a leash right.
But then you need more space in the large area, so I think what we talked about was some way to not make the conversion back.
Thank you for the clarification I do think that dog ownership trans change over time, people you know different dogs become more popular or not.
So you know I think that that the basic principle of like what kind of dogs do people have now might not be the same answer in five years and so on.
This is showing you the space on in front of Chelsea Piers, that's dedicated to I, believe use of the spear that pierced, America, I, know, I, think you're here still, so we'll definitely bring you over for this discussion once we were in the point of it and Noreen you're here as well, but Brad wanted to bring all this stuff because we have been, you know, looking at more ways to create space for the Greenway for pedestrians.
Yes, you are okay, so, let's start at Chelsea, Piers um, you know it was flagged because there's three lanes of roadway there that Brett saw is being very underused and would love to hear from you an explanation of that roadway what its utilized for and how you see that faith um.
If you come here on a night prior to kovat, you will find you could wait ten minutes just to get out through the traffic light on the south end, it will be completely blocked and we will have four traffic people along this roadway, helping to get the you know the person hops out in the middle of everything out of there uber just like we see all over New York who's, just like I'm gonna get right here, and you know they start unloading.
So, okay also is the queuing space for emergency vehicles and police and ambulances, and all that sort of thing fire trucks I mean this comes about for a number of reasons, not just identifying the need for additional public space, but that is a really sharp that's curve on the Greenway we died.
They all tend to go over there, because the kids like the bikes and looking in the water and all kinds of stuff, so they already are over on that area.
I. Just wonder if you know there isn't a more resourceful approach that couldn't have couldn't find some way of making this more available to the public and that's what we want to either think about.
Weight was answered in terms of that and I believe the stanchions are primarily at the entrance ways where people do cross coming from the east side of the highway into the part, and if the stanchions help slow down the traffic on the bike way, I think that's a good thing.
If we have a big space there, isn't it just directing people left or right instead of do you know what I mean, if isn't it just kind of more traffic, bicycle and pedestrian traffic, yeah I think it's a combination.
Is it necessary- and you know I, don't I don't mean for any of this to be an attack on the operations of Chelsea Piers, because they're, critical, integral and essential to the functions of the city, but I think that the whole everybody as a whole is looking at.
Don't know that we can do that without a better understanding of the data, but I think the whole point of this conversation was to really just start.
We see and I have studied it, because I use the bike way and I run so I'm moving slower than the bikers, so I plenty of time to look around and I've worked there for 18 years, so there's so well, I would I I, don't if the committee indulges me I, don't want to take any action on this this evening.
So if everybody's okay- with that, that's what I'd like to request at this time of Erica for this area in terms of the photos and any data that you can share, we would love to take a look at that.
And could you do this conversation, probably at our September meeting, because, like good New Yorkers we're gonna try to take August off because we haven't been off since March sitting right yeah, so that would be really helpful if you could share that with us, it should be that the committee send it to you or to Jean I've, even senator Janine, and that way she can share with the committee.
I think what you were kind of saying here so um way back when I I, probably work for community board for I, don't know the area kind of near the loop between the intrepid and puréed and then continuing on through out there.
They have to come in front of us or I think a few things right yeah have to, but should so Lesley can I.
