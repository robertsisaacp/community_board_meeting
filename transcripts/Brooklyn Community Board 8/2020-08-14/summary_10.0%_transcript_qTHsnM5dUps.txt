Thank you, okay, so we're going to go over the opportunities we have for public realm improvements in the upcoming m crown neighborhood rezoning, and we have with us chief of staff, tasha young for my majority leader council majority leader, lori cumbo, who will make an adaptation of suggestions that we've discussed over the past several months and she's gone through the trouble of documenting them with pictures and addresses and fully blown stated, recommendations and suggestions.
So, basically, just going back to a letter that ms young did back in may the basics are opportunities for development of city-owned properties, including new, affordable housing, opportunities for improving open space and public realm features, economic development, workforce development, schools and other community facilities, sanitation and quality of life, issues and transportation.
Doing a little research along with council land use on what other rezonings have done in you know successful rezonings in the city, so we borrowed a few highlights from different rezonings in both the bronx and manhattan and kind of glommed out what we think could be applicable for m crown so on to the next slide.
So since 2016 the city tracks neighborhood planning commitments and implementation annually on the website, which is where we got a lot of this information from then we just take a look at the surrounding areas to the m crown zone.
That's underutilized or not utilized at all, so other types of public land offer opportunity for development of community beneficial uses such as affordable housing combined with education or art space.
We start talking about another city agency hpd, which I've really been keeping my eye on with these current budget cuts, but another type of community access is existing, affordable housing.
So, knowing that how important commercial uses are to m crown, sbs is another partner that the community board would like to liaise with as part of this study on what that would look like if we were to be able to move.
Should we consider supporting private applica, or should you consider supporting private applications that match the m ground framework, discuss pros and cons very important conversation, and if there's no immediate commitment to implement zoning, how should the community planning work be memorialized?
Can one of your committee members assist because I'm trying to get presenters michelle okay, so my usual request is to try to get weatherspoon if she would be so kind as to monitor the chat and allow people to bring your questions forward news weatherspoon sure.
So, while people trying to get them in perform their questions, you know how to raise your hand or, if you don't, it should be on that right-hand panel.
I know because I'm on that block, okay and the question really relates to the fact that you mentioned that that lori cumbo has supported senior housing there, which we have heard before as well.
Looking at the map of opportunities in the powerpoint, I just wanted to address all their located relative to the density, because I think it's of the community board and a brooklyn general name actually the city which is one of the most dense deadly developed areas in the city of new york.
The other thing I'm so I guess I just want to reiterate that you prioritize thinking holistically, not just about m crown, but about all these different developments and how they interest intersect is important and I'm asking so.
That way, are they looking at the opportunities in the area relative to all of these projects together at once, and they are all moving together at once in the second part of it, I'm actually going to take this a little bit further than the land and say that what we've heard from hpd is that actually they do intend to pursue a minimum of 80 units of housing in one site of these two hpd scenarios, that is, that will inevitably lead to enough zoning.
Okay, peter I'm sorry, this one's counter to my understanding that if you complete certain numbers of dwelling units by 2025, they start running a 1.3 million a month liquidated that's only for the affordable housing, and so once they move there's six thousand.
I could try right, but I think the requirement for open space is something that I really have to bring back to the majority leader and you know talk with our land use department and see you know what, where the opportunities are, and I'm not sure that I'm exactly understanding everything that you're saying, but it's something that I would have to bring back to her and get back to you peter and then with bergen and dean, and the proposal is also something that again with this.
Certainly, there are examples in other communities where schoolyards are also called jointly operated, playgrounds, which means after hours, the parks department has interest in them, and so that could become a consideration and there's been a movement to modify the asphalt surfaces to bring in the newer versions of the artificial turf, so that could help modify the type of activities there and if any place is appropriate to try to get more hours out of spaces embellishing with lighting to you know, when you can't easily make more land, if you can make more hours and lighting certain times a year can be part of that solution.
We've had to reassess all of our priorities in terms of our work, our schedules and, at this time we're simply not able to complete a rezoning as hoped for within the time frame of this administration, but that does not mean that we cannot do planning work with all of you and we are intently listening to the comments and reactions here.
The thoughtful work that tasha young provided to you all and that you're reacting to, and we look forward to working with you throughout the next weeks months and year to make that to turn your ideas into a plan that can then be implemented when there is more time there and we have the the means to implement it.
Thank you winston means is the is the critical element in trying to move this neighborhood rezoning forward and it touches on who's going to pay for the work that has to be done to say that it's safe and proper, whatever else to change from what we have now with more than 50 years of chemicals in the soil to go to residential use and so on and so forth.
All of that work who's going to pay for that, but should we consider supporting private applications as council member rep tasha young asked in the questions for the next step, and it's something that one of the main proponents of this app this rezoning has been asking over time.
I think that the you know, one of the key questions is: how much can we get done while this administration is in office and you know, can we demonstrate that we have a public process that is moving forward in some way, and I guess in that in that vein, what I would ask is, I think, a good.
I think a good indicator of that would be able to would be to be able to get to a scoping hearing, even if you know we're not able to move into euler if we can, if we can come up with and get to the point where we've created a scope for the euler process, we've gotten public input on the scope.
I think that would that would demonstrate momentum and would make it more likely that the next administration would continue to pursue this effort as a neighborhood rezoning, and I would ask winston if that might be a reasonable goal to take on together.
So that means you do have to do a relatively complete environmental analysis in order to understand what impacts you might trigger, but might be as a result of the rezoning in order to then prepare a scope of work where the eis will then further look into those impacts right, and so that is a lot of work that is includes, and sadly, most of it.
I think it'll help us all winston if we can find a way to piecemeal this thing so that we get some portions completed rather than saying we're going to show the entire until we have the entire million and a half two million dollars to do the work in a bundle if we could again, if I may, I think the strength and the power of this plan that you we are working together is the support that you and all of the other panelists here can give it during this process right, and that is best done when we are able to walk you through.
Have you know together talk with other city agencies, answer your questions, respond to your concerns and address them to the best way possible so that you can then we can then together, put together a client, okay, just a second.
I think, before even to get to scoping, we had thought of a number of outreach steps, such as going over capital planning and infrastructure planning talking about housing and other topics that members of the committee raised.
I think that process you know takes quite a bit of time and leads up to discussing zoning and land use.
So here we have developed neighborhood plan land use application, urban design, zoning capital plan, draft scope of work, draft environmental impact statement.
I think you know we're looking at not the land use, application itself or the scope, but urban design, zoning capital planning and though- and I just want to say those- are very robust, complicated things that requires back and forth with with agencies a lot of coordination internally within the department.
But I would say too that we also want to hear from you and what you think is what you and the committee and others feel as a good use of our time and how we can advance this together.
You know the foundational stuff that's necessary to move these timelines ahead at some point is important, and I also believe that some of these tasks listed under developed neighborhood plan would be important tasks that would yield meaningful information for the rest of the community as well, so, for instance, urban design and zoning, I think, would be very helpful to get into, to the extent that we could that we could create a draft zoning plan, which is something that many of the community members and many of the committee members on this call, I think, have expressed interest in.
That would be the idea that we continue to work together and and develop a zoning proposal together when no now I want to be- I I'm not trying to put you on the spot, winston, I'm really not, but I think in this environment we also want to unders, and we want our group of stakeholders to understand what they can expect to see.
I think it's possible yeah right, I mean again we're I mean again we're talking about putting together something a plan, and that obviously is based upon an understanding of what the community would like to see happen here and then how to accomplish it and is absolutely right.
I mean we're talking about the need, the desire to create affordable housing that requires changes in the zoning.
There is no, there is no requirement right now in any of the zoning, not in any excuse me, but there is no requirement in many of the areas of this community district of for affordable housing to be included in new development right, and so that's something that we can work on like where indian crown area.
You know that the community board has adopted, and so what we're talking about now is taking that to the next step and proposing zoning around it, and that I guess I'm saying that's something.
We all know that right, okay, just want to be clear, go ahead, I'm sorry, okay, so I think that I mean I think that would be an important goal for us.
That's probably on this on this second line here, while we're working on while we're working on public engagement and engaging with agencies, I think that putting together the draft zoning is an important activity for us, and I I'm only speaking for myself, but it seems like something we should consider focusing on at this stage.
I think we consider those part and parcel just as important as a zoning proposal, and I so they go hand in hand, and I we would like to see you all understand what the city's tools are and how they can be implemented alongside a zoning avery zoning and to make sure that there is a comfort level here in the community for changes in the zoning.
I think that's how would you assess that winston we've been over these concepts a number of times over the past year, and I think the members of this audience are familiar now with what the community wants and I, at the one hand, I hear you agreeing that we can do a draft zoning plan, but then a moment later, I'm reluctant to ask you for a revision to this improm draft process and timeline that gives up so that we can see and looking for a memorialization about understanding when and where this project is going.
I think over hearing fear from a fear of unbridled increased density as potential private applicants point at pacific atlantic arts pacific park and say they want to harmonize their proposed developments with that, and this is another reason why I believe, we've documented that this community board will not support private applications in general.
So the concerns that you're voicing about that you're hearing from members of this audience about increased density is because they have not fully joined in the community board's resistance to in private applications, which is something that we will be memorializing at our full board meeting, either in september or october, so that there is no question that would retard the progress of this neighborhood rezoning in the in the in the eyes of dcp that we're not sure about what we want.
If I could, I jump in for a second alex summer for those who don't know me, I think what we're saying is that we're committed to working on developing the zoning and the urban design framework and all of the associated kind of policies that we can.
What do you guys think we want to talk through all of the different implications about the different densities, the different heights, different ways that we can modify our zoning regulations to accommodate local and unique conditions, and that and that yeah, I'm sorry go ahead.
This is new and so like that it requires like an ongoing dialogue, and I think why we're a little hesitant to say it's going to take x number of months is because we're in a new environment of technology- and we haven't tried out all the different methods of public engagement with this new reality and with these new considerations, and so like I said what you're hearing from us is we're committed to continuing our planning work with you and everybody on the call.
I think we really want to hear from you about how to engage in that dialogue so that it's not just a series of letters back and forth, but it's really meaningful conversations about when we go from one zoning district to another zoning district, we're actually talking about how many apartments, how many families and what that means- and that's really what we want to have that dialogue for, but if I, if I may, this is gibb, I don't want to minimize either what we're going through with the covet emergency or what it's meant for the city budget I mean both of those are very serious things.
I want to point out that the plan that we're looking at on the screen right now was presented.
We didn't do this in a vac in a complete vacuum and things have changed and we need to just simply adjust what our plan is and I'm I some of the discussion we're having here makes it sound like something has prompted us to.
I don't think it's helpful to give other folks on the call, the idea that somehow you know maybe people who are not as familiar with all of these things in detail.
I think those are great questions, and so absolutely we want to work on the community engagement.
I think those answer the questions I mean for one thing, I had no idea the environmental impact statements were not produced by the city themselves, so I learned something I didn't realize that it was that outside consultants were the people who do that kind of thing, just a quick clarification they are produced by us, but it's we rely on consultants to perform a lot of the analysis so for for air.
I think we want you to sign on to the zoning proposal and to embrace it so that we can actually, then in in good conscience, ask for the amount of money that it takes to do a full environmental impact statement.
I think, if I'm not right about 23 separate categories in to be considered for environmental review, and I listed some of them a little bit earlier, and so the first thing that you do for any zoning change is when you conduct an environment review whoever it is.
There are automatic triggers right, you're introducing x amount of square feet of commercial space or more a certain amount of housing, and that will and that it has the potential it doesn't say it does, but the potential to have an impact, and so that then it's almost like up this one, and then you put it aside and says: okay that one needs to be studied, and from that you develop a scope of work.
I think what I'm hearing that the community is saying is you know what tangible commitment?
I I'd like to say I share tasha's concerns and I and I and she could have taken the words out of my mouth and I think that there's an opportunity to address them by simply updating the plan that was presented back in april.
I think we just have to look at where we are now in terms of time and resources and provide a plan with specific milestones and tasks, as tasha mentioned.
So I'd like to ask again winston, if it is, can you can you provide an updated plan based on based on your current, your current available resources, and you know what we have been discussing in the spring yeah sure I hear I think tasha.
We were we paused right and we paused, because we were told stop things have changed dramatically in the city and we need to reconsider and we're back now and we're we something conditions obviously have changed, but our interest and our commitment to work with you on putting together a plan have not the.
You know this was intended to be an update meeting and I think the next meeting with you should be where we we can tell you when and where we can meet with the next city agency and whatever information you want, I can, and but winston can I ask beyond just what the immediate next step is.
Can you actually just give us an updated plan, a time and event schedule that looks like what was presented in april?
I think we want to talk to you like wait.
Let me ask a question, though, is this new did something that was because none of this was a factor on april 23rd, when this other did something happen that changed the information you need from us that didn't exist at the time that we discussed the previous schedule.
I think the previous schedule was based on a at that time, a rational presumption that we had resources available to do environmental review and that we had the time available and other means available to get this project done by the end of the administration, and that is simply no longer true right, but we got that.
What I asked was, can we can we present a new schedule, so everyone will know what we can accomplish, what we expect to be able to accomplish during the term at the remaining term of the administration at our october meeting and what I thought I thought I heard you say was yes, but we need more information from you, and so I just want to understand what that information is yes, so it is your interest in in what it is that you want to learn about right when we, when we were when we were speaking when we were meeting earlier this year right, we presented you with information about the demographic change in the community and legitimate questions were raised about.
Let me tell you why I'm being so insistent about this, it's because, right now, the community board has taken a position that we don't want to support private euler applications and that's an exceedingly strong position and if we don't have a plan that shows how we're going to deliver something meaningful.
If I can okay, I I'm I hear you I you know, we did not suggest that you not review or consider that is the community board's prerogative to do about private applications.
Yes, by all means, it may help people who have questions about environmental review and whether it's all involved, but I would say the strength of a plan- is the substance of it.
You know, regardless of what the environmental review says is, do you want to see more housing?
You know what can be done in house by city planning to show what streets may look like, or can we take cut and paste images of other buildings that are the heights of these opportunities showing which sites might change based on how much zoning change you know, these are exercises that can happen over many months to help inform people right.
So, in addition to learning about where you might be able to figure out squeezing out more park space or affordable housing beyond mih, that could be an area where city planning is much more need than its sister agencies.
