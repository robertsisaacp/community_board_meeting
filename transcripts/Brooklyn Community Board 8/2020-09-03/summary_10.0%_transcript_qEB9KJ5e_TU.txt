So, as ms tyus pointed out with the city council's approval of the grand pacific rezoning, the agreements that the community board reached with the developer, emp capital became effective and the restricted declaration was registered with the the governor finance and and, as you saw that's now available on acres, we also expect there will be a memo of agreement that that plays out.
I think we've already kind of been through with the general structure of the community benefit agreement and the nature of the the controls and enforcement that are in place with respect to grand pacific.
As richard pointed out, the developer, ellie perriante was quite, was quite coming and being interested in working through this arrangement and on the community board side, miss tyus and rob witherwax, and myself spent a bunch of time with mr perriente and his attorneys ironing out kind of the details of this.
I think that the onus of the imperative is really on being public and showing the public what the cba looks like both in terms of because it could, in theory, have more in it than what the the the record and you know as if you recall, I personally did express some concerns about a adding another component to a euler process which involves negotiation with the community board.
We would want to be able to start at a higher level, and you know seek terms that were as favorable to the community board, given whatever future circumstances exist as they possibly can.
I think, probably the committee members remember there was a suggestion that owners of a couple of those other lots be given an opportunity to accept the same terms that emp did for the in exchange for the same community benefit.
No, we had no text of an agreement, only the desire to have something that had that could be enforced as opposed to simply having a letter saying a developer has an intent to do something and in fact we do have something that has relatively strong enforcement provisions through the department of buildings and also through also through specific money, remedies that the community board.
Second point in the resolution was that the applicant make a binding commitment to allocate at least 0.25, far of the commercial ground floor to m crown uses and that the commitment takes a form that provides for monitoring and enforcement and survives transfer of ownership of the project of the subject properly, and in fact that condition was also met.
was actually what we distributed earlier today to the committee, so the property title as maintained by the city of new york, provides for the restricted use and that provision will be binding upon any future owner of the property, and likewise the community benefit.
I would use the time for m crown in terms of a potential rezoning when you walk the neighborhood look at things where you think you might see opportunities for enhancement, whether it's street crossings, whether it's lane reductions just anything that might be a quality of life benefit and bring it to the community board's attention, give explicit locations on that and start compiling a database of the type of things that you'd like to see embellished through or rezoning.
