What I'd like to do first is to do a roll call for the I'm gonna ask about those who are not speaking if you could mute so that we don't have the interference okay, I'm, going to do the roll call for attendance, princess James, Janet Collins present.
Okay, miss raspberry is here to present a proposed plan to build at 9:59 Sterling place with 1242 lot.
Okay, what I'd like to share with everyone is that crown heights north started reaching out to the her bronze school dating back to 2004 intent was to work with them to help them meet whatever goals that they were trying to achieve for themselves in terms of the building on Park Place, the school that is, we were not successful in any of our outreach efforts dating back to 2004 coming forward.
The second thing, I'd like to say, is that it was very unfortunate that we did not receive a copy of the plans for this development so that we could have looked for them.
Believe I did request that you send them to us, because we have a process that we go through to come to a meeting with a project of this magnitude and look at the plans, the plants just now.
Maybe I may have left out a person or two so I, don't know if it could I make a recommendation that everyone who all of the attendees who are here for to be a part of this team, if you can press the raise hand, icon I, think it might be easier for everyone to be identified and welcomed into the meeting Danny Collins speaking enough not help out, it will help, but not everybody if present is shown on my screen.
We're gonna have one main presenter, okay and I that'll be miss raspberry.
So if you could just give me a second sure, no problem I think we should step through your PowerPoint presentation and didn't have questions as I've been done with George, no okay, I think we should do that.
We're gonna I turned it over to this raspberry now, okay, so the open to the community for questions and comments can come after her presentation.
Yes, I did I just wanted to let you know I'm getting questions from individual attendees and panelists regarding the notification process and weather and the question around whether or not the meeting proper notification was not done and also since the plans weren't received until today.
We could probably move it to the second Thursday in July if the applicant agrees short notice and puts us at a disadvantage for being to being able to ask informed questions.
What I'd like to share is, as the president of the Crown Heights North Association I, did entertain the thought about making a motion to not hear the applicant because of the untimely notification.
I, don't that's an alternative to the motion, but I just wanted to interject that so I'm turning it back over to you miss chair, because I don't know how we should proceed at that point, but I wanted to share that with the person who made the motion in the second okay consideration.
Okay, fine, okay, so if you would call the roll on tabeling this to have them come back in July question yeah I'd like to speak to the motion.
I do believe that we should not have a vote this evening because of notifications in the community to the neighbors not being timely, but this is a big project and a big proposal and I think it would help the members in the committee to hear the presentation from the presenters.
Okay, so you can put your hand down the next person is Morris edge after me, the question is: should I be happy to talk with you, it's another time.
So the board knows that things aren't clear from Sarah yeah I'm, sorry that was I thought it was a response to a message.
Somebody sent me privately there's just some confusion among people who are not usual community board, meeting, attendees and yeah.
This evening, okay, given the given my late arrival, the ability to catch up one time I feel that I need to ask the forgiveness of those who voted to postpone and have MS rasberry step through the battle point presentation, and we take questions tonight and let them come back with answers in July.
Some of the questions I'm seeing in the chat is not about the proposal itself, it's about the process and trying to understand so that they could be prepared for next time and I think we owe it 'smoke.
So what I say that to say that for the community as a part of Crown Heights North, once we get the plans and we digest what I would offer to the community that has organized around this project since miss raspberry has extended that invitation to us that, like you, come back together and allow her to present to the community or the community members, not the community board price July, that's something that we could possibly consider.
I, don't know if that's inappropriate, but you know you did extend that invitation, and that is something that the Crown Heights noughts Association would have ordinarily entertained when the developers come forward in the historic district and asked to make a presentation if we feel it's warranted so and I'm addressing that to the community members who took time out to come in here.
Okay, thank you, so there there's raspberry, so then we'll reconvene on July 9th, if you would send your proof of notices to the adjoining property owners at least a week before that July 9th date, we'll come back together on zoom' and I promise to be on time.
Thank you all the neighbors for coming sorry, this is a disappointment, but you now you have time to look at the plans that news raspberry put together and we can put together a you, can put together a list of questions for them based on what you have in your possession.
We are looking at what we can ask city planning to include in the studies that they're doing to make sure that this neighborhood rezoning hits the mark as far as addressing needs in that six-block area.
Just as an update, we've had some discussion with City Planning with regards to an outreach strategy- the I'm sorry they're, not they're, not with us tonight, but they presented us with a very extensive outline and topics they wanted to cover in outreach sessions to the community really a kind of a whole course in City Planning.
If you will, what we suggested in that meeting is that we have one monthly meeting between now and when the scope for the draft scope for the environmental review comes out, and we move kind of the topics that they had outlined for us into the framework of that one monthly meeting, because it would be extensive, it would take a lot of time for a land-use meeting and we don't see holding for all the information that they're proposing to cover.
One I was at a pH and EC meeting last week and I thought you gave a relatively clear description of the different zones of M crown and the e zoning expectations that are the target, the rough estimations of where things are going to be, and since there's no almost 60 participants on the call at this point, I think it makes sense just to give the neighbors of the in Crown Heights and specialized than many of those rights that the idea of what to what M crown is with the zoning and the second actually was about the also at the meaning, givers Marshall in this process, and he is a he mentioned.
The first was because there's a good number of participants on the call who don't know what m crown is and because I thought that ran through I can run through the different zones of em crown with the zoning, the building heights density, the type of object very quickly, and then let me answer that before we do a train again on the first question, M crown is laid out on the community boards website.
Think that's as I said, the North Prospect Heights Association has this communication is extremely public and when we're sharing it with a committee, so we were just asking mr.
It's actually essentially marshaling this effort, so I think it's a reasonable request that he share the input that the Prospect Heights neighborhood development council is providing the Department City Planning thanks Tony in fact we're not providing any input to the Department of City Planning.
So that's what I'm asking all of you attendees to look at as you walk around this community district point out things that are in or near that rezoning the area that's up for rezoning, so that we can get it to DCP and they can include it in their assessment to the agencies that they're working with, because they're going to work with all the city agencies.
We want to tease out the questions that didn't get asked tonight and make sure that they brought up next time.
You said the meeting time to actually read this: oh yeah I mean I, don't like I think everybody can read, it I mean to make sure the people weren't feeling put out I.
Yes, okay, so a couple things at some point: City Planning is going to put together a draft zoning proposal and it will probably have four or five different zoning districts and that will be the basis for them to repair the environmental impact statement based on that scope of work and okay, a lot of opportunities, starting with the scope excuse me, get up turn off your microphone I'm.
If the council had a certain sense of what's gonna happen to the neighborhood might that affect how they want to accept or modify the rezoning proposal, or are there other resources of the city that the council may try to leverage to try to minimize that kind of effect on your neighborhood Thank You, mr.
But there was a lot of stuff that was very informative and it would be very good for this committee to see and the trends that it shows do you indicate substantial displacement, particularly by income and race over the last 10 years in the study area, and it's something I hope that they'll be able to present the future land-use.
The question I think I hear people like dr.
If people in the community are winning the lottery and the units they vacated tend to go to higher rent, especially for coming out of stabilized units where landlords you know, even though the rules changed a little bit, rents will still go up somewhat and then you still have a lot of homeownership units in a neighborhood.
That's automatic if you're, not one of those zip codes, your income has to be fairly low to have a chance to get that service so that that's been an issue in some communities and you know helping people really with resources or organizers to help people know their rights to best combat displacement pressures and you're gonna limit limited opportunity on other city-owned properties.
A support of population elderly you know, so you can use the uncrowned dialogue in meeting with the agencies that City Planning facilitates you with to go well beyond the uncrowned footprint, finding open space and creative ways.
Parking lot is within that yeah, but and it's up to you as a community and a community board to decide what the conversation should be and take it to whatever scope you think appropriate and the city may be totally responsive.
So, looking literally anything that comes to mind, that would help improve the neighborhood I think should be brought to the attention from people who live in a neighborhood.
So just two and I believe since the last meeting, the Land Use Committee, the North Prospect Heights Association, did send a note in Kathy may be able to correct me, but I think it was to the department, City Planning, asking them to identify potential places where new office space could be created because I think you know knowing the neighborhood as we do and walking around.
We don't see very many city-owned Lots that might be available for a creating open space and a you know, keeping in mind just for those who are listening from who are too familiar with the project that because we're because it's a manufacturing, quiet, large of manufacturing zone, that's being a transform.
We know that this HPD lot adjacent to being playground exists and D playground is certainly very close to the district, so I mean any suggestions you have for how could close the connection for HPD, Department, City, Planning and others just so that there could be an expansion of the playground into the into the into the into the parking lot would be helpful and we did send that letter.
I just want to second what Peter said me sent a letter to your office and I think to Miss Tyus and the board as well about helping us identify opportunities for open space in the project.
So we have that survey, data and I'll send that out, I'll post it to the land use Google, Group you're, not gonna, see a lot of opportunities, but obviously the HPD lot could be a dialogue about open space again schoolyards, so identifying schools that perhaps, if they're opened up more hours or if parks had different equipment, could they provide for more people or more children?
Mr. Todd yeah it'd be a lot of talk about city-owned land and we know that there's very little land, let's face it, I mean I, think they're low-hanging fruit.
Don't know exactly how to say this, but we need to translate those casual observations into something that would be useful for City Planning to put in that space other than bus parking, lots and junkyards.
Some of the things that DCP has suggested is doing a large meeting where they put up maps and they ask people to come over and pin ideas to a particular location on the map.
So I'm not quite sure how to do this and we're I'm casting about for suggestions from you guys, weren't, you talking about a monthly meeting, didn't get mentioned some things: Kathy, I'm, sorry, Kathy, Islan, I, don't want the same kind of same kind of arm-waving to happen at the monthly meetings we have to I think we should come up with a organized way of researching these areas.
I think it makes sense for the committee to take a look at the available capacity in the existing local schools for this kind of a proposal, so we probably have that somewhere would be great.
This is gonna, be at a month by month basis, okay I think we have theirs Wedderburn on the line she could probably get something I probably will have hat will have the opportunity to have access to the data and I proposed in regards to school.
We want to give data to City Planning, as I said, can we meaning this Community Education Council number 13, which is has oversight over that area, as well as the community board are in the midst of teasing out that data?
Okay, that sounds good, so that's a date on seats, new seats coming in or Peter there's plenty of data overall in thirteen, as well as a discussion as to what the needs are that will serve thirteen and therefore serve the M crown area.
Okay, this is a Peterson I'm, happy to support, Sharon and listen, and if she needs some help and I think she's referring to the school capacity data which the part of Education publishes every year and that's a really good resource for looking at available seats in you know in the area.
So that's sure it's gonna be great to see this info and I'm again not offering to help you just coming back to the number of units projected or this is our bulk analysis, not City.
Volpone I just want to add that when City Planning does the environmental impact statement, whether it's those exact numbers, what they're gonna do is they're gonna take the known buildings that are supposed to happen with or without the rezoning, such as some of the few that went through the EM crown area already they'll make that part of the baseline condition project school needs, combined also with a general growth factor that they're going to assume and then they'll project based on a new units they'll plug in a number.
Don't know, maybe I'm not I'm, having trouble coming up with the right way to formulate this question, but is like all right are the like exodus from the neighborhood gonna be factored into this type of these types of projections?
Or is there just no way to do so likely not probably gonna, use fairly recent, and they have this thing called neighbor, Housing, Survey, community housing?
Sorry I think it's called that helps them figure out baseline calculation and they're not going to really get into the nuance of how things have changed in a various community because of the kovat.
People have also been talking a lot about how the structure of the school year might change based on some of this and the way that the way that classes are broken up or the way that class size is determined and I, don't know if the assumption is again that schools are going to go back to operating how they did before the pandemic or, if there's or if the city is thinking that the operation of our public schools has to change.
Is the City Council land-use office and the councilmembers office I've actually done quite a bit of work, identifying potential community improvements to be associated with this project so I they had started to compile kind of an interesting list and I think we should invite them to the next meeting and see if they can share some of their thoughts with us, because I, at least for me, when I read that it opened it opened my mind up to thinking about things.
We want to keep them on board with this I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is this is really sort of DCPS we as well, so it's a general I mean it's a meeting for any community members.
These are the meetings that I mentioned before, where they have kind of a whole, syllabus and stuff that they want to present feeling their way along.
I hear you and what I'm trying to gather from looking getting the chats is questions that should be gleaned and put in these different buckets and go to City Planning I thought I said that when I asked miss Neal for the chats believe me, I have no problem ignoring stuff.
Let me add Millenial now what we want the live, so it's clear to everybody miss Neal, okay, you know!
I don't know the answer to it, but it seems that this is a public meeting and the chats as part of that public meeting and I appreciate that this is a new technology and we're learning it so I, don't know the answer this, but before things are deleted, I'd just recommend that we check to make sure that that's actually allowable, because I think you don't want to, on the other hand, delete things that were meant or made public and there's some people, you don't have I mean we've already heard people who don't have microphones at work.
This is a new technology with actually more ways for people to get input and then just speaking so I'm just saying that I think there's a legal question as a public there's, a public meeting, that's being docume - I'm, not sure that things can be erased.
Well, what I would say to that is that if once miss neele finds out- and we have a responsibility to let people know that if you think you send in something private, it won't be private, there's a possibility.
Janet Collins speaking next week, oh I'd like to I'd like to also chime in on that and I think that Debra young is 100% because the word write it means no enough supposed to see it and the technology and I know you were gonna check it out, but I just want to say this, and the technology is using.
That word private, so not likely believing anything that going for the public, but this was private chat, but anyway, I just wanted to chime in on that I think she's, 100%, correct, you've said it twice, and we I hear you clearly.
Do it set it up so that the community boards use WebEx so they're the experts on this and city staff city employees will interface with other city employees and let us volunteers and community residents know what the fine points are on, how we use this technology and what's open and what's closed and what's private and what's public so we'll have that information going forward and we will make sure that people are aware if their chats, that are listed as from one person to another and not to the entire group of attendees s, private are really private or not.
So if people feel that I was rude, I guess I need to apologize, but I wasn't able to get in on time and set the groundwork for what was going to go forward because the applicant and I discussed what the likely possibility would be for them not timely doing what they the two things they were supposed to.
Yes, what I'd like to say is that I think you are fortunate that you had a group of people community board members who realized that there was a problem and we tried to step up and keep it moving so that we didn't have the applicant and visitors just hanging out.
So should that happen in the in the future, because anything could happen with modern technology that what I would suggest not just to you but to any chair that finds themself with that is before you come in, like you said a bull in the china shop that you can communicate via text or ask a question just so you could pick up and not you know we'd not have that happen because we did try to you know.
