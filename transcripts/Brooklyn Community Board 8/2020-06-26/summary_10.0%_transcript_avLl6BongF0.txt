George I just want to note that move on to Robin Callahan and just give everybody that's coming on board a chance to introduce themselves to the group.
Thank you for your kind words and I will do the roll call Kier mone Allison, when you hear your name unmute just say here into Andrews Desmond, Adkins, Lisa, Atkinson, yeah, Wayne baby is present in the chat having connectivity issues as well.
It's open to the public and your you've got good standing to be to attend and contribute to the design action items we have for tonight or two items for the Executive Committee of resolutions were continuing business about a process for membership, recognition, slack and land use, so Miss Georgia.
Okay, this resolution is to confirm the authority of the State Liquor Authority and sidewalk cafe, review committee slack and the land use committee to work to act for the full board and it's been circulated to the board members and I'm reading it as we go now in recognition of the suspension of the interest and meeting requirement of article 7 of the public officers law included in the governor's executive order, 2-0 2.1 issued march 12 2020, the committee discussed confirming authority of the slacking land use committees to act for the full board until regular meetings begin again, a motion made by mister witherwax and seconded by mr.
The committee approve the concept and the language now presented for affirmation at this world board meeting is as follows: whereas the current state of emergency and the restrictions on in-person meetings implemented by EO 2-0 2.1, to prevent the spread of the deadly Kobuk 19 virus have made regular full board meetings impossible and whereas two committees with regular adjudicatory responsibilities, the SLA sidewalk, SLA and sidewalk review or cafe, review and land use committees continue to hold virtual meetings to give the board the opportunity to respond to applications that have been submitted.
Having met March, April and May, with June meetings scheduled and whereas all committees, with duda Kotori responsibilities, either currently or arising, acquire the affirmation of the full board for the authority exercised thus far during 2020, as well as authorization to continue to act to the full board.
On the extant circumstances, when the full board is either unable to meet during government restrictions due to government restrictions or to achieve a quorum due to technological impediments, when the full board is not scheduled for meeting be there for resolve that the full membership body of community board a grants executive authority to any committee with an adjudicatory responsibilities during a state of emergency, notwithstanding any associated technological impediments that prevent a forum and whenever the full board is not scheduled to meet, are there questions on this resolution again I asked?
It's nothing as of yet Miss Tyus I'm trying to follow if there's any hand raised, does this have a time limit?
As you know, Governor Cuomo has set certain restrictions on people being evicted and people not being held to task for payments, so Miss Tyus, I apologize, but we're having some feedback and I think it's coming, maybe from Miss Ferris that she also had her hand raised hi, miss Ferris to see questions.

Sorry for the complications miss lipkin there, any announcements we need to make Miss Tyus I'd like to just remind all of our participants and our board members.
Mr. Ellis is critical crucial and it's something that people who really need to pay attention to I just want to add that for the business that we just went, ten thirteen seventy Dean Street has an LPC meeting coming up.
If you have questions, you should be able to find out about people, you don't know about that are on the ballot by surfing the web, especially the Kings County committee website.
So everything is closed down, they're working, they're doing stuff inside, but everything else or the program stuff has been placed on hold of course, but you know it thinks something happened during this summer, I would kind of out let the community board know when they start opening up and doing all the other projects.
Okay, thanks miss Jaymes check-in that and have that information prepared in advance for next meeting.
If we're still continuing this manner, all right, we're winding down unless there's something else, the project for 959 Sterling place, he brought the Land Use Committee application to go to the LPC for a certificate of appropriateness was laid over to June, July, 9th and notice will be issued.
Oh, yes, okay, fine I, just wanted to be clear.
I just want to say that I know that we may have not may not have an option, but there were a lot of complaints from the community members who felt that they were not welcomed and accepted and able to participate in and the last land use meeting because of the difficulties in the challenges.
Yes, okay, number one on the absentee ballot application didn't apply to me.
We need to hear from the new board members that joined us.
So once I hear something from COC I will let you know: I have a raised hand, mister, the Kona tea and then I'll miss Wedderburn, just a just a cue people on open streets, I just wanted to I just wanted to say that we noticed in Prospect Heights on Underhill, Avenue and Carlton Avenue.
So if you see in the Crown Heights open streets and the barricades are lying there on the sidewalk, you might just ask the OT if it's okay, to just go ahead and put them up.
Okay, thank you all miss letter, Byrne hi everybody just as on we can all stay in place.
I believe it is, but I have I have I have been told by DoD personnel, but if the barrier is not up in the morning when it should be, if you feel free to put it back up, that's all well, it sounds like you're, a good person to ask among Sterling place between New, York and Nostrand, and we have a SAPO permit approved for the first Saturday in August for our annual Kids Fun Day. You know we just closed our little strip, Sterling place between New York and Ostrom in the kids, ride their bikes up and down the street, so I.
Mr. Merrill put a question in the chat regarding the locations for early voting and I will email those locations to everyone either tomorrow, on Monday, very good I know for a certain date or date.

We call it slack, you lift out the arse and won't be slur and the Land Use Committee so and those dates will be posted on the community board calendar a website and will, of course be using a virtual meeting platform WebEx. So those are two you could work with over the summer and then, if reception for September over the summer talk with ms/ms Georgia, a district manager or Ms Neil, our community liaison, and they can help.
The main are you here: okay, all right, so we'll move on to calvess, Nikhil Stein's, yes, good evening, everyone.
Last year, but I didn't know, I had like an underlying health issue and work-related stress that ended up in Kings, County hospitals like two months at the time, I was a part of I had like one more meeting and then I would have been underneath an Education Committee.
So you know continue our work and I think if the summer committees need folks I'm willing to participate on slack during this time, but I don't work for the New York City Department of Education in the office of safety and development as a social, we're becoming fearsome.
Thank you, okay, Miss Tyus.
Thank you, mister, where the wax, oh okay, and before we decide to separate ourselves for the rest of the summer, except for those two committees.
