My name is lowell kern, I'm the chair of manhattan, community board 4, and welcome to our small business support and reopening forum um back in march, when the uh pandemic first hit and governor cuomo shut everything down in new york city.
The focus is to better understand what resources and initiatives are currently available for supporting small businesses and they as they reopen and to highlight what needs improvement.
I want to thank bert and the rest of the group for holding the meetings and putting together tonight's forum and with that I'm going to hand it off to our district manager, jesse beaudine, to explain tonight's agenda and how the event will run jesse.
If you are currently having difficulty getting a response from one of your precincts, I can help with you connect to connect you with the right contact at the precinct, so I'll be putting those both in the chat and with that I hand that it over to small business services for their brief presentation, followed by the nyc bid association good evening, everyone uh and thank you to community board 4 and my fellow panelists for having me here this evening.
First of all, uh we are the department of small business services and we uh provide uh assistance to job seekers looking for work, as well as small businesses who want to start and operate a business, and we also support neighborhoods throughout the five bowls.
So in that area, we're still I'm going to provide assistance to those uh small businesses that will be need for staffing, you're breaking up a lot.
What happened during their pandemic is that we have adapted to a new program which is the sbs hotline, so this hotline is primarily uh designated for to answer business owners questions when it comes to reopening, as well as the ppe, finance and assistance legal assistance as well as recruitment.
The second question I mean second category that we come across will be the reopening guideline, so there are still currently some businesses that are not allowed to open this.
I also am in charge of the program in terms of offering virtual consultation for these businesses who try to stay in compliance when it comes to open restaurant seating program.
Just so let you know that small business services used to offer commercial lease assistance program.
Recently, we issued out a statement from the bid association on ways to go forward to help small businesses and the city's economy, and that's there's nine pieces to it.
Now we want to expand to other retail, to let all the retail go out and maybe set up in front of their stores, things that they could sell, and you would need to to allow that to have to go deal with the stoop law of the city, because you're not supposed to sell and exchange money outside of the store like that, and you would have to get if you did do it right now.
So we don't have a negative effect on it yet because, for the same reason why restaurants are hurting, there's not a lot of people on the street, buying street food or buying stuff, but it will become an issue when and if we start to get back to larger numbers that are walking around the street buying things, the fifth one, probably not exactly a favorite one for a community board, is to streamline the straight liquor authority process to make it easier to get your liquor license and uh to also allow some temporary, more temporary licenses for people who want to do stuff outside if they get approval from the city.
The state will probably regroup and meet again legislatively up in orbiting, probably the end of august early september, and that would be the time we would start pushing that and if the seventh one is the city should support non-profit organizations who want to create markets and pop-up venues, primarily we're looking to do that in parks or in in plazas those those are city properties and if there's any revenue involved in that normally you'd have to go to fcrcs the franchise commission, which I did for my job and it took two years or you have to pay a large sum to sappos.
I think you just did wendy gazelles is the small business marketing manager for google she's, been with google for 10 years she's, also on the board of the manhattan chamber of commerce and we're lucky to have her on manhattan community board, for we also have nathaniel garber there he is, he is in the family.
As we know, businesses have many challenges during this reopening phase, but I think one of the biggest challenges that they're facing now is the limitation on occupancy.
As we know, small businesses in the city of new york really thrive on high occupancy customers coming into their places in order to realize the profit right to meet the monitors, and I think the limitation on the number of people that can actually uh come and actually uh come and to enter a business at any.
I think what points you're raising eric is very important because most street businesses [Music] small businesses at street level, retail restaurant bar those kinds of businesses depend upon densities of pedestrians density of people around and the model that most small businesses have had in new york is based on that model and now we're confronted we're all confronted with something different.
Well, we see it in two different ways at the bakery, because where we have two retail businesses, but the majority of our business is wholesale, so in the retail business we still have a relatively high volume of people coming in, but now we're turned into policemen, which is really really stressful, because we are suddenly responsible for making sure that there's only a few people in the store at a time that everyone's wearing a mask that everyone's socially distant, that everyone's actually wearing their masks correctly, which is incredibly difficult for a lot of people and that act of policing throughout the day is really difficult.
Yes, yeah, it's um, so you know my business is essential, so you know, fortunately we we were not forced to close at all, although the first couple of months of this it was you know, a ghost town um, but I can say that throughout this entire process from the beginning, when there were only a handful of people and up till today, you know maya is 100 spot on it's such a huge, it's so stressful and on top of on top of just dealing with clients, you know we all have employees that are on the spectrum of how paranoid they are about contracting the virus themselves.
You know I may have someone in the store that we're comfortable with each other, but we don't know who's going to walk in the door any at the next moment and like if people are all over the map on this, and I think new yorkers for the most part are respectful about doing it.
Have you come across any of this with people that you're in contact with what I've heard from other small businesses, some of the same?
It's not a perfect system, but at least you can do some of that expectation setting right from the start so that you have maybe fewer surprises and can have fewer of those kind of policing moments that some other panels have talked about bob yeah, it's one of the bigger complaints we get from the businesses in the bit in my bid district about having to police behavior of the patrons, some of whom don't behave.
We've been open the whole time, so we you know it's we've just been continually expanding slowly, but now we're at a place where we're wondering if we're going to have to close again.
The leases, so it's it's certainly a challenge so like the money does help, but you know when that ppp came out the even the the division of where funds are allowed to go.
I mean every new york business owner, you know, scoffed at like oh great, like 40, probably wouldn't even cover a month's rent, and that's where you need to help.
That brings up right if um a core issue, I think for small businesses rent lease a mortgage if you own your own space um, have you three of you who have you have your own business or right up front or wendy or bob or eric?
And then it is just to leave the place by itself, because I'm not going to find anyone to render right rented to at this moment, we've had good experiences and also have heard that there are landlords willing to negotiate, which has been helpful both for us and for our wholesale customers at our restaurants and need to renegotiate with their landlords to survive um one of our bakeries, we own the property.
So we need to negotiate with the city of new york, because one of our single biggest operating expense right now is property taxes.
You know like maybe the city should be rolling back their tax base to the year that leases were signed so that renters aren't paying the differential, which is the boiler plate in just about every commercial lease, but differential.
I think a lot of this is going to rest on the funding the state gets because I saw today and then on gothamist that cuomo said or has basically like threatened to raise state property taxes statewide.
If there was some kind of blanket abatement or task force to deal with just that issue other than taxes, which is major, are there other impediments to fully open that you're coming across because of city or state rigs?
I'm sorry, but it feels to those of us who are out on dealing with the outside dining stuff that there just isn't a lot of enforcement like we're missing that from the city from the state from anybody.
If there's a slight breeze, it's kind of a mess so but yeah yeah, you know going back um uh the business model we referred to before you know built on pedestrian density and people walking in off the street um.
So even things like personal training right, which is such an in-person kind of business, we've seen that shift to video online on google we've actually now added a way on your business profile on google, which is just what shows your local business information you can now, as a business owner.
All of that we've seen a lot of small businesses across the country, doing um and we've, you know developed some additional tools to make that a little easier as well.
It's been really inspiring to see what businesses are doing and then, as we now look forward and we're seeing these different phases of reopening, I mean I'm very curious to hear what my other panelists have said, that they've done.
You know personally for their businesses or what they'd like to do, because I think that's.
Certainly, you know we will work with people that don't want to come into the store on the street or over the phone knowing they're right outside, but for the mo for the most part we I haven't noticed that either of our locations, especially our village store, which is so spacious.
Even if it's just a 10 minute, I need nuts and bolts, and I have a few random questions before I go like make a mess at home, and you know I think, there's something to be said for that.
I just don't know that it matches for the logistically for the kind of day-to-day client interactions we have here well, if, if we wanted uh each one of you wanted to leave us with a sentence or two of maybe what you've learned and what you still need, I think that might be helpful.
I think I would add, is that um in addition to learning all sorts of new things about sanitizing and viruses um I've been like, I said: I've been so impressed by so many small businesses and just being thrown into an unimaginably challenging time and how they've pivoted, how they've been resilient.
You know that there are resources and trainings that are available, whether through a company like google or whether they're chambers of commerce, through small business services, um people who are experts and want to help and so to continue to reach out, because we one maybe have a resource to help you now and if we don't, we can build it, we can figure it out together.
Well, I I think one of the most surprising things for us in our position right now is that we're sort of desperate for enforcement and policing and guidance from city and state agencies- and it's we've always had you- know the existing rules and regulations that we know to follow and they're good, but now we're in a position where we kind of feel like we're making it up on our own.
You know like we follow everything that we get, but we don't get that much so in terms of letting people into our store or employees sick policies.
If we had someone telling us exactly what steps to follow and it's kind of the same thing with reopening and the possibility of a closure we're going with it, you know we know how to operate our business, we'll figure these things out, but we're it would be so nice to have more guidance, which is an unusual position for us guidance from city and state.
Well, I want to thank the six of you and just to let you know, you're not off the hook, because we have questions and answers coming coordinated by chris and dolores uh for the next uh half an hour or so, but jesse would you want to say something about the poll that will be happening or sure so um we're not doing a live poll on uh right now, uh, I'm gonna put into the chat the link to our survey and uh, we'll send it out to everybody that had signed up rsvp'd for this event um shortly and then we'll have it on our website um.
We've always talked about selling some of their stuff and they'd sell some of ours, but it's easier just to refer people to them, because they're so close, you know a couple of uh things that I've seen that I think, are pretty great one.
I mentioned before people creating links to things like gofundmes or selling gift cards or having other kinds of fundraisers, so I think just asking other people, whether they're local businesses or just other people.
I think, there's a lot of confusion as to you know, as we talked about tonight, about how to do that so also reaching out to your existing customer bases, whether it's through your email list through your website, social media, whatever it is to say, hey.
Um is huge and I've seen that happen quite a few different businesses, both in new york city and across the country.
Uh themselves, they'll get the bags and things like that, um or working with the business integrity commission to sort of come up with uh, some more uh creative ideas, um uh in terms of the uh, the shelters.
That's that's unfortunate and I I feel like there's a lot of small businesses, uh looking for resources very similar to the bid, and so this next question goes to our three panelists.
So I guess that goes to the point that, like having those resources made available- and I believe we have those contacts with our district manager uh- is that right, jesse yeah.
What's the benefit of forming a merchant association or a bid during this time, uh and then second, how can that translate into providing restaurants and other small businesses in chelsea and hell's kitchen organized closed streets for outdoor dining?
You know, I think they will come back it's just like.
We have found- and maybe wendy can speak to this as well, because I know when you and I have gotten around in circles, sometimes trying to help out small business in our in our district that are affected by numerous different things, one being all of the all of the ddc street projects that that take up all the frontage in some small small restaurants.
Tell me if I'm wrong eric and michael that, if, if a group of restaurants or a group of owner small businesses are part of an association that can receive funds, they can receive, it gives them a lot more access to either funds from the city directly or or um grants, or things like that um and certainly does allow.
So I would just say that in our my experience, that is true that, if um, it might be a little more extra work on your guys's at small business ends because got a lot to handle, but it does when it comes down to something like how to you know how to quickly get that access to those programs.
It also gives you the chance once you've gone to a training, to set up time with a person one-on-one to chat through some of those issues, so a helpful resource for small businesses, but then again, if uh, if you're an actual association with a merchant's association or a bid um to be able to learn a little bit more about how to communicate.
Since we are just living in a life where we can't rely on on foot traffic anymore, you wendy- and I think that kind of I want to ask everybody to give their last pitch and any uh shout outs to their businesses or uh businesses that they know and need.
Well um I mean I think all businesses are in need.
You know and right now all the people of new york.
For us I mean just remaining local here and getting to to know people right around here.
It's the walk around getting to know people more around here that I will do more of um and through venues like this.
Well, I think I'd like to second daniel's point about positive messaging, really feels like new york is one of the safest places in the country right now, and I think we've done an amazing job getting here and we don't make enough of a big deal about that and then in terms of restaurants, because those are the small businesses that I know best, I don't know any that are not operating at a loss right now, a huge loss and an anticipation of future losses, just in the hopes that things are going to get better people are sticking it out.
So I would just hope that if anyone is brave enough to go out to a restaurant right now be really kind, you know if people don't have what you're expecting what you want.
