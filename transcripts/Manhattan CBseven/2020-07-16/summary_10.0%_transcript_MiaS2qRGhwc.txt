We've got an incredibly interesting topic, a topic that I learned about a handful of years ago, called Reese sort of justice that piqued my interest and we've been sort of trying to play with the idea of getting it on board, and we have so I'm excited to learn something today, a goal now to mark for a moment and then what we're gonna have is Julian I'm gonna, let kind of introduce it and I'm gonna have him sort of introduce our panelists because he really did all the work.
So that's number one I also want to thank Courtney, as we always think our records takers so Courtney's taking the notes and she'll get the first question of the day.
I see there's a lot more folks here, which is really exciting, but I wonder if maybe just for the sake of the time we can just kind of pick eight to nine people that will participate and everyone else will be able to watch.
Think I, don't know if Stevens here anymore, but I can I can give a quick introduction for my friends, yrj yeah, so I'll be really brief, so that we can get into the circle, but basically I think a lot of the as a committee.
Who's here today is examining another sort of the solution to that in a way and I think as a committee we've had meetings where we talk about like the s tag report, URI talked about gifting, talented programs or underfunded.
Youth programs- and these are all symptoms of problems within our system and so I think this will be a really good opportunity for us to hear from students and adults who are working together on restorative justice, which is sort of not a saline antidote.
But it's a way of dismantling systems of disproportionality in schools, so the students just to give you an introduction, we're very grateful to have two student members of Y RJ and Ian Addie, and we have their adult partners Emily and Michelle who work as directors of restorative practices, for the affinity, schools in the New, York, City, Department, occation, office of safety and youth development.
You know inequitable practices, but also that, hopefully we can pass something as a committee and maybe bring something back to the individual spaces we inhabit as students as parents, as teachers or as just members of the community.
But we are my RJ and we are youth for the presidency, based in Brooklyn, comprising of students from all five boroughs on that go to New, York City, Public Schools and we are authentic partnership, he's an adult partnership with our facilitators that are here and we kind of take what we've learned from our adult facilitators and then now facilitate to other people like we're doing right now we take the work that has been here for centuries, such as sort of like restorative practices, and we implement it into our schools in our everyday lives in our communities, because it helps it flourish better and it brings a sense of comfort ability and vulnerability being able to share your fullest self and still combat issues like you face like inequitable stances and disproportionality.
Thank you no problem, any other questions so like Julian introduced them before we have our adult facilitators, who will not be participating in the circle, just so free time sake or whatever, but we have our wonderful partners, Emily, Michelle and Pilar, but sorry our check-in.
It kind of grounds the space since we're all in a virtual platform, but we're coming from all sectors of life right now we don't know what each other is going through, but it gives a sensibility for other people to see where people are at what people should be aware of in the circle or most people should be aware of in the space and just something for me or something cool to get it off.
So I could say you know I feel like Sony or I'm happy, so I'm gonna pass the talking piece to number three, which is corny I mean Rosa I.
Also, a member of this of cb7 and of this committee I'm also having trouble coming up with a word that starts with R I know my mind is racing and running, but that's about my mind, because a lot of things went on today in at work and I.
I know I'm supposed to do something with pee and I guess she's perplexed about just there is so much going on and my own inability to make things happen as fast as I'd like them to and just that's where I'll leave it so I'll pass it along to number eight I think you, my name is Antoinette and I am a member leaf.
I just want to give you guys some background on what restorative justice and its practice are so we're sort of justice is in essence, a way of being that gives people a space to be vulnerable and to flip that holistically, it gives people a chance to build relationships and repair relationships and hold the respectable on kind of bonds.
So a restorative justice has three basic tiers that it can be open down to so tier one is the most important and what you people need to spend the most time on which is community building now, without this tier, the rest of the tiers do not work and will not work correctly.
So if disrespect happens or for slur is said in the classroom or in a room or in any other community that you're in that space, you can go in and now that you have mutual respect and vulnerability built into your community, it can actually address it because we're sort of justice is that is less accountable, holds these people accountable.
You're sort of this is one thing on there's a big umbrella for sort of practices, and it just gives you a space where you're able to be vulnerable, where you feel needed, where you look that as a person not just for what you bring, but for everything, you're bringing everything you are, and it's just a really good place to be I'll.
So, as Andy said why we are here creating a space that is safe for people, so norms allow people to come into the space and not be them their real selves and complete selves, and this is not know like kumbaya I expect we're really trying to get down to the nitty-gritty, and even though we get down to the degree, and sometimes we try to touch the surface, we often step on each other's toes sometimes, and we want to create something that will allow people to put these things in place, which is like hey.
Don't forget that I've kept this as norm, because I want to be able to feel comfortable and complete in this space, so the virtual circle community norms that we have for today are open mind, open heart, coming into a space and realizing that you're coming into new things and ideologies and be ready to take it in speak your truth.
It can just be realize that people are allowed to be themselves and doesn't have to put like another face of when they're trying to be honest about the situation and respect respecting everybody's beliefs, ideologies, feelings, attitudes or something, and just having respect for wrong general, so yeah opening sim.
Think back to a time during this experience that you were able to or like your school leaders or whatever the case may be at that time, and what did you perceive from that community or it could be an individual person that allows you to be vulnerable to your true self and expression so and Tyler will help recorders that help us record that in the chat, so one two three words that allowed you to be vulnerable, so I start us off to model.
As adebola said, I really need to hear back that you're kind of understanding what I'm saying what I'm being open about understanding where maybe, if I did something wrong or if you know I'm, not judgment and just fun where we weren't just it didn't feel so serious thing.
You know, maybe to bed, then number five I thought of my experience working in high school on the school paper, where we had common goals, common effort to deadlines had to get stuff done had to do it.
Thank you guys so much I'm gonna take this until I'm, really sorry that Krishna cannot participate right now, yeah, it happens so I'm gonna take it since our second prompt that Tyler will drop again in the chat.
So thinking about again, security needs so reflect on a time that you were not able to reach, but you really needed to be and what got in the way so I'm gonna give like my story.
I did the best I could I was a pretty good student, but there wasn't much space at home, for any vulnerabilities, I mean I had to just be into academics in the summers I worked, you know, and it was.
I would have liked to have a little more space to just be a teenager and I felt a lot of pressure to be an adult and I will pass that up to Courtney, okay, I think again, I was almost I grew up in a place where it really wasn't okay to be different and there's a reason why I actually like ended up in New, York City very quickly as quickly as I could and so I would say almost every other time.
Where warrants it would be, wonderful in school were basis where people didn't really know me and didn't know that they kind of had a person like kind of had to be persistent to open me up, but also thinking back spaces, where teachers and administrators kind of put the pressure of me being a role model like hey, like you're, your president, you can be like actually honest or so I felt I so censored in a way that I knew I couldn't, say things because teachers were looking at me to be like be a role model to their student to the room, so like I knew I couldn't say that I couldn't be honest, so I think in those kind of spaces, I couldn't be me and I couldn't move honorable when I needed to be so yeah I'll fasted back to miss edible right back to you.
So there's a quick 25 minute circle, but I think having places like this is so important, especially in schools and while kids are going through growing pains and stuff at home and social unrest.
You know, I, think a lot of educators and people who end up growing up and being policymakers forget what it feels like to be a student.
In conversations and the be more harmful than helpful, so that's just something really important and why we think work and we're sort of dust is just needs the every school in every community.
So there's two kids from each school I mean used to we used to meet in person every to every two weeks on a Friday, so ease the meet and just really build our knowledge on what circles are wherever sort of this has come from ways we implement sort of justice into our school and then from what we learned in our larger school meetings.
Each student member would then take it back and build their own restorative justice, school-based team, so then kind of what we learned from our larger meetings.
So there are schools where every single day, every single student and staff member participates in a circle like you just did in with the with the purpose of building community and building relationships.
As schools, that would be good fits to kind of go in phase one of this expansion I think the goal is to expand it to the entire city at some point, but there are lots of schools that were doing this work long before this expansion effort started and that was really driven by the school community.
Let's go out and catch up, and sometimes and very often it's driven by a teacher or a paraprofessional or a group of students who learn about the work and get kind of a small group, really excited and then grow it throughout the school.
So we might have some schools that have been practicing this for 50 years, because the way that they interact and the way they engage and recognize one another's humanity is just a part of their foundational values as Antoinette's folks who, in the presentation what we see in schools, is really borrowing and adapting from indigenous practices that have been going on for thousands of years right around the globe, and so some schools are just already founded and positioned in that way in terms of interacting with one of the building community having strong systems for addressing and repairing harm and welcoming folks back when reentry or reintegration is necessary.
There are some schools, though, that are brand new to this and may just be hearing about it and are entering it as a way to kind of heal their school culture, but I think the most important thing is recognizing the work starts within, and so it's not necessarily a script or protocol to be followed, but really shifting the way we see and interact with each other day to day great okay.
They are each assigned a point person, a coordinator who reaches out to their school and supports them through a process of implementation and introduction to the work and then, as Tyler said, there's lots of folks that have been doing this authentically for years, and so often they have kind of found their own resources through a lots of great partner organizations and different opportunities that the department ed has offered through osek just kind of open to anybody.
This is just like a like a little thing that help people but there's a whole other thing besides in it, but how she notes is basically like somebody feeling something within the circle that they're not okay, with it's not sitting right with them and they're, saying ouch and the person.
These circles can go really deep, because we all need to unpack things, because we realize that we're not unpacking things with any within ourselves and even though we don't want to it now reflects in what we're doing so, whether it be policymaking, whether it be being a teacher, whether it be being a student, if I, don't know pack things as myself, which I really don't want to do to I'm older, but now that I'm in the space was just like I'm granted with opportunity to speak to people that are ready to listen and ready to take it in it's beside.
What's going inside, you're still bringing your true self, but this does it need to hear all of you and somebody else can hear it privately and hear that you're still like hurting or whatever the case may be or whatever that so I don't want it to seem like if somebody felt like they couldn't say anything that when we got swept in the wrong, but just knowing that I the circle can evoke that type of emotion.
Do you want to talk in the hallway, and that does happen, so there are a lot of different ways that people are supported.
Anything else right all right, Ken, thank you for coming today, very nice to see you and the at the yl meeting, and let's have you answer whatever questions you have yeah I'm actually here for something that a new business but I was very interested in this I'm, a member of community board 7, also on the Transportation Committee and the parks and Environment Committee I get my question was this so far to me seems very abstract and I was wondering if you could give a couple of concrete examples as to why how one of these circles starts, what props it you know, I assume it has something to do with.
They'll be like oh, hey, we're trying to implement this work in school, but we're gonna send you somewhere to train you first, so you can come back and bring it to us.
So that's how it was, and then we went into this space and you were greeted with pizza and smiles, and then we try to see what we can do from there and we sat in a circle like why are we sitting in a circle, obviously like how you guys are new to this and citizen a circle and as we were going along, you were learning, but we were understanding that we needed this to help fix what was going on and most of the time.
Like any said, people implement our G when it's too late so like, for example, if there's a fight that happens within school you're trying to know sick kids that are already angry and full of rage in a circle with somebody that they'd even build community with in the first place, so I didn't know what boundaries to cross with you.
All these things, if you're, not understanding why a student is the way they are, you can't actively try to change them or discipline them without understanding what got them to that point and I'm positive, and you can explain that a bit more things like Eddie said we came into the space, not really knowing what we were there for not really understanding what it would leave -.
Maybe community building games, you know learning each other's names and their name where we're from and the places would like to be in so there's getting to know new circles.
You just pause and hear one we're just kind of just building the relationship more and then gradually and slowly as months past, we saw those circles come from just getting to know each other's names and where we're from talking about family deaths and stuff, that's something that happens so naturally, as that community, like kind of gradually builds and -.
So some people do like to call it transformative, justice, I'm fancier, second question in terms of maybe community and feeling having a vulnerable space and people being able to be holistic and bond and needed.
Eddie yeah, you got it starts, but what we're saying is that, like right here, I, don't I, don't know anybody, but I learned that Rosa went to all-girls classic school, like I learned that from being in circle with Rosa, but it's not like I, but up fighting Rosa and then she's, like the reason why I'm like this is because I was an all-girls Catholic school I mean at first I knew that there was a boundary for her first.
Yes, finally, and it's okay- and you just add, I- think you did a beautiful job of explaining like what builds up so conflict and how we, you know, end up in a space where we need to heal harm.
So, for example, Emily and I have worked at a school together where we really worked really hard to implement restorative justice, and we realized a lot of the work needed to start on the adult level.
Those important steps you need to slowly build your kids are able to feel comfortable in space and be like okay, maybe I do want to open up.
Let me not to have to students how about this process to make sure that do you know anything like how are you making sure that the kid that people come to the table since it sounds like the venom rita's back here, is to have people in the room before any before issues?
There and I think that one of the ways that we try to get every voice at the table is by letting as many people as possible experience what this is and what it feels like and as they've all they've said.
It's a way of existing, and so when you shift a school's culture in such a way that everyone knows that there is opportunity to be heard that there's opportunity to be seen that there's opportunity to be vulnerable when you provide constant spaces for people to participate in.
So it's a it's a huge array of things that have to happen, but really it's shifting the entire culture in the school, so that people realize that if they want to have voice, there's an opportunity for it and then you start to get a lot of different voices so just in the same way that they passed a talking piece during circle.
I, don't want to give you the wrong number I know that the operating budget in terms of kind of purchasing power in per session, so OT PS in per session, was about three and a half million, but that does not include a staffing budget, and so we could get that it's public information I could get that and send it to Julian to share if you'd like but I, don't know it offhand.
There was one person that was in my group, but I didn't want to be in that group, because I didn't think this person I thought this person was mean because of their face or their expression, and then, when this person shared in a very vulnerable way, their wounds in their life.
So and I know that the general fundamental principles that are so important in any sharing is safety and boundaries, and you know, and of course that includes being in an environment- that's non-judgmental, you know, and so I'm, adding a little bit to what Arena said and I was having some a similar thought that which is that, unfortunately, tragically there's so much abuse in the society of every kind, physical, verbal, emotional, sexual abuse that I have to imagine that much of this will be benign and will foster friendships or relationships, but I have to imagine that some people will be triggered and then I guess.
We mandate that folks go through really extensive training around how to facilitate and how to hold this space before they begin doing this work and as addy and Andy pointed out, one of the things that has driven home in that training is that you have to start this work at the foundational level of just that kind of, like very low stakes.
The way they did was that they wanted to kind of have adults experience having to write off the back without having built any relationships have to talk about being vulnerable because when this work isn't done well, this is what we ask students to do all the time without creating that safe community first and so as Andy kind of shared at the end, like you have to create that safe container before you start asking people to be super vulnerable.
Don't know that people are gonna be open to discussing I mean talking in situations where there may be gang members and I'd love to hear your thoughts on you know dealing with this on a community level dealing with this in a school we're in a Middle School, where gangs that may be recruiting people and beating each other up so I be curious to hear your thoughts on that thanks Peter thanks all for that question.
So, to your point, I'm just a circle back that building a restorative culture takes time, and so we would certainly recommend that those trust that trust that relationship has already been built before we use restorative justice as a means to begin having a difficult conversation.
If you don't have that relationship with the young person, any other questions Peter, you said you have a bunch you're, muted, now, I'll, let other people ask I, mean I've, got a lot of questions about community and trying to do this, but Tyler.
If we find that there isn't capacity within the school building, so, for example, if you're not able to identify folks who are either trained to do this work or have the right relationships to do this work, that's definitely a resource that you could reach out to help solve some of the community issues.
You know we're normally used to seeing in schools, but if actually maybe live in the neighborhoods, and some of our young people have been in their shoes and can actually come in and I've worked with them, where they help do mediations in very difficult situations, and things like that, and so again thinking of our schools like really how part of your sort of justice is.
So data is always a tough conversation, especially around restorative justice, because a lot of the work is so qualitative right, and so it's changing the way we feel about one another things of that nature.
That's a great question, I think it's the question that, like everyone wants to know the answer to all the time from us, because a lot of people want a lot of schools and kind of policymakers.
That needs to happen to kind of address what we talked about today, which is that that's not really going to be particularly effective if you haven't built community first and you haven't built these systems and structures that allow people to lean into the experience with that said, there are lots of examples of using these practices to help address harm on even when strong community does not exist.
It can only work when the people involve are willing to engage in the process in an authentic way, and so what we've often seen in schools is that, as you are growing tier one, which is that community building stage where you're teaching everyone the practices, you're building those relationships, harm will happen simultaneously.
People won't be like we won't cause any harm for the next two years until we've built really strong systems and structures and community harm is gonna, happen simultaneously right, and so what we often see in schools is that there's kind of like a dual approach during those years, which is that for when there's moments of harm individuals that are prepared to kind of go through an authentic experience, where they're willing to take ownership, they're willing to acknowledge what has happened, what's gone wrong, they're willing to take responsibility, they're invested in trying to repair it, we will Willie support those schools in thinking about like okay.
We can offer like when it came to like Kenny, for example, Kenny's able to help people that come into the space that doesn't really understand English when it was somebody else there they didn't know.
I've been a part of circles where we've meditated together for ten minutes and like that, I definitely think that it benefits the circle when my fluence is a part of, but the circles can show up in a lot of different ways, but I'm -, Sean, - Eddie's thing I have seen the support of a lot of bilingual students with my circle, experiences and Kenny, being one of them, where maybe students who think both lambda transpose seen a lot of patience with the rest of the people in the circle, about I'm, really trying to listen and letting them just learn along the way.
I, don't know if why is always fun, but today it was so I see a lot of smiling faces, so it was certainly a different meeting, but a very pleasurable meeting and I'm gonna hand it to Julian -, just close things out, because any last words did you like to give I come on the spot.
You may get a call from mark killer to facilitate at a steering committee because it seemed like these practices may be best used for some sounds like we happen that big, because, when you think of safe spaces, you think of the community, oh yeah, I, guess I used to close out well, I, think yeah I, don't know I like a lot of a lot of the work that we do on.
You know approving something disapproving something and there's certainly work to be done with this in terms of approving then and not approving stuff funding is certainly a big aspect of it, but I think meetings like this are very important and it's one of the reasons why I really love yl committee, because it's not necessarily an incredibly tangible thing, but we're all gonna walk away from this meeting with an important understanding, restorative justice and we're all involved with school committees in some way, and so whether we're taking this back to our own communities or whether months from now we're having a.
You know 20% of the people who live in our in our district are our youth under the age of 18 and they're, not heavily represent on the community board, and they often don't attend meetings and so I think it's really important that we involve them, especially when we're you know trying to help them, whether it's from the youth programs that we were discussing last month or in school, so anyways I'm really grateful for everyone from yrj who came and spoke.
We want to challenge ourselves this year, not to say that we should have rubber stamping from what's the year before, but you know, maybe this is the year with all of the other things going on with all the conversations that we may really wanna to take a you know, a strong look at what we put in we've got to start the process.
So those are the two so in terms of practical steps, Steven we're a little late in the process, but there are good reasons why we are the smart way to do this would be to as a committee, and it doesn't have to be online right now, but before by your September meeting, to have a list of bullet points of items that you want to cover, they can be items that have been covered in the past and they can I hope include items that have been either reimagined or created anew for this year's analysis and then at least two have begun, if not to have gone a long way toward identifying and reaching out to those people outside of our circle.
I know, there's some new board committee members: it's our district need statement that we do want to be yearly on a yearly basis.
I just want to mention that that's out there and I think if the Bank Street book story can be saved, I'd love to see the community board support in any way.
I would think that the most that we could do is to say that I'm sorry to be so basic, but bookstores are good, and this is a particularly venerable institution that defines a part of our community culture I'd be happy to say that in some way, but let's take this offline, if we can yeah, that's all I really have I want to be creative, but still somewhat respectful, because there's often more to a story like this, then we are aware of it in the first blush.
So I don't know if the do-e and the d-o-t are talking about this, but I think you know we need to be pretty creative and flexible, and we have this amazing space around every single school.
So you know the idea of how do you come out of school and maybe you know in a safe place coming in the fall, how do kids maybe spend a little time with other people?
So I don't want to read it out because I'll take a bunch of time, but I think I'm gonna send it to everyone's email and it basically talks about how they support, having the use of school streets of streets in front of schools for either classes or entering the school.
I do worry about what this looks like in January, as opposed to September and for a school to sort of organize outdoor classes in a very changeable climate becomes really quite difficult, so I think there's a lot of work that would need to be done to figure out how to make this sort of feasible in New York, but it obviously is very compelling, as a way of beginning to find space for students to spread out.
The idea I think one is just what the logistics are and how it works, especially when schools need to have their plans together by August and I'm really unclear.
I. Think, there's like with the rapidly evolving question of what school will look like this year, there's a question of how the open streets can be made use of and that's something we don't really know, because the actual status of schools is still somewhat up in the air.
This is the question of just what it is and how it works, and then there's also the question of timing for the community board to get involved, because even if we're to pass a at a new business resolution right now, we wouldn't be able to vote on it as a full board until September.
And do we want to be just general saying that we support the idea or do we want to be really specific about what it is and what we want it to look like I, get to feedback first and then open it up and just specifically at one of the areas I think it could be interesting is if you're still gonna have a drop-off and a pickup, and the concern is you're.
Oh, maybe there's a way to use that to create safe spots was the thing that jumped in my mind, right away, but again a lot of details and because there's a lot of details, I mean I would be reticent to do a resolution out of yl because of that I'm a as mark knows, kind of a stickler for process and rich mean you've talked a little bit as well I like to get a lot of community feedback.
Potentially, even if you know it's a different kind of learning that happens, five I can understand, there's some safety issues and obviously the weather but I'm curious about what people might have checked you about this I'm.
But as a play area- and it's I mean it's a great idea, but it's really a hard thing for people for the schools to actually work so I think we're present.
You know we, when you sit through PTA meetings or PA means there's a huge conversation about school security, and this is a huge breach in school security and it's at a time when one doesn't really know what school security is going to look like as it reforms itself and as budgets get cut and I'm going to jump back to another conversation where mark was talking about the city budget as what we were doing for the district needs, we're gonna have less money.
We cook for kids coming and going through school, but I don't think in a lot of cases.
So thank you for joining us at all and I thought, since you were foolish enough to reach out to me during this meeting to say, should I join, of course I'm going to say yes, but we're talking, you probably picked up the threat, but we're talking about a new business item having to do with whether or not it would make sense and if so, how to try to make streets and public way available to schools for their use in the coming year.
I was a texted mark because I remembered that this meeting was going on and someone in the other that I'm also on right now, which is the d3 green committee, and the sole purpose of that meeting tonight is to talk about outdoor space learning and in the chat someone mentioned that you know.
You know they're trying to make things work, but they are under challenging circumstances so that anything that could come from the community or the community board would be positive.
So the reason that I'd hate to let process keep us from having a voice in the issue and if we don't weigh in time will pass, and it means that we just won't be involved in the decision when I think that a lot of us feel pretty strongly that this is a good idea addressing IRAs concerns and Mark largely addressed it.
A number of us do feel like it is something we do want to weigh in on and if we don't do it now, it means it's gonna pass by without us having a voice or see me.
Yeah I just want we're getting a little bit late here and I want to sort of close this topic down and say again, I think I'm, very supportive of it, but I'm, but I wouldn't be prepared to do a resolution for the points that I had said.
So I am comfortable putting out a letter the letter if the letters from Y yell there, the community board I'm fine with that as well, but I think that's how I would feel about it, and you know if we can move on I mean that that's what I would that's, how I feel about very good.
So let me just confirm in a second I: don't want to show up the wrong night yeah right now, they're sort of say you know it's part of their main, their making sure that there is some live learning in the summer school, but there's still no guarantee or any direct feedback that a high school or anyone has to do might learn.
You know, I think there is no there's minimum to if you're working if you're at the kids at school, you know he's gonna, have a minimum of three hours or to our online a live instruction.
So you can sort of add that as well, meaning that we'll have more dialogue about this topic and okay, but I just I just want to make sure that people understand same thing for like yeah I get.
