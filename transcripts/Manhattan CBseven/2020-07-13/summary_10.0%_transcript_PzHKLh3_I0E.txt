They had a woman on today who basically study gorillas and apes in Africa, and she was saying that we as humans have to stop separating ourselves from nature and not understanding that we have to share diseases jumping in to mankind the way that they are herded together, like markets all over the world right yeah.
But you know what her comments were about, how you know we have to learn how to live with nature, and you know the plan I just completely the hours up, but we have to change how we do things and how we interact, because she said you know everything that the animals are being crowded together now they have less space to throw in the wild, so to speak, yeah we're coaching on their grounds and they're coming back, but they're coming back at us, but it's really their territory that we're in costar we're developing their areas.
Oh. This is so weird I, don't missing a number of committee members, yeah Susan, IRA, the leader, yeah I, don't think we'll leaders on housing anymore, harvest going on twice: okay, that's genetic!
Coming to all the meetings and there's trees at the foot board mark you know, I sent you that email and I'm- sorry, you replied to me, but I did something evil to it and it disappeared so yeah.
What happened is that mark make sure that the full board meeting that there was affordable housing going up on 79th, Street and I asked him where okay conversion, it's building on 79th Street, that was it's been taken over by project open, I, see on 79th yeah, it's there's a developer, that's taken over and they hired project open to run it project find I, mean project.
So yes, hopefully not, but you know: Thank You Melissa between the haircuts just enjoy the law right now, but I guess marks having problems, give him another minute and then oh sorry, that was me.
So I, don't know the agenda, never got posted I, think which is my bad it's to look at the DNS of what was supposed to do right.
I guess starting come September I feel like it's kind of a new community board year and I.
Think we want to embed into both of those discussions a lot of thoughts about weaving NYCHA and the needs of residents into our work.
So I think, let's start with the DNS and budget priorities, and we can look at we did last year, but I think you know for context.
Cedilla sent out that memo that sort of asked us all to be a little bit more thoughtful about how we compile them this year, with so little city money likely available next year and to sort of really think through what should float to the top of our list.
And you know just based on our committee to me it would seem the needs of NYCHA, both capital and operating in our district would be a major priority and I sorry I'm just reading a message from Larry wood from that's, where a law project also suggested, like rental assistance or eviction prevention funding for people who are in rental housing in our district judge agree.
Are they like big asks that are sort of like larger policy issues, or are they more concrete things that are actually in our district that we think we could maybe get as opposed to being more of a coalition of voices?
And you know I'd like to hear what everyone's thoughts are on like what is the right scale of ask to be targeting and Louisa?
For me, okay I just want to talk Terkel, okay, because I looked at that list that Cindy sent around and everything that was the five of them for housing and that included the playground in the Senior Center of Frederick Douglass.
No, absolutely not I think as a Housing Committee we're dealing with housing and that's our focus and it's the single mindedness flower of our argument and our attack, and then there, of course, there are different elements of housing, but the priority, if we're going to exert our energy effectively, has to be in Nitra, because that is the that is the ongoing issue.
That's the bear month, that's the big one: that's what I call the black swan in housing in the city of New, York, okay and so I think that we should not take into account these other considerations that are very important but they're, not our work.
What plan and I'm a realist so I know what the real estate interests, how it looks at nature, okay and, of course, I'm on the wrong side of real estate.
I made a comment of what I would like to add with respect to another sector, the mitchell-lama which I know a lot about, but it's I'd like to stay on the night, Racine yeah, let's hold on for a second I, just want to say a few things just for like run of meeting I understand.
If we just like all start speaking without knowing what we're working towards and just again to assert my initial question, it's sort of do we want to focus on like a larger scale, asks or smaller asks that are more specific to our district, so just again to pose that and I want to hear what people to say about it and I think Jeannette I did you you've wanted to speak front, you ahead and then Roberta yeah I would, from my experience of district need.
Statements are a little bit of a procedure that city agencies and Ownby have to go through, but the easiest thing is when a community board gives a big rambling discussion, and the agency's response can be okay.
Talk to this guy talk to that guy, okay, we're in agreement, but we don't have funds for that right now, I'd, like the way that we wrote everything last year, but I think within that we should have a specific, discreet, ask and I would just say the plate.
Douglass playground I've put that on in the last three or four years and got criticized a lot because I'm not I am usually not in parks, meetings and parks has its lists of things and I bring it up and people see it as a parks item.
The Douglass playground for the past 20 years has not really been renovated, other than cool well, other playgrounds have been renovated more than once and I think if our community board is going to put it its money where its mouth isn't saying that we're looking at a fair, equitable approach to improving our public environment.
Procedurally, the Housing Committee should ask should send a recommendation to park any that particular playground is our number one priority and that we'd like parks to consider that, because I think they're always upset that Outsiders coming in suggest.
If you will for lack of a better word, they looking to generate funds and I think what we need to focus on I mean not about the DNS, but I think we need to focus on what NYCHA is going to do, because whatever we decide and I guarantee this by dealing with nature, doesn't matter so I think we're gonna find something like Robert was saying.
Do feel that part of that statement should include a statement that money should be allocated to the nature development C on the Upper West Side, to improve conditions as clause capital, because well as the former chair of the Housing Committee, we always spoke about repairs all the time we always focus at cetera, but whatever happens downtown with the agencies.
Okay, I don't want to invalidate this discussion because it is very important, but it is also a bit apart from what our goal is here tonight, which is to nail down our budget priorities and I to the second piece of our agenda tonight: I'm very open to making this a whole meeting like in September I.
So there are a lot of issues that are going on that we really need to look at what I am asking.
You is that if you guys can have an open policy for the tennis to sit down with you when you are making these type of decisions, because most of us are hands-on all day long and it's only right if people are making decisions for our developments, we need to be there a great Carmen.
I mean you totally run 4,000 residents and plus, because you know I'm one that whenever any development caused me alcohol, so we are all working together and it's only right that we sit at that table and be respected as such, because we're the ones on the ground and anything that hits Douglas hits to me.
I want to reinforce what Melissa said, there's a lot of good work that needs to get done, and so, let's focus on the right path forward.
Nobody knows our developments like we do and while you make Resident recommendations, you have going on at wise towers currently during Kovac, which should not be happening.
So, while you're deciding what to do with money, we've already had money allocated to having our community rooms we've had floods in them, we've had floors, collapse, ceilings collapse in our community rooms, and we have been working with our elected official and the heads at night Chuck to get our rooms renovated and without asking anyone for a penny just again to I guess to clarify in the district need statement about your priorities.
It's just how we basically tell the city agencies what we think they need to prioritize in our district and also they can be used as a tool to push elected officials occasionally to also help fund things without what, with whatever discretionary funding, they have parry be funny with the funds when they get designated to playgrounds.
Okay, in terms of wise towers, if you had to name some capital neat, I, guess I, don't know with packed going on it's harder to think through like how to add something to our budget priorities.
Now we have Pleasant Avenue coming down this way, which is you know, it's development against development, and so, in order for my seniors to be safe, we need to finish the rest of the doors and get them done.
Okay, that's helpful, and definitely something that's something we can ask for easily yeah I got it correctly, guys I'm, making a couple of notes here myself.
So you know that needs to be addressed with capital funds, okay, to put and secure entry doors to the building's if the doors at the front are unsecure.
You I like exactly what you said Anna you should do that I mean we can both I think it's you know.
- I don't know if it's just like their stops: fine, they just don't do their jobs or maybe it's both, but we could definitely think about putting in an expense for the personnel.
You know the right thing might be more to have like a doorman service there of these buildings, rather than some security cameras and punitive way yeah.
Not you know they're forcing the door open after it's been fixed, so it might be nice to take a new approach to this and not just be oh, it's a security issue.
You know I, agree that everybody's there to help people yeah so I saw someone in the chat mention elevators I'm, assuming that's so I Robert one second I just want to hear from anyone on the call who wants to speak to any buildings in particular that have elevators or constantly broken, and if we could get an address and we could include it as a capital item well, elevators are always being vandalized.
I'm not sure talk to the managers of each development and have you know, have the footage, my signal you can tell who's doing I say no drop so that I lose my place, yeah virtual doorman and then yes, my signal, and that is the trend, and that is very manageable.
It's not an ask, but it's something that we could help Helen out of HPD for nature in this district and we're talking about Amsterdam, Douglas Weiss, you know massive units and that 14 million dollars, if it belongs to my tree, belongs to my trousseau.
Let's again, I want to table this until we're all more informed and I also want it to be an open debate over what the right thing to do is in terms of honoring a previous agreement and what you know we see as important projects in our community and not just you know, come in with the solution.
But again, let's talk about it in September, okay, yeah, sorry and I wanted to speak on that Sharon Austin wrote, she's a Douglas, House resident.
So we want to mention that in the DNS statement, that would be great that we need more funding to expand the virtual program that was already implemented in 2011.
Is there anything you could think of that we could be helpful and requesting that could help the developments prepare for in case things get really bad again or continue to be bad if, since they are sort of still very bad on night campuses in terms of kovin my opinion, as you definitely need to focus on sanitization and cleaning, that is an area.
I would like to see money allocated for some kind of program, especially for the youth all right to be engaged, whereupon this way they can clean their own buildings after they've, gotten training, of course, but I do feel that that's a direction that we should go in I like that, any other thoughts on what it means as the president of the brownstones and because we have to walk up.
Okay, if any other attendees have something that they want us to add into the district needs a when we haven't touched on again, you can raise your hand, we're always happy to hear from you guys, I guess beyond nature.
And, of course everybody needs to take care, centers and but I think other committees are going to discuss that I.
Preventing evictions prevents poverty, so I think if you know that might be something we want to look at I, don't know that we can put it the DNS, but it might be something you little and that not only do you need to help the people that might be evicted.
So there's something that really needs we look at I will be talking to somebody about how it's being run and it's most of the time you know I'm being actually help which fish is calling me to help them out.
Maybe there's some room for collaboration with you know our Health and Human Services, Committee and but the tenant leaders said, look at the social services being provided on site and sort of like what are the gaps and what are the management issues?
I think that could be something we definitely look at this year: yeah, okay, Oh, open it before again, one last time and say any other housing items, Nitra or otherwise that anyone in attendance committee, non-committee, attendees public ta presidents wants us to consider, including please speak up.
I think it could be like a more universal ask that, like multiple committees- okay, yeah, but that yeah, it's important, don't compost thing yeah, we can put it over.
Yes, and that is a worthy agenda topic both because it's important and because we really, as Melissa said, need a bit of research and some answers from people in either elected or agency positions to tell us what the limits and opportunities are there I've just refresh every, but if you member back to when that happened, HPD was going to give us a report at one point they did give us a report at one point, but it would be a good time to have a second point: yeah, okay, and just so you know, I planted a seed with a number of folks, not the least of whom is Gale Brewer.
