I may take her out of sequence, then remarks by elected officials and then and then we'll go to the stakeholder groups, which will include goddard, riverside the upper west ciders for safer streets, the open hearts initiative, the west side, community organization, two block associations, two faith leaders, a co-op, condo board and then mark you're gonna back clean up.
If they, if they're, attendees and they're meant to be panelists from the community board, maybe they could contact rich or christian by phone I mean by email, I think, probably by text that'd be better but yeah they can mark.
I was insistent on because I know what it's like well we're grateful, I'm going to give two more minutes in hopes that the panelists all join and then we're going to get started because we got a only two hours and a lot to cover since we have dead, aaron gail's here.
My name is mark diller, I'm the chair of community board 7., welcome to our information session concerning the use of local hotels in our district for the protection of homeless, shelter, clients who were housed elsewhere to protect them from covin.
We have two hours and far more far more to cover than that could possibly handle so we're gonna, I'm gonna be moving us along as best I can, and I'm gonna be as tight as you've ever seen me about timing for everybody and with apologies to our wonderful elected officials who have joined us tonight, a couple more than I had anticipated, which is great- and I thank you for that as well, but we're going to ask everybody to keep it to two to three minutes other than the dhs and the service providers, because we're here to hear from them that's how this is intended to work.
I want to lay out just very quickly how the evening will go, I'm going to as soon as I finish talking and thanking just a couple of people we're going to turn to the department of homeless services.
We will then hear from let's see we'll then hear from depending on time principal monica berry is with us from ps87 one of the schools closest to two of the shelters, and I know that she has other duties with respect to exactly how it is that we're going to reopen our schools or are we or are they inside or outside, and so with apologies to the order of speakers, we're going to turn to her earlier on than perhaps the other stakeholders.
Thank you mark and thank you to the community board, to our elected officials and to everybody participating this evening to have you know over a thousand participants really says something in terms of individuals wanting to get information about the work that the city is doing to protect vulnerable new yorkers and also learn more about the services that we're providing.
This evening, they've really been at the front line of the response in terms of providing programs and services and really making sure that new yorkers, who have no place else to go really are connected, really are essential services during exact steps.
If I can I'd like to take a moment and sort of walk the audience and participants through the work that dhs has done over the course of these past couple of months to contextualize the conversation that we're going to have, I think it will provide some information and possibly answer questions that are coming and so wanna.
We started very early on when we were learning that this pandemic was unfolding of really working with our colleagues at health and hospitals at the department of health and mental hygiene, utilizing cdc guidance to determine how to respond appropriately to protect new yorkers who are in shelter.
If you remember very early on, we didn't have access to testing, and so we had to use a symptoms-based approach and a presumed positive to really make sure that we were taking care of the totality of our shelter system, and so that meant, if individuals were presenting with symptoms, we were able to remove them from those congregate settings place them in an isolation hotel until their symptoms subsided, thereby making sure that we were treating them as well as the shelter system as a whole.
Those calls continue each week every tuesday and following those calls, we send out an email, summarizing updates that occur each week, and this is across both the hra system and the dhs shelter system and back in april, very early on the new york times, credited us with the transparency in our reporting, which we were very proud of, because we think that transparency is important.
In the area of the upper west side, there are four commercial hotels that we're utilizing in cb7 and, as I said, 60 around the city, we worked to initiate these transfers as quickly as possible.
We entered into a contract with the hotels association of new york, so that way the agency could focus on serving our clients and we worked with providers to match them to hotels based on you know.
The size of the shelter that they were serving and how they were going to move those clients into the commercial hotel, the provider.
Also, it's not just moving the clients, they also moved their program, their social service staff, their security staff into the hotels as well to make sure that our clients, irrespective of where they were located, still had the availability of case management of housing, specialists of connections to mental health, to telehealth, to substance, use counseling and those sorts of things, as well as the opportunity to you know, continue to engage with staff.
We also continued our work on the streets in terms of ensuring that individuals who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness also had access to information to ppe.
One of the things that I think you and I might not be so attuned to, but the public spaces and the ways in which individuals use spaces has changed very significantly during the covid outbreak right, so many locations were closed, whether they be gyms or libraries, coffee shops, grocery stores, all types of things.
We've made sure that our outreach staff are informed on the locations of public restrooms that are available to ensure that clients who might be on the street know where to access those locations.
We acted with the priority of our clients and our provider staff in mind our essential staff, who showed up to work each day and we've been working with our communities to address issues that some of you have raised that have been raised through the community board that have been raised directly with providers and are glad that we've had the opportunity to have a couple of stakeholder meetings where we've heard from our elected partners from community boards from bids and other stakeholders in the community and then to be able to respond to some of those things.
I know that each of the providers are going to have an opportunity to speak later, but I wanted to give a couple of examples of the things that we've been able to respond to and that I think, are important.
We have regular canvasing that occurs on the upper west side by goddard riverside through our manhattan outreach consortium, the locations in and around the three hotels that we are using for our d density efforts are canvased regularly, multiple times a day across multiple shifts.
So when you call 3-1-1, that's in addition to the regular canvassing that's occurring in these locations, we've also been able to, through the conversations that we've had these past couple of weeks, remind our hotels staff or the excuse me, the provider staff that if they see somebody who their teams are trying to engage- and it turns out that it's not from one of the hotels that they're able to call our joint command center to ensure that dhs responds to make sure that we get a team out to address the needs.
The homeless outreach unit was disbanded, and we now are very much focused on ensuring that we're leading with our social services tools that we're working with clients to engage them, that we continue to focus on meeting the social services needs of our clients rather than using a heavy-handed enforcement tool.
They are popping up, which is a little distracting, but I want to make sure that we save time for the providers and then be able to dive into questions no matter how many times we do they zoom things.
It still takes a little bit of getting used to so thank you for your time and attention and I'll turn it back to the chair thanks so much, and thank you for your presentation before I turn to the service providers and I'll be calling on project renewal first, so perhaps we can unmute eric and whoever else eric designates.
It's a really tough time and I and our staff are committed to working together with all the community leaders here to help our neighborhood and all of new york recover.
You may not know much about project renewal because until july 27th we didn't have a presence in this neighborhood we've been serving homeless new yorkers for over 53 years today, we house over 2000 people, every night, half in seven shelters and half in permanent, supported housing, we've built or rehabbed.
Our vocational counselor had 15 individual sessions and one group of 11 clients case managers held 26 individual meetings, we're doing two joint patrols with help usa from the belclair, a peer engagement specialist made neighborhood rounds every two hours we distributed about 200 masks today and actually we've gone through 10 000.
For instance, the precinct now has a patrol car stationed at the hotel most evenings we've transferred 18 clients back to congregate, shelter for repeated failure to respect our good neighbor policy.
We're planning right now for our return to shelters, adding plastic dividers to create more spacing improving air, filtration and circulation systems, because we know we won't be in these hotels, much longer charlie katon- and I will be here to answer questions after the presentations are done.
We provide shelter and programs and permanent housing in over 65 different program, shelter and housing capacities serving over 4 000 people daily 90 of those folks are here in new york city.
We made that strategic decision, because we recognized very clearly that the upper west side was a much more residentially dead and dense neighborhood, and so we wanted to act as good neighbors right from the get-go.
So we feel like we've done as good a job as we can do in protecting our clients and staff, and I can't you know it's hard to overstate how difficult our work was, and I know for many of you on the on the zoom call as well who work with people in any capacity how difficult these decisions were and still are march april and may, as we all know, was a very difficult time, but without our ability to empty out our shelters.
So we have really have a low tolerance, a low threshold for clients who are just behaving inappropriately or having some challenges or difficulty and we're not moving them back just out of like keep them out of the neighborhood, but sometimes when they go back to their shelter, origin, they're, actually, a little more comfortable.
So now let me talk a little bit about what we need and we I've spoken with many community residents who live across the street down the street, and I really appreciate the outpouring of support.
I read a couple of the articles recently in some of the local papers and it really it really is great- to hear kind of cutting through some of the noise, but what we need for our clients look we're in business to put our homeless shelters out of business.
We need, we need more jobs, we need access to more employment right now we have clients working at places like sephora the new york times.
Among other things, we have a number of clients who work in other nonprofits and shelters, and we need to expand our employment opportunities for our clients and, lastly, and most importantly, regarding the work that we do is ending their time of homelessness.
I worked at four different places on the upper west side for about eight or nine years in my twenties, and it only launched my career and kept me going in homeless services for the ensuing 15 years thereafter.
There are things that we need from the community again in order to end our clients, time of homelessness.
I have those questions we will get to them, but we also have monica berry the principal of ps87 with us who has a another commitment coming right up, so I'm going to interrupt our flow to call on monica as a as a community stakeholder just a couple of minutes, please principal, but we're grateful that you're here and thank you please take it away.
Thank you for having me here tonight, so I actually have had the opportunity to meet with both project renewal and with help usa separately, along with the principle of ps9, to talk about what we can do just to ensure that we are all feeling safe in this situation, and so we discussed what we do in terms of the patrolling around the area, because I know that there has been concerns about people gathering in our play, yard and things of that nature.
We have numbers to call if there's anything that is going on, so we can reach out right away to talk to security to help us, so we definitely have been working with both organizations to make sure that we are doing all that we can, while school is in session to make sure the kids are safe.
If there's anything else, that's going on, particularly when we are entering the building our buildings in the morning and when we're dismissing in the afternoon and if there's any time during the day, if we're using our play yard, so we have been working with, like I said, both agencies with both of the organizations we'd, also like to have a conversation with the 20th precinct to talk about added protection that could come to our school to help us in maintaining the safety and security of the members of our community.
So so thank you for that and I'm gonna go turn now back to our service providers and the third one is cucs, and is that mr hannigan, or who is going to present on your behalf, yeah hi, it's tony hannity good evening and thanks to cb7 and manhattan, bro president gail brewer for pulling us together tonight.
I didn't know that about daniel about starting his career on the upper west side, I did too being part of clump university actually doing organizing in the single room, occupancy hotels at the time and and in some ways.
Cucs has 30 programs across the city that emphasize housing and restorative health and mental health services for homeless and formerly homeless, individuals and families, though what they look like is street outreach.
It was prior to testing, but we figured we had at least 20 coven cases at that point and in a congregate setting it's impossible to manage that and it's a threat for everybody in that shelter and it's a threat for the residential neighborhood that we resided in, and so we were grateful and remain grateful to be able to be at the billboard and we're actually very proud to have been able to as a staff to regroup so quickly and create recreate our program in a totally different setting, which was just it was uprooting for everybody involved, the staff, but also for the for the residents.
I think it was like tony said very disruptive to everybody, and we've worked very hard on trying to address the community concerns.
He has my cell phone number and we've been working with trying to create a great partnership with them, and I'd like to thank him and all the officers for the help that we've gotten from them, and I've also put out my number and people have reached out to me.
Last week we had some interruption because of the move, but we didn't move out somebody last week and we actually have about six more move outs scheduled right now, and I say that because my experience in the bronx and working with the community there is that when we start to move our clients out into permanency, we create the type of situation where they're invested in shelter.
And I think that kind of that kind of tangible benefit and that kind of tangible result is one of the things that I point to as being the progress we've made since we've moved in sort of getting ourselves situated, responding to the community concerns, responding to our clients, concerns and being the type of good neighbor that we have been in the bronx for many years, and I think that we're getting towards being on the upper west side, like I said, I'm at the site most days and I've spoken to many of you.
So I'm going to start turning to our our community partners, the first one would be deputy inspector naoki yaguchi, who is the commanding officer of the 24th precinct and, as I understand it, we'll be speaking on behalf of both the 2-0 and the 2-4 good evening.
I hope we have try to put a lot of cops out there on broadway, but a little bit more presence to counter some of the unpleasant things that the residents of the upper west side has seen.
We wrote a letter to commissioner banks, it's up on social media, it's going to be on our website and it certainly has been in our newsletters, and I am upset because if, in fact the city moves people into hotels without telling the community, then we can't plan- and I know you understand- you- don't want to be told- no not to go into the hotel, but you got to plan and right now we're in a situation where there's not a lot for the individuals to do during the day.
I have been begging dhs for more support so that people would know who's from which hotel and who is the individual working with goddard and the outreach I haven't been successful yet, but I think there might be one glimmer of hope to get more support and I just want to say that we do have a copy of the contract.
I do wish that we could figure out because I've got midtown too this I got the entire borough and I know all the problems that was in midtown two and a half hours a day, walking around same issues same problem, and I wish that we could figure out as a society that people have the kind of challenges, and I understand the need for covid be more secure in terms of not being in congregate, shelters.
I think thank you for being with us yeah, thanks for having me mark and thanks to all of community board, seven for hosting this important information session, and thank you to the hundreds and hundreds of residents who are participating tonight.
We are also experiencing the impacts of a growing street homeless population and, as I look through the comments in the chat, I think many of those comments have to do with the street homeless and, unfortunately, goddard riverside outreach is not on this town hall tonight, but we are actually oh great.
You know in agreement with gail, we need many more resources on the street to make sure that we are helping our street homeless actually agree to come in to shelter.
So how can we make sure that everyone feels safe on our streets and how can we make sure that the people living in the shelters are getting the services they need?
Thank you, council member, I'm now going to call on assemblymember, linda rosenthal and followed by senator robert jackson and brad hoyleman hi, everyone, hi mark and hi community board members and providers, and everyone else on this call.
It took many years, and here we all are, but the covet 19 pandemic has changed life for all of us, sheltered or not in a very short period of time, and the changes have been significant for many people's lives, incomes, housing situations and the future feels and is uncertain, and I've heard that sentiment from so many of you over the last several months.
I always say this communities need to be in on what is going on the city and the state at times cannot just place people without in a community without getting communities to be part of making it work, and no one learns their lesson, and this keeps happening maybe after this it won't, but there are hundreds of new people in a seven block radius and we also see a lot of people, including some in front of my district office, who are on the street.
But I do have a question about what the time horizon is going to look like what your epidemiologists or the department of health says is the figure for when it's safe for these men and women to return to congregate housing.
When is it going to be safe or are we are we looking at weeks and months, even though we're keeping the infection rate so low so, but thank you to all the providers for doing this work.
My name is adam herbs, I'm a resident of the upper west side for the last 20 years and tonight I'll be speaking on behalf of manhattan day school school in the community for more than 75 years, with more than 500 students from ages, 2 up to 14., the school is located on 75th street between west end and riverside drive.
I would like to thank the entire community board for inviting me to speak this evening and for facilitating this working group of schools and also expressed my most sincere appreciation to the providers and to the police and the 20th and 24th precincts for everything they do to keep us all safe, they've offered to increase the patrols near the school and have been accessible to speaking with us.
So we fully understand the city's plan to move these individuals to stop the spread of covid and agree that it was necessary in the middle of a pandemic, to save the lives of people who have nowhere else to go, but in the interest of full disclosure, the percentage of people with covet in the city is currently under one percent and has been for over two months now, and we really would like to understand what metrics will determine when this emergency will be considered over first as members of the community, we do intend to be good neighbors I and the school supports helping the homeless, but neither we or any of the other parents or school groups were given notice and input about the moves that were being made here, particularly the unacceptable number of registered sex offenders, moved so close to playgrounds in schools.
We propose a work group between the city and the dhs and the service providers, the police and members of the community, and I ask for serious consideration of this idea so helping with communication and transparency.
Our teams are out there daily, responding to not only through and ones but responding to hot spot locations and community concerns, as well as just canvassing the entire catchment area, engaging new folks and offering services.
Upper west siders for safer streets is a non-partisan facebook group that was formed by residents and local business owners out of collective concern for safety in our neighborhood, the facebook group was has provided a forum for information sharing and collaboration and solutions to address our concerns.
In addition, dhs placed 19 level 2 and level 3 sex offenders into temporary shelters without community notice or transparency.
The current situation affects everyone in our neighborhood, including the most vulnerable population, the homeless people who have been failed by the city by being left out on the streets or placing hotels with adequate social services and facilities to address their varied and complex needs.
You go okay, thank you for giving us a moment to tell our community about the upper west side, open hearts initiative, we're grateful for the work of the experienced and dedicated service providers that, as an emergency public health measure, have temporarily relocated to neighborhood hotels.
The upper west side is known as a welcome and diverse community in a short period and without any transparency, a large at-risk homeless population was relocated to three local hotels ill-equipped to serve their needs.
The answer, and many homeless advocates have noted that, in the case of micah shelter, clients, temporary hotel housing may create significant community problems, as well as fail to provide appropriate services to this at-risk population.
Just as the second hit occurred, we are asking our local officials to fix the failed homeless hotel policy that has put both the men and community at risk.
Mark and thank you for everyone: who's participating, I'm dale brown, president of the west, 79th street block association and I've lived on west 79th street for 50 years, when it was announced that 283 homeless, men with drug and alcohol abuse issues would be moving into the hotel.
It is the time we aim to set ourselves on the right path, as the community meets to discuss the temporary use of shelters in the upper west side neighborhood.
We are taught because we never know if we might be one of the people who one day need that same charity, and we want to promote a cycle of giving being homeless is not a crime, and it is not a personal failure.
As things go from bad to worse, it is vital that we work with the shelter providers to support them in their needs to serve the population, including more outreach workers to support their mission.
I would love to see and am willing to take a leadership role in seeing our community talk about and think about how we got here as a city and a country, many of the chronically homeless, who sleep on our streets and are not living in any of the three locations suffer from mental illness.
How is our city and state working to prevent drug use or provide adequate support for those who want to turn their lives around and perhaps most of all, what does the amount of people without homes in new york city say about our social safety net?
I hope and pray that we can ask questions of ourselves in this moment and to engage in the big picture long-term conversation if we believe that all people should live in dignity and have the chance to be safe, let's begin to think about the bigger issues and how we can do something to make our city more equitable and more hopeful for all who live here.
We are actively engaged in work, both with homeless individuals and also with a number of other residents trying to prevent additional people from experiencing homelessness.
We want to know what we can do to be constructive in this, the situation, what we can do to support the residents of these shelters and also what we can do to get to a healthier conversation about safety for these new residents and safety for a long time and ongoing residents of the west side, we're very interested in that, and- and so I just offer our whatever resources and help that we can offer to the situation, which is not ideal.
I know that if any community can figure this out, we can I've been working on the issue of homelessness and affordable housing about 35 years.
I also want to acknowledge the fear and concerns of some of the in this gathering field, but I must say in my experience of working with over 500 homeless individuals, I have never once felt threatened, so I think fear, even unfounded or largely unfounded, fear can be a very powerful thing, but I would suggest anyone who's afraid should get more engaged and we will learn that the fear is largely without merit.
They need to be part of the solution, and I know in my work with homeless individuals directly.
You know people that we have in our in these hotels, they're, going through the most difficult time in their entire lives.
Obviously it's 8 15 and it's obviously later getting to this than I had ever hoped we would, but I thought it was important to hear from our community organizations who asked to speak so we've done that we're going to go to q, a with the permission of the dhs team, I'm going to go right into questions and answers, and and we'll jump with that I'm seeing this drinkwater nodding.
These hotels be used for permanent shelter after the temporary uses is concluded, and then there were a lot of questions about fair share.
Thank you, okay, so on the the timeline for going back into congregate, shelters, what we know is moving into the commercial hotels has helped us in respect to the low infection rate that we are currently seeing.
Soon, there are a lot of unknowns beyond our control and we are working together with the medical experts to continue to make sure that new york city's infection rate as a whole remains low right.
The city is slowly reopening our experts at the test and trace location are minding the numbers to make sure that, if we're seeing increases in the infection rate that we're able to determine how and why that is happening, we'll continue to provide masks and testing to our clients in the single adult system.
The upper west side does have other locations that are used to house or shelter homeless, new yorkers, it falls sort of like in the mix of where the city is so that's those are the numbers I can provide you today.
Sure I will answer the question we provided this update and response both on last wednesday stakeholder call and then in writing to the borough president, with the hopes that it was getting disseminated into the community.
The city of new york places all of our clients in appropriate locations in accordance with state law, and we provide shelter to new yorkers experiencing homelessness, irrespective of their background.
What this means is individuals are able to get connected to programs and services that there's not restrictions on who and how people can come into the shelter based on their background, they're able to rebuild their lives and get a second chance, as opposed to being out in the street.
If you compare new york city compared to la you, see a stark difference in the numbers of new yorkers experiencing homelessness on the street compared to those in shelter who are connected to case management, housing, specialists, substance use, counselors and other resources to get a second chance and to get back on their feet.
I want to provide some information that I believe was useful on the call we didn't have any follow-up questions, and so I like to think that we were responsive.
The I'm going to shift gears and talk about we've heard a lot of questions about aggressive behavior, and this is where we have a confluence of shelter, clients and of street homeless.
There have been concerns about homeless, encampments and the regular presence of non-shelter client homeless in as being a part of the daily occurrence or experience on the street and as well as verbally aggressive behavior toward women and questions as to why they are permitted to remain.
If you could, please address what can and can't be done with respect to each of those categories of folks sure so I'll talk and I'll certainly look to the providers who can fill in the work that they're doing in the community.
So, but there's been a lot of questions about what to do when folks encounter and I'm sorry using words that I never thought I'd use in a community board meeting, but they encounter people masturbating or they encounter people being aggressive and so forth, and also when they encounter people who are engaged in drug activity, either using illegal drugs or buying and selling illegal drugs.
New york is our most vulnerable population on the street to care services and shelter, but to do that, we heavily rely on 3-1-1, so the app is something I encourage for folks to try to utilize.
There were a lot of questions concerning homeless, shelter, clients, as well as the street homeless, but especially shelter, clients, congregating in public without wearing masks and without social distancing, and there were a number of ways in which that question was expressed, including whether or not there weren't ways in which to enforce the requirement of wearing masks and so forth, and a question as to whether, if the purpose of moving them into the hotels and away from the congregate shelters was to create opportunities to interdict the spread of the virus, then isn't that defeated by congregating in public in close quarters without masks on what can be done about better compliance with masks and I'm not sure if that's a question for dhs or for the service providers so aaron.
I'm going to turn now to the covid testing that was done recently is eric still on the call or somebody from project renewal, because there was reports that there were I'm back chair dillard apologies that there was recent rounds of testing and the question is what, when someone did test positive, apparently there were some positive tests and it would be helpful to know how many, but how many tested positive and then please explain what happens to the folks who test positive sure we did covet testing two weeks ago.
I'm happy we're going to have positive results in the other shelters for the folks that are with us, I'm sure they're, just hoping this is daniel from help we've had, as I mentioned in my initial talk, we've had in our second round.
We couldn't agree, we couldn't agree more and things and the service providers help us with what shelter clients need that the community could donate or provide.
Okay, this is your thought ronnie from help I'd just like to say, one of the things that we could use is space that could be made available in the community to run small group programming.
I want to give my community board colleagues an opportunity to ask a question or a comment again.
You know an extremely residential area like 79th street to me, may not be the best appropriate place for people with addiction challenges, and I have experience in that personally and there's places in the upper west side that I think would actually be more appropriate.
I feel like there's a perception from the neighborhood that the upper west side is really overburdened with the number of hotels and homeless individuals.
Thank you, oh sorry looks like shelley does have a question yeah now I have a question: the there was a history for a long time of dhs, not counting contacting the community during the bloomberg administration.
So I understand that the use of emergency hotels- you said it exactly it, because it's operating in a in an emergency to respond to this, we did provide calls to our elected officials and to the community board.
This was not that circumstance and again I recognize I am empathetic to the frustrations of the community, which is why we're here tonight why we've participated in other meetings to hear from the community and really be partners on the question of sros and other issues that the upper west side feels like it is handling more than their fair share.
We know that a permanent place is the best option for people, but we also know that we have to work in partnership that we all are working towards a day where I no longer have a job working to provide information to communities around homeless, shelters, but homeless shelters are often like ers, okay right nine o'clock.
I've been on the call since it opened, and I just couldn't get into this room, but I want to thank all the service providers that are on this call, and I just have one very brief comment.
You know I've been on the upper west side, probably over 30 years, and I work for community board seven when sally good goal and john kohler were the chairs of this board, and I just want to remind everyone on this call, particularly the service providers, that the upper west side has a history of developing supportive housing before anyone even knew what that was, and so I want to make it.
There was far more supportive housing homeless, shelters on the upper west side than any other community district, and I really just want to emphasize that.
I feel like something else is going on, because we're not getting an honest assessment of a time line, and I think it's critically important that we get that timeline and that the public that the public officials may put a pressure on the city on the mayor on the deputy mayors on steve and everyone else involved to give every community a timeline.
So I just want to say I think, we're entitled to a timeline when the homeless will be will return to where they to the homeless shelters, since the number of cases are going down and we we're not seeing an increase in spread.
Can someone speak to that as well I'll answer for a project renewal and then I might ask kadan to jump in if you have, if you have something else to say, we've transferred 18 people in the last four weeks out of the lucerne and back to shelter to other locations, because either because of repeated unwillingness to abide by the good neighbor policy or because they simply you know, weren't willing and able to function well in the hotel environment.
