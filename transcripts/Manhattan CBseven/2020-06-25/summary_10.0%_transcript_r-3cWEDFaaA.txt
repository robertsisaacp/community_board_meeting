Did that end during tonight's meeting we're going to hear how different organizations, agencies and elected officials understand the challenges these are facing right now and working to support their health and well-being?
So our participants and speakers include members of the request: prep academy community, the New York City Alliance against sexual assaults, safe horizon the administration for Children Services, the Children's Aid Society, the community service Society of New York, along with champ, which is the community health access to Addiction and Mental Health Care, Project and councilmember.
Had this past school year coming into our school, and so we're really excited about all the new things they're happening yet was prepped like the new Regis classes that we offer now that we did not offer when I started working there and we're having about sixty to seventy percent of our students.
Then what were the resources that they were like in for in order for this child to come to me and still, knowing that child lives in a home with a lot of different people moving in and out, you know, former students I'm hearing a spending the night.
There has an open ACS case and when you speak to the ACS work, if we're giving her information that she doesn't know, thinking about people falling through the cracks and people want to be quick to blame schools and say well.
We have a very caring and loving staff and if we can't provide them with enough after-school programming and enough parent outreach and phone calls and different supports, and they have an open, ACS case and they're still not able to maintain, then again, whose problem is that and so I reject the notion that schools can take care of everything and also being in district 3, where you have a screening process where you're warehousing certain groups of students, it gives off a negative reputation about other schools and also to charter schools, which also create more challenges for school like mine, when students are turned away or forced to leave charter schools, they come into our school.
You know if you have read stories about certain charter networks in the news lately and if they're having challenges or a bit, the way of life at that institution doesn't work for all children and the idea of creating more of those institutions just kind of contradicts the whole purpose of critical thinking and lifelong education, in my opinion, so and you're thinking about your alliances and who you're supporting and why you're supporting them take that into account and also dialogue, Kashif and I'm, going to introduce them next that to speak about more programs for youth, especially summer youth programs options, so that students and children can understand that their education is going to lead to something productive for them in the future.
Kashif woodfall, who just graduated yesterday from West prep and eighth graders going to high school and its gonna go, do big things so Kashif you want to I knew yourself and we can hear ya and you I'll be glad to do so.
It was like a really good school allowed me to develop myself allowed me to learn anything and I plan on like going to college I mean that drain gonna be pretty difficult on that I'm glad plan to stay on my best to make sure I can do whatever have to do.
You know and my life has altered completely, and this was about a week before I started grad school, so a lot of changes were happening very quickly, so you know I'm saying that, because as the parent Court as a parent first I knew that West peb was going to serve the different needs of my different children.
So then, now I graduated in June from Hunter school social work with a master's in community organizing and when this opportunity presented itself to be the parent coordinator, Westford Academy I didn't think about it twice, because I understood that West prep as a school community, one has been doing an amazing job with the students and their families, but I also understood from the Social Work perspective that they are where a lot of challenges that would be on the school's capacity.
Whatever the case is they're doing the best they can with the limited resources that they have so now, as a parent and thinking about the challenges that our families are facing, you know one we have to Cove it, but then we have to also acknowledge that they are some family members and some students that are commenting with a lot of trauma, whether it's from the home, whether it's from their personal lives, whether it's from the community.
If someone doesn't know exactly what these students are dealing with, just thinking about those challenges and thinking about what services or what support we as a school need, especially with me working with parents, hearing stories of mom moms that are working full time, we have some of the parents that are, you know they may need to be working at a hospital 3 to 4 days a week, 12 hour shifts and there's no one to really take care of their child.
You know all the other agencies that are providing resources for the families coming together to the table with the school and us having a conversation of.
We're not doing right not on the same page and at West, probably really do believe in the work of all and I think that getting more connected with the agencies in the community coming together having these conversations, seeing where the gaps aren't and then connecting them.
You know I, think that really would for us at the school level and our families, because I think when we talk about the children and the youth and yes definitely they need to be supported.
As you pointed out, there are some families and some students that we cannot reach either, because parents will have phone numbers or whatever the case is so I, think I'm again just going back to working together, co-creating together with other agencies, what supports they?
Don't look like for our families to support them and the other piece is really what because she said about the voices of the young people.
You know what they need and I think again, adding their voices to the planning asking for their voices in decision-making, because these decisions will impact them eventually and having them be part of the community, contribute to the community and also hearing directly from them what those issues are, because we can't come up with all these great plans, but if we're not hearing from the source we're doing half the work, you know so I think that's really where we can use some support services and the challenges that we've been facing at West prep and many schools that are underfunded and are dealing with many challenges.
You know I apologize in advance for having to help off right out for this, but thank you so much for the opportunity to let us be here and share our experience as well.
We are one of the four agencies within the New York State we're the only one in York City than is actually providing these services and I wanted to tell you a little bit about what we've been seeing in regards to the recent kovat situation and what we face on a daily basis.
And what we are trying to do is lift the voices off the minors and provide trauma-informed care from all levels, whether it's got from physicians, child abuse, predictions that are seeing these children, whether it's a child advocacy center through which they're coming or whether it's for counseling and as and we take a holistic approach, providing parenting support and family counseling.
There has been an increase in the number of cases of teenage sexual assault, because a lot of teenagers have been engaging on chat platforms and online video games, etc, and there has been an increase in portes when phase when phase one and phase two begin and they started actually going out and the summer came, you know it became warmer, they started going out a little bit and so we're seeing a higher rapport amongst them.
The other thing that our child abuse, p traditions in the city have told us is that the children that were coming in for physical abuse cases, there is definitely a higher correlation to sexual violence right now, they're seeing a lot more cases than they usually do as well, because people are you, know, children living with the perpetrators and even though they're not going to school and ACS is not as involved for that reason.
But what we are concerned about is that we are part of the sexual assault initiative, along with four other reprises programs in the city and that funds those funds help us conduct these forensic exams trainings as well as other trainings, where we're trying to provide trauma-informed teaching to folks that come through the CAC that come to the IDI that come I know those are the providers that perhaps necessarily aren't sure how to talk to 14 year old versus six year old versus a 24 year old.
And then we start talking about healthy relationships and the impact of harmful social norms, and so it kind of you know, moves along it graduates the conversation graduates until we come to a point where we they get an opportunity to do some peer engagement through well.
You know they bring in these people so that they could start having conversations about healthier relationships about teen, dating violence prevention, and so they get to create these pieces of outreach of these pieces of community mobilization.
They get to stand up and speak about their truth, and the program has really changed my work because it reminds me that this certain time you know so many programs out there and if we're having a program for youth and we're not talking about sex, there's an issue we're not talking about healthy relationships.
They loved our adult engagement component because one of the advance groups in our of our youth came back and they did some focus groups with parents because they wanted to know how come you guys haven't told us about any of this.
So this advanced group, they created an actual training for the parents on how to talk to how to create a safe space, to talk to your youth, about healthy relationships and sex and dating so we make sure that they have venues, for you know continued outward facing.
Well, within the last year, this program served 70 young women across 25 council districts, and we also like I, said, have groups of young men and amidst the Cova 19, we, you know, definitely had some fallout, because you know lots of these families were ill and had to move and some of them.
If we're asking what how you can support us, perhaps without reach to youth in your community, when we are offering these workshops to help us get the word out, but definitely to support us as an organization with City Council funding, we are very worried about the cuts that have already affected our youth with not having summer work.
I think we're one of the you know few agencies that are really doing this sexual assault prevention, work with teens and young adults in this way, and so thank you.
I really appreciate the specific information that you gave us about what's happening and also what's needed and Gina, it's so exciting to hear about the work that you're doing with youth and not only kind of giving them the tools to be leaders, but also to help other people be leaders in the community.
Carolyn will speak to this a little bit more, but I wanted to speak about the wide range of services that they prize and offers with youth and trauma on the runaway and homeless their street work project.
C word project supports runaway and homeless by providing concrete services, medical care, legal, sexual health, basically so Neil showers, wellness and mental health care to drop-in, centers contact, number yeah, okay, so just I think one of the things that want to highlight, as you heard me, serve runaway and homeless, youth, which are, and particularly this time, the more most vulnerable, especially in covered, where our services have had to be limited, you're talking young people who basically sometimes sleep on the streets at night.
We're talking childhood trauma from a very young age which disrupt a lot of their development by the time they get to our programs.
Is that one of the things that we really need in terms of sustaining young people is, you know our drop-in services could utilize some more support in terms of increase hours, because homelessness don't stop when we close at six o'clock, so it continues since to be able to provide that safe space and respite.
If we could, you know we know this is times of cuts coming in, but to think about the homeless population on york city, streets of your people.
So it's really important that when they develop a relationship with a caretaker Ana mentor in that program, we're able to connect them to these different resources and again some of them are young people who have went through ACS not being able to make it through the system and I think what happens a lot with systems.
So you know that would really be helpful where we could have specialists who come in and able to address those things talking about intergenerational poverty and try and I think that's about it.
Young people do not house in do they need support while they get into the house and yes, and we should have more supportive case management or it's like programs.
We really wanted to talk about how we are and I'm sorry no trauma response to my colleague, Eric Kaplan is here to start I'm gonna finish off with some contact numbers sure offer that support.
We started off as a pilot program working with some NYPD precincts around the city, specifically partner with the domestic violence units and those precincts, so that we could engage with families right after a domestic incident before it is filed, so that we as clinicians could come in and engage with families where children have been a witness to domestic violence and provide trauma focused therapy for the family, specifically around symptoms and reactions that might be coming up for kids.
We have programs right now in Manhattan and Queens and the Bronx, but we do work with families all over the city, and you know oh thank you so much and my apologies Sarah.
If not partner programs are on the call tonight, safe, Verizon and Children's Aid Society, you know, ACS is concern, like all of the other organizations on the call is to ensure the safety and health and wellness and well-being of children and youth and, as everyone else has said, that there is no more critical time than what we're facing right now to ensure that happens, and especially because the families we serve like those touched by the other organizations on the call, are disproportionately families of color and so between the kovat pandemic and the racial equity and anti-racist action in the city.
The network of prevention services providers across the city, though, has been unwaveringly dedicated serving families in their home when it's really necessary to have that face-to-face engagement, appreciating sort of all of the necessary precautions around Kovich also, you know keep families and workers safe, but also really leveraging telehealth opportunities to ensure that connectivity is continuing to happen.
You know, I, think more stressful on children and youth, and probably anyone and really I think stressful on families that are disproportionately facing increased poverty, increased job loss, and so it has been more important now than ever to continue to meet families where they are I.
Also, you know want to note that we are in prevention services at ace on the verge of recompete, or rather we have recomputed our system for the first time in ten years, which has meant really looking at how to take what has been a continuous process of improvement and growth that has affected a really sharp decrease over the last years in foster care and really kept more families together and supported, and really look across the system and strengthen those services across the system.
The other thing that has been thematic across some of the comments and particularly MS Reyes spoke about, is really bringing in the voice of clients, so families, youth and children, and while our service providers do that on a regular basis, ACS is making a really concerted effort to partner with agencies to make sure that is happening both in service provision with families, but also at the organizational level to really ensure that services reflect what families want and need and that we continue to push towards making a service continuum that is responsive to family need, I.
You know, continue to try to develop programming work with partnerships around the city, really digging deep with our partner agencies like small business services, ISM at the OE to ensure that youth are thinking about career, his career pathways opportunities.
It's really wrapped around career readiness, education, employment and housing services, and so I want to give you just you know, sort of a really quick look at some of the programming that we provide and then maybe some opportunities where, if you know youth are looking to connect to services, then around career readiness, education, employment and housing services, they can so.
It essentially pairs up every foster care agency with the opportunity to develop a coaching team if they haven't already done that and connect youth in foster care to a coach, and so most folks on this call will probably know that one of the most important things our population youth can connect to is a caring, adult right and somebody who's got their best interests at heart and somebody's gonna guide them to.
To be a good worker to be a business owner, whatever that youth decides to do, and so this futures program that was funded for this year gave us an opportunity to deliver services through coaching tutoring and also through a holistic approach that focused on permanency and connecting you to a caring adult.
Here's you know career pathway, that you may decide that you want to do in New, York, City's, labor market and here's where you're at developmentally and the gap between where you are at and where you need to be.
We need to develop a plan, a career path that has an educational plan and a career plan that includes these successive steps that get you along the way to where you want to be, and so we start to teach that to you that middle school, high school and on their way out to college, in addition to that structure that theology, that thinking that the wirework program affords used an opportunity to become part of a career Club and in that career club, there's experiential learning as well as destruction about how they use the labor market to design their career pathway.
The last thing I mentioned is that if there is, if there are youth that you're working with- and you want to connect them to these opportunities, all of the opportunities that I mentioned as we're at the end of the fiscal year are wrapping up services, a Robin, Hood Foundation.
If there's you know who, during the summer may not have an opportunity to go to work an internship, we want to propose that we put them right in front of the city's economic recovery.
Thank you very much kathryn and it's great to see everyone here at cv7 a very challenging time for all of us for the city but I'm afraid doubly so for young people, though, have endured social isolation and have had their educational experience so terribly disruptive and are facing really challenging career prospects that, at a time when the economy is in such bad shape, and so in that context the fact that at the moment, the city's budget entirely slashes some of youth employment to me is totally unacceptable.
And you know, prior to the pandemic, we had a big push in the City Council for universal some youth employment, because I feel- and many of my colleagues feel that the young person's willing to step up and say they want to do the right thing over the summer and actually do some work and get some experience and help out the community and make some money.
We had a hundred and fifteen thousand kids who apply so that's 40 thousand young people who stepped up and wanted to do the right thing and we were told no, and you know relative to the size of the city budget.
But you know, there's also lots of new jobs which need doing that young people could do now.
In a more public role, where we have a continuing need for social distancing ambassadors to be out there, giving out information on coronavirus and giving out masks and in a non aggressive enforcement way, informing people about the need for that and for folks, young people a little bit older, certainly I would say over 18 or 18 and over there's a role in our what I like to call our Public Health core, which is the people who are doing contact tracing right now, which is a workforce of several thousand, which includes people who go door-to-door people who help connect people to social services when their quarantine, iing and those jobs.
I just want to briefly touch upon looking farther ahead is next year in the school year, and what school is going to look like for young people and the non school opportunities for them through after-school, etc, and there's just so much uncertainty about that right.
It's not fair to kids I'm concerned that we're not talking enough about after-school programs and the kind of things that are so important to social-emotional development of young people to career development and I, actually think or easier to plan in a socially distance world, because you have generally, you don't have the whole school population there after school and you can be more mobile as well, and the groups tend to be smaller, so I feel like after school from a virus safety perspective.
So I know that's not the topic tonight, but very much on my mind and I think has to be on the short list as we talk about an agenda for young people in the months and years ahead.
My job is to make sure to create three 3,000 to 3,500 internships for young people, because we know they're young people, they have a part-time job, end up getting better grades and of going us college and graduate because somehow those relationships they built in the workplace are, lastly, and they serve as examples even when they may not have examples at home, even when they may not have teachers that support them, even where they don't have those supports that they need somehow someway they manage to get them at the workplace.
Like the council member said earlier last year, the city and the state provided 75,000 job opportunities to young people.
We know what young people do with that money right.
A lot of people know CSS mostly for our research work that have been focused around I use, health, housing and labor related issues, and also we have also programs that serve people throughout the entire state, health related issue and access to health care, and we also have different smaller programs throughout the entire organization as well, but today, I'm just gonna, pass it on right away to Allison, who is going to be talking mostly at our mental health issue, and before that I just wanna touch on two points: ESF I have done a lot of research around in Summer Youth Employment was a big part of the coalition that made 75,000 Summer Youth Employment slap-happy last year two years ago, as council member.
So she SS was also hired a major task force and we have done a lot of work around specialized high schools in Essex, black and Latino students, so with that I'm just gonna lead to Alison to talk about mental health issues and the services that we provide for everyone, but I'm sure she has some work on young people in and working with them.
Now I talked to my team today about this presentation, and so what we did was we pulled together a few examples of what champ has done, particularly with youth and with families, to help support people's quest for certain types of services.
They are working on so many other components of the logistics of trying to make sure that this individual, youth or child is safe, that it's, they don't necessarily have the time or the capacity at that moment, to do the research or to speak to the insurer about who actually is in network and who has openings, and so what we do.
We focus on health insurance issues, but that doesn't mean that we don't want to also try to provide a level of support on their other issues and so I'm so glad to be on this today and I've been seriously taking notes, because, even though many of these organizations are already on our resource list, I'm going to make sure tomorrow morning that our resource lists are updated with all of the fantastic services that all of you are providing sometimes.
Sometimes families or individuals come to us when they're in the middle of service or they have a provider, but they don't like that individual provider, and so they want to change.
Our helpline is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 a.m. and our helpline number is 1 800 and if you call that helpline number you'll be connected to the champ team, which consists not only of the people at CSS and our multidisciplinary group of attorneys and social workers, but our network throughout all of New York State, which includes community-based organizations in different parts of New, York State, as well as specialists in Medicare and confidentiality and mental health, who can who are all working together to try to find a way to resolve this particular youth or families problem, and also try to pave a way for people who come after that individual to be able to access services.
It's really important for us to be able to advocate and spread the word to neighbors and to other you know, people with kids and stuff to let them know that there are programs out there and there are activities so I really want to thank all of you.
If you have any questions for the speaker or any comment, what an incredible session I actually have a lot of notes that I've flagged for follow-up later, but I think no further questions other right at this moment, just really just to see our thanks to everyone for their time and their passion on this and I'm sure you'll be hearing from us in many areas that you touched on tonight later and that coming week and well one thing that, from the very beginning that young man and spoke asked for something with such a heartfelt emotion.
Your conversation to me, you were in my head, I said: get out, get out get out, so thank you for having the same thoughts that I had it makes me feel wonderful, but also too, and I want to thank Catherine and Shelley for talking to me and so being supportive of understanding how important it is to support these kids.
If you have any comments thanks so much given the hour, I'll try to focus in on a couple of really important things and try not to repeat my heart is full right now with the positive energy that surrounds so many needs and the conflicts that all of you who provide services to our youth can bring to it.
I want to just sort of touch briefly on the ideas that we've already been working on at cb7 we've been advocating for years for SYEP, including in our budget last year, and we've already actually written to the City Council to renew that support and others of our committees are focusing on different aspects of the programming we heard about tonight.
There's going to be multiple years in which the ripple effects of what is happening in our economy will be playing out and the need to provide for our most vulnerable will not go away anytime soon, which leaves me like Lolita grateful for the incredible work that you all are doing and we hope we'll be able to help.
I know we're not we're doing virtual school right now, but when we go back to school without having basic supplies, so I found that to be another thing that was really important, very basic and I'm sure there's a way we can figure out to help with this.
I wanted to get into and I'm sure that letter of recommendation was extremely helpful, so it's beyond just like summer work and money.
