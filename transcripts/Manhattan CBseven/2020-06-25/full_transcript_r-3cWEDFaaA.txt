Good evening, everyone, oh hello, hi Catherine, hi everybody. It's so great to see. All of you welcome hi, we're great to see everyone, so I want to tie mark. If you can help me I want to see if I can set up my computer so that I can see my notes at the same time that I'm seeing the screen so I'm just gonna. Try to do that and I might just ask you I'm sorry this is Allison. Can you hear me yeah? Oh hi, there sorry to bother you just I'm, not sure if we're it live on YouTube right now, that's what it's saying in the top-left. So just in case we are I just wanted to make sure we are all the. Where are we live on YouTube right now we're live on YouTube, the recording is paused, but we are live on YouTube. So the recordings not going right now, not yet okay, I'm gonna, give everybody a warning. Okay, well give the warning because we're gonna start recording because I want to make sure it works. So I don't take time during your meeting to mess with those details, so I'm gonna resume the recording and I'm gonna hit broadcast, which means that we're now live on YouTube as well, and that means that people who are attendees can now enter the room as if you look at any participants list, you'll see that they're coming in okay, so I will also just remind people a couple times during the meeting.

I want to start well, first of all welcome everyone. Thank you. So much for making the time to be here. I want to start really briefly by congratulating Shelley, fine and the friends of Bloomingdale, inclusive parks and playground. Shelley who's, the founder and co-director applied for a capacity fund grant from the City Parks Foundation in New York City Parks Partnership, her car, which will support fees for developing a website and he won not grant so that's great and that playground is connected to with Prep Academy and they're. Here, Karlin Washington is here and she a scholar there and so we'll introduce them in a moment. So I'm Katherine Bellagio I'm, the co-chair along with Sheldon fine of the Health and Human Services Committee mark Diller who's on the top left of your screen. Most likely is the chair of community board 7 and I want to thank Madeleine innocent that she's here, because it was her idea to have this meeting with this topic. So I want to thank her and all the members of the community board and others we kind of helped to gather together. These wonderful speakers that we have today so alternate children and youths are valuable members of our community who deserve our unconditional protection, support and advocacy. That is not contingent on changing circumstances. They have the right to have all their needs met all the time whatever it takes. This is always doable. It's just a matter of our having the will and commitment to work together to make that happen, and the time right now is urgent. Did that end during tonight's meeting we're going to hear how different organizations, agencies and elected officials understand the challenges these are facing right now and working to support their health and well-being? We're especially concerned about you tour, the most, who are the most vulnerable, because they're also really hard to reach and access from the discussion tonight. We hope to learn as much as possible about current needs and priorities so that we can use what we learned to advocate for specific items in the city budget and also later for our district needs treatment. So that's the purpose of the conversation. We're really excited to have anything with us, and so now I'll explain the format, we're fortunate to have a number of groups visiting with us, each of whom will speak about their current concerns. What they see as potential ways to address challenges, what they're working to advocate for and advance right now, including related to nature, and what we can do to support their work. Robert it's going to keep track of time so that he'll give speakers a head up a heads up after ten minutes, we'll also, as will also hold all of our comments and questions until the very end after everybody else. After all, the speakers have time to present and we're also going to make sure that community members also have fun at times. So our participants and speakers include members of the request: prep academy community, the New York City Alliance against sexual assaults, safe horizon the administration for Children Services, the Children's Aid Society, the community service Society of New York, along with champ, which is the community health access to Addiction and Mental Health Care, Project and councilmember. Marco theme will stop in at about 8:15 or 8:30, and possibly council member Helen Rosenthal as well. So we are going to start with less prep Academy we're so excited to have them with us. So Carlin Washington is the principal barman raised is the parent coordinator and parent and Kashif. We call Dave with scholar and a recent graduate, so we owe him a congratulation for graduating so I'll hand it over to you Thank You Katherine, and thank you Mark and Thank You Shelley. It's good to see you all in this bit is the everyone here in cb7 and the Upper West Side of Manhattan I live in Harlem myself and so I love, Manhattan, and so anything that I can do to be involved with supporting our scholars in our community I'm. All in for as Katharine said, I am the proud principal of West Park Academy. This is nice in the most six year as a small public school located and honey and hid in Amsterdam, it's 140 partner. Today, nine years, in acting there, in nine years nine years we have gone from the lowest ranked middle school to improving our test, scores, improving our disciplinary outcomes, hiring some of the best teachers and staff in New, York City, and we have become one of the most sought-after schools based off of our application. Had this past school year coming into our school, and so we're really excited about all the new things they're happening yet was prepped like the new Regis classes that we offer now that we did not offer when I started working there and we're having about sixty to seventy percent of our students. Leave our middle school with Regents credit, whether it's in living environment, algebra and or Spanish, and this year, thanks to Kovac all students pass and receive credit until all 70 of our eighth graders received a credit and living environment and algebra the shinsen we're really proud at them and in Spanish as well. So we were very excited about that. Prior to Colvin 19, we were able to successfully execute a lot of field trips, I'm, going to Washington DC after both year taking kids at the back field. Trips walking around Reading, Terminal and Philadelphia showed us a different culture and get them out of the city we conducted labs with Roosevelt University and the new labs of the Columbia University, and around hundred 25th Street I've been able to work with college students. We also develop a strong parent connection and mrs. graders over native to talk about that. A few minutes like certain organizations, we all face our challenges and we know it's gonna be good. There are states and founders that we cannot reach and that renewed support, so you're thinking about families who are coming out of situations where they living in two and three bedroom apartments, where single parent has eight and nine children various ages. You know you're thinking about the child. That's in my school. It's not able to get their personalized attention their need. Maybe the love, maybe the basic resources. If you're thinking about maslov's hierarchy of needs, you never still at the bottom on a lot of our families and so the challenges that face them. I'm, thinking of another family I was child comes to school. Every day you can tell youtell is not clean as a middle schooler, and so my thought as a middle school principal, is what was going on with that child in elementary school. Then what were the resources that they were like in for in order for this child to come to me and still, knowing that child lives in a home with a lot of different people moving in and out, you know, former students I'm hearing a spending the night. There has an open ACS case and when you speak to the ACS work, if we're giving her information that she doesn't know, thinking about people falling through the cracks and people want to be quick to blame schools and say well. What are you doing about this shovin? Why can't you reach to a certain child there's so many different factors involved and I know. We have a very caring and loving staff and if we can't provide them with enough after-school programming and enough parent outreach and phone calls and different supports, and they have an open, ACS case and they're still not able to maintain, then again, whose problem is that and so I reject the notion that schools can take care of everything and also being in district 3, where you have a screening process where you're warehousing certain groups of students, it gives off a negative reputation about other schools and also to charter schools, which also create more challenges for school like mine, when students are turned away or forced to leave charter schools, they come into our school. You know with the negative sense of Education as a whole and we had to build that child. So it's a lot of different components here. So what I'm asking you to do when I'm allowed mr. Kashif to speak in a second and my parent coordinator is to really think about using your resources and early childhood literacy. Education like before they get to second grade making sure that children can read and write and can do simple, math, because I'm finding as a middle school, principal and I get kids from 60th Street. All the way up to the Bronx that are, the children still cannot read and write when they come to the state's great and so again as whose problem is that, and what do we do about that at this level? I'm? Also thinking about expansion of pre-k, n3k programs, you know those are definitely needed to be a literacy in the early ages. We know children are like sponges and if you don't catch them before they get around 6 or 7, then it's very difficult to catch them later. Psychology shows that, and also thinking about your own alliances with different charter schools and different factions that are competing for our public money. You know if you have read stories about certain charter networks in the news lately and if they're having challenges or a bit, the way of life at that institution doesn't work for all children and the idea of creating more of those institutions just kind of contradicts the whole purpose of critical thinking and lifelong education, in my opinion, so and you're thinking about your alliances and who you're supporting and why you're supporting them take that into account and also dialogue, Kashif and I'm, going to introduce them next that to speak about more programs for youth, especially summer youth programs options, so that students and children can understand that their education is going to lead to something productive for them in the future. So I appreciate you listening to me and I'll be around to answer any questions later, but I want to introduce my top scarlet mr. Kashif woodfall, who just graduated yesterday from West prep and eighth graders going to high school and its gonna go, do big things so Kashif you want to I knew yourself and we can hear ya and you I'll be glad to do so. I was trying to like talk about myself talking about West, so I just graduated yesterday, not the day before. Are you sure of it? Two days ago, but West prep was like a I was like a really school. It was like a really good school allowed me to develop myself allowed me to learn anything and I plan on like going to college I mean that drain gonna be pretty difficult on that I'm glad plan to stay on my best to make sure I can do whatever have to do. I, wanna I wanna be in a major of businessing, so I plan on and go into a really good high school. That allowed me to learn more about that and stuff like that. I, like basketball and I'm, just a really positive person like dude good, so I came here, because I wanted to discuss about the ideas that I had that. Maybe that maybe could bring up a positive reputation in our community and what I thought of is that we could wear that. The community could have more events such as like charity events, where, with the no charity events during the summer, things like backpacks and school supplies or even food to being, could be distributed to where to where people who might not be able to have such not be would have such resources that have and people who may not have a lot of food supplies would be able to would be able to obtain food, and so I also thought like. Throughout the year there can be like meetings for youth where children would oil teenagers. Our beauty could be able to speak about to speak about problems within the community, suggesting like gang violence or just problem that they see within the community. Whatever they bill is bringing the community down I feel like it would be. A really good idea to have children speak among each other, along with the dogs, so that I was Catherine said. So you have youth. The youth has their own way of speaking about the problem they feel like they have a voice. I feel like. That would be something that would be. It would be like really changing in a positive manner. Also I feel like the community since there's a lot of sense. There's a lot of like there's. A lot of negativity. I feel like this brings like this. Events like overall, would be able to bring the community together, be more involved and be able to give up a more positive, more positive reputation. I guess you say so another thing that I thought it was like during the summer there'd be like cookouts or like just me and greets. Where give me that you could do our activities like such as what the cookout equal activity, there could be like a build. A kind of a networking any day dude if activities together I feel like overall, would just be a way to make things more positive and there's just a lot of community to be more engaged and, more broadly with each other and I feel like just in general. I. Think I think the community should be able to just do things together. More often I feel like you should be able to do more things such as live with the meeting, but like you should be able to be more involved with the things that go on in the community at the youth day. Eventually, you're gonna have to grow up and learn things they're going within the community, so I feel like bringing the youth and to most of the meet most of the meetings that go on such as I'm here today, I feel like it would be more empowering and it will allow for greater change and last thing, I'd, say I feel, like so I, like recently just learned that the park we had I recently found out that that the community boy has something to do with it and I feel like there's. Like tons of schools within Manhattan, and they all can't be changed, but I feel like the same thing that happened to our school should happen to more schools, because I feel like many of like the playgrounds where kids, like many kids, have to enjoy themselves and they're, pretty old, and all that so like for us for West prep and for the PS 145 school being able to being able to expiry and something new something more better. I felt like that was able to bring a lot more pop. A lot more positivity I feel like stuff like that. Should she be done more throughout the throughout the borough, which would allow more kids to feel better and more positive and I feel like more school should just be dealt with any problems that what any problems that occurred so that they will be able to build more positive and just overall anything that will be able to benefit the community, such as events, I stated before I feel like they should be done where community could come together and just positive, and that's it. Thank you. Well, I just I just want to say the sheets that I think I can speak for everyone in saying that we are all so impressed. I think your future. Maybe your future community board chair leader definitely a definitely a community leader already, and that was so helpful for all of us to hear and if you just did an excellent job, so we're all so impressed and grateful that you shared your wonderful ideas with us and we're gonna follow up on those. So you don't hear back from us and we're really glad you're here. So thank you so much for coming, oh yeah and we're giving you a round of applause, and then we also want to hear from Carmen raised right. The parent coordinator and also a proud Karen of West Park Academy Scholar, yes, hi good evening can hear me yeah, perfect, okay, so so, yes, my name is Carmen I am the parent coordinator was prep and I just want to start. First with saying: I've had four children go through West crack I have one: that's in college. I have another student who's going to be in the 12th grade in September from he's at Brooklyn, Tech I also have a seventh grader who's in school now going into the eighth grade next year and I also had my niece, who I'm her guardian now so two and a half years ago, her mom passed away tragically and in East Harlem and I took guardianship of her sister and my sister's granddaughter, and you know it was no brainer I had to promise in Washington cuz I'm like this child's life has fallen apart. You know and my life has altered completely, and this was about a week before I started grad school, so a lot of changes were happening very quickly, so you know I'm saying that, because as the parent Court as a parent first I knew that West peb was going to serve the different needs of my different children. These were completely different. Children who had different needs and I knew that their they were going to have their needs met. So you know after graduating, my niece is not in high school she's going into the country next year. So you know so, as a parent I had a lot of trust in West prep even ten years ago, when everybody was saying how bad it was. There was something about the school staff that really allowed me to trust. Not so much of what people were saying in papers and you know things that they didn't really understand or know, but I trusted the staff from what I saw and how they engage the children. So then, now I graduated in June from Hunter school social work with a master's in community organizing and when this opportunity presented itself to be the parent coordinator, Westford Academy I didn't think about it twice, because I understood that West prep as a school community, one has been doing an amazing job with the students and their families, but I also understood from the Social Work perspective that they are where a lot of challenges that would be on the school's capacity. Like there's just a lot of things. The school cannot do because of funding because of lack of services. Whatever the case is they're doing the best they can with the limited resources that they have so now, as a parent and thinking about the challenges that our families are facing, you know one we have to Cove it, but then we have to also acknowledge that they are some family members and some students that are commenting with a lot of trauma, whether it's from the home, whether it's from their personal lives, whether it's from the community. You know so here we are trying to educate students who are really dealing with a lot, a lot of things that many of us may not have experienced. If someone doesn't know exactly what these students are dealing with, just thinking about those challenges and thinking about what services or what support we as a school need, especially with me working with parents, hearing stories of mom moms that are working full time, we have some of the parents that are, you know they may need to be working at a hospital 3 to 4 days a week, 12 hour shifts and there's no one to really take care of their child. You know so thinking about all the and those are just some of the challenges, very small challenges we have many more, but thinking about us and what we have been doing and how we need support is really co-creating with the agencies and our communities such as ACS. You know all the other agencies that are providing resources for the families coming together to the table with the school and us having a conversation of. Where is the gap? Where do when does West prep stop? Where do we have to stop for whatever reason, the laws, the policies and the procedures? Where do we stop, and where does the next agency pick up, you know, and how do we do this together, because I think that everybody's doing a great job with whatever they're doing in the agencies, sometimes when we're not doing great work separately? We're not doing right not on the same page and at West, probably really do believe in the work of all and I think that getting more connected with the agencies in the community coming together having these conversations, seeing where the gaps aren't and then connecting them. You know I, think that really would for us at the school level and our families, because I think when we talk about the children and the youth and yes definitely they need to be supported. They are part of a family. They are part of mothers and fathers and aunties and uncles and grandparents and caregivers who need supportive services as well. So we can be doing a great job at West prep. We can reach out to the families we can connect, but that's nice, the Washington pointed out and Katharine. As you pointed out, there are some families and some students that we cannot reach either, because parents will have phone numbers or whatever the case is so I, think I'm again just going back to working together, co-creating together with other agencies, what supports they? Don't look like for our families to support them and the other piece is really what because she said about the voices of the young people. We are asking them. You know what they need and I think again, adding their voices to the planning asking for their voices in decision-making, because these decisions will impact them eventually and having them be part of the community, contribute to the community and also hearing directly from them what those issues are, because we can't come up with all these great plans, but if we're not hearing from the source we're doing half the work, you know so I think that's really where we can use some support services and the challenges that we've been facing at West prep and many schools that are underfunded and are dealing with many challenges. That's it that's a lot and that's wonderful, so insightful and so helpful for all of us to hear, and those are great. So thank you so much all three of you for coming. Next. We have York City Alliance against sexual assaults. We have please correct me if I mispronounced, your name, we have Jena Jefferson. This is Senior prevention manager, Sarah, Sadie, who's, an assistant director of intervention and best care program, so I will I can get us started. You know I apologize in advance for having to help off right out for this, but thank you so much for the opportunity to let us be here and share our experience as well. So I oversee the intervention program at Jena runs the prevention program, so we wanted to provide both perspectives to you. So in terms of the intervention piece we provide counseling for children's and children, teen adults that are sexual assault survivors as an organization as a whole. We are the New York City Alliance against sexual assault, which basically is an umbrella organization with the various programs or reprises programs in the city, and we try to advocate for survivors on behalf of those various programs and our partners with in regards to legislation and policy, etc. So we have a counseling program which provides counseling to two children, teens and adults that have experienced sexual assault. We also have we provide training to forensic examiners, yesses physician assistants and physicians. That are, you know when somebody goes in to get a forensic exam done. We are one of the four agencies within the New York State we're the only one in York City than is actually providing these services and I wanted to tell you a little bit about what we've been seeing in regards to the recent kovat situation and what we face on a daily basis. I've been a child therapist for most of my career about 18 years at this point, I'm a physician by training. So it's child psych. For me, what I have found really interesting is that when we have these conversations, children often get left out of these conversations, even though 70% of assault occurs in children and even and the funds are mostly geared towards the adult programming they're few they're private organizations, private foundations that will provide funds to children's programming there very few. That will prefer that government funds- that are large city council funds that do provide for that we do, and so what I have been aiming to do with the Alliance. And what we are trying to do is lift the voices off the minors and provide trauma-informed care from all levels, whether it's got from physicians, child abuse, predictions that are seeing these children, whether it's a child advocacy center through which they're coming or whether it's for counseling and as and we take a holistic approach, providing parenting support and family counseling. What we are trying, what we're seeing recently is, particularly with the covert pandemic. There has been an increase in the number of cases of teenage sexual assault, because a lot of teenagers have been engaging on chat platforms and online video games, etc, and there has been an increase in portes when phase when phase one and phase two begin and they started actually going out and the summer came, you know it became warmer, they started going out a little bit and so we're seeing a higher rapport amongst them. The other thing that our child abuse, p traditions in the city have told us is that the children that were coming in for physical abuse cases, there is definitely a higher correlation to sexual violence right now, they're seeing a lot more cases than they usually do as well, because people are you, know, children living with the perpetrators and even though they're not going to school and ACS is not as involved for that reason. They're still coming into physical abuse, and there are more cases that have what have come in for children than they have for adults in the last three months, at least in New York City. So we basically work with child advocacy centers they partner with us during our kids, safe training, which is a sexual assault, forensic exam training. We have ACS come in and speak to the nurse examiners, as well as to the physician assistants, talk about what options there are for children and what specific services there are within the city. What, unfortunately, we're struggling with is that during this time when children are not are living with, the perpetrators are living with family and they don't have an outlet where they can go to school. If you have a teacher, a friend or a guidance counselor, it's been a bit of a struggle in terms of how they report a lot of families. Don't have the technology where we can provide sessions to them or we have or are comfortable and talking about of Gena. Who can speak a little bit more about this as well? But, for example, we have a client team client who is exploring gender identity and sexual orientation right now, but is unable to speak in front of their family, and so we've introduced a web chat platform for that visa and we're encouraging our partner programs to consider that as well. Obviously, it's not the same because we want to have counseling sessions in person, particularly with the younger group. They're. Not it's not talk therapy. We use a lot of creative arts and plays that's been a bit of a block right now in providing here to them. There's really no good solution, I think right now. What we're really concerned I think as of right now is potential budget cuts that might be coming around we'll find out next week. I guess. But what we are concerned about is that we are part of the sexual assault initiative, along with four other reprises programs in the city and that funds those funds help us conduct these forensic exams trainings as well as other trainings, where we're trying to provide trauma-informed teaching to folks that come through the CAC that come to the IDI that come I know those are the providers that perhaps necessarily aren't sure how to talk to 14 year old versus six year old versus a 24 year old. So it is very critical for us to make sure that these children are not re-traumatized when they are coming in to these places, and we are concerned that, if these budgets, if these funds are cut, then we will not be able to do that. We will not be able to provide training for forensic examiners. We are worried that we will not be able to provide the counseling that we want to provide the crisis counseling, that we provide children as well as the trauma-informed trainings that we provide. So we would love for you to support any sexual assault initiative that you can to help us bring these services to the community. We also a set part of the City Council budget is also the young woman's initiative. The chena can talk more about in terms of what we do with prevention and how those funds help us. Thank you Sarah. Can everyone hear me? Yes, thank you. Yes, you know, and I just have to say the work that Sarah and her team does. An intervention is almost unheard of, and really amazing. So thank you for sharing and thank you for everyone. Thank you, Kathy and Marc for having us here and thank you everyone for coming together to talk about the youth, because, with all that's going on, they have been extremely scared, extremely tricky. You know challenged with all with you know, between kovat and just the racial tension, so this is really important meeting. So, yes, we, the New, York City Council, has been providing us critical support with the Young Women's Leadership Initiative, which is like a multi-platform coalition aimed at supporting young women in the New York City area, and so as a contractor of the New York's, the young woman's initiative. We implement our project program called project dot. It's called project dream, hotel and dream of a life without violence on your story, tell your story, and so it's an after-school program where we engage young women of color from various cultures of underserved communities. For example, we go. We hone in on certain communities like LGBTQ communities, young women, young Muslim, women, we've done groups with South Asian and Southeast Asian women. We've done. You know various groups of communities where we know that sexual assault and violence prevention has not been addressed, and so we also you know outside of I, just want to mention outside of City Council funds. We all of the young woman's initiative. We also support young men, and so we do. We do groups that are multi, sessioned, participatory. You know educational curriculum taught about taught about healthy relationships, how to analyze social, harmful social norms and genders gender stereotypes. We teach them leadership skills, for example, public speaking, how to outreach to your community and how to organize, and they learn to practice consent to talk about consent with their peers with adults in their lives. We they go through a special training where they learn how to how to implement safe bystander, engagement, behaviors and so project dot. It's a fifteen to eighteen week program where we cover you know. First, is the education about these pieces and another part is where they get to think about themselves as how do they identify themselves how to identify the communities? What are the strengths and their communities? And then we start talking about healthy relationships and the impact of harmful social norms, and so it kind of you know, moves along it graduates the conversation graduates until we come to a point where we they get an opportunity to do some peer engagement through well. First of all, their peers are invited to the bystander training, so they get to hear and learn what they're learning and then, as at the end, they get to create design and design and implement their own peer social media campaign that talks about being a bystander that talks about the importance of consent that talks about what's a healthy and unhealthy relationship and they get to put their views out there, their artwork their videos to a campaign that reaches hundreds and thousands of people, and so that's one part of it, and then they also design and lead adult engagement component. Where they're truck they look back to their community. They bring in their mothers their sisters, their aunties, the teachers, the you know, the hairdresser's. You know they bring in these people so that they could start having conversations about healthier relationships about teen, dating violence prevention, and so they get to create these pieces of outreach of these pieces of community mobilization. They get to stand up and speak about their truth, and the program has really changed my work because it reminds me that this certain time you know so many programs out there and if we're having a program for youth and we're not talking about sex, there's an issue we're not talking about healthy relationships. There's an issue you know, and so it was a knock on my door to say: okay Gina. This is what they need and they are so grateful for this work and the opportunity to stand in leadership is just amazing. We also provide opportunities for advance leadership. So, if they've gone through the program, they do get a two hundred dollar stipend for the 15 to 18 weeks and they've gone through the program. They we invite them back to do more community engagement. We are currently unsupported by Rutgers University, who saw our program and said, wait a minute. This is really good. They loved our adult engagement component because one of the advance groups in our of our youth came back and they did some focus groups with parents because they wanted to know how come you guys haven't told us about any of this. You know, and so we had. This common is really great conversation. You know, parents, you know they had many reasons why they didn't have those conversations and some did, but so when they came back and they've met with the parents they decided to then so a lot of parents said well. We didn't really know how to have this conversation, and sometimes you guys don't want to have the conversation with us. So this advanced group, they created an actual training for the parents on how to talk to how to create a safe space, to talk to your youth, about healthy relationships and sex and dating so we make sure that they have venues, for you know continued outward facing. You know with this topic and right now. Well, within the last year, this program served 70 young women across 25 council districts, and we also like I, said, have groups of young men and amidst the Cova 19, we, you know, definitely had some fallout, because you know lots of these families were ill and had to move and some of them. We were running on LGBT group that had to stop because saara had shared. You know they weren't able to talk freely about their. You know their sexual identity and stuff like that freely from home, wasn't safe for them. So we ended up having like just a check-in group with them to kind of just social emotional support check-in, but we did our best to keep all of our programs going. We have one of a group of 14 young women graduating from the program this next week, so it's we've done our best to put everything virtual, to make everything virtual and to continue our programming. So you know, like you, know, we're all here concerned about the rise in sexual assault and violence amongst young women and the violence amongst our youth and all together and so I guess. If we're asking what how you can support us, perhaps without reach to youth in your community, when we are offering these workshops to help us get the word out, but definitely to support us as an organization with City Council funding, we are very worried about the cuts that have already affected our youth with not having summer work. We are, you know, so glad to offer these stipends right now. That's one of the reasons why I really pushed forward that we could make sure they had some money in their pocket, and so we really would love for you to consider us advocate for us. I think we're one of the you know few agencies that are really doing this sexual assault prevention, work with teens and young adults in this way, and so thank you. I'm here I'll be here a little bit for questions and stuff afterwards as well. Thank you definitely appreciate the opportunity to learn more sorry. I really appreciate the specific information that you gave us about what's happening and also what's needed and Gina, it's so exciting to hear about the work that you're doing with youth and not only kind of giving them the tools to be leaders, but also to help other people be leaders in the community. So that's really incredible. Thank you, and so thank you. So much so now we're gonna hear from safe horizon. We have Sara Caplan mchale Monroe, who are supervising child trauma responders from safe horizons, child trauma, Response Team program, and we have Caroline sexual health, basically showers and the street work overnight. You know one second I'm, so sorry to interrupt you but we're having trouble hearing. So if you could speak a little bit louder, that's Rick I'm, here as a proud member of safe Verizon's child cameras team. Our mission is to provide support, prevent violence in their families and the community. Carolyn will speak to this a little bit more, but I wanted to speak about the wide range of services that they prize and offers with youth and trauma on the runaway and homeless their street work project. C word project supports runaway and homeless by providing concrete services, medical care, legal, sexual health, basically so Neil showers, wellness and mental health care to drop-in, centers contact, number yeah, okay, so just I think one of the things that want to highlight, as you heard me, serve runaway and homeless, youth, which are, and particularly this time, the more most vulnerable, especially in covered, where our services have had to be limited, you're talking young people who basically sometimes sleep on the streets at night. If there's not enough shelter, one of the biggest challenges that we have within rhy programs as runaway and homeless. Youth programs is getting young people into housing, stable and permanent housing, and that is because runaway and homeless, youth programs do not have direct access to housing vouchers for youth. Nor are we night priority. Therefore, this leads young people to go to supportive housing which not everyone qualifies for because it requires an tense diagnosis and the second piece to that is the only programs available for rhy, youth or temporary and transitional housing programs, which don't last long and what you do have is young people returning to homelessness. After two to three years, so that really defeats the purpose we know when young people are on the streets, they are more susceptible to be involved in high-risk behavior, for survival being exposed to more violence and abuse. What are the things to within a runaway and homeless? Youth property population is that our young people are survivors of trauma. We're talking childhood trauma from a very young age which disrupt a lot of their development by the time they get to our programs. They're. In that crisis stage, we do adopt a very trauma-informed harm reduction approach. Many are for young people are having co-occurring disorders, which is mental health and substance use. So we kind of take I'm, not a punitive approach. Are we don't have college eyes them, but kind of do start where to young person? Is that one of the things that we really need in terms of sustaining young people is, you know our drop-in services could utilize some more support in terms of increase hours, because homelessness don't stop when we close at six o'clock, so it continues since to be able to provide that safe space and respite. It allows us to be able to keep them safe, offer more resources. Within that time period I mean there are young people who are working, but if you're working and you don't have a stable place, then the employment goes down. We have young people who are interested in vocational educational pieces, but if you don't have a stable place that goes down, and so we have to kind of balance that out so really be helpful. If we could, you know we know this is times of cuts coming in, but to think about the homeless population on york city, streets of your people. Another thing that happens is because they have more frequent contact with law enforcement. They do get thrown in Ryker's, sometimes a very petty offenses and the experience there does increase the trauma. Young people already dealing with challenges of mental health, surviving the streets, I think there's actually a study done. That shows where a lot of young men who going to write has come up with traumatic brain injuries. So that's another piece, so you know the more services and resources we have to offer. It will decrease them interfacing with systems, but I. Think the two prior two pieces are mental health. We do safer eyes and Counseling Center. We were satellite of the program and we do have our trauma therapists that come and they can't even meet the need. That's there, that's how overwhelming our young people have that need. Young people tend not to go to outpatient clinics, it's really a one-stop shop, which is what our drop-in is about. That I'll elaborate a bit more on what Mikkel my colleague was saying is that in our drop-in center we offer a therapist, we offer a psychiatrist, we offer our legal, we offer medical that is really significant for young people to have who don't trust systems who have been abused by systems. So it's really important that when they develop a relationship with a caretaker Ana mentor in that program, we're able to connect them to these different resources and again some of them are young people who have went through ACS not being able to make it through the system and I think what happens a lot with systems. When we talk about mental health, there is a lack of understanding of what trauma is a trauma. Experiences and I'll go further to say that majority of our young people who come to our Center or young people of color, and when we talk about trauma and racial trauma. That is something that has never been touched in terms of trauma workers. It's something that we are beginning to do ourselves. So you know that would really be helpful where we could have specialists who come in and able to address those things talking about intergenerational poverty and try and I think that's about it. But what would really be helpful is for re-try programs to have access to housing vouchers and be a nicer priority, because homelessness for your people is a crisis you're like. Can you take a lot of funds that you just said, you said would be really helpful? Is access to vouchers for your organization yeah for rhy programs, because we don't have access to the vouchers oftentimes young people will not. Some of them may not want to go through the DHS system. Our young people have been physically and sexually exploited in adult systems, so that many of them are afraid, and so it would be easier for us to have vouchers in the origin system to be able to get them access to housing. Young people do not house in do they need support while they get into the house and yes, and we should have more supportive case management or it's like programs. This will be very beneficial if City Council could do a lot of this resource in is to increase housing specialists in these programs and benefits specialists, as well as with some mental health services. They go ahead. We need housing stability to take care of the other piece, really incredibly helpful information and there's so much there, both in terms of the big understanding, a big picture, understanding the perspective, youth and also understanding practically. What needs to be done so I really appreciate the specific. Thank you so much to both of you, so I'm gonna turn it over to the administration for Children Services ACS is here again, please I'm, sorry to interrupt you. We still have a little bit more. We really wanted to talk about how we are and I'm sorry no trauma response to my colleague, Eric Kaplan is here to start I'm gonna finish off with some contact numbers sure offer that support. If that's all right. Thank you. So much for coming back in thanks, Miguel and Thank You Carolyn I, just wanted to Mikkel and I are both clinical supervisors for the China trauma response team. That's a present and I wanted to talk a little bit about. Carolyn talked really specifically about some of the challenges that come with the runaway and homeless youth programs serving youth who have had a long history of trauma. What you wanted to talk, what our program really kind of focus is on and safe. Verizon is aging with youth and families right after a traumatic incident happens, so that we don't give families and children the time. For you know the trauma symptoms to really set in so I want to talk a little bit about our child trauma response team. Well, we are a program. That's been around close to four years. We started off as a pilot program working with some NYPD precincts around the city, specifically partner with the domestic violence units and those precincts, so that we could engage with families right after a domestic incident before it is filed, so that we as clinicians could come in and engage with families where children have been a witness to domestic violence and provide trauma focused therapy for the family, specifically around symptoms and reactions that might be coming up for kids. We know is that often times when kids are the direct victim of services, they're still or crimes, they're, still not a lot of services for kids that you know when that happened. But we kids, who sort of witnessed that those incidents may have kind of grown up in homes where a lot of violence has been happening or seeing a lot of violence and communities. They often don't get seen as a direct victim and often don't get to the services that they need. Our program is really focused on. You know that the idea that, when we can engage a family around the reactions are very normal reactions that we have to trauma whether it's community violence, whether it's intimate partner, violence, whether it's sexual violence, that we can really reduce those reactions and have the family being able to communicate together for both caregivers and children. What we're seeing is when we are able to intervene and engage youth right after an incident happens and their family members. We can bring those trauma symptoms down very significantly cut. We can cut the possibility of PTSD setting in and we can really impact. You know the chances that the children families are going to continue to experience those different, violent, different traumas. So we, you know we're really focused on sort of getting in as quickly as possible, so we can impact that right now. You know: we've moved past a pilot program to be a full-fledged program. We still work with a lot of NYPD programs precincts around the city. We've also started engaging in different with different community programs around safe horizon, so we're able to you know, get referrals from our hotlines from our help lines from our community programs from different domestic violence. Shelters, and you know, try to engage youth around the city to really bring those symptoms down before they be before they get sudden know before they get kind of set in and to kind of speak to something that was you know, echoed sort of with everybody's presentations. Was that once that trauma has happened and hasn't been addressed, it can come up with you know it can come. It can come to you like problems in school that children can get. You know end up getting penalized for down the line down load. You know down the line. They can have increased exposure, two more NYPD, you know and sort of kind of continue sort of cycles of the Icahn's of other crimes. So that's a little bit about what CT RT. Does the child trauma response team? We have programs right now in Manhattan and Queens and the Bronx, but we do work with families all over the city, and you know oh thank you so much and my apologies Sarah. Is it Sarah or Sarah Kaplan Sarah? Thank you so much for what you shared I, especially appreciate that you pointed out that and if that intervention can be effective as long as it happens quickly. So thank you so much for sharing that addition. So now, I'm gonna turn it over to the administration for Children Services and please correct me. If I'm mispronouncing any names, you have Sandra Graham community engagement, specialist Rachel Jensen, the director of intergovernmental affairs, Raymond singleton, the Assistant Commissioner of ACF, Division of Family pregnancy services and Elisabeth local mere associate, commissioner of the 80s division of prevention services. I welcome Liz, welcome here and I am with the community based strategies, team and prevention services at ACS. I will kick us off and then I will hand it over to my counterpart ray who's on the call. You know, I, think. A lot of the themes that were discussed here tonight are really relevant for the work that ACS does and in fact, two of our partner agencies. If not partner programs are on the call tonight, safe, Verizon and Children's Aid Society, you know, ACS is concern, like all of the other organizations on the call is to ensure the safety and health and wellness and well-being of children and youth and, as everyone else has said, that there is no more critical time than what we're facing right now to ensure that happens, and especially because the families we serve like those touched by the other organizations on the call, are disproportionately families of color and so between the kovat pandemic and the racial equity and anti-racist action in the city. We really see that impact disproportionately on the families that we serve, and so, while it's always our goal to strengthen families when it's safe to keep a child in the home in order to support Children and Youth, or to support children and youth through kinship or a placement. This is really the most critical time to be doing this work. So I want to talk a little bit tonight. First about our work. We do in prevention, services and then and then talk and then rate we'll talk a little bit about the other part of our continuum. Prevention services are really designed with the goal of ensuring that, whenever possible wanted to say for a child that we keep that family together and whole and give them the supportive services that they need, and typically through our contracted network of providers prevention services, quite literally meet families where they are most services are provided in their homes and so of course, kovat has presented a real challenge, as it has for all other direct service providers. The network of prevention services providers across the city, though, has been unwaveringly dedicated serving families in their home when it's really necessary to have that face-to-face engagement, appreciating sort of all of the necessary precautions around Kovich also, you know keep families and workers safe, but also really leveraging telehealth opportunities to ensure that connectivity is continuing to happen. Obviously, there is really undue stress at this time, especially for children and youth that are home and trying to continue to engage in a virtual education with fewer activities in the community. You know, I, think more stressful on children and youth, and probably anyone and really I think stressful on families that are disproportionately facing increased poverty, increased job loss, and so it has been more important now than ever to continue to meet families where they are I. Also, you know want to note that we are in prevention services at ace on the verge of recompete, or rather we have recomputed our system for the first time in ten years, which has meant really looking at how to take what has been a continuous process of improvement and growth that has affected a really sharp decrease over the last years in foster care and really kept more families together and supported, and really look across the system and strengthen those services across the system. So, on July 1st, that new continuum goes live and I think probably not a moment too soon, because the major things that we are focused on with the new services across the city are to increase the number of slots that are therapeutic and treatment slots that provide therapeutic and clinical services to our families. The construction of service across the city was really a two-year labor of really looking at what the needs of families in New, York, City and the families that ACS serves are, and so, while some families need some case management, some help getting connected to services. Many families really need a more intensive intervention in this new system will be prepared to do that for even more families in the city. The new continuum also creates Universal access for families, which is to say that every type of therapeutic model that we offer, including those designed specifically for families with children in those youth age ranges, are, will be offered in every borough across the city. And so really you know as a matter of equity, it's so important that families not be funneled to services just because they're nearby, but rather to services that are best gonna meet those needs, and this new continuum is gonna, make it even more possible for us to do that. The other thing that has been thematic across some of the comments and particularly MS Reyes spoke about, is really bringing in the voice of clients, so families, youth and children, and while our service providers do that on a regular basis, ACS is making a really concerted effort to partner with agencies to make sure that is happening both in service provision with families, but also at the organizational level to really ensure that services reflect what families want and need and that we continue to push towards making a service continuum that is responsive to family need, I. Think finally, I'll say, and the other place that we are really partnering with providers is to ensure that there are bodies within each organization and I think you know direct service organizations just like city government organizations, are in different places here that seek to disrupt racial bias in our systems in our service to clients. So we are really excited for the continued strengthening of ACS prevention services and I'm going to stop there and hand it over to Ray permanency services division. So, on behalf of our Commissioner David Hansell, our first Deputy Commissioner Eric, Brettschneider, Julie, Farber who's, our deputy commissioner at fps and yuri pollock who's, my boss, I just want to thank you for having us and while they've. Given me, the space I want to acknowledge the folks on the call, but then also especially Kashif I, just found his words so eloquent and the way that he describes some of the things that they that they would like to see happen. It just sort of pierced. My soul I've been doing youth work for most of my life, but I've been really deep in to Workforce Development in three different states and when I hear youth like him talk, it really inspires me to. You know, continue to try to develop programming work with partnerships around the city, really digging deep with our partner agencies like small business services, ISM at the OE to ensure that youth are thinking about career, his career pathways opportunities. Would it become self-sufficient but, more importantly, where they put their voice into the work that we do so the service delivery is reflective of who we're serving, and so I couldn't be more happy to be on this call with you all and thank you for listening to me talk for those two seconds. You know in terms of the programming that I want to enlighten you about. It's really wrapped around career readiness, education, employment and housing services, and so I want to give you just you know, sort of a really quick look at some of the programming that we provide and then maybe some opportunities where, if you know youth are looking to connect to services, then around career readiness, education, employment and housing services, they can so. First of all, we have a program called for your futures. If you haven't heard about it, I'm sure you will it's a wonderful program that focuses on education, employment and housing services. It essentially pairs up every foster care agency with the opportunity to develop a coaching team if they haven't already done that and connect youth in foster care to a coach, and so most folks on this call will probably know that one of the most important things our population youth can connect to is a caring, adult right and somebody who's got their best interests at heart and somebody's gonna guide them to. You know this process of life and help them connect to those next steps that are gonna, get them their best opportunity to be self sufficient to be successful. To be a good worker to be a business owner, whatever that youth decides to do, and so this futures program that was funded for this year gave us an opportunity to deliver services through coaching tutoring and also through a holistic approach that focused on permanency and connecting you to a caring adult. So that's a great program and we've had an abundance of success throughout the year with that programming and we're looking forward to what's coming down the pike with that. In addition to our futures programming, we have programs that focus on career readiness, programs for you and those career readiness programs are developed in partnership with Columbia University's of Columbia University puts together a why a work program which stands for young adult work, opportunities for rewarding careers, and it focuses on a vocational development that really, you know, takes a look at a career pathway approach to saying to youth. Here's you know career pathway, that you may decide that you want to do in New, York, City's, labor market and here's where you're at developmentally and the gap between where you are at and where you need to be. We need to develop a plan, a career path that has an educational plan and a career plan that includes these successive steps that get you along the way to where you want to be, and so we start to teach that to you that middle school, high school and on their way out to college, in addition to that structure that theology, that thinking that the wirework program affords used an opportunity to become part of a career Club and in that career club, there's experiential learning as well as destruction about how they use the labor market to design their career pathway. So that's just a sample I mean I could go on about that program. It's a wonderful partnership with Columbia University, but that's just to give you the gist of some of the things that we do. Planning we also partner up with dyc D, with their program advance and earn plus. The plus part for us is when we work with D Y C D. We ask that some of the programming that they provide includes coaching navigators and that it's trauma-informed and that's the plus in that program. So some of you all may know that the Y C D launched a new model of the Y P plus program. It's now advanced Mary, and so that follows again a career pathway program with a navigator. It's a paid internship program that allows you to get paid while they get work experience while they're also preparing for the HSE test and HSE prep, and so that's a really good opportunity for you to of especially disconnected you to connect to opportunities where they can get reconnected and then move along the line to a career pathway. We also have a mentored internship program and a partnership where we collaborate with Pinkerton was one of our philanthropic partners, and that is also a mentor and internship program where there is a supervisor and a one-on-one relationship with the youth, where you work in all of the foster care agencies who are part of the program in there's 12 of them. Who will provide opportunities for you to work in their IT department, work in their fundraising department to work in their admin department and get a real, hands-on perspective about what it's like to work at a non-profit. A community-based organization underneath the supervision of a caring adult and an executive within that infrastructure, so those are just a sample of some of the programs that we include. Acs fossil has college prep programs that we do at first, our we partner up with CUNY to do college enrollment programming, and we have a host of housing services that we provide to make sure youth are connected to affordable housing. Lately, what we've done, because of all the D kovat and the city constraints, around budget we've gone to Robin Hood and they graciously granted us a grant to enroll college youth into an internship program. So I work closely with my colleagues and ACS and we develop work sites citywide within ACS and this year, they're all virtual, so we've developed over a hundred squats for you to be able to enroll in two paid internships, while they're in college. So you know lieu of the fact that we know there's been some budget restraints. Some of the youth will still be able. These 100 you to in college will be able to do two things. They will be able to enroll in a internship with meaningful virtual work assignments, skill development opportunities to become a part of a career Club and get mentoring and finally get some tech. Immersion Google graciously allowed us to waive the fee for our youth to become G suite certified so to of that, and our partnership with New Yorkers for children also to help you get certified as parent peer educators. All of that wrapped up into this opportunity, fronted by Robin Hood and youth they're, going to get a stipend for $2,800 for six weeks of virtual work, plus all that skill, development, mentoring and tech immersion that's involved. So this is just some of the things that ACS really works hard to provide to connect with philanthropy to partner up with academic institutions, community-based organizations to provide the career, readiness to education and the Employment Opportunity housing opportunities for you. The last thing I mentioned is that if there is, if there are youth that you're working with- and you want to connect them to these opportunities, all of the opportunities that I mentioned as we're at the end of the fiscal year are wrapping up services, a Robin, Hood Foundation. We opened up with a person Thursday and all of those applications we've had over 300 candidates apply. So if anybody were to say that you don't want to work, you know we could hardly that's not true, and so in three days we had 300 applicants apply. We only have 100 slots, we're definitely gonna fill them all, but what we did do last thing I'll share is that we had a virtual career there. So, when the pandemic hit, we immediately sought out relationships with employers who were essential service employers. They work environments for youth, offering not only training but also an opportunity for you to go to work immediately. So we had a virtual career, fair with six employers, allied Barton they're like universal. Now it's Caritas FedEx manpower who represented FedEx and an JPMorgan, Chase, Bank and also UPS, and we also partnered up with small business services and their Career Center in the Bronx, and we had over 300 folks, online coaches in our system used and we connected about 35 youth to jobs. We've been pairing up youth with job opportunities and continuing to work with them. So we have what we call ACS prep sessions to prepare youth or interviews, connect them to employers. Where we have relationships where we know the work environment is safe. You know that kids are gonna, learn, they're, gonna, be treated respectfully and be able to you know, sort of move along a career pathway and almost all of those employers that I mentioned UPS. Allied Universal securitas all have college tuition reimbursement at their entry-level positions and offer you the opportunity for pensions. So we are, you know we continue to build out those relationships with employers and I. Think that's where the interconnectivity can happen with us. If there's you know who, during the summer may not have an opportunity to go to work an internship, we want to propose that we put them right in front of the city's economic recovery. Have them get connected to job opportunities where there are real jobs, real paying real hours and safe environments and move forward in a collaborative way to help youth connect to those opportunities being as prepared as they can be? Thank you and I'll be available for questions and I'll also put my information in the chat that folks want to reconnect. Yes, thank you. So much I just want to acknowledge that council member Mark Levine is here, so we welcome you and we're so glad you're here. Thank you so much for joining us and we're excited to hear from you, I want to finish with I, want to allow ACS to finish and then we'll move and then we'll move to you. So we have another a couple of more speakers greats from ACS we're here available for questions, but that is the bulk of our presentation. Lots of other folks when it's good as I think so much for having it. Thank you so much it's so exciting to learn about the work that you're doing both in terms of a holistic structure of ACF and making your services more accessible, more targeted and then also all of those fantastic programs. I just want to hear more. So thank you so much for sharing and helpful member levine. It's so good to have you with us. I'm gonna turn it over to you. Thank you very much kathryn and it's great to see everyone here at cv7 a very challenging time for all of us for the city but I'm afraid doubly so for young people, though, have endured social isolation and have had their educational experience so terribly disruptive and are facing really challenging career prospects that, at a time when the economy is in such bad shape, and so in that context the fact that at the moment, the city's budget entirely slashes some of youth employment to me is totally unacceptable. And you know, prior to the pandemic, we had a big push in the City Council for universal some youth employment, because I feel- and many of my colleagues feel that the young person's willing to step up and say they want to do the right thing over the summer and actually do some work and get some experience and help out the community and make some money. Then it's crazy that we would turn them away and we had made progress in expanding the program, but not enough last summer. Well how we did expand the program to 75,000 slots. We had a hundred and fifteen thousand kids who apply so that's 40 thousand young people who stepped up and wanted to do the right thing and we were told no, and you know relative to the size of the city budget. The financial barriers were not insurmountable. So, given that we were disappointed with that shortfall, you can imagine how many of us have felt with the total cancellation of SYEP this summer, and you know we understand that many of the traditional job functions are not going to be possible because of ongoing concerns about social distancing. But you know, there's also lots of new jobs which need doing that young people could do now. We need to be checking in on senior citizens who are homebound. We have thousands in my district. More than my staff could ever do alone, and young people could be if they wanted to be safe at home. Making those calls asking seniors do they need help connecting them to food banks etc. In a more public role, where we have a continuing need for social distancing ambassadors to be out there, giving out information on coronavirus and giving out masks and in a non aggressive enforcement way, informing people about the need for that and for folks, young people a little bit older, certainly I would say over 18 or 18 and over there's a role in our what I like to call our Public Health core, which is the people who are doing contact tracing right now, which is a workforce of several thousand, which includes people who go door-to-door people who help connect people to social services when their quarantine, iing and those jobs. Many of them don't require masters in health or anything like that. It's appropriate for a young person, in fact better for someone who understands the community who has connections to the community, who speaks the languages of the local neighborhood, etc. So this is playing out now in the budget fight not in City Hall, which is in its final hours. Here final days and I'm, hoping we'll have good news: I don't have any yet, but I guess the other topic. I just want to briefly touch upon looking farther ahead is next year in the school year, and what school is going to look like for young people and the non school opportunities for them through after-school, etc, and there's just so much uncertainty about that right. Now, uncertainty about the extent to which school can be conducted in person or through some sort of hybrid, where only a portion of kids are in the building at any moment, and others are doing distance learning multiple shifts at different times of the day or different days of the week etc. Can we do activities in outdoor parks and school yards because the virus doesn't spread as well as easily in those settings? We need to work this out soon, because it's not fair to families. It's not fair to kids I'm concerned that we're not talking enough about after-school programs and the kind of things that are so important to social-emotional development of young people to career development and I, actually think or easier to plan in a socially distance world, because you have generally, you don't have the whole school population there after school and you can be more mobile as well, and the groups tend to be smaller, so I feel like after school from a virus safety perspective. We can plan this right and we need to force those financial questions there as well in the budget and I. Think the other big question for next year and one that's looms large for us for many years- is entry criteria, selection criteria in middles and middle and high schools and I see. Here we have one of my favorite principals in the world, principal Washington from West, Prepon and I. Think he has some other folks from the school here and I know that you principal Washington, have been thinking a lot about ways. We can improve middle-school selection criteria on the west side to make a more integrated than fair makeup of our schools and student bodies. So I know that's not the topic tonight, but very much on my mind and I think has to be on the short list as we talk about an agenda for young people in the months and years ahead. So that's it for me, big picture, I, don't know if there's time or interesting questions but I'll stick around for bid either way. Thank you. So much for sharing all those really fantastic ideas and I hope that I hope that many of them come to fruition. So, let's turn it over to Sandino Sanchez, the director of team and program society and II know we're so excited to have you with us. Thank you. Thank you. I will say that this is a tough group to follow and everyone is doing fantastic work. You guys are truly the soldiers and the protectors of our communities to the councilmember. We met many years ago and I love the fact that you are still champion the fight for young people not only for work but also for their livelihood. I want to thank you for that. So, as mentioned, my name is Sandino. Sanchez I have the director for Workforce Development. What do we do on the children's a society we've been around for quite some time few hundred years we have the unique ability to provide support services to children and family in every developmental stage of their life. What does that mean? That means that we have early childhood settings from cradle to college and support young people all throughout college to make sure they graduate. How do we do it? We have a dozen or so early childhood, centers or citywide. We have quite a few elementary and middle schools where we are the proud community school director and we're part of the community school movement. Our flagship Community Schools have everything from been to mental health and medical services, as well as your traditional after-school programs as well as we are partners and those schools that were in. We also have high schools. We have beacons and we have centers that we've been operating for many years. Our flag, ship centers, are in Harlem of the middle beyond 18th Street and the Fred duck Center and the East Harlem Center, as well as good as you in stand on it. So we're citywide. We have multiple partners, including ACS's and who's, in the set in this room, as well as dy CB and every other city and state government agency. What I do what I do? My job is to make sure to create three 3,000 to 3,500 internships for young people, because we know they're young people, they have a part-time job, end up getting better grades and of going us college and graduate because somehow those relationships they built in the workplace are, lastly, and they serve as examples even when they may not have examples at home, even when they may not have teachers that support them, even where they don't have those supports that they need somehow someway they manage to get them at the workplace. They meet people, they establish relationships and that's what pushes them and motivates them to be who they become I'm very concerned. As son I am 51 years old I often tell people, I survived the 80s 109 street in Amsterdam, I have war scars and war stories that I could. We could spend the whole night talking about, and then we will all cry ourselves to sleep. I'm very concerned this summer. This is the first time and maybe thirty years that over 300,000 young people will be unsupervised. There are no day camps, there are no parks, no pools nowhere for young people to go and even worse there are no jobs. Like the council member said earlier last year, the city and the state provided 75,000 job opportunities to young people. We know what young people do with that money right. It gets reinvested back into the community, it doesn't go anywhere. It doesn't go on sneakers, as some people may think it doesn't go. You know it goes back to the revitalization of the community. So why not? Why not? Now, when we most need young people and investing in young people should always be at the forefront and should be part of the kovat recovery strategy. Young people are, for the most part, losing their minds with these zooms there's a virtue instruction, they're getting bored and they're gonna have a lot of idle time and all the experts on this room know what happened when young people are not supervised and they're. The idle now me I'm a perfect example of that. I know very well how young people have the ability to organize. We may not like what they organize. They don't always organize for bad. Sometimes they organize for good, but the end result is idle time. Parents may not be around because they're transitioning back to work right. At least we hope. We hope that we get back into the swing of things and people could go back to some level of normal. We don't know what that normal is, but we expect that there's gonna be some transition back into normal, and then these young people will be doing or in the corner on the streets. Again the summers 12 to 14 weeks. All it takes is one mistake whether it's a sexual assault, whether as our argument, the rent went the wrong way, whether it's interaction with NYPD, whether there is something that was racially motivated. You know we are going through. We are all living history right now. The last thing some the last time something happened like this was a hundred years ago with the Spanish flu and now, what's going on with the with the struggle and fight for police reform, all these things have a lasting impact, and where are we as a race to our young people? So what we want? What we need is full restoration of SYEP, if not partial, for a relaxed social distancing so that young people can not just work virtually. We can make that an option. We have the capacity to do that, but also to call young people to be able to be what was mentioned earlier. Kovac ambassadors whenever that may be well, however, that can be defined, there's potential and opportunity for that. In addition to that, we need our camps and please read back in business. You know a lot of we oftentimes talk about first responders. We oftentimes talk about the folks that are valued and are part of this coded recovery, but nonprofits are usually not in that conversation and that's a problem, because in every step of the way nonprofits have been at the forefront, we were there with we're here now we were there with in Sandy. We were here there for nine eleven and then you could go back to the history of New York City and you will find nonprofits rolling up their sleeves trying to make a difference. So why do fund nonprofits now when you need them the most? It doesn't make any sense, and we need all of us to continue our advocacy in our efforts to make sure that these things are not continue to happen, because the most neediest people and families in our communities need it more now. This is a time when we should be investing in young people. The future that young man that spoke earlier is the future. We're supposed to be you're trying to work to make sure that young man has an internship this summer that young man has something to do after school. They can put some money in his pocket and then we continue to support him in his career goals. How do we do it so this year, despite the budget cuts and the massive layoffs that we have done in response to kovat, we have decided to stack up a few of our pennies and create our summer jobs experience not a lot, not the 3,000 that I'm used to after 4,000 of them used to boom. We created our own version of summer youth for about be hungry young people. It's all a virtual experience. They're going to learn to be two tutors using reading are using our books and a reading program to read the younger young people. They're gonna learn our project-based learning activities, whether it's stem base, whether it's learning how to make hand sanitizers or learning how to make masks. There's an entrepreneurship part of it, there's an artistic part of it and there's a justice part of it. We- and this has been said many times today and I'm gonna sit in my own way. Young people need a voice and we need to start listening to them. If we were listening and we have been listening to young people, we wouldn't be going to what we're going through today. Young people are fed up, don't still listen, you tell them what to do. We tell them when they write, we celebrate them when they write, but when they want sometimes we're not there in the way that we should be- and this is what's going on now in America, young people are fed up. They want action and they're taking actions in the hands and what are the role? What is the role that we have? We have a role in all that to nurture to support and to create an environment, but we can't do it without resources. Everyone in this room has already said we have less or we're still doing it, but we could do more. So the idea is that collectively we continue fighting to get what we need to make sure that our families gets what they need this summer. Our plans for this summer is to have young people, distribute the OPP ease to help prepare food for distribution to those that need it to continue assisting with the recs, the rec centers and distributing food to become experts with pulpit and be able to share information about that, and as well as to be young people, it has to be fun all the big geared towards making sure that, at the another six weeks, experience they're able to show and tell what they've done with their family and their friends. Let me see what else I go down here after a lot of us have been talking about coffee today, but we have not talked about the covert of tomorrow Oh as nonprofits. We have to start preparing on the impact of the loss of jobs. The injuries are shaken up. Some people may not return back to employment, so there's going to be a higher need, not just for food, but also for shelter. There's going to be a lot of litigation when landlord-tenant there's going to be a lot of uncertainty and I know that I have a bunch of academic professionals in my life, and they talked to me about that. The highbreed that the councilmember mentioned earlier, how our families that are supposed to work? How can they be home if the young people are home twice a week? How is that even possible? So there's a piece of all that that's gonna affect not the Kovalev today, the Kovalev tomorrow and I. Don't necessarily think that we are totally prepared as much as we sure I think. That's all I have I'm gonna stick around. If anybody has any questions. Thank you so much for the invitation and I love all you guys, keep it doing the good work much and we love you too and appreciate what you shared, and so thank you so much and I'm going to turn it over to our laughs from the community service Society of New, York and champ, which is the community health mental health care project, which is in partnership with the New, York, State, Office of alcoholism and substance. Abuse services and office of mental health, we have Santa Sri anama Vasquez, the director of government relations. It's so good to see you again have you with us and Alison Wyman who's, a health attorney. So thank you both so much for being here. I got very nice to see us being a long time here. Welcome it's nice to see some familiar faces, I think I, know Sunday. You know and I cancel member levine, I think, is still around nice to see you I'm, not gonna, say much. My name is Santa Soriano government relations, community service society, CSS I, would say, is the older sister or brother of Children's Aid Society, because it has been around for 175. We used to share the same building a long time for a while, so I just have to say: CSS is an anti-poverty organization. A lot of people know CSS mostly for our research work that have been focused around I use, health, housing and labor related issues, and also we have also programs that serve people throughout the entire state, health related issue and access to health care, and we also have different smaller programs throughout the entire organization as well, but today, I'm just gonna, pass it on right away to Allison, who is going to be talking mostly at our mental health issue, and before that I just wanna touch on two points: ESF I have done a lot of research around in Summer Youth Employment was a big part of the coalition that made 75,000 Summer Youth Employment slap-happy last year two years ago, as council member. Let me mentioned so it's unfortunately, we don't see some loss this year. Hopefully we are, will don't see all of them to be lost and also we've been working a lot around the diversity in school, primarily in middle school and in high school. So she SS was also hired a major task force and we have done a lot of work around specialized high schools in Essex, black and Latino students, so with that I'm just gonna lead to Alison to talk about mental health issues and the services that we provide for everyone, but I'm sure she has some work on young people in and working with them. Alison, hello, everyone, my name is Alex and wyman. Thank you. So much for having me I am incredibly inspired by all of the work that everybody is doing and I'm really honored to be here. So thank you for having me I am a health attorney on the champ program and the champ program is New York State's Ombudsman program for behavioral health. What that means is the champ program helps anybody in New York State, regardless of the type of insurance they have and regardless of their age and regardless, if they're insured at all, with any sort of mental health or substance, use disorder, insurance issues. Now I talked to my team today about this presentation, and so what we did was we pulled together a few examples of what champ has done, particularly with youth and with families, to help support people's quest for certain types of services. One example is oftentimes: we see that clients need some sort of mental health or substance use, disorder, services and the need is quite urgent and it's time it's quite urgent when it comes to time, but that person, the youth who really needs to be supported through these services is not insured. So what we are able to do at champ is we have a helpline which I'll share at the end of my presentation, but if the family member, or that individual youth calls us, we actually can connect them over the phone through a warm transfer to one of our navigators who is able to actually do a phone, a roll enrollment for that individual and get them enrolled in Medicaid or another type of insurance. At that particular moment, we have found that even if people are insured, there are also other administrative issues that can hold up accessing care. And so an example of this is a client and family who waited two months to see a provider and showed up right before the appointment and learned that there was some administrative error regarding their and which was going to keep that. Keep that youth from seeing the provider. And so because we had been working with the family. The father was able to call champ and we were able to explain to their financial aid team and to their. We were able to explain to their administrative team that we were actually working to fix the problem and it was a problem that the family had addressed and it was actually something that was just taking a while to process and as a result that individual youth was able to see the provider that day. Another type of example of the services that champ offers is simply helping. Families that have insurance understand what mental health and substance use disorder benefits are included in their insurance and how to find providers that are in network. And so we see this a lot and understandably that when there is an instance, a circumstance, a situation that involves the need for substance, use disorder or mental health services, the family, member or the parent, or the guidance counselor or the teacher. They are working on so many other components of the logistics of trying to make sure that this individual, youth or child is safe, that it's, they don't necessarily have the time or the capacity at that moment, to do the research or to speak to the insurer about who actually is in network and who has openings, and so what we do. A lot is, we are, we call providers or we speak to the plan. We use search tools and we find providers that are in network that are accepting new patients and that are willing to set up an appointment that day, and so, even though these types of search functions are available online. Sometimes in the moment, it's really difficult and sometimes to be honest, those online directories are not accurate, and so, when time is of the essence, one of the things that chant can do is actually get on the phone and really try to find a provider for that individual or family. We also provide referrals so oftentimes many of our clients, which I'm sure all of you are familiar with. They come to us with a myriad of ways that they could use support and at champ and at the community service Society of New York. We focus on health insurance issues, but that doesn't mean that we don't want to also try to provide a level of support on their other issues and so I'm so glad to be on this today and I've been seriously taking notes, because, even though many of these organizations are already on our resource list, I'm going to make sure tomorrow morning that our resource lists are updated with all of the fantastic services that all of you are providing sometimes. So those are examples of things we try to do: pre service, trying to help someone find a provider or get insured. Sometimes families or individuals come to us when they're in the middle of service or they have a provider, but they don't like that individual provider, and so they want to change. So that's an example of where informal or formal advocacy, either working with the individual, youth or client or the family, or at some at some times directly, with directly with the provider, can lead to a situation where the individual client, the youth, feels better about their care. Lastly, as we know, health insurance is really complicated and we see a lot of cases where individual youth have received care needed care. That was critical at that moment only to find out later when the family or the individual received some sort of bill or explanation of benefits from their insurance company. That individual plan was out of network or the service is not being covered because the plan deems it not medically necessary, and so in that situation, what we do is we help people with Appeals and the appeals laws, particularly for the different types of plans, whether you're, fully insured or self-insured, our quite difficult as time lines are very strict, and so what we're able to do is to walk families through that process. We're able to at times write or provide templates for families to submit those appeals, and then, when it comes to something called external Appeals, which are sort of the end of the appeals process after you've tried everything else and you're your last chance within the existing process that exists, we do write those external Appeals for families and their use. The last thing I just want to touch upon is something called a parity violation. Now there are times when what a plan is doing seems unjust, but is actually allowed under the law, and then there are times that what the plan is doing by requiring certain type of certifications for a provider to be a network or by requiring that much source stricter criteria is met for medical necessity for a certain type of behavioral health service. There are times when those types of restrictions are illegal under federal and state law and that's called parity, and so what we do is we oftentimes read through plan contracts and if it seems like there's an issue where behavioral health services on a whole, so not necessarily for this specific person, but for everybody who has this health insurance plan and contract is being denied services that they really should be. Then what we do is we write parity complaints to the right to the appropriate regulatory authority. Now I wanted to provide our helpline number for anybody who's interested in calling our helpline. Our helpline is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 a.m. and our helpline number is 1 800 and if you call that helpline number you'll be connected to the champ team, which consists not only of the people at CSS and our multidisciplinary group of attorneys and social workers, but our network throughout all of New York State, which includes community-based organizations in different parts of New, York State, as well as specialists in Medicare and confidentiality and mental health, who can who are all working together to try to find a way to resolve this particular youth or families problem, and also try to pave a way for people who come after that individual to be able to access services. Thank you very much. Thank you so much so we have so many wonderful. Everybody keep their client very purpose of the session. It's really to learn so I want to first shellie need to unmute yourself. I have a resolution to present. Would this be appropriate time? Why don't we wait till? We should be. Let's wait till we hear a little bit more discussion. Okay, that's! Certainly! Okay! So I'm going to hold back on my thoughts. Okay, one other thing just to say that Gale Brewer checked in and advocating for social worker in every school and the mayor had provided through the Thrive New York program, certain social workers, but that that's being cutbacks and he's proposing replacing the social workers that are being cut with those, but those are being cut back. So it's really this disconnect there. Certainly a social worker in each school would be very desirable and about the value of a social worker in the school cannot be underestimated. I, that's very good point I'm! Thank you for sharing that I'm gonna call on every person on the committee, starting with Lolita. If Lolita has a comment, I just want to say, I just want to make a statement that I was very depressed about the summer for our kids throughout the city. It's almost to a point where you know I felt it we're just gonna have a lot of havoc and a lot of problems, but hearing all of these programs. It gives me some faith that there are things for children to get involved with, so I really want to thank all of you for spending this time tonight. It's really important for us to be able to advocate and spread the word to neighbors and to other you know, people with kids and stuff to let them know that there are programs out there and there are activities so I really want to thank all of you. I feel a lot better. Thank you and Robert they're, absolutely extraordinary and of the program portfolios not for profit or for children, but when it does frost the committee I think it does. It helps us well. First of all, it shows us how utterly critical the issue is and how much trouble in, because, if we are talking about $75,000 jaar 75,000 jobs offered last year under the previous budget, and now that we're gonna have the cuts already cutting down to a program offering a couple of hundred jobs. That sort of thing so where the trouble is severe, but this draws a more granular picture of the problem that is going to they're. Confronted with on the street and I think what this presentation does with all of them and I just can't say enough about this panel- is that it gives us a moment it for our resolution shelley and we, those of us who are not educators and so my motion with the programs that are going to be lost, see, and we know that DYC dean, which has been around forever- it's not at me, but when I was in program development in the city and you counted on DYC, so that now we have a fuller picture of what we're up against, because the our inland that we know that Helen was also quite a fighter in a in a worry on behalf of the budget restoration. But we need more. We need more force, supporter and I. Think that now we have that's my comment for the moment ever great, so I'm gonna ask Courtney. If you have any questions for the speaker or any comment, what an incredible session I actually have a lot of notes that I've flagged for follow-up later, but I think no further questions other right at this moment, just really just to see our thanks to everyone for their time and their passion on this and I'm sure you'll be hearing from us in many areas that you touched on tonight later and that coming week and well one thing that, from the very beginning that young man and spoke asked for something with such a heartfelt emotion. He said we want a party. Can we have a party something to celebrate and I feel like the young? People need something to celebrate and I, don't know how we go about doing this, but it was just the way he asked it made me feel like if we could do something small like that or find a way to get the city to do something small like that. It would show that we're thinking about you guys, mm-hmm and Natalie handing over to you, and it's not remind everybody, to make sure there's screens around you, okay yeah. It's Andy, no I wanna ask him: how was he my head? Because the things you were saying is the things I've been trying to rectify all these years because of things and I come now with the kids and it has been going on since out of 50 and 60s. That's how long I've been in this neighborhood and most of the men in jail are kids that didn't have any where to go over anybody support them. Anybody to love them so yo. Your conversation to me, you were in my head, I said: get out, get out get out, so thank you for having the same thoughts that I had it makes me feel wonderful, but also too, and I want to thank Catherine and Shelley for talking to me and so being supportive of understanding how important it is to support these kids. That I, don't know I, don't remember who said it, but there's gonna be a whole. Many kids out there with all the small businesses opening up putting tables out there, they're bored, they're, angry, they're, frustrated and I, and what I'm afraid of is harm coming to them. I mean I'm. A realist they need something they need to feel important. They need to feel that this coronavirus wants me to do something positive in my life too, so we all have to give them that support. I love all you guys and forgive me saying guys, but I love all of you that came here, but ideas that I had no idea of these programs that are available to use. So I really applaud you all for doing the work you have done. I'm, like Courtney, said we're gonna be in touch because there's so much to do. I don't want to see any more kids in jail for just being hungry, just being wanted support just being wanted to love all of those things so I think us as and not even just us as adults, but us as activists support people whatever we need to go to them where they are and tell them. We care, because those people, when we gone they're gonna, be with your kids. So why not? We teach them interact with other people other than us, so it's very important to do that so I. Thank you, Catherine! Thank you! Cat Shelley! For doing this wonderful zoom meeting, thank you. It's all I'm saying thank you. So much Madeline and I want to make sure to call in mark Diller our amazing care to see. If you have any comments thanks so much given the hour, I'll try to focus in on a couple of really important things and try not to repeat my heart is full right now with the positive energy that surrounds so many needs and the conflicts that all of you who provide services to our youth can bring to it. I I'm expressing it badly. But it is remarkable to me how, in the face of the needs that you're confronting whether it be teenage violence or sexual, predator or abandonment by adults, that you bring a positive energy to all this work. And then you share that with us, and then we of course heard the thoughts of our student, who was who was bringing that positive energy to a whole community. So thank you very much for that overview and takeaway from some of this work that you do. I want to. I want to just sort of touch briefly on the ideas that we've already been working on at cb7 we've been advocating for years for SYEP, including in our budget last year, and we've already actually written to the City Council to renew that support and others of our committees are focusing on different aspects of the programming we heard about tonight. There are tons of needs here and I, look forward to the resolution that you're going to put forward and looking forward to trying to influence both now and well into the future, the budgetary aspects of what you're confronting, because this is not a one-year issue as far as I, can tell that. There's going to be multiple years in which the ripple effects of what is happening in our economy will be playing out and the need to provide for our most vulnerable will not go away anytime soon, which leaves me like Lolita grateful for the incredible work that you all are doing and we hope we'll be able to help. You continue to do thanks very much so Thanks. So great. Thank you so much mark. So there's a few board members here and I'm just going to call on each of you in case you have anything you want to ask Barbara it's good to see you thank you. I have nothing really to add, except that this was really an extraordinary symposium and thank you so much for putting it together. Speakers were really wonderful, Thanks and Richard yeah. You know, I might my one question: if Mark Levine is still on the call, is there anything in a couple of and the hours literally hours left before the budget is decided on? Is there anything we can do influence any budgetary decision for this he's not here, but we, but my answer is that we are going to try we're going to try our best I mean like I, can't emphasize enough more. They disaster was going to fall the city if youthful not served it's just it's unimaginable, really and youth being searched should not be contingent on. You know they at one point. They were going to cut out entirely the Summer Youth Employment Program, but not cut more than one or two percent from any other budgetary item. In the budget, which is you know, I, don't think that's the current state of play, but it that somebody could think that way is just unimaginable. So we have thank you so much. Richard and IRA are you here and do you have any comments that you'd like to share I'm here I, look forward to having the opportunity to vote on this and one or two other resolutions that are in a similar vein and if we can make him fifty zero at our next meeting, that's what we ought to do! Berta! Yes, so the budget is within the next two weeks, so we don't have. We probably don't even have to the full board to weigh in on it, but it is very important that we know that we're not happy all these cuts forever. Thank you for Berta and I'm, and thank you for just emphasizing that, where we don't have time so I want I, think that covers all the board. Members that are here and I just want to say that I think I, suppose Nora and I'm really happy to see you and Mark Murphy still here, mark Diller, yeah mark I can't see you for some reason: I get that a lot I can't see. I can't see the public members. So how do we, except for I, saw Jinora? You call up if you call up participants so the bottom of your screen. There are a couple of buttons hit the button that says participants and then there's panelists and attendees would be those who you can't see. Okay, so let me open it up to the attendees if you have any comments or to the panelists the speakers from all of these wonderful organizations and ACS. If you have any questions or comments that you want to add to the discussion now these birth mothers really anyone Oh Rosa hi, this was really so informative and I. Just so appreciate it. I also wanted to add that I don't want to forget what the young man said about backpacks. He mentioned something about backpacks and supplies, and so that I feel it's something really important. I mean you can't really do school. I know we're not we're doing virtual school right now, but when we go back to school without having basic supplies, so I found that to be another thing that was really important, very basic and I'm sure there's a way we can figure out to help with this. So I just wanted to make sure that we keep that on the list as well, because I just think it's really important. In addition, I grew up in the city. I mean I'm 45 now, but I was a youth at one point and I did us SYEP at least two summers in a row and I got a really great letter of recommendation and was able to get into the Newhouse School of Public, Communications I'm sure in part because of that recommendation. So it's not just the work and the extra money, like the connections you get out of that I mean I. Didn't I, didn't really know anyone, but it was a program. I wanted to get into and I'm sure that letter of recommendation was extremely helpful, so it's beyond just like summer work and money. It's also getting a connection, getting a really good letter of recommendation and going to the school of your dreams, pretty amazing, so it's something that we really have to focus on for others, so that they can benefit as I did. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Those are two really great points. I think this applies. It's like a very essential need something that's and others, and also what you said about the life opportunity. That's reported from each of these programs are so important. It's not just in that moment, but it's for a lifetime. It has you know every positive action has a okay, so I, don't I just want to check the list of participants, one more time to make sure that I am not missing anyone that wants to share. So why don't I turn it over to you? Shelley, okay, so I'd just like to point out that I'd like to ask any agency that has not done so just to send them the name technical name of the programs that you're that you want to continue want to have funded and so on. We have references to them and some of them with specifics, and so in our resolution Lee one of them. You know in the resolve part. We want to really list each thing, so it nothing's lost yes, Ellie I'm, sorry interrupt you is that I will also review the transcript from this discussion to make sure that we don't miss anything and we can share the resolution. The final resolution with everybody that came so that, if there's anything that we miss or that they want to add, and then this resolutions for now, but it's for ongoing, because our district needs statement will be developed from your input. So it has long-term application. It's just not a one-shot piece here, so these are the following facts that inform their understanding of the situation of youth during this pandemic and moving forward one. The greater number of sexual assaults against children, especially teens that forensic training is critical for providers and it's very often habit for the age groups that are experience. Sexual assault, mother abuse that counseling out of necessity had to be often how to be virtual during this period of time as Kashif so beautifully. Articulate the voice of youth has rarely been a part of the conversation about youth coordination between schools and community service agencies are not formally structured to serve the whole child very often Runaways and homeless. Youth have needs that are not well met, specifically for housing vouchers and for more time and drop-in centers and trauma therapies due to the pandemic prevention services very often had to be virtual, except when absolutely necessary. The more intense therapeutic services are available in the new continuum was everything has to defund. It has been a program to connect, foster care, youth with coach, a caring adult and that's something our committee has dealt with especially Roberts has a strong interest in that for a long time. There are programs that provide paid internships, but, of course we need more. There are no camps. Little ball feels no playgrounds open and for summer and very end with the no SYEP very few internships for the summer, so our youth unfortunately, can be idled during the summer, the community health access for addiction and for mental health. True, this advocacy taking people through the processes that they have to and for her and for the services that they need and so impressed about how far people are taken, which is unusual and agencies we handle it and then they get it. They don't get it have it I have all the notes on all of the programs from coping through kovat teens, take on kovat preventive services, the workforce support young women's leadership, initiative with project dream own until the sexual assault, initiative, safe horizons and so on and so forth. I have them all listed and I just want to make sure we get them all I'm instead of going on and on all the light. I think it's so important. I want to just come to the resolve. So therefore it be resolved that cb7 calls upon the mayor and the City Council to support and enhance funding for these crucial programs, and we will list them for children and young men and women in the executive budget and the City Council budget, furthermore be resolved. That cb7 will create opportunities for youth, to have a voice in the community and to advocate for opportunities for youth, for recreation and internships for the summer and, furthermore, be it resolved that the needs and programs that we discussed tonight will be a part of our continuing conversation and incorporated in the cb7 district needs statement. Shelly, that's so fantastic! Thank you. So much I think community may have some questions. One sec thought that I have is Kamini kind of intentionally requests at the city, or could we request that the city intentionally or strategically and includes you in their process when it comes to figuring out a strategy for addressing some of these challenges? You said that cb7 with who view through forums and that's great, but can we call the city to do that in some way, maybe think about the language Richard and then we Bob also we just have to unmute it's a great summary and a great resolution. I would ask though I you know I. You mentioned the groups who spoke tonight and I, don't think we should exclude other similar groups in similar circumstances, so you may want to just able you say these routes and others performing equally important work or something like that. You know that it's not we're not an advocate for any specific groups, but for the services they perform. You know the other thing I wanted to just suggest. Is that there's a special need for lbgtq children and you may want to add that as a otherwise I think it's great I agree questions or comments without their at Robert. I'm. Sorry Robert! Well. The resolution, of course is excellent and it outlined the comprehensive catalog services and agencies that are working to make this better, but I want infuse and it will we run language again. I want infused and Richard made the point, then it's the point that the committee we've all been making all along, but let's infuse some language to convey the emotionality of this whole thing so, for example, not for example. The point of this. These cuts being imponderable I think we have to tell them. Ii have to tell the Budget Committee that and let's work on Richards expression of it. This theme thought that who thinks this way see so the word imponderable gets at it, but I think that we want to have that kind of emotional language in the resolution in the therefore and the word restoration. So we have to challenge the mindset or maybe it's beyond that. Maybe it's a system of thought. Maybe it's an ethos among these people that make the budgets and that I'll never forget some demonstration a couple of years to go, and there was lady standing next to me and I forget exactly which it is, but they blend and she said- and we were talking about black people, black men and black people. In this particular point she was making once about black men. She says when they don't know what to do with our men. They throw them in jail. Now, I studied history and as in Hunter College, and some of my research took me back to the 17th century. Where there's where the preachers were talking about Housing Opportunity for three men and that prison and containment was a perfect way of giving opportunities for housing to people who not white men all right, but the same mindset with children. So we have children that are under programs under see why the all of the different programs and all of a sudden we're pulling the lot form under all of these kids- and we have to be I- have to be careful with the language, because kids we're talking about 25 year old in their 20s, not just 13 14 15 years, we're talking about young people who are trying to get settled, trying to find their way and they've gotten their summer jobs and that they've been able to count on, and maybe an internship here and inside and all of a sudden. They got nothing. Okay and, as Madeline could sit, you know. They'll hit the street, that's a reflex, but we have to mmm as it were, that the kind of thing, whatever the kind of mindset that allows you to even contemplate cutting all of these funds. And when this statewide we had that. Seventy five thousand jobs available, even that wasn't enough. So now we're supposedly gonna get some people are going to get comfortable with a couple of hundred or several thousand jobs, and when the kids in the street, the young people in the street are saying no can No Mas, which is the phrase No Mas. We have to take that same position in the same strength and convey that same emotional position in our ways we have nothing to fear right, nothing to fear. What are they gonna come and shoot us down? Maybe they will but we've all been fine. You know the rest of them okay and expose ourselves point well-taken Robin, so does anybody else have any comments or questions without the resolution? Okay, Richard I, just if committee like I, can just draft a couple of sentences along the lines of a little emotional flavor. I, probably can't do it tonight, but it would be along the lines of my. Can you also Richard. Add those two other points that you made and the and including all and thing and all similar right? Okay, look at it to you tomorrow! Okay, in that spirit, let's have a vote all right. Let's have a vote. First, the committee members right it's great, raise your hands, so that's Katherine, Shelley, Robert, Audrey, Madge and Kourtney. When Kourtney excuse me, you're right, Malika, Lolita, oh you're, right Lolita too, we have some updating to do. Okay. Mark. Of course, Richard has speak many men, okay, Rosa is Irish still here, IRA, okay, and so that's it. So we had six committee members of seven committee, members I, think it's six dicks and I believe we have six non-committee members, okay, so six, zero, six, zero, unanimous and Catherine. You did an amazing job nationally and Rob. Oh well done all of you Shelley! You did an amazing job with the resolution. It's so wonderful to see so many people here from the community board and to get your insights and also our amazing speakers, I think, there's just a poll that remains mr. Washington. Thank you. So much for being a part of this with us. I know I'm, giving you a big hug through virtual hug and say to Matt Madeleine, who motivated us to really saw thinking about this seriously and working with us to get it that I think you - Madeleine furnish it initiating this, be here without you. So we have one other thing to do as a committee, and that is hear from Courtney who's been doing really great work and she hasn't covered something really important. As a new member of the committee and we love her, we're so excited to have her with us. So Courtney do you want to share what you've been working on yeah and I? Can you all hear me I just switched to my earbuds yeah, so it had I'd swipe this for a couple of members. A couple weeks ago, I have started to see some news articles talking about how people who had coded 19 early on so early March things like that before what testing was widespread. We're now facing really large insurance, though, because they didn't get the official test and I actually knew anecdotally of at least one person to whom this happened, and so, while some things are covered and were free, if you got, for example, the actual test, a lot of things, including some really expensive hospital procedures and tests when they were in the hospital we're coming back, is as a very large bill. So I was trying to figure out how significant of an issue this would be and I have not yet discovered that, but in talking and making some phone calls. What I discovered by talking to some of the government agencies was that actually you can, if you have a bill that you have been denied by your insurance carrier coverage, you've been denied relief right. You can actually file with the gfs or an external appeal, and it has some time bounds. And it's actually interesting to me, because Allison Wyman, who was on the call tonight, talks about this as a service. But her agency provides to people with filing that external appeal: I mean it, and so that made my ears perk up because it's something of which I was not aware and seems to be something that could be really important for some people, if only they were aware of it, and so it has some minor costs associated with it, and it is extremely time bound. You have to have appealed. You have to have filed this external appeal from for dates from the date of the final determination from your insurance carrier. So it strikes me as something with potentially important to people and potentially could provide some really great relief. So now, armed with this information, my plan is to try and figure out the best way to get that information out. So my plan is to reach out to some of our elected officials and I'm, really open to any other message that people think might be important or whether they think this is valuable. Other ways that we can get that information to people who, for whom it might be extremely important to get that financial relief. Oh Courtney, it's our lor elected officials, send out updates kovat 19. Oh, that would be a great place if he could formulate it up your indistinctly and that's one to some of our agencies. Ryan hello, Center, okay, side I can go through my own housing organization, others where we have not only have our own people, but we also send things out to other people so yep if I could follow on Shelley a list. You'd add to that the Children's Aid Society was also with us today would be the another natural conduit as well as wish fish as Shelley mentioned. This might be something that you might want to take two minutes and mention it full board when we have a when we have our colleagues with us and then you'd get their collective input, although I think Shelley's hit the most the most ones, that will have the deepest penetration for getting the word out. Yep great. Thank you guys. Thank you. We have a lot to process Madeline. Thank you again! So much and I'll let everybody get some rest. Thank you. So much everyone and we'll follow up. There's much more work ahead. The four seasons had something to say about it. They said, oh, what a night they made everyone.
