Let me just take a moment to unmute the 201 826 number, and can you tell us who you are and what application you're here for I'm going to be presenting for 305 west end avenue?
Thank you and matt rosenberger matt rosenberger adolph, yes, doug you're, a committee member right, yeah, doug, mcgowan, doug kleinman is one of our veeps and our chair mark diller, and you got peter sampson because I didn't see his face.
I can share that's fine, okay with the marquee all right, so you should have the power to do that.
Okay, everyone can see my screen yeah all set great okay, great, so I'm presenting on behalf sorry for the little hiccups technology.
It is an assisted living facility and I'm just going to go through the photos that we have to get an idea of what it looks like currently, I'm gonna zoom in here, okay.
It is located on west bend avenue between 74th and 75th, and this is a view from 74th street looking up at the corner of the building, as we continue you can see here.
It has been approved for the fabric running portion of this existing, underneath just to give you a little understanding of it, there used to be a two by two hideous drop ceiling down here, with some fluorescent light, so we are proposing to remove all of that because, as you can see up through here, there are some beautiful architectural details that do exist and our intent is to highlight these some photos to give you an idea, so we're going to carefully remove anything these.
We also do have to remove the frame, unfortunately, for this fabric awning just to replace it in kind, because it is rusting out- and this is our proposal to give an idea of the rendering of you from underneath, as I mentioned before, as you can kind of tell on these images here, there is some beautiful coppering, so we're going to look to highlight that the intent is, as you can see here, is to actually paint these out see a similar colors to the frame.
That's here on the fascia, even though we are actually supposing to just update the fascia, because, as you can tell here, it's not in the best shape necessarily, you can see there's burning on here from the lettering that used to be on here, we're just going to clean it up by installing new metal fascia panels, a new frame and underneath matching the same color as the fascia to the underneath panel, we're proposing to paint the existing architectural detail on the perimeter.
There are three coppers existing and then we were going to drop a metal aluminum dark, bronze aluminum panel in these three sections, which will then have some accent lighting, which will then further draw attention to this detail, and then the remainder of the canopy underneath will be painted out this chalk white semi-gloss just to brighten it up again.
This is just showing the removal of that framing again, and this is just some details in terms of what we're proposing to install, as I mentioned before, we are looking to drop three dark bronze and as aluminum panels in these locations, and it was going to be lighting and solved in each of these corners to highlight the existing coffers.
This is where that rendering came from just to give an idea of what it would look like underneath because from the street space coming from the facade, you wouldn't necessarily notice this change, but obviously underneath we're trying to bring attention to the architectural detail that is present and then re-cladding and cleaning up the fascia that exists here.
So if we go back we're pulling back everything, that's there and just dropping a panel in the center just so we can install lighting because we don't want to disturb the existing structure at all right and the heat lamp is the one in the middle, correct yeah, because that's where the center of the doors are I'm sorry right.
So that's where it would be okay, yeah, and could you review the materials you're using again sure for the canopy?
Okay, I mean it's with the you know again replacing in kind in terms of the structure: that's there, so that does not update the window.
Currently, okay, mark you going to say something yeah, I thank you.
It appears to me to be a creature of its time, which is of the 1970s and 80s when I believe it dates back to, and I'm wondering why you know, even if you were to have a marquee like structure as opposed to a more traditional canopy, why that color and material were chosen because there's an argument that it might be a little out of out of date and out of place on that stretch of west?
I know right here- it's maybe not rendered well, because it does look a lot lighter than it would actually look like.
I know that is effectively replacing and kind what's already there, but but I do think that it's a little bit of an anachronism in itself, so replacing an anachronism doesn't but you're lucky, because I don't vote with the committee, so you wanted something more in keeping with the other buildings on the block.
We've seen fan like treatments that have different kinds of no one wants me to design their building for them, but I, but we've seen other things in this kind of a context that I that I, that I compare this to is what I'm, I guess, what I'm getting at peter, I'm sorry jay and you're, muted jay.
He went up if it had something different or if it's always looked like this, you know the 1940 picture yeah.
Okay, as is we, the resolution is to approve, as is as presented second as presented all right.
I think that's the whole committee, zero non-committee board members mark oldstein, okay and doug climate.
The second part of your presentation, please, yes, okay, so as you now are familiar with the building same location.
I think you need to exit the share screen and then call up the new document because you're pointing things we can't see.
Oh I'm sorry, okay, hello, yes peter!
Okay, at this setback, there was existing equipment which I'm going to show you here.
So from his understanding, he thought he was approved to install these units and he gives his concern for the safety of the residents because they are older and they have certain health conditions in the building.
It is for the units, yes and then with that because of osha there's, the second portion of it, which is why we're talking about the screen is because of osha, because this parapet is too low in this existing location.
Yes, I'm going to get there yeah, so here I'm going to jump ahead a little bit, so you can see it.
So this is a photo from across the street here, there's actually three okay, so, as you can tell here, there is an existing water iron front here that at 75th street all of these locations- those are the units zoom in.
Yes, yeah yep, since we're here, we might as well speak about the screen and I can go back and show you some more.
Well, the entire iron rail I'm having a hard time seeing this I stared at these plans for a while before the meeting too I mean this, is you know my problem, but I can't you expect the residents of the building to come outside and go walk past these air conditioners?
Yes, there's existing equipment here: okay, there's a lot of the majority of equipment.
I was, I had the same little bit of confusion, so it's a brick wall and a brick wall yeah, it's only four feet high, because we can't actually technically build higher than that by dob.
So michelle and kay, if I may, generally speaking our task with respect to legalizations is, would we have approved it if this were presented as if before neither penalizing them for having not done the correct procedure nor giving them a pass because it already exists right.
Yes, I would have said the same thing yet that's I would you know we could put in parentheses, that we still don't like illegal mark is correct, so I think we could vote yeah.
So I guess I don't know if there's anybody on the call who wants to speak to that, but why don't you stop sharing screen, so we can see who's on the call now and I'll see.
Okay, so we resolved to approve the second part, the two parts to the second part of this application right.
Yes and two b2, we approve the installation of a four foot, brick wall with the railing on top yeah michelle.
Are you trying to share your screen, I'm trying to yeah all right.
The glass transom marble bulkhead at the base, brick facade kind of a deco styling, which doesn't read as much in this elevation as it does in the actual the actual views with divided light, casement windows at the second floor for the office spaces that were created the upper three floors.
It's used as a very like open, glassy, porous storefront and at the same time I think mimicked tried to mimic what was going on in the original queen anne style upper floor with another archway, but in a sort of paired down.
So then, we would like to give a better treatment to the existing facade on the second floor without having to reconstruct the whole thing, and the idea here is that we would use a limestone panel treatment with a deeper return at the arched window and then bring back some of the steel casement windows that were part of the original or not original, but the 1920s version with divided lights together, get more depth and texture into the second floor, and part of the intention here is that the limestone cladding will draw from the limestone trim and columns which has been painted over, but we will expose it as well as the adjacent building to the left.
That's the profile of the window, we're proposing in the limestone panels and that's the presentation all right.
Yeah are the are the casement windows that you're showing on the second floor?
Well, the other thing I was, I probably misunderstood, one of your drawings, but it looked like there was a recess at the ground floor for the new entranceways yeah.
That shows this yeah, the more you show us the original, the existing condition, the more we're going to vote for anything else.
Yes, okay, are we ready to vote or we have more questions?
Okay, let's see if we can do this as presented right.
Yes, that's the second part of the first vote right edge.
I think her name is who is a community member and says that she supports this, so I thank alice for for weighing in and- and I am encouraged by that- but I would vote yes as well.
When are you calendared at lpc we're not, but we will probably after this right, okay and whenever you start your construction, when do we start the construction yeah after approval?
So I'm sorry, I didn't see you, but he says he votes yes, so that makes it three zero for non-committee.
Yes, okay, perfect, do you want to share your screen, or should I put up your panels happy to do it either way, whatever's easy?
Okay, so 320 riverside drive we're looking at penthouse a on this building.
No, yes, they were but apparently had almost no detailing, or I think it's safe to say no detailing to them, which is surprising, considering how beautiful the building is below yeah wow.
You think that this next slide, we've already received approval from the lpc to cut new openings into the penthouse and reconfigure the fenestration we're looking at installing hope's steel window units, I'm painted a dark brown color to match the lpc approved color for the building windows, the taped off areas.
So the only thing we're looking at right now is adding a small bay window onto the terrace, which is indicated by this netting.
As well and apologies for all of the other clutter on the terrace they're doing facade maintenance right now, so it's a little bit confusing and why didn't they approve the bay window they are in.
Yes, and there are some details showing what that looks like as we get further along.
So here you see the approved west facade, and here you see the proposed bay window, the side view of it.
Okay, a mystery yeah, there's no egress from the bay window.
I'm I'm okay with this as presented yeah I'll?
Let's see, maybe in the chat, paul and alice g said she's in favor, and we don't know about paulie, but he's not he's not muted no, but he often has trouble all right we'll leave that open.
We're just hearing this right, yeah, I'm just going to say full disclosure.
What's going on and doug, we have paul fisher's, yes, fyi for 350 riverside drive yeah the last application.
Lonnie is calling me right now, each one three, two riverside three: two, oh yeah, okay, michelle and kay- I just I have to call somebody at eight o'clock.
Okay, anyone tell you what doug, rather than take the whole committee's time with this I'll, hang on this for a few minutes with you and anybody else who wants to of course is welcome to.
Thank you, yeah all right and anything else, you guys, or should we call it today?
