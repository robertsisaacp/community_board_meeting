The role of the community board is one of an advisory body that weighs in on a variety of matters ranging from applications to city government to issues of concern with respect to I know a lot of folks are here because they're concerned about the overlapping issues, homelessness and the presence of shelter, clients that are being housed in some of our hotels.
The next is that, while there's a lot of discussion about homelessness, both street homeless and shelter, I wanted to call on captain neil zuber, who is the commanding officer of the 20th precinct, welcome to community board 7.
How have the people who have recently been placed into lucerne, the belclair, the beltnord, been affecting the quality of life and there's a perception that there is an increase in drug use, increase in public lewdness, a lot of issues that were not present this time last year on the upper west side, we've been pushing everybody please.
May I go first sure or are you Thank you so much, I'm glad to hear that what I want to focus on just for a moment as we continue as we will over some months, probably to see what comes out of this is the issue of how you get to the greenway, because, unlike other dedicated cycle lanes, this one to get from central park to get to the screenway in riverside park, one way or another has to get through riverside park, which is, as we know, a very heavily used park by many pedestrians and others.
So I'm going to try to do this really simply if you arrive at riverside drive in riverside park, if you were, if you entered the park there, you have a big circle with eleanor roosevelt statue, then you have a very narrow, shared path that has many pedestrians, with all sorts of baby carriages and et cetera I assume that was just a an error that you're not asking for safety for everybody anyway, so but I think, as people are thinking about this howard, it's important to understand, because the issue is, how do you is a safe way for everybody to get to the greenway but I just want to explain something: the phase 5 of riverside park, which is supposedly opening imminently, but still waiting for some con ed work, we'll have a fabulous feature at 66th street, which is a dedicated bike ramp from riverside boulevard that will go down to the greenway.
That's the other half of the perfect solution, but when the rotunda is under renovation, which we're told will start sometime soon and last for several years, that will be unavailable, and I'm saying this now because I think when people think about a bike lane that terminates at riverside park, they have to have at least some understanding about what happens next, to get those cyclists safely down to the greenway.
The bus pulls over directly to the curb and the bicyclists are in danger on central park west, because the bus is pulling into the curb- But the resolution says that community board 7 is seeking a proposal for quote a physically protected two-way bike lane or lanes on west 72nd.
Okay, just first information at the committee, we extensively discussed this and then we thought several times we're important in the proposal and one was a bike lane We are in a very difficult financial situation and we should be very careful about what we're asking for what we need and what we want.
Hello, hold on hold on one second I don't think cost should be as much of a concern as just making sure that these agenda items are like actually capitalized upon in our on people's minds.
Also, I kind of wonder if this resolution is meant to you know point to the homeless men smoking in the medium that everyone like hate, that that's happening right now, and it makes me a little suspicious of the timing of this resolution and you know I think we don't need more enforcement by the police on the marijuana piece and just in general, I won't be voting for those.
As you know, I called shay and let him know that I think that and lastly, we'll be sending out an email tomorrow about how parents who want to donate their pandemic ebt cards, how they can do that if they want to donate to families in need again sign up for my emails, you can go to helenrosenthal.com I've been following your community board from the beginning and obviously you have a lot going on, but I wanted to say that I stood with brad holman yesterday and activists about the u.s postal service in respect to the lock boxes that we're trying to get all over the state.
Thank you so much assembly member rosenthal, it's great to see all of you here with us at community board seven and given the length of our meeting tonight, I'm very grateful for everybody honoring the the quick turnaround of these comments, and I will call out later the names of the staffs of elected officials, but So I'd like to first open the floor for nominations for chair.
We've been doing that for over a year, but we're collecting more stewards to continue that work and people can reach us through our email at info columbus, amsterdam bid last couple of things is that there is compost collection happening at the 107th street community garden, that's at 107th and columbus avenue, I think we should all share the burden, but my concern is wearing a mask and that's going to end social distancing and that's going to be particularly important when parents and kids are going back and forth to school when that happens, and I'm down the street from lucerne.
and then, finally, just I think it's really important that we all our community we're all part of the same city and we all have an obligation to help people who are down on their luck and going through a tough time, and that includes sheltering them in hotels during a unprecedented pandemic and economic crisis, and thank you for your time.
Unfortunately, situation residents in the entire city, which are which is the massive homeless population in new york, I want to say that I support the use of these hotels as shelters, visible.
We should be trying to face the underlying challenges that they're facing creating more permanent, affordable housing and supportive housing on the upper west side would benefit everyone by providing stability and access to opportunities for low-income residents, reducing segregation and racial inequality and raising wealth, health and education outcomes for all people are homeless, because there aren't enough homes I'd like to just say a second to thank all the volunteers.
I'm also a volunteer, I'm working with the group of thirteen 000 residents of the upper west side, who've banded, together as neighbors to talk about and discuss the issue of how hotels, good hotels in our community that have been supporting local businesses and helping our neighborhood really be.
One sex offenders are not required to register, so I just want to make sure that when you have people speaking on behalf of organizations that are making a lot of money, housing, the homeless and providing services to the homeless, that those people are giving accurate information to the neighbors who and I've been living in the neighborhood for 40 years, I'm a lifelong resident of new york city.
I think that there should be because it's definitely better in terms of public health and in terms of our social obligations social distance, especially since the pandemic gets concerning with what's going on, it seems like it's just adding you know more danger to our neighborhood and for those I'm sorry Let me be abundantly clear, miss diamond, because I really think that you're hitting something important That's why we're extending this meeting beyond its original purpose One point is that this is absolutely not a racial issue and that we have a very diverse community over 13 000 people are on a facebook page that represent a large proportion of people of color, and many have reached out to us who are particularly offended by the notion that this has anything to do with race.
Miss taylor, I'm going to break my own rule and about not commenting on speakers and we'll have a little bit of an opportunity to do that at the end, but I will tell you that community board 7 Can I just wanted to add my voice to the folks who spoke out in support of the shelter residents staying at the lucerne.
As megan pointed out, these men were moved from another shelter in hell's kitchen, where the same problems existed and that community board acted and they moved them right out of their neighborhood.
So I urge the community board to do the right thing, and I urge the other speakers on this call to think a little bit before you point that racism finger.
I think the first is an important point that people want to keep glossing over, but there were multiple hotels in hell's kitchen, where these men were housed.
I think the second thing I want to note is when you have 13 000 people in a facebook group.
So for people to say it's not happening, just isn't true and we all see what's going on, and people may say: hey we're, okay with that, but a lot of people aren't, I think the third you know point I wanted to make The first thing I would say this is a safety and security issue, but at the same time, if the first thing you think of when you hear homelessness is race or you hear crime in its race, I'd actually say to you might need to check your implicit bias because for a vast majority of upper west siders, including lots of people, we know who are people of color.
You know was presented to our community with without any notice, and that's just a fact, and I appreciate everything that she's been doing to provide those answers, and it's so important that people continue to speak up in forms like this so mark.
I'm actually going to take one more second of your time to thank my colleagues because we were here to listen and that's exactly what we did Certainly there haven't been a lot of community board meetings at which words like defecation and masturbation are used, and I am just so grateful that everybody hung in there with us.
