Are we talking street space or park space, but you had said that if they wanted to do that, whatever that street program is that it would be helpful to get the sort of the okay in advance from the neighbors like to close off the street, I was I was liking, it yeah program may be too sophisticated a word.
I mean this whole thing is just you know, I'm sure you can appreciate how many meetings we're having to talk about potentially reopening what the reopening plan is, etc.
Thank you, pleasure, hey everyone hi, so it looks as if we have all of our members plus doug clyman shelly had said he was going to join us tonight.
I think all our other committee members are on which is great who's going to do the minutes.
I most likely on the bike lanes because they seem to be the the ones that are in the most stressed situation, but just know that that's out there and that if people are interested, they can contact us through our email info at columbus, amsterdam bid and we'll be trying to do that this saturday.
The only other thing that I'll mention is that our annual meeting is coming up on thursday, the 30th in the evening at five o'clock, and if people would like to join that, send us an email and we'll make sure we get the invitation and information to you.
I'm not sure if he's with us yet eric and julian should be turned made, made participants right, mark sure- and I just wanted to know, while we're on that theme, that erica overton from linda rosenthal's office is also with us.
That shows- and maybe you could put this on right now for a moment mark what the current law is concerning smoking and non-smoking the smoking prohibition in our parks and what the new york city parks and what the exceptions are I'll, be very impressed mark if you're able to do this so that I just took from the statute the definitions which define smoking is doing just about anything, and it does now include e-cigarettes too, but it but with tobacco and then there's this prohibition in our parks, which is what we talk about here in this committee.
But it accepts from the prohibition sidewalks immediately adjoining parks, squares and public spaces places you'll see that at the bottom, basically pedestrian areas on our broad on strips, such as the broadway malls, but it's probably also ocean parkway and things like that and parking lots in parks and then theatrical productions which I think is probably not something we much care about.
One of the things that our community member mentioned to me is that with the corona virus situation, now, where you need to distance and wear masks, smokers are sitting on benches on the peripheries of the perimeters of parks, they're, obviously not wearing masks.
Increasing public use of our parks in general now concern- and this is in the resolution as well, that the rip that the statute is written doesn't address marijuana.
Yeah look forward to hearing from her that'd be great, okay, so mark, if you can put on the draft resolution, but also what we want to do is to find janice in our attendees and janice.
If, while we're waiting for her, if gail wants to join, I don't know if gayle should maybe yeah.
Okay, although gail we hope you'll be with us for as many comments as you can, but we'd love to hear from you, I'm fine, but I think mark she indicated that she couldn't hear you so janice.
You might call it early evening to all committee members, but not to others so like to be able to show the draft resolution, but also committee members may find it more convenient to look at the email that version that they had for the last hour or so, and I guess we should first plan and call on committee members who want to speak and I'm looking at participants, that's in the wrong place on my screen panel.
I guess panelists is what we're called yeah and- and I think again I don't know if gail, if you're you'd like to say a word or two now or if we want to move it to other panelists for their comments.
So the ones that are listed in your resolution are definitely the ones that were exceptions that I couldn't get rid of the sidewalks near parks and public spaces, and this one was a big issue of pedestrians, yeah through any median or mall, which of course, you mentioned in terms of the benches on broadway, perfect, and then we're not going to talk about the parking lot.
So I think one of the things you might want to hear and have some discussion about is who's going to do the enforcement.
If anybody yeah doesn't matter, then that's a different issue, but that's where I got stuck thanks very much that background is, is extremely helpful and- and you did very well for us and for our parks users at the time to get it past.
If they know it's, if there's no smoking they're not going to do it, they're always going to be some violators, as we know from other types of illegal activities we've talked about recently, but for the most part, if the law is clear, presumably people will will comply, including smokers when they call 3-1-1, who is supposed to answer.
I think it was you know times have changed, there's more and more concern about second-hand smoking.
You know it's one thing to smoke on fifth avenue or riverside drive on the opposite sidewalk, but it's another to be on a park bench in what's clearly a park on a parked sidewalk and our and our medians, and for that matter our parking lots, which are the three exceptions there and then there's the marijuana issue.
I missed what gail what you said, gail brewer, so I hope I'm not redundant, and I know you were talking about enforcement and I can come back to that because I have personal experience with the ncos who were anxious to enforce and then the some of the park people also were very helpful.
Anybody who wants to hang out on their park has to deal with people who aren't wearing masks because they're smoking so kind of.
As a result, these edges this park land that you really go to presuming and hoping that it's a less risky area for covid, it's less congested, ends up actually being a greater risk, because again, smokers are sitting for a long time for hours without their masks on and essentially the result is the rest of us who want to sit.
Okay, thanks janice and we will be calling on give a chance to speak to anybody in the community who is signed on as an attendee, so the people you mentioned or anybody else in the community will have a chance to speak just one other thing I forgot to say, as I was doing an intro here, and that is, I did speak this week with the the ceo and president of the riverside park, conservancy dan gorodnik, what I was just repeating his name.
Issues in our conversation supports eliminating the the exception of for smoking on the perimeters of of of riverside park, so that the entirety of the parkland we don't know judgment's parking lots would be would not be exempt the whole.
Let's look, I suppose, as we normally do to people from the committee who want to speak.
Actually, if there are people from I, I maybe a question or two from the committee, but I think because we have many people from the okay, the other way around fine.
Okay, so maybe we go to the committee then, or the community then and then come back fine, let's look at the community and see how how the same thing happened to me at the last meeting, elizabeth and and mark.
So we wanted to make sure you had a chance to ask a question if you have one or make a comment right, including the people janice mentioned, but you know elizabeth and mark I'm not saying that on my list, but I think that's because of how I'm doing something wrong.
Should we call let's call on ellen kessler and hope, then that other members of the public will raise their hands doug we've sort of decided to wait with committee members until we've heard the public.
The little raised hand icon is on the top on the top right when I'm holding it in landscape, so hi everyone, I'm ellen kessler, I'm on the board of the west 80's neighborhood association we've been around and we worked with gail when and with wefts, when we were trying to landmark the neighborhood, and we totally support this.
You know accommodating to this, and I also spoke to the park ranger, who said she would enforce it, but she thought that it was legal to smoke on the perimeters.
So my feeling is, you know you can almost say that about everything you know who's going to enforce it, that you know you need the law there and then you can maybe work through the mechanics of being sure it's enforced, and my sense is that it's enforced in riverside park for sure thanks, janice yeah, I mean, as I was saying a little while ago after gail spoke, although there are always going to be some people, whether it's this law or another one who are going to violate it in general.
That people for the most part know that smoking is not allowed throughout the park where in those except at the perimeters and and they obey that, and if the law then is extended to no longer exclude the perimeters and and as we've drafted here, the parking lots and the malls as well you're going to get a one, would predict a pretty high degree of compliance, voluntary compliance with always some outliers and then that's an issue on any any statute.
My problem is that I'm still seeing so many people in the park, smoking and and that that interferes that that really interferes with my rights that interferes with my health.
I just want to let you know those, that's the kind of comment I got when I passed my bill.
I think it's very important that we take it right to the edge of the park and not have these exceptions, but I do question why we're lumping in marijuana?
Okay, thank you, I'm all for extending the ban of gayle's original law to the perimeter, particularly because of the dangers of secondary smoke, and I'd like to add that maybe we should have some type of since we can't guarantee enforcement at least some type of penalty.
You know you can't have a zillion signs all at once, because we've got a lot of parks and a lot of perimeters, but I I think it's a friendly amendment to ask for signage, inform informing the public that it smoking is, is prohibited anywhere within the parks.
I'd like to join the course thanking manhattan borough president and also second ken's comment about supporting this for tobacco smoke and use in those adjacent areas, but I'm concerned about the addition of marijuana.
The use of marijuana may or may not be a good thing in many individuals in new york are unable to smoke as it as it is in their buildings, whether it be in their co-ops or their rent, their their rented homes and look to smoke, whether it be tobacco or whatever else outside.
Okay, I I'm gonna want to say something more about that, but let's hear from other people first we had shelley.
I think it's very important and and also doug people who are smoking.
So I don't know if that impacts people's decisions on this resolution per se, but I do think it's something we need to figure out tonight.
Do we need to unmute janice again yeah, I'm so primarily focused on tobacco, but I do want to just interject this tobacco is also legal and the question in my opinion, about whether marijuana is harmful to your health and forgive me, but it's really, there aren't studies.
I just wanted to raise this that there is a council member, and I want to confuse matters in queens named peter coo k-o-o, who has some has proposed some legislation to ban smoking everywhere outside it's very extreme, but I just thought kind of people should know about that that that's been out there.
Janice, that's a good point, and you know one thing I just included as a sort of a preamble to the resolution is that new york is really rethinking a lot.
I mean partly spurred by the coronavirus, but partly this was going on before how our public space is used, and it's it's it's side, it's sidewalks and street beds and parking lanes and parking, lots and plazas and all of those areas of public space- and you know we're not tonight going to be addressing the much broader issue of smoking in all of our public space.
Marijuana in our parks and marijuana smoke is as offensive to many certainly to me, but I know to many other people.
Panelists or attendees, who want to say anything and here's what I elizabeth here's, what I'm going to suggest it looks like doug, has a comment and anyone else.
The addition of marijuana and to focus on tobacco is is, is that the case or that is that is not, in my view, a friendly amendment, but I'm gonna when we finish the discussion, I think matt may have had his hand up I'm going to suggest a way that we can vote that separates that out.
Does anybody have a better handle on that and that may be right, in which case we don't need to talk about marijuana, but gail do you know I think she's music just called smoke free, that's the name of the act yeah, but the definition that I picked out today, but I'm not sure it's up to date and refers to tobacco use, but I'm not sure that's up to date.
Maybe she's got an answer: yeah I'm on the new york city, gov parks.org and it says: do you want to know about electronic cigarettes yeah that that is as of april 29 2014?
Okay, I'm going to suggest that we first vote on the resolution minus that sixth, whereas equivalent and minus the second paragraph that talks about extending prohibitions to marijuana with the changing landscape of cannabis.
Both bold, I think, okay, so if this is all right with elizabeth and with mark, what we would be doing is voting on the resolution committee members and then non-committee board members.
Last week, yeah, okay, cool last chance for attendees or participate or panelists, I think doug, simon.
But as a practical matter, I do not want to see people smoking at the perimeter of parks, because it's the smoke issue, it's not, and it is offensive to some- and I just you know, I'm I'm very concerned about that.
So, if I could just add, I think whoever made the comment that this was about the smoke itself is what we're really voting on tonight and where that comes from whether it's a tobacco cigarette or marijuana, is really what we want to keep out of parks for the quality of life of the majority of residents.
So the way we're going to do this one is please so for first for parks and environment committee members, please voting.
I am a non-committee member of parks, okay and you're.
So if I mean if, if passed, I mean our resolution would still be asking for the same thing, but I put in the first of those two yellow paragraphs because it kind of gave the background, but I don't I just I'm just wondering if there's a way to say that sort of all of the legally or sort of illegal forms of smoke in our city right now, which include marijuana, we can include that smoke.
We're not here to judge on marijuana use, we're here to judge on the fact that people don't like smoke in the parks and whether it's coming from marijuana or a vape or a cigarette, and you know, is to me irrelevant it's all things that are things that obstruct the quality of life in our neighborhood.
All other forms, I think, are already included with this tobacco and the vaping I mean marijuana is the outlier at this point, I'm not sure, there's anything else.
I, like, though, elizabeth your idea of having something that talks about wanting all smoke all smoking in the parks for the for the you know, quality of life, of a park of our park users all smoking.
I'm not just not sure how we were, how we're going to say that, and maybe the committee would trust us to just come up with some something simple that would say that or we could try to do it right now, but but I'm admittable to taking that out and if we do, I would prefer to to adopt some something such as elizabeth has suggested about.
All types of smoking should not be in the park should not be done in the parks right, I think that's.
So, let's mark, if you don't mind putting it back on the resolution, so everybody knows what we're voting on and we you've got some hands raised, though what oh yeah we got to do the hands okay.
So what we're going to vote on is the resolution minus the first paragraph that talks about marijuana but with the second one and we'll add a little language about wanting all forms of smoking to be prohibited in our parks?
I don't know, are people raising their hands to vote or are they are they wanting to?
Let's see lower okay, so now non-committee board members in favor of the marijuana provisions and amendments that you just heard in favor.
It is september 1st yeah, and I think I mean I think janice in particular has made a very good case for why the crowding of our sidewalks during covid times, which are certainly going to unfortunately likely continue through the fall, are a good reason to add the perimeters, and perhaps the you know the parking lots and the the malls as well, because they're in there is it.
Okay, so I would then just say one more thing on this topic and I think we've done a a good and efficient job on it tonight, and that is fortunately, we have julian de la porta who's representing council member rosenthal with us.
They know that we strongly supported and in fact, unanimously the basic resolution with the majority, also on the marijuana add-on, and so I'm hoping personally, because I don't speak for community board seven, but I'm hoping personally that they will take it back to their bosses and see whether, in light of all of these considerations, including the importance of making the most breathable space around our everywhere in our parks during the coveted time that they'll initiate something without waiting for our full board in september, because this is not something we can put into effect.
Okay, elizabeth, do you have anything else to turn to, or I think we're good mark thanks with matt with still with us.
You know I think lisa as long as it's remained a parks and environment for a minute or two.
If you want to talk about your work with streetopia, I think that's great unless yeah yeah okay, so I just wanted to make sure that your committee saw our central park advocates report and street films for those who haven't.
As you read the report, I know clara, you said that you received it from us and I read it: okay, great so at some point, we'd love to hear feedback from you and perhaps get on your agenda to discuss it further sure, thanks lisa, we I think that a lot of us are active in supporting the park in various ways and various modes of transportation.
I know that I would be interested in doing something as long as it's you know well organized, and you know the the timing works for for people, so my this is just kind of an advice to the representatives from the parks who are on the meeting today that maybe we could come up with some sort of a public outreach plan because the parks are just being used like never before, and that has consequences and vs community members can step up to help natasha.
Maybe you know if there's anything in the works on the riverside side and certainly on the the central park side.
We would love it, but before we hear before we put matt mahatsi doug mcgowan, were you wanting to address the same issue and then we'll turn to matt, not the same as you know, okay, then, let's turn to matt to see if he has any wisdom on this for us matt so yeah.
You know, volunteer efforts in our parks and I think that they would be.
So if groups want to come out- and you know volunteer some time to to do some basic cleanup- you know- I think that's that would be something we're pursuing matt, we'll contact both riverside conservancy and central park about this.
With regard to tonight's, it's a proposed resolution sure no, it's not going to go anywhere on cb7 letterhead until we have the full board meeting in september, and I certainly hope it will be adopted because I voted for it.
But, as I said, the most important people to listen to our discussion tonight rather than us hearing each other, were the council members reps, so they know about these issues.
I've been communicating with with my our borough office right, and I think we had one other question that came in about actually two one was about the opening date for riverside park, south the phase five and then about construction.
Let's see on pools which paul fisher was asking if a pool isn't opening, but maybe the riverside park south question first, I know something about that.
We don't know that for sure they may be able to start the rotunda sooner, but all these things sort of are, you know, part of the same octopus and we'll we'll find out more when we find out more anything else sounds like that's a wrap, I think we're great, very great everyone and and gail, if she's still with us all of you and yeah.
So it looks as if all right, I think, that's a very good issue.
If we need to talk about anything, if anybody wants to talk about anything yeah, I think maybe the only last thing to mention is that we will be meeting jointly with the transportation committee at their september meeting on the issue of revel as it pertains to safety in general, but the parks in particular.
We said hey we want in because it's very much a parks issue as well, so yeah, that's september, 8th and then our our committee meeting is the 21st have a great summer.
