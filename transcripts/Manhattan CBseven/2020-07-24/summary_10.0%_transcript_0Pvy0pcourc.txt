It is a minority deposit institution and mdi and a certified community development, financial institution of cdfi and we're going to hear from sherry lane, executive, director of capital, access and center operations for new york city, small business services, spds and ms lane oversees the city's network of business solutions, centers and industry business service providers which provide free services to entrepreneurs and business owners in all boroughs.
She also oversees sbs's capital access program, which includes managing multiple funds that aim to reduce the financing barriers for underserved business owners and rounding out.
She also advises the comptroller on policy recommendations that change how new york city does business with women and people of color through reports such as making the grade.
With that said, I'm hoping to cover a powerpoint presentation that we've created for companies, whether they're, a startup or an existing entity as to what you need to do to obtain financing and how to package your the loan request, I'm trying to take a 20-minute presentation and shrink it into and zoom it into a five-minute presentation for you all with that said, just real very quickly.
So those are the basic types besides a personal loan, besides a fixed asset loan and letters of credit, so that in itself is the realm of what banks offer in a nutshell, as it relates to loans and of course, I forgot to mention the real estate loans that could be covered by sba programs.
Your request, I think it's key that you be prepared and that you understand what exactly you're going gonna use the funds for whatever you do not tell a banker.
That's not a bank, so you have to do your homework in terms of the type of lender and the type of loan that you're also looking for alternative financing mechanisms are all over the city of new york, and I believe my other colleagues will cover that.
As we go along we're going to be creating, you got to start with your finances and robert we'll get into that, but you basically need to understand the use of funds to sources and uses.
We're going to need to understand, based on your projections where it is, you want to go with this financing, okay and you have to start with the balance sheet the income statement and adjust all of that accordingly, to what it is that you're requesting do you have any existing debt and if you do then highlight what that is and identify what it was used for.
Let me give you an example: if you go to a bank and you're, not in the dmv system, well, the bank's gonna request a report and they're gonna come back and investigate you and inquire that so from a company perspective and a business perspective, I rather provide them with the information I want the mb to have so that everybody else has the same thing and also it will now slow down your package because you're already in the system.
The other thing that you need to be aware, of course, is the actual three entities that are going to provide credit information on the personal and or owner of that entity.
I also know that, for the last three or four months I've initiated on the bonsai bank, the ppp program, which is for payroll, and if you any of you, are interested in that we are open at this point in time and accepting applications, but that is only to complete payroll, not for working capital.
I believe that sba also had an aidl loan that you can qualify for under the disaster mechanism that the government designated us for and that you can use for working capital, and then you have the regular 7a programs that can be used for anything and everything I am going to basically leave it there in terms of the lending capacity.
That, in essence, will constitute your business plan and or your proposal to a banker all of that information they're going to want to know regardless, if you're going for a fifteen twenty thousand dollar loan, it's small in scale versus millions of dollars.
If you're gonna have a larger loan, I'm going to leave it at that and tell you that, basically, with that flash drive and that binder you can be prepared at any point in time to provide your package to a banker that may be interested, learn what we call your elevator pitch, learn to talk about your company in one to two minutes and highlight that keep it current updated when needed and copy when needed, and I will end with that at this point in time, and I think I was under my six minutes.
I know we're going to hear from robert in a moment, but every if you have questions, please put them in the chat area and we will be reading them and if you want to come on camera to discuss them, that's fine!
So, at the end of the presentations we will, we will read your question to your questions, to you know for the individual, panelists and so I'd like to introduce mr robert, and he will tell you legal standpoint of this and thank you so much madeline.
My name is robert rotten, I'm a partner with davidoff hutcher and citron firm in the city, who is very active in the city itself and those things that move around it, I'm educated in the south, okay, but I moved to new york more than 40 years ago and I'm an experienced bankruptcy lawyer who especially, is right.
Restructuring small to mid-cap businesses and linda, asked me to talk to you about how you avoid me and that's, okay by me, I'm happy to figure out a way to avoid having that having to address the problems right.
Most of the small businesses that I have seen over the years are under capitalized have limited funding all right, and you have to understand that the success rate for most businesses is on them less than 50 percent.
Okay, but the main reason that you can succeed in the business is using learning to use management tools, and it starts with having the necessary accounting information at your fingertips and making sure that your accountant understands how to produce these invite these items for you, one of them, is the monthly statement believe it or not.
Okay, issuing to yourself, let alone to the bank, a regular quarterly financial statement, so that you know exactly what you're doing right and then, when it comes to dealing with bankers.
Actually, you do it so that you get an understanding of how your cash works during the course of a business right here, if you're in a cash business like a grocery store, you know your cash in cash out and your cash flow is exactly will match up neatly.
How are you going to repay me properly constructed projections will tell them that you're going to use the property, the money that you're borrowing right to make a successful business which will produce an income and the cash flow will tell you how what income you will have available at the moments that necessary to be able to service the obligations of the from the bank or the lending institution and putting those two ideas together.
I can't tell you how many times I've seen a successful small businessman all right decide that he was going to be the big butter and eggman next and go out and buy himself a fancy new car or incur fancy new offices without reflecting upon what he is going to do in terms of cash flow with the necessary requirements.
Your business in a logical manner and they want to make sure, through the use of cash flows, that you have the ability to repay the loan in an orderly manner.
So to be a successful banker, you have to understand your client base in terms of how to make sure that they succeed in their businesses, and that has to be tied in with your cash flow, all right, so loan payment for the source of funds.
Thank you, robert richette, and thank you very much and now we're going to hear from sherry lane, executive, director of capital, access and center operations for new york city, small business services, sbs, who will explain some of the available opportunities and how to get different types of access to these great well.
So if folks have follow-up, questions feel free to reach out so the few areas I wanted to focus on one general reopening assistance, particularly for businesses that were forced to shut down temporarily two business education and that's both for folks that are interested in starting up a new venture or have an existing venture and want to kind of get a refresh on some of the nuts and bolts of running a business and then three financing assistance.
It's a lot to digest so we're trying to synthesize that as much as possible, so in terms of access check out our website and then also we have a hotline, it's 888 sbs for nyc, so I will I'll post these things in the chat once I'm finished speaking as well, so that's reopening for business education again, I want to want to point to the website for anything that I didn't cover.
So I'll put that in the chat as well- and I wanted to start with talking a little bit about the business education piece, because I know we're talking mostly about financing here, but I want to just emphasize that hand in hand with any either application for a loan or taking on a loan, particularly now, in these uncertain times it's critical to have that harness on your budget on your operations.
We have business solution, centers that are staffed with finance account managers that offer free one-on-one assistance to go through a lot of the binder that madeline was talking about, and the purpose of this is that's a lot of work, sometimes when you're starting to apply for a loan, especially for the first time.
That's compelling, so we provide that service for free both in terms of helping you put that package together, but also to try and navigate the space of a broad variety of lenders in the city so again to madeline's point.
If you don't know the comptroller controller, scott stringer is the chief financial officer for the city of new york, he's the chief auditor chief accountant and the fiduciary to the city's pension funds, and our team's focus is to ensure that the city uses its financial power from contracts to investments really to level the playing field for women and people of color.
I'm sure robert is very busy these days, and so we wanted to take a look at mwbe, specifically in new york, and this will give you some context on why it's important to reach out to people like sherry and madeline, for support on financing and for city contracts.
We saw that 65 percent of respondents that shared information about their services said that they were ready and able to do business with the city.
We also know that it's because of this huge dip in revenue, we saw that eighty percent of mwbes lost revenue a median of about thirty, eight thousand dollars between those months of march and may, while we were in really the thick of the pandemic here in new york city, and so we asked what are the, what were the toughest things to pay for, given that you have lost all this revenue?
So what did mwbe's ask for what do they want from the city of new york in order to have long-term sustainability right over and over?
I always wanted to open my own business, never thought about a bank, I'm just giving you a scenario of what type of people are out there that are needing help, but I went to my father and I presented him, I'm the only and first person in my family that has been self-employed and I'm pretty proud of that.
Finally, I went to work at new school university for 10 years, but there are people out there like me, never think about banks, and that this is what my concern is because if there were people like me, as far as their self-sufficient and funding their own business, but this webinar here is so informative.
