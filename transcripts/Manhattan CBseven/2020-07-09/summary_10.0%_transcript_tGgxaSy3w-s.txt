That's got to be a pretty serious executive because yeah all right, I'm gonna, start broadcasting, because that'll let the attendees in the room, okay, I, think 60 West, 76th Street is first okay.
It's actually at 86th Street and Central Park West, that's 262, Center, Park, West I, remember very well because it was in the first Fame movie and the apartment we saw was right above the main entrance, and it was one of those ones where originally it had multiple light and the building basically is all one over one.
Sorry, too many times recently, it's okay I'm, the problem, Thank You Josh won't be here.
These are commercial storefronts, and this is 76th Street we're going to be presenting to you is the entry, the residential entrance to the residential portion of the building, which is on 76th Street, and this photo is from Google, because the building actually is scaffolding on it now, so we thought this would be useful to at least show generally what it looks like without scaffolding, because that gave us a little bit of a challenge.
The presentation before I get into you know, John I think that what I'd like to do is skip ahead to the to the to the pictures, and then you can come back to the design, know the after the drawings all right.
Who knows what they looked like originally, even if they, if they exist, sit in 1894, but this is this is the condition now John?
Fences are often altered and this one is two and John I think this would be a good time to go back into the proposal, yeah so again back to the front entrance with this sort of one.
Tell them if you look very closely they're blocked off of little bars horizontally, so I assume, so no one just goes and sits in there to block people, but if you were coming from fire escape and be kind of a trip as it to get out so I think it's just there to stop people from using it and that's kind of ignoring the safety of the fire escape, but otherwise, if these weren't here I would assume these lighters would drop you into the area which it's not a good idea.
One of our requests is to change that and then, of course, since we're building the step out, we have to fill this in covering the existing stone here with new material, and our goal is to use a stone that matches.
If he's over here, there's the area way stills to protect people from falling we're going to cut the curb here, we're basically gonna in a sense cut the curb and a portion of the existing railing out and use it to fill in this part, and so this really is pretty much thing, as is other than the cut and we're making the make this landing.
You know one pier on the right gets twice as why it is yeah since they're not original to begin with.
Sometimes the other way to go in preservation is to make the changes you have to, but not make the changes you don't have to so it's kind of like one way or the other yeah on this well I mean I, understand as a matter of general practice and not altering historical material structure, etc.
All could I jump in on this sure, thanks I'm with Jay and would actually go, maybe even a step farther, which is to say that not only do I think that the piers should be symmetrical, but that the replacement of the fire escape landing ought to be balanced out.
What is now that cockamamie iron thing so that the fire escape lands on something more solid than a catwalk and had that come to the street as well - the trip hazard, as you said, and truthfully I'm almost indifferent about the piers entirely, because there's no way that material that's on there now is original or appropriate to that building it ought to be.
You're looking at well mark just so I understand you're suggesting getting rid of that platform, which I agree with by the way, and so you would be extending the fence to the pier, basically, no, what I would be suggesting because they do still need to have the landing for the fire escape above, so what I would do is extend.
Why not just fill it in or make it concrete and extend the fence, which would be almost symmetrical with the ramp I think they are okay, so you already have a landing.
You take away the fence on the east side of that ramp and have it go to the same landing that the front door goes to right, correct, yeah, just pick it up, lift it out and put it against the wall against the remaining railing, and you probably look better yup, a simple change.
Good I mean I, think we're open to coding with brownstone as an option for these peers and I mean I, obviously, would want to discuss this with the landmarks that I noticed that in the series of pictures you showed earlier, there was one from 2017 that seemed to indicate that they were brownstone.
Match yes, I agree with all of that, but I think if you have someone who has a disability in the building who needs a wheelchair, couldn't you do this as it is right now and on going do the rest of the work like cutting down those stanchions and painting them?
It's up to us to fashion a resolution conditional on what we decide are the changes that we all seem to agree on and if there's you know two alternatives that we consider acceptable, just condition our approval either one either one construct or the alternate sounds right to me so mark you want to help us with the resolution with the conditions.
Okay, thanks guys I'm just curious about the Expediency of this, because we don't another full board meeting until you know September.
So this will be one of those instances in which we go down to LPC with a committee resolution and whoever it is that presents at LPC will make that clear and it'll come up for a vote in September just to ratify what we do as a committee just for our good practices, because either LPC will agree with this, so they won't, but either way we should be internally consistent with our own procedures.
You all have seen prior applications for windows on this building and I understand that on past applications, you've asked why there isn't a master plan here.
It's I think you'll see it's a very well designed master plan proposal for one over one: double hung: windows replicating historic brick, molds, reinstating the architecture of the larger openings and providing for a uniform approach going forward in the future.
So replacing all of these, this mix of modern windows will allow a return to a more uniform fenestration pattern in a more timely manner and as you'll see, the original windows on the building were six over six.
People won't hang on to their one over one windows in favor of more dividing lights, so we think that will lead to a quicker adoption of the master plan than doing a six over six other.
What the master plan says right, but every one of these windows is going to be replaced, or there is some that have already been replaced by the prior from your prior applications that won't be replaced this time around or in the P.
There are no historic windows on the on the building now, but do note that even within the one over one and the single pane there's a big variety in these windows because they were done at various points over time.
One of the things we looked at was were one over one windows used historically on this type of neo-renaissance building in this period and shown on the slide.
Here are four examples from within the district showing various buildings of similar design, all of which were originally built with one over one windows, including the one at the far right, 263 West, End Avenue, which was designed by the same firm, Sugarman and Berger.
So we think that, in terms of this period, building and the architecture of this building, a one over one window is appropriate historically and next slide.
Please and then looking at this in the context of similar master plans, I think all of which came before you in the past, the similarly one over one windows were approved for master plans in lieu of the historic configuration of multi light windows, and that was the case across the street from us at 271, Central Park West at 87th Street, which originally had nine over one windows and the Commission approved a master plan for one over one windows and further up the further up.
A venue, 327 Central Park West at 93rd Street, which originally had six over six windows landmarks, approved a master plan with one over one windows.
This is a slide showing obviously the it was so the master plan on the left is a existing elevation with their colors, indicating the different types of windows that are present on the building, the light blue, showing an existing double-hung one over one sash, a couple of different colors red and light purple, but her pink that show two different types of tilt and turn windows insurance.
That's compared with a standard typical double hung window present on the building right now.
I think the thing that I want to point out to you most closely is one that's obvious as a result of this master plan, if we're going to the effort to recreate a moulding set, but the perimeter moldings and the moldings of the mullions that separate windows in a gang window, the current time they're very simple, rectangular, aluminum panning, sometimes going over estimate irreal, sometimes know the effect is very plain and as a result of there being 70 different types of windows on the building, it's clean but confusing.
Of course, even in a couple of different manufacturers match each other, we were able to take a bit of the existing aluminum panning off of one of the those on the street facade and found the prick mold of the original window, underneath frame still remained, although fashioned still and the volume were all removed.
So it's not a not a scenario where we could restore the existing window, but we were able to take very careful measurements of the moldings as it happened a similar application a couple of years ago on one of the rear facades of the building.
This is I want to say Anderson, but for some left correct excuse me, we have a luminal, clad wood window by a different manufacturer which I'm taking pains to point out, has the same molding set and the same details as the all aluminum window, which we can believe matches the historic configuration of moldings and overalls pretty closely.
The existing double hung window you'll see that the what little the original frame that is there is hand over with that rectangular aluminum, padding that we mentioned and the amoliant has that same condition where, whatever there is covered over by that rectangular panning, the mo Lian's are fairly wide in that first leading edge, and that makes for a very broad plain, looking mo lien and a very plain-looking rips around our first mold at the window surround we have both of the window that the intended closed windows at the bottom left and right and in both cases we're able to get a yes exactly a custom molded panning to go over the existing system, whatever it is, and that matched is.
That shows some tilting term windows, but if I may, if that's okay, with Michelle Thanks, so I'm looking at the meeting rails on the three windows here, and none of them seem to match to me, but it could just be my unpracticed I.
So what you're seeing is, of course an architectural you know fill that's meant to show that those are the wood windows need to change the appearance of it and, as you see the whole slide, okay, any other questions, any member of the committee, the only just as a matter of policy as far as a basic determination as to whether replacement windows have to reflect the original historical configuration.
So in my building, as you guys all know, she's way three, there were one of her one windows installed forever and then the LPC got wind of it and opposed it and required them to put back in the six over six.
But I will remind the committee that we had an application on this building for a set of windows more or less directly above the main entrance on Central Park West, and it was controversial at the time and it was controversial at public hearing, because the standard that we were led to want to use and sort of adopted was whether the wind, whether the decoration of the building taken as a whole, was such that the that the loss of the multi light fabric on the on the facade would or would not affect the overall impression of the building and 370's Riverside Drive, which our former colleague Misha presented to us and 150 West 79th Street, which I see when I walk out my front door are examples of highly decorated buildings, with lots of wedding cake features and frou-frou and so forth.
A lot of that had been modified to six over one, and yet there are no original windows in the building.
So we really think that this plan- and it won't look good for a very long period of time, because the double-hung windows will be up there with the tilting turns and an occasional six over six might be introduced.
I would go back to the original condition, which is six over six percent, but I would accept aluminum instead of wood just to go back to so you want to go back to six over six, but you would accept six over one yeah, but I applaud the attempt to have a uniform look but yeah because, as they say, it's a long term solution and like this is our chance to say what should look like okay, but did two sort of A mish-mosh building in a way it is, and that's why I don't think these went over ones would harm it rather than trying to go back to something that probably is not as fitting and I am worrying.
Think was Michelle's question about the architecture is appropriate, as Steve mentioned landmark says it's when a year history of approving one over one windows on this building, including recent approvals in 2014 and 2016, and the Commission's findings in those decisions were based on the fact that there are no existing his sort of windows and but in particular that by matching the operation and the brick profile and by maintaining the uniform eautiful beautiful unity of the facade in terms of configuration, materials and finish, I was much more in keeping with it was much more harmonious to the building.
One over one window is appropriate on the style building the Commission, particularly in their prior approvals mentioned.
This is the precedent of similar one over one windows on similar buildings of that period, style and design, so all which I think you know in particular getting that uniform window appearance is probably the Paramount goal.
The details on these windows are very carefully designed and designed to follow the original, and therefore it will be a much nicer looking building than the existing one over one windows, even if they were uniform.
Okay, we're going the resolution is to approve as presented sounds like it I'm gonna call.
So cp8 has written a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Committee, a commission saying please don't approve any more master plans that don't replicate the original multi light fabric of Windows in any building on in community board 8 and community boards, 5 and I believe three have signed on to it and I put the I sent the letter to our co-chairs, asking whether we wanted to, but noting the previous history of having approved under certain circumstances like tonight.
Michelle okay, he's not here, but he but I think he replied to the email to you saying not so much and I just wanted to raise that with the committee and let you know that I will not be signing on to that letter in part, because it would be duplicitous to do so after this vote and 150 West 79th and 370 Riverside Drive and a few others.
That would mean that even a building that didn't originally have six over ones would have to install six over ones in order to be consistent, stone Street that I mentioned yeah exactly and then the other thing to consider here is the LPC formula and the formula was recommended to us about, judging whether or not to replace multi light based on the presence or absence of decoration on the facade.
