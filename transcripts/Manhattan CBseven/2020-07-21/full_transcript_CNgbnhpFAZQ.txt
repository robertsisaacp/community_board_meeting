Hey mark: hey there, hey michelle yeah, I'm trying this on my phone on bluetooth and outside. Oh I'm, sorry. I have to give me one second I have to. I have to mute. The other thing. Wait. Oh wait! Wow! That's where it is hi blanche, hi thanks for joining. Thank you for having me and I did it without steve's help cool. That's a good thing. Yes, it is now we can't see you, but can you see us? I certainly can excellent. Okay, I wouldn't want to see my black and blue jaw. Oh because of your dental, you know: yeah hi, guys, hey, linda, hey, linda, got a new do or just yeah nice thanks! Thank you yeah. They started this week again. So, yes, my, I actually had a post covet haircut. You know holding the mask while she cut around the back poor thing had to deal with what I did to myself with my beard. Trimmer, when I was you know, we're live on youtube, so I probably shouldn't be talking about coffee, but I totally relate to it. They rectify the colors and my color mishaps and everything else so, but it's there, but it's we're almost back. It's phase four. Well, it's phase, four with an asterisk right, yeah or maybe three and a half yeah hi bland hi linda. How are you I'm good? How are you I am world? Thank you. Okay, are you using a phone now michelle yeah, I'm using a phone and a bluetooth and I'm not home, and so this is been very interesting, have to learn how to do all of this. It is challenging it is. I I'm thinking about investing in a green screen, because I can't get the background, so that was the because I've been doing a lot of these things. These webinars yeah so background the background's my home. So it's not really hot looks nice. Oh thanks, hey andrew hi, andrew clary, I got an email today from janice horowitz and she was so thrilled by the parks committee meeting. She said it was. She said it was exciting and she couldn't stop talking about your command of of the of the whole dialogue. And so anyway, it's a really nice email. Are you there clary? Oh well, he's almost there hey, doug hi, I'm going to talk to you about green screens after this green screens? Oh you mean, like my background here, yeah. I just think it's apropos it's verde square, sonia, it's very upper west side. You know beautiful. Thank you. I'd like to. Let me rotate it. Dude do another point of view on the upper west side. I have a whole bunch of shots. I want to put up, except that when I do it looks like the invisible man or woman, because you can just see like through my eyes and see the background. So I have to get a green screen because I have what they call a three-year-old camera on my yeah a mask somebody wearing a mask: oh hi, there, sarah all right, hey, sarah hello, cindy, hey cindy hello, hey howard, hey andrew, hey, mark, hey there! This is luiza without louisa hello. This is like remember everyone. We have a romper room yeah from clark. I see andrew, like he said doug, and I remember looking back like how did how did she see? What would what was she looking through, though she was looking through something it was like a mirror that turned it was like a magic mirror. Yes, thank you and reminds me of steven wright's line where you know, if you're a little kid watching television and he said he really freaked him out when he said smokey, the berry said only you can prevent forest fires. He went me a lot of pressure for a little kid. I think we've got to play. I think we've got play in the works. Only you can prevent yeah. I thought it was only me that could do it right. That's. Consequently, we all thought we were the fire chiefs. I'm researching. I was just saying: I'm researching green screens well and zoom you just there's a virtual. You just have to do your virtual. It doesn't work online because I don't have the camera and whatever, so you have a more powerful camera. My computer is three years old, so, but I think it's just you could just take a photograph and then use that, as you see how roberta has the lovely planet, I think that's one of the ones from zoom was I took photographs now we put him up and then I called my I.t guy and he just said forget about it. You're going to have to get a green screen. You've got an old computer. You want to buy a new computer from him, I'm like! No, if you go to the what is it called you go to the where it says more and there here say virtual backgrounds. It says virtual background. You can go to your pictures and download a picture into the virtual path I did all of the above, except that it breaks up, because I don't have the bandwidth for it literally. So I have to get a green screen. Well, I just want to give mad props to all of the board members. When we started talking about this in early march and I said to mark, we can't not do meeting, we have to do meetings of some sort. There's this thing called zoom: we should be using it and what a difference a few months makes like everyone's on it and using it. Well, so mark that's largely thanks to you. No, it was remember. It was that team of folks that was you rich robbins doug bob wyman from the community, a bunch of other folks. They all conspired to teach me how to spell zoom, let alone how to use it. We take it day by day. You know, I remember. Skype was like a miracle, and then we had the google and none of them work like zoom, really kind of it's more fun. Oh really take that back. Fun might be going a long ways, but so hi folks, it's 6 32.. So I'm going to more or less call us to order. We do have a quorum of steering. So the first order of business is the thank you for having a quorum of steering at 6 32 pm. It's really terrific when people show up on time and helps to make meeting management that much better you'll see on our agenda that the first topic was the budget one. But this budget issue, which is both dns and the budget itself, is going to be informed by a discussion with our council member helen rosenthal who's running a little bit late. So what I propose to do is to jump to number two rather than have a piecemeal budget discussion and number two is to talk about what. If anything, we want to say as a board with respect to the potential for using outdoor space for schools, you may have seen a piece in the new york times that was published in between the time in which this was put on your agenda and today talking about some of the advantages of this and actually we're counting some interesting history that apparently this was done during the cove, the covid, the spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as well as various bouts with tuberculosis in outbreaks here in new york city in the early 1900s, as well as other times as well. The community education council tomorrow night will be taking up a resolution that also calls for the creative use of outdoor space and has additional facts and thoughts. This was kicked around a little bit at transportation and, I believe also at yel- I'm not certain of that yes say again, ken yes, okay as ways in which to mitigate some of the effects of return to in-person learning, to the extent that we do that, and I don't think we are as a board but I'll, listen. Obviously, I'm curious for your thoughts as to whether we're whether we can opine on whether or not folks should go back to in-person learning in schools. We certainly couldn't do that as a letter, as I believe, if I've made clear what we tend to do with letters is expand upon and perhaps extrapolate from resolutions and statements that the full board has adopted, but not to take new positions without without the benefit of some kind of full board and perimeter imprimatur in perimeter. However, that's pronounced so here having having our board robustly endorse outdoor dining and outdoor use of space, about the use of outdoor space for other retail and also having our board pass resolutions recently. That called for the prioritization of both the funding for input in person, rather, for course, subjects as well as for after-school programming. It seems to me that a letter would be possible leveraging those of statements of our board to then go the next mile and say to the extent that there are plans for in-person education, that they should include the ability to use outdoor spaces, whether they be parks or curbside or plazas or whatever it is, that might be available to each particular school. So I'd be curious, I see shelley's hand and I'm going to call on you first, but I'd be curious to see, first of all, to hear your thoughts about whether that is a fair leveraging of prior community board statements and, secondly, whether you think that is an appropriate thing for our board to be doing regardless so shelly. And then I see christian's hand. After that I speak as a 50-year educator, mainly in the public schools and having been chair of the community board in district 3.. I think it's treacherous the idea of curbside or park classes. I would support rooftop on schools that have rooftops that are safe using outdoor yards and those type of spaces, but given the fact that there is no control once you're outside of those areas in terms and sometimes even in those areas of outsiders who will say I like this- I don't like this. I want to interfere with this with the streets being particularly eerie and unsafe, and I'm the last person who complains about people on the street, I think, and certainly in the park. I think that it's a great idea to have open-air classes, but within the confines of school, just a little side note. Schools will then be also be liable for anything that happens to kids, and so some schools and districts have a tremendous difficulty coming up with regulations for trips outdoor trips. To begin with, this would just, I think, exacerbate that need that need for creating legal, legalistic documents, but I hate to you know, but I think things that we have talked about and had resolutions support, outdoor learning, so rooftops yards playgrounds, but not streets or parks. Yeah. Thank you. So, let's go to christian, and then I see ken and then I see paulie, oh and cindy okay. So in that order, please I couldn't agree with shelly any more than what from what he just said. I would also add that any outdoor space used for learning can only be temporary, because eventually you have rain, you have high winds, it would get cold and those places would no longer be viable for destruction, so they would have to have a permanent place inside whether they will meet. So I would really you know, discourage the idea. Okay, I think I had ken next and then paulie and then cindy. I think that's the order and then now I see howard and sarah okay, so ken go ahead. Yeah this you know we were able to to build a hospital in central park, pretty much overnight in tents and there's no reason why we can't cordon off streets and sidewalks in front of schools to expand their footprint. Much like we have we're having restaurant streets. If it's good enough for people eating, it should be good enough for teaching the stakes are really high. Here. Schools are crucial to building back our economy. If we can double the number of students able to use classrooms, then we can cut the occupancy of the actual physical rooms in the school in half, and that means more people, more parents who don't have to stay home, which also is a big way, a big help to the economy. You know we, as I said, we have this pop-up hospital. This is this is not a time to be operating out of fear. I'm sure that the city would ultimately be liable. We're talking about public schools. We shut down streets all the time, they're called play streets in the middle of the day. Nobody talks about liability issues. We don't have problems with that. We've had open streets for several months now we really this resolution could just be, or the letter could just be calling on the city to explore this concept. We don't have to necessarily be advocating for it. Okay, thanks. Let me see, I think I had polly next tonight and then look at everybody. I think I had polly next go ahead and then so I just got off a call with the president of the ufc, because I'm part of the reopening committee and what we have recommended it is to utilize our parking lot. Our sidewalks, you know whatever space is available because we do have schools that have trailers already that are being utilized, and so we are exploring that as an option, because there is limited space, especially for the elementary school and junior high school students. So we are exploring the fact that we should utilize outside space. So I agree with shelly and everyone else who spoke that, yes, we can use that space in a productive way. When the weather gets cold. We can set up temporary trailers so that this way the students are protected. There will be supervision. What about when they're trying to screen the students they have to hold them somewhere right? So it'll take an hour to two hours for students just to get into the building. So we have to come up with a better plan, while they're waiting to be screened, okay and to make sure they have ppe and seated they'll be standing around for at least an hour, or so they should have somewhere that they can sit down and we see some type of enriching weight building. So that's some hardly exploring. So I do feel that you know it would be good to look at it in our area and, yes, we could put a statement to that effect. Saying that you know we support any other options that may be available so that the students aren't standing outside for two hours, just waiting to get into a building and then having to exit. You know within two hours, because classes will still begin from eight to three o'clock. Okay, so that's something that should be looked at paulie just to understand. You said that you agreed with shelley, but shelley was pretty clear that he thought that it should only be spaces that are already pertinent to a school. Well, he did identify the rooftop. He did identify parking lots. He did identify sidewalks, okay, playgrounds. Those are the areas that we're talking about. Okay about now. We want to utilize all spaces that are available, because different schools have different spaces, and so there are parking lots next to the school buildings. There are sidewalks. You know the plaza basically on 97th street, that's a very wide boulevard. You know, so that would be comparable to setting up a temporary shelter for the students, because they shouldn't be standing out in the rain or in the snow or in the cold waiting to get into the building when we can utilize that time to give them instruction very good. Thank you. I just want to make sure I got your comment correct. Yes, yes, I think cindy was the next person we were going to go to so go ahead, cindy and then we'll figure it out from there, and this will be one by the way, guys where I see a lot of hands. So let's make all of our comments at once. We're not gonna go back and forth. Okay cindy! You need to unmute mark at some point. I'd like to comment when my turn comes thanks, blanche. Sorry, okay, can you hear me now we can yeah. I just wanted to disclose that they sit on the board of a funded school that serves 80 some odd children with language-based learning disabilities, so they all have ieps and I've been we've been I've served on the task force about reopening and one of the things that school wanted to inquire of the community board and the council member about was potential use of the street as a type of a play space. I agree with ken we, especially for children with ieps, there's a lot that needs to happen for them during the course of their school week. Our goal is to serve every kid every day in person, if possible, and to have the flexibility of using the outdoor space. The extra outdoor space would just be one other tool in the toolbox that the administrators could use. I know that safety is a very valid concern, but I don't feel that the community board should substitute our judgment for that of the administ school administrators as to what's safe and what's not safe, and what can and cannot be done. You know unless you walk a walk in their shoes. You don't know you know what they're capable of. I know our classes are very small with a teacher and an aide, so there is a lot of a lot of adult supervision that goes on, and you know it's amazing, the creative solutions that I've heard spoken about in the past few weeks as fuck surrounding reopening. So I would, I would definitely endorse sending some kind of letter giving schools as much space, especially outdoor space, which everybody knows is much safer and less likely to help spread the virus so yeah, I'm totally in favor of it. Thank you. So let's go to some more hands, I'm gonna take blanche and then I'll say so: blanche, howard courtney, andrew stephen clary paige, in some order. I'll try to keep to that. Okay team has had our hand up for a while too. Who has I'm sorry? Oh thank you. I didn't see her, so thank you see mo be on the list too. Thank you. Blanche go ahead. Oh and councilmember. Rosenthal is with us. We are discussing the potential use of outdoor space, for schools. Can you hang a minute, or should we pivot and go back to you can okay? Thank you. Okay. I just want some clarification. I think this came from ken. Can you mention the the height of the pandemic when temporary wards were set up in central park and you are you and are you not equating that to setting up classrooms on the street? I didn't. I couldn't get that clear. Yes, I was that's not the only possibility but buddy, but he heated tents or they were set up in the early part of the 20th century when tuberculosis was running, but I see a vast difference between setting up a facility in the park and setting it up on the street, but I just wanted to be clear about what you said shelly I in part I to a great extent agreed with you that setting up a classroom situation curbside would be hardly appropriate. Is that what you said? Yes, okay, I I'm sure all of us have seen the curbside dining facilities, and somebody else mentioned that, and I don't know if any of us are thinking about something comparable to those for classroom. Use, I just don't know what people are suggesting when they say herbicide. Well it would. It probably is akin to something akin to what restaurants are doing. So, let's assume that, but I'm hearing you as a no on that idea and I think that no, I think we will be exposing our students, our faculty parents, who might be waiting to order emission students would be cheat to joe with traffic. So that would be an absolute no. I think somebody excluded parks and I'm not sure why I would just say for the upper west side here where I am. There are a number of playgrounds that are contingent to schools. There is a mammoth playground that runs from 100th street in amsterdam to 102nd from amsterdam over to columbus, where one could set up multiple classrooms, that's under the ages of the parks department, but just to cut it short. I would just say that we should do some looking into what part, and there are other there are other places in the in the 80s okay, so we should look. I just would say that we should look into park spaces that are available and usable and should not rule out the possibility of getting trailers, because at 163, which is next door to me, have been held in trailers for years now. So all these are possibilities. One thing that I would that I personally totally disapprove of is the kirkside use and I won't take up any more time at this point. Thank you blanche, my part, my apologies for interrupting book and somebody promote josh, cohen and marcia rosenberg to panelists. I thought I did. Let me I did before there's madge, okay, thank you and christian for having been so diligent, I'm gonna burden you with being a co-host of this gathering tonight. Give me one second: actually I'm going to go in the order in which the hands were raised. Zoom apparently keeps track of that. So paige cowley is the next person to be called upon and I'll just go on the list in the order. It'll be page, followed by rich robbins, followed by sema, but I'll get everybody so paige go ahead and I'll try to look for a christian in the meanwhile. Just a caution. I think all of our efforts are have married, there's an architect in my office who's working with his kids school in queens, and there are a lot of other factors I mean a tent is great. The flaps can be rolled up. You get fresh air, you can put the flaps down when it's windy rainy, but the reality is, though, those areas also need to be able to be sanitized in scrubs between classes. You need telephone, you need emergency equipment, you need a nurse on duty. I mean I'm surprised that you know the department of education is really looking hard at temporary facilities, but with children and not to mention the issue with ada. I would be very nervous about making recommendations. I think it's great to write a letter in support and that we would give assistance when called for the specific sites, but I'm kind of with shelly that we're opening up a can of worms here and we don't know all the circumstances- the class size, the kids capacity, what form they're in. So I that's it. I just hope it's general. Thank you. Thanks! I'm going to go to rich robbins next, followed by seymour by clary yeah. So I want to echo what cindy said, especially in response to shelley and paige and jerry and others is that I don't think we need to be prescriptive. We don't need to tell educators what's safe and what's not what they should do, what they can't. We don't need to go school by school and say you know here's what you should set up. I think what we want to do is just a blanket, a statement that the doe should be exploring all options, and that includes working with other agencies, especially the dot and also parks and any other agency, to explore any possible space that could expand the amount of space that's available for schools, and I don't think we need to say any more than that and we can trust the doe that they're not going to do something. That's going to put students at risk and they're not going to do something that doesn't work for pedagogical reasons or for space reasons or for safety or any other reason. But we just want to tell them that they should be exploring all options and other agencies should be working with them. On a bigger point to how mark started this conversation about how we don't know if schools are going to open, that's the main question: that's going to be, you know super relevant for the next few weeks and what I put in chat is: it could make sense for us. I don't think we should weigh in on that issue. I don't think we can, but there are a number of members of our community who are extremely concerned about a number of big questions that haven't been answered, and one thing we might do is just try to raise a list of the most important questions that should be answered extremely quickly, because parents have just the next few weeks before we have to tell the doa whether we're sending our students to school in september or, if we're going, 100 remote and there's a lot of information that we're lacking, that we need to have to be able to make that decision and that's something I think the board might even consider- and I know it's we're getting into august, but we might consider having a town hall just to hear from parents in the next week or so to hear what are those questions and put that out for elected officials and for the doa to hear you know. These are some questions that you need to be answering so that parents can make the right decisions and that reflect some of the concerns that the community has. Thank you thank you. So sema is next. Then clary then howard, then courtney and steven, then andrew sarah and barbara, and then we're gonna go to our council member. So I have a seven-year-old daughter and we did remote schooling from you know mid-march until the end of the year, and while we had a decent experience, it is far short of an in-person experience, and so I do think that anything that we could do to give our schools and the district a chance at getting more kids, giving more kids an in-person school experience would be sort of the best thing that we can do. I agree with a lot of what rich said and that we shouldn't be prescriptive. One size does not fit all in terms of solution, but giving schools an opportunity to use outdoor space vacant storefronts churches- I mean a lot of these. Things- have been sort of in the press and thrown out as options whatever I think the school, both in conjunction with doe any school administrators individually, decide, I think, is something that we could support and especially if it means that more kids could have an in-person experience rather than remote. Thank you. Fema clary is next okay, so I largely agree with shelley and people. Who've agreed with shelly on what spaces might work and what don't I'd like to have an open mind about streets. Just lost you guys. Am I still there yeah you're here, yeah I'd like to have an open mind about the streets in front of schools, the adjacent space, but I suspect that between issues of weather and safety and noise and cleanliness that probably those spaces are not going to make it. I just wanted to speak for a minute, though about parks, because a couple people have suggested that those that actual park space as opposed to parking, lots and parks, and I'm not really addressing parking lots in parks but actual green space in parks. I think, is a really bad idea and I don't think we should be suggesting or mentioning or sanctioning that for two reasons. One is that while central park has a lot of space and it worked for the small hospital that was there for a while, our other local parks, including riverside, are very constrained for space. Riverside is long but very narrow. Our perks are fuller than ever of people who are there for various active and passive recreation, and I just don't think you can fit school rooms in any park other than central. But but aside from that, I think, if you start, we had some back and forth this last week about whether permits would be required to set up schools in parks or whether they could just go do it. I find it hard to believe you could just go. Do it without some kind of sanctioning affirmative permission from the parks department, but my concern would be that that would likely lead to inequities where the perhaps the private schools are the ones with the stronger parents, association or the ones with more power or the ones who were more savvy would get there first, they would take the space and because you're not going to have lots of them, even if you have any in our parks, and it would lead to inequities that I think would be a bad thing. So I would just want to keep parks, not offer parks as a location. Thank you. Keeping going with the list as zoom gives it to me: I've got howard, followed by courtney, stevens, andrew and then barbara, and then we're gonna wrap this up. Okay mark martin, excuse me mark you also have saralin and you have an attendee. Also thank you they're, not on my list, but thank you we'll make sure we hear them too keep going. Oh, I just wanted to say I don't think anyone's advocating sticking kids in traffic and seeing what happens. I think what we're talking about is offering schools the greatest possible latitude to provide an education which is more difficult than ever so to the extent we can give them another tool, a closed street. I think it's really critical because of how difficult it is in terms of lawsuits. This is america. Anyone could sue anyone else for any reason. At any time, kids have one shot in an education and again the street may not be the appropriate place for it, but they should again the this is an incredibly difficult time for both educators and students. We should we, as a community board, should be advocating for these people to have the greatest tools available to teach kids and if it's inappropriate, it's inappropriate farming it from me or from any of us to say what they can and what they can do, what they cannot do. I think we should just give them as much help as possible to perform their educational function and hope that they can they can do a decent job under these very difficult circumstances. Thank you, howard. I'm going next to courtney, followed by stephen yeah I'll, just echo very quickly what I think we're starting to hear, which is that I agree with what cindy and rich and fema and howard all said, and I actually think at the last yl meeting. What I believe we began talking about was the fact that we as a board do best when we support the decision-making processes and the decisions made by those with the greatest most specific expertise for coming out and making some very specific recommendations so like cindy and rich and fema I'd support a general statement that encourages schools and officials to really think creatively. While addressing both the opportunities and constraints that are specific to them, whatever those may be, because we don't have the expertise to do that, but I do think that to miss the opportunity to really encourage schools and the officials to think creatively is to really do a disservice to our kids as someone with a young child, the idea of extended distance learning is not exciting to me so anyway, I'd support a general statement like so many others have already mentioned. Thank you, stephen is next, please yeah, so I I'll just build on what courtney said again. I this came up at yl as if everyone doesn't know, and it kind of led into this at the end. What I said there is what I'll sort of reiterate a general statement of exploring opportunities or of different spaces. I would be in favor of I think that there for me, there's no bigger issue coming in education, so the idea of giving educators the opportunity to do things and take advantage of this. I support and I would think when we time to vote. I just think about this. We're talking about that exploring spaces. I think one of the challenges since I've been on the board is sometimes we have a tendency to dig into the weeds and the details and say I'm not going to vote for this because it could be cold in december and that's not what we're voting on today. We're not voting on whether we have ada compliant we're not voting on whether it's cold we're not voting on whether it's going to be a classroom out there we're just offering a general statement of something to explore to me. That seems fairly obvious that this is something we should explore and when they make that decisions we can have meetings. I would see us at yale having a very specific meeting and discussing that and having a resolution either in support of the details or against the details, but this is a resolution or a statement just to support the idea- and I can tell you this we're in a time of crisis and the idea that we wouldn't explore something because of things that could happen, but we don't know seems counterproductive to the way I would think about it. I would encourage us to support this idea. For that reason. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to turn to oh there's. Sarah lynn, great okay, andrew ridgie, is next. Then sarah lynn, then barbara adler and those are the those are the last hands, although I think we have one in among attendees and I will be glad to take that hand as well as long as it's about this. Thank you. Can you hear me I just put on these headphones you're doing great. Thank you so yeah. So I don't know if you've seen my video I've just been in multiple rooms in a small apartment, because we have a four-year-old daughter who's about to be five. It's been extremely difficult. Trying to work have a life schooling inside. I think we need to look at every opportunity under the sun, moon and stars to figure out what we are going to do in the future. I know with a as a parent with a daughter who's going to be in kindergarten next year. I want her to have an experience that she and we will remember for our life. This is a crisis, unlike one we hopefully will ever see ever again, and we should use this opportunity to enact big, bold policies and see how it goes. Everyone talking about safety. Of course, safety needs to be paramount. I don't think anyone questions that, but I agree with all the sentiments we need to support a plan to look at every option we have and then those people that are responsible for determining what is safe. What is not should make those determinations it's as simple as that, I don't think it's complicated. Let the people who have to deal with those decisions deal with those complexities, but the cost and the impact of not doing anything is so much larger than us actually taking action. I'd love to look back at this, and I think that kids could have such an amazing learning experience and one that they will probably never hopefully have to do again. So I'll leave it at that, and I just think we need to support this for these reasons right now, so anyway, so I'll leave that. Thank you thanks. Let's go to sarah lynde, barbara adler and richard ash was in the chat, so I'm going to call on him too, but then I'm really I'm going to cut this off. Okay, so sarah you're next barbara, then richard. Thank you. I just wanted to say well a couple things you know: clary mentioned that the parks might be an equity issue, and I wanted to say that this is absolutely an equity issue. Families, essential workers, people who don't have child care in their home, but need to go to work still. They depend on schools to educate their children, but also to take care of their children. We're talking about a blended model where families that again need to go to work and don't have reliable child care are struggling to think about how they're going to manage their children. It was difficult in the spring. It's going to continue to be difficult, the more children we can get into schools in a safe way, the more equitable our city will be so that I think, is a top priority and you know we need to have space. I also want to say: kristen sabov was in the chat she, so we serve on the ps166 slt together she's the chair, and we were discussing this idea as an slt and supportive richard ashe mentioned. You know we could close streets next to schools. I think that's exactly what we're talking about. Ps166 is on 89th. It's a narrow, crowded street. There are five educational institutions on the street. Pick up and drop off is crazy. On a normal day I mean it's so crowded, having social distance having the kids get in there and in any kind of socially distance way would just be impossible with the buses coming with all the it's crazy. So what we're talking about is potentially closing a street like that at pickup and drop-off, for example, so that families can spread out. We can take these temperatures whatever needs to be done, so we just have that flexibility and then also just exploring other creative options where we can get kids into open spaces. So I think it's absolutely an equity issue and equity calls for being creative about this. I also just wanted to mention, because I wasn't able to join the yell committee, but I know that the district 3 green schools committee had written a statement. I'm not sure if that got read into the record there, but I will just copy and paste it into the chat here and I'll put it in the minutes as well, and then just last thing is. I just wanted to ask what we're talking about doing. I know you're talking about a letter mark but like are we do we need to vote on that? I know we can't necessarily do a resolution because we don't have full board in august, so I just wanted to clarify the logistics of how we move forward, but I'm in support. So we were talking about one or one or the other of those two things I'll interrupt for just a second the. In order to be timely, it would have to be a letter, but since it's a letter it can't break new ground. It has to build on something that we already have a statement in support of and consensus, and so so I'll summarize that way. If there's a, if there's a will to have a resolution, which of course would be voted on september 1st, when all the plans are already made, that's certainly something we can do as well, but I'll wrap this up with a thought and then see if there is consensus around it there, we there they're at so I have now barbara adler and richard ash and then one person in attendees and then I'm going to call the quest, not call the question recall the wrap this up. Okay. I'll, be very brief, I would support a very broad statement, but I think that shelley spoke very wisely and from experience I had experience for 11 years with my taste of the upper west side event. It was only two days of the year, but we asked the teachers to have their classes in the street in exchange for using their school yard and it was a nightmare and we had nypd presence at both ends of the street. The teachers really hated it and ultimately, they chose just not to use it at all. I think it really puts an undue burden on teachers asking them to do to take to keep their eye on a group of 25 or more students. Who are you know, running wild really, and it's that's all very good. Thank you, richard you're, going to give you the last word on the board and then we're going to turn to one other person in the attendees who I'll click on in a moment thanks. I think several board members expressed what I believe, which is that focusing on outdoor space misses a much larger point is that the city should be scrounging around for every available space. That's suitable for the classroom. That includes hotels that includes theaters. It includes churches after school centers and the focus solely on outdoor space. Really doesn't it's a small percentage of what might be available in the city, so I would favor if we're going to write a letter. Of course, the resolution I think is out of the question too late, but if we're going to write a letter, I would favor much broader as rich robin said much broader letter, you can mention, as sarah said, closing the streets because that's a specific request in terms of procedure. I wonder whether, although we can't write a letter as a community board, building on what we've already done, I wonder whether a letter subscribed by every community board member in his or her individual capacity, rather than as a community board, would have the same effect. In fact, it might have a greater effect, so you could, you could get a letter and then circulate it, and everybody wants to sign on can do that and it would not be constrained by any prior discussion from the board. Okay, thanks, I'm going to turn to it's mark daniel friedman, hi! Mr friedman, are you yes, I believe we can hear you so please go ahead. Sure I'll, introduce myself we're multi our family of multi-generational, educators, myself, starting in the 60s. At a time when educators were made, had more influence over the teaching in the schools. As a result of that influence, education number one insured safety and security, I thought I'm sure that's completely lost now, judging from the comments of everybody on the committee, but that was always job one I mean if you took a class trip, you would not go into the street. The idea of putting the children into the street was unimaginable now mark started. The conversation with curbside schooling- and I know mark- has an agenda about curbside parking. Howard brought it up in his comments as well. So I know it's in the back of some of the people's minds, however, putting kids in the street. The way you would put restaurant diners in the street is incomprehensible. Children are not diners, children are impulsive, children don't sit down to a meal. Children are not supervised by a waiter. With a maitre d there's one teacher 30 children putting them in the streets is not my idea of safety or security. I want to actually go through and read to you some of the comments that took place during this discussion. You will be aghast at what you said thanks very much we're not going to go recast the chat, but I thank you for contributing to our conversation. I think, given the hour and the fact that our council member is patiently waiting for us that it's time to wrap this up, what I propose to do since I think we all agree that a resolution voted on september- and this is almost the entirety of the point- is that I will draft something in the way of a letter that takes in and is, I was about to say school. Forgive me that is informed by all the comments, including those from those who have expressed significant concerns about particular uses of outside space and informed by the call for a much more general letter, the much more general call for creative space. That professionals think is safe. So we don't wander into areas that that are beyond our expertise or the expertise of some. I don't want to speak for you all, but certainly beyond my expertise, and I will circulate that to this group to the steering group and, if that, if that works for everybody, we can either sign on to it as individuals or as a board if we think that there's consensus around that and that it's a fair statement of our previous previous statements. So that's where that's what I propose to do and I want to wrap this up and thank you all for those very helpful comments. I think that we'll end up with something that certainly follows the lines and if we're way off still, we can continue to work on it. I hope that will satisfy the consensus that I hear developing throughout this meeting great. So thanks very much for that. I'm now looking for our council member who, I believe had to change from computer to telephone and so council member rosenthal. Are you with us? I am, can you hear me, we sure can and we thank you very much for joining us. The agenda item that we want to welcome you to discuss is in part relating to our district needs statement and our work for that, but in turn there is a and I'm going to turn the ball over to cindy cardinal, who is the chair of our of our budget and strategy committee, but to sort of tee it up. You were obviously one of the members of the budget negotiating committee and we're we're confronting the idea of trying to make recommendations both as to district needs and as the budget priorities with respect to the fiscal year 22 budget, and we were hoping that we would hear from you on any topic about that. You want to share with us, but especially about the severe budget cuts that we already are experiencing and the ways in which the current fiscal 21 budget was balanced, which may be a one-year one-off and then I'm going to turn it to cindy and follow up on more specifics on that. So is that a fair question can I can, I just get done, oh sure, happy to answer in 30 seconds. No, it's a really important question. I want to get to it just real quickly. If somebody can let me in for some reason my phone is saying that I'm still waiting to connect. So if there's, if someone in who's an administrator sees my phone number waiting, that would be great. Is that does it end for? Is it end in 483? No 1019? I don't see that on my list. Oh that's, weird! Okay, but anyway, here we are so look. I am a member of the budget negotiating team. I don't know how closely you all followed the drama of that vote and the negotiations. But my overall comment is that we went too far in our cuts. I believe that we cut beyond the fat well beyond the fat and that the cuts are falling on those who most need social services. So it's it's. Why? One of the two reasons why I voted against the budget and, if you're interested in seeing my statement on that mark, maybe you can send that around. It was in one of my e-blasts or I'm happy to send it out to get that around to folks, specifically, we went too deep in our cut to education to senior services to youth programs and social services. In general, the mayor put together a plan that includes a billion dollars in using a billion dollars of pension river reserves, which he's actually not allowed to use, and so by including it he's basically saying if the federal government doesn't come through with money or if the state does not allow us to borrow, then the city will take bigger cuts on its workforce. There will be furloughs, there may be pay decreases and he says he's working with the unions now to determine what those cuts would be. I have fought very strong over the last two months for two things: one is the state giving us the option to borrow, which can be imagined differently than the borrowing in 1974 when it was the nature of the crisis. Was very different than what it is now number one in number two: we've now already done our cuts, so I think the oversight should be very different for borrowing, and the second is that we for just one year only unwind the securities transfer tax rebate. This the tax, that's on the books, has been on the books, since 1905 is a good source of revenue to the city and the state, and the state is now discussing the possibility of unwinding the automatic rebate. That's on this tax and if you're interested, I can talk more about it in terms of the community board's district needs statement. You know, I would urge you to focus on basic government services. That's my cue to ask everybody who's, not speaking to mute thanks. Okay. So what do I mean by that? I mean that we need more affordable housing. The city is desperate for affordable housing and so on the capital side. I think, that's you know a number one priority and then on the expense side. You know we need more funding for food. Our pantries are being overrun. We need more funding for our schools, as someone mentioned earlier, the city does not have in place a nurse for each school, nor a nurse for each building. We need social workers, even more social workers in our schools. The administration has cut some social workers. I you know, I heard your discussion about an open classroom, ideas about open classrooms and using other spaces. I think you know the doe doesn't know yet until it surveys until each school surveys, their own population of students and teachers. I don't schools, just don't know whether or not they will need more space. You know the way the models are set up right now. It allows, for you know, only a half or a third of the kids in the building at any given time. So I think the department of education feels confident that principals are going to work out a nine to one nine students to one teacher ratio in all the buildings, but so I'm a little less worried about space. Now not saying we shouldn't be, but you know the proof will be in the pudding on that one, but immediately we need nurses and social workers in every single client in every single school. So those would be my top budget priorities. Great. Thank you, council member. I'm going to ask cindy cardinal, our the chair of our budget committee to sort of jump in here and bring us focus a little bit more in terms of questions. What you think we ought to be talking about cindy, hey cindy there. You go okay, hi helen. One of the things that our budget committee was actually talking about was how the list of most pressing issues overall that new york city planning puts out and as far as I know, it's what we're using still this year doesn't have some of the issues I mean you can check other and write in, but affordable housing, yes, is on their schools is on there, but you know maybe issues surrounding racial equity, that's not on their issues surrounding covet 19, supporting small businesses. So, there's a lot of stuff that sort of issues that are have always been there, but maybe knock over 19, but issues that have been there but maybe have risen to the to the top through the pandemic. So we were kind of discussing that and we were also talking about our goal this year, which is to reach out to organizations outside the board, and I think that goes to europe point helen about cutting beyond the fat. I think we need to find out what beyond the fat, those organizations are seeing as cuts and what we need to what we need to ask for. You know beyond obviously, nurses and social workers and all the schools, affordable housing, I think, was our number one priority last year, great well, you know but funding for food pantries and so that our are creating yeah. Our committees need to be reaching out to those organizations to say you know to get more specifics and also to have maybe have them advocate as well and include their letters in our district needs statement, which is not something we really did so much last year. We didn't have so much supporting material, but I think we'd like to include that this year, if we can yeah it's great point and I would reach out to the usual suspects and you know, project find and it's senior centers. Obviously the senior centers are not open, but project find is being used as cooling center. It's worth checking in with them goddard, you know, runs so many programs, including affordable housing, one of the beacon programs which is so important, so it's worth reaching out to them and then the churches. You know that are doing phenomenal work in terms of getting food out to people and west side campaign against hunger, the other staple, and they will all tell you they need more funding right, and so I haven't come through the budget, and I don't even know that I'd be able to read between the lines, because I know how sometimes budgets are written right. Sorry, you're jogging, my memory, litter basket. Pickup, I think, is incredibly important. This city is going to get dirtier. Our district is not experiencing it today as much as the outer boroughs. Some districts up right now already are so filthy they're cutting back litter basket, pickups, so it'll only be one day if that on weekends, possibly holidays, and then only three days a week for regular pickup, which used to be five day a week service cleanliness is going to become a serious problem which then, of course, you know means rats are going to be a serious problem in every throughout the city. As a component of that, you know the loss of curbside organics composting and the there was also a major hit to the community composting. It got cut in half helen. Does the reduction of services by the sanitation department comes with a reduction in personnel attrition? That's that will happen. That means that people will not be hired to fill empty spots. That's exactly right, jerry we, but we were told also that the sanitation workers we were told in a committee meeting that the sanitation workers were being redeployed to feed feed the hungry. So it was kind of hard to argue that you know we should have curbside composting and people shouldn't eat, so it was sort of like we were given that as a even more you know, that's interesting, and certainly there have been some interesting results in implementation. Having the sanitation, commissioner, be the food czar, so sure maybe that's happening. I don't think that is it's not an either or proposition. You don't have to feel like it's, neither or because it really was at the point where you know you just felt like well. How do we argue for that? Well, I share your feeling about that and was very careful. I mean when we were in the budget negotiating team. Talking about this. We have the same. You know we bumped up to the same things. By the same token, you know, I think, there's an element to which one could say. Commissioner, garcia was a really good soldier in terms of being a commissioner and took many more cuts than other agencies did right or wrong, but you know it's tough. So, as far as the borrowing could you maybe give us more information about that yeah, we can talk about more about it offline. I mean, I think the main point is to the extent the community board could be supportive of the city borrowing and contemplate even a resolution about it and then send it to your state, elected officials. That's where that has to go, and just wanted to highlight that our june 2nd resolution on education funding did include an endorsement of borrowing in order to fund some of the of the putbacks of education, cuts that we were proposing fantastic. So it's the exact same thing, yeah right and it need not be much more complicated than that. I mean if you wanted to add one more sentence. I think the sentence would be you know. The covid pandemic has brought on an economic collapse and a meaningful reduction to revenues. You know, therefore, any oversight does not need to in my mind's eye focus so strongly on cuts, particularly given the fact that the city just put forward four billion dollars worth of cuts, but having oversight about the revenue streams does make a lot of sense because, as soon as revenues come in that's when the city can pay back borrowing, I mean to the extent that the federal government steps in and gives the city five billion dollars. You know that's a one-time use and borrowing is meant to cover the same piece while we're waiting for the federal government to come. In, I mean everyone. Economists are saying I mean economists have been saying: the city will come back in 2024, you know, but if we're, if we're just cutting programs and services, why would people come back to new york city in order to get a jump start our commute our economy after you know, there's a vaccine, so obviously borrowing is something that I am very familiar with. Given my background at omb and I've done a lot of research on this people, I've written an article about it in the nation, but you know we don't have to go into the details here at all happy to follow up with anyone, yeah, okay, so I'm borrowing to provide basic services. Where have I heard that before? Oh, yes, the mta yeah, I mean look you better, I mean mta is screwed yep, sorry, nothing personal. Despite your best efforts, andrew, very good, I'm going to open up to for a few questions for the council member. I see one in among attendees, mr friedman, please make it about the topic under discussion. You should be able to unmute yourself go ahead. Mr freeman, thank you mark I'll start by saying that I always talk about the topic under discussion. I have found that I have not always been taken directly with what I say, but I will continue just in response to your comment to me: mark no we're talking to the council member right now. We you and I can talk offline, as you have been a frequent flyer in my inbox this week. You're welcome to do that again. If you have a question for the council member, I invite you to post it now. Otherwise, we'll move to my colleague, stephen all right thanks, so steven you're up you did it. Okay, thanks mark, I think I'm sort of half on topic in it maybe a little half out, but I'm in topic, because it's about schooling, hi helen. I hope all as well great to hear your voice, and I can see you. I know you, don't hey good, to see you, I think, in terms of education. One of the biggest concerns in a lot of the parents is to understand for the remote learning. You know what is the requirement or what is the goal for how much time will actually be spent in remote learning in terms of live, educational teaching and I've asked this to dozens of people and haven't been able to get a single answer. I think that's either acceptable or remotely giving us direction. You should know that all the parents we all have to side with in a week and what we're going to do and I'm hoping that you have some inside information or some insights on that, because I have greetings, no you're nailing it having to teach himself all day. You know yes, steve you're nailing it you're nailing the problem, and I think I asked the question you just put out there. You know twice in my town hall, I'm guessing that you tried to have it asked in last night's town hall. The doe does not have an answer. They don't have an answer for some really basic things. They don't have an answer on testing. They don't have an answer on nurses. They don't have an answer for how we keep our children and definitely our teachers and administrators safe. I mean it's now recognized that, while kids between 10 and maybe 16, don't necessarily get the virus, they are carriers. You know we learned something new all the time right about this horrible virus. So no I just all I can say is I agree and keep on your quest because it's outrageous, they don't have answers to these questions, and I also agree with mo guru when they say they're gonna clean down the school every night. I can't believe that's true. I just can't wasn't true. You know when school was open at the end of you know, when the pandemic broke out, it was a lot to be worried about I'm sorry. Okay thanks, maybe they should get advice from the mta. Maybe I mean if government, if the institutions, if the agencies would start to work together, you know you could have creative overlap like that? No joke yeah, no! So, council member, thank you very much for joining us and for all of that insight and you kind of teed up perfectly the next part of our conversation and I'm gonna, look again at our budget chair cindy cardinal to try to lead us on the next part of it. You're, of course, welcome to stay, but we know that you've got all kinds of demands on your time. What we're going to talk about next is the nitty gritty of getting a district needs statement in order and in place and how we want to go about doing that in timing and so forth. So cindy, can you help us with that part of the conversation and then mark with that? I'm gonna say goodbye. Unfortunately, I have two more zooms to get on, but cindy. Let's follow up happy to be helpful. Thank you so much for having me on tonight. Thank you for joining us and for being so patient too appreciate it thanks. Okay, so we wanted to talk about the timetable, because I know that you know at this point. Last year I was already haranguing people to give me their district needs statements and budget priorities, and this year was a little different, as you may have noticed. So so we decided not to harangue for months and months and just to say that we would like you all committee chairs, to use august to sort of sort out the information that you need to obtain in order to write a district needs statement, and he had mentioned that last year we distributed the sections of the district needs statement to all committee chairs, and I will be happy to do that again before the weekend. We'd like to see a dns from everybody by the first week in september, and the reason for that is that we would like to then at the next. At the september, steering committee meeting discuss our budget priorities. You may recall that last year we did sort of a broader grouping of budget priorities that we all agreed on. I think we narrowed it down to ten and then in october, got it down to the three top priorities, and I think that worked pretty well and I'd like to try that again again, you heard us say it. When we were speaking to council member rosenthal, you know reach out to organizations outside the board. We need to kind of look for the coveted lessons learned and that we are still learning find out from the ngos. What is on the chopping block? What needs to be advocated for what is being cut beyond fat, although I know most of them would not think there was any fat already and then we were talking today that we had a committee meeting in terms of preservation preserving what is the last thing that should be cut? What do you hold tied to even in a severe budget situation and that we'd, like you to approach approach the issue sort of from that perspective? We know that revenue is going to be tight until at least 2024.. So this is this is our dns for 2022 and so we'll still be in pretty dire streets. Then, and we know that as council, the council members said that the budget's balance this year on four billion dollars in reserves. So that's not gonna be recurring, and so that's gonna. It's gonna be worse next, and I think that was basically what we what we wanted to say. I guess so the dns in september and then and then during the month of september, to get your bro your capital and expense budget priorities set up and so that we'll have those by the beginning of october. I would hope so does anybody yeah? Does anybody have any questions? I can't I don't. There are a couple of hands linda. Actually, the question is we will get this ready for you for september, the first week of september, because we always get our dci always has our dna statements on time mark I wanted to ask you: can we have a- and I christian don't hate me, but can we have a meeting a committee meeting in august then so we can go over it with committee? A lot of committees find that it's more efficient to do this offline, but if you want to have a meeting you absolutely may I don't know christian. How do you feel about that? I don't think we may need to have a meeting itself. Why don't you and I discusses offline and if we need to, we just make a meeting to talk to the to the members. I'm not going anywhere. So if you need me, I'm here yeah, okay, fair enough, thank you and thank you cindy thanks steven cindy one question: are we considering a coveness within this boat within this dns? Are we considering what covet needs yeah? I mean, I think that we'd be we'd, be ignorant if we did not yeah. We just see this through the coveted lens we have to, especially with restaurants and all that's why I think it's really pressing that we get this right. One of the things that we had was that the budget this year took a big cut, but beverly had pointed out earlier that we, the city, took the extra money that was sitting and has added that to the budget. So for the next year that money is gone. There's no there's no extra and from the projections that I've been reading from the independent budget office, we're not going to see revenue like we've had until maybe they're predicting at the earliest 2024, but it won't be the same revenue that we had in 2019. So we're probably looking at 2026 before we're back. If god willing, the covet 19 vaccine comes in and people are treated, it doesn't come back to haunt us. So I would really have to concentrate on that. Thank you. I see ken's hand up too yeah. If we're as helen suggested, going to be making a suggestion to the legislature about borrowing. Are we also going to have an opportunity to make suggestions about revenue raising proposals sure, but they will be voted on by the full board, so we could that's something we could put in dns, but not obviously in the budget request, because that's right, so there's got to be a way to include that. Okay. Well, I guess that's, I don't see any more hands up, so those are what we're seeking to do everybody their section of last year's, probably before the end of the week. Thank you. You're welcome all right. Many thanks and we have a terrific budget committee. This year we cindy is no longer toiling in the weeds by herself. Roberta bev. Penny has been very active in it. So we're grateful for all of that expertise and interest in a topic that a lot of us would lied over. Mr friedman, I see that your hand is up. Can you I'm gonna, give you a chance to speak, I'm not sure if we've already covered that topic, but I'm gonna give you a minute to speak on this. If that's what you're asking to do? Yes, that is what I'm asking to do mark I'm curious how the community board feels its role to suggest raising taxes and to suggest raising borrowing. What is this have to do with the community board? I know that people like to play as, if they're the legislature. I understand that it's a big thrill, but please I'm asking I'm begging on behalf of the community. Please listen to what your neighbors are asking. Thank you, mr freeman. Thank you, mr freeman. That's plenty on that. The answer is that the community board is charged on the city charter, with commenting on the budget revenue as well as expenses are parts of the city budget, and that's why we are trying to make some sense out of a very difficult situation, and we do listen to our community as you've heard throughout the evening tonight and all the work that's done offline. So I thank you for your comment. I am moving us along on our agenda. The next item on our agenda is a reference to the work on equity, race and ethnicity. That is ongoing. I thank all of you for the contributions you've made about potential ways in which we can work harder on some of that, including the possibility of an event or meeting that is dedicated to that. But meanwhile, many of our committees have done notable work that I want to call out just for a brief moment. In june, both the yel and hhs committees had meetings that were very much focused on the need to infuse issues of race, ethnicity and equity, especially equity in the budget process, as well as other matters that were under discussion. Those were resolutions that you voted on at the july meeting, but we made our work on that known to our council members as a work in progress. Bci is has in the next. The next work on this is an event tomorrow during the day and I'm looking at linda and christian to please give us a few words about the event that's coming up tomorrow and from a bci perspective can is that a good enough setup? That's great! First of all, this is madeline innocent's idea to begin with to reach out to minority owned, and then I and women-owned business businesses some startups some existing, but, as we know, a lot of the minority-owned businesses had a hard time with ppp and getting appropriate loans. We have an incredible panel tomorrow, much good thanks to madeline, but it includes a senior member of a senior officer from ponce bank, which is a community funding bank. We have a prominent attorney real estate and general business attorney and we also have senior members of the diversity committees from sbs and the office of comptroller stringer. So it's an exciting panel. It's an ex an exciting dialogue. There will be granular information about you know, helping small business owners find funding where to find it now why they didn't get it, how they can better get it. So I'm hoping all of you will join us christian. You want to add something, and only that the part of the discussion will be also what they need to do to get that funding. So thank you for that. Incredible that incredible resource that you're gonna provide to the community and tomorrow at noon and by the way kudos for both of your meetings being at during the day when business people can actually focus in on them and join and make use of them. So thank you for that work. I'm gonna move our agenda along. Unless I see an objection. A brief note about committee agendas. I see that it's ten minutes of eight, so I'm not gonna wax eloquent on this. A lot of the committees are doing what we asked you to do, which is to plan your agendas ahead. We're grateful for that. Please remember also to give penny and the district office as much lead time about those agenda items as possible, especially during covid when, when issues seem to cross boundaries, I encourage everybody to do what you always do, perhaps even a little bit more robustly, which is to check in with each other in terms of committees and overlapping jurisdictions. We've had a lot of joint meetings lately, and I think that's terrific, rather transportation and parks and environment had one recently or a couple recently, and I think that is a very effective way to to get all of our work done in the most collaborative way possible, and I'm grateful for that. I renew a thought that came up in the spring that, wherever possible, to draft your resolutions in advance, I'm happy to receive them in advance and to put them up as as screen shares whenever the right time comes, and so I thank you for that and ask that you get that moving along. The next item on our agenda is the full board agenda. I am happy to keep the order in which we've order, which we've been when been operating and the september full board so far seems to be a fairly light agenda. The one modification that I want to suggest is that, while we start with the business session that one of the things that we want to do is hear from our elected officials, but try not to interrupt as much of our other work as possible. So what I'm? What I'm proposing to do is to have a set time and it can be movable depending on the length of our anticipated business agenda when we invite our elected officials to come. I tried that this past month our business agenda kind of went past that time, but it did seem to work a little better and I was just wondering if anybody had any comments or alternatives that they would like us to consider with respect to the full board agenda, so I see roberta's hand and elizabeth's hand, so the two the two chairs before me. So I welcome everyone's input, but certainly yours to kick this off. So I'm gonna go in that order. You'll go first, roberta goes first, then elizabeth we'll go and reverse chronological order. Mark. I think it's. I think it's very important to have the business session first, but I would suggest a little time management that you look at the, which is something I did when I was chair, which is to look at the items figure out what the impact on the community is and allow a certain time frame for each for each item. So you know, if you think one is going to have a bigger block of people that want to speak, then you then you allow, you know, let's say half an hour or 40 minutes. If you think something like bci is going to be a quick vote, you could allow seven or ten minutes to that and then you have a time frame, and you know if it's a minute or two over it's fine, but it seems to work better and then you're at the point where the electives can speak. Thank you and in order to make that work I'll need the input of the committee chairs. Who will be running that part of the meeting and that's a good suggestion, and I will I'll do that for september, although I think we only have three items on the agenda that doesn't mean we can't find something to take our time just the same. But but I'll do my best to follow that good advice, elizabeth you were next and then I see rich robin's hand. So my question is just I know the legislative calendar. I don't know who's actually gonna be back from albany and wanting to show up you know virtually or in person. I guess anyone can do that now. I think that's an important consideration, as you think about when you do the business session versus the sort of government officials. I just have to say mark that, even when you say that we're doing the business session first, we have interrupted our meetings numerous times for public figures to come in and they speak longer than they should. And you know when we had long meetings the last two months we had them. Do that, and you know, I think it's important for you to either you know set it that the business agenda is always going to come first or you're, going to take it month by month. In the case of september, if there's a really light agenda, I have no problem with you. Having the elected officials speak at the beginning of the meeting and tell them they need to be there between 6, 30 and 7 or 7 15, or else you know, that's it like they get a minute afterwards and I know it's hard, but I just think it's been a real disservice to a lot of board members who give up their volunteer time when we have people talking about the same things. Sometimes don't even know what they're talking about when they get on a call- and you know I think it's great to hear from them, but I think it just needs to be structured in a way that can be productive for the board meetings thanks. What I tried to do last month, just for full disclosure, is to push them later into the meeting so that the business session could be concluded. It didn't completely work out, but that was the effort. No, this is not an indictment of you at all. It's more just. We know that when paul like, when elected officials and candidates and people show up at meetings, they're going to want to talk- and it puts an undue burden on you, so anything we can do to set some ground rules beforehand. I think would be again would be amazing if we could do that just to keep everyone on track for the volunteers who don't have to be in a meeting until 11 o'clock at night. I hear you thank you. Rich robbins, you're next yeah, not sure how to do this, but the september full board meeting is still six weeks away from now and I'm sure that there are going to be issues before the community. Just given the crisis that we're in that we're going to want to discuss and likely vote on at the full board meeting, and I'm wondering if it makes sense to have some kind of ad hoc meeting in advance of it or some way of bringing up new business and voting on it on whatever the crisis might be. That comes up in the next six weeks. One thing we could do is have a steering meeting in august or an ad hoc meeting to tee it up. The thing that I'm most concerned about- and this is in response to concerns that were raised by our colleagues on the board- is new business being asked to be voted on without any opportunity for public comment in advance of it, whether it be a committee meeting or what have you and that's a fair criticism. That's a fair, that's, a fair concern, and so and august traditionally is a time in which it's hard to schedule a meeting if there's wi-fi at the beach or wherever folks go on vacation. I suppose it's less challenging this year than in most others. So I am open to that. But only on the report is not until the eighth it's the day after labor day and I'm reluctant to move that, because if we start pushing other meetings later into the month of september, we're going to run into the religious holidays mark, why don't you hold off and see if something comes up or not? That's where I was going to. Thank you roberta, that's exactly where I was going. Let's put a pin in that and come back to it as we need to. I see clary's hand, and let me just go to that. First, I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry! Jay adolph was next and then clary jay. Can you hear me where is? Can you hear me lamar yeah there you go ahead, okay, just a question mark. Have you spoken to our elected officials about a time limit on their remarks at these virtual meetings, a time limit per se? No, I have encouraged them to stick to topics that are relevant to our district and I have asked them to join us at particular times and that doesn't always that's not always advice that I'm taking up on well an observation that our elected officials have multiple avenues of communications and are not limited to community board meetings. They have newsletters, they have town halls, they have open offices where people can communicate with them on a regular basis, and I know it's a bit dicey, poet, sensitive, but in the context, virtual meetings, where now it's so much easier for them to participate because they're around they don't have to travel, etc. I would suggest that you reach out and suggest a a time limit on their remarks, and I agree with elizabeth. We should schedule a time when that's set aside for those remarks and if they don't abide by it, we don't interrupt the proceedings and we limit them to a minute. I hear you, I'm not sure I agree, that's something that we can continue to talk about. I am mindful of two things. One is that this is a key way in which it is a key service that we provide to the community. It is you're right, not the only one, but it is- and I also am mindful that very often, the resolutions that we pass are directed to one or another of them, and if we want them to take us seriously, then I don't know that we do that effectively by putting them on a timer, especially they don't. They don't stay to hear the discussion about the resolutions they in large part. So you know I appreciate, I appreciate what you're saying and I know we need to get their buy-in, but I also think there is a level of we are all volunteers. The folks on this call have given up an evening of their time to be on this call. You know I fully respect all of our public servants and our public officials, but I just I just think there needs to be in this era where we are being overzoomed and over scheduled that there needs to be some limit, or at least some conversation about how these elected officials, when we hear one thing from one person and then the next person talks about exactly the same thing. It's you know again. We want to hear we do want to hear from all of them, but I think there need to be some limits in this new era. That's all, obviously I agree with you. Thank you. Clari is next yeah, just two things, one in terms of when our september meeting is mark. I don't have a calendar in front of me and I'm not where I can readily get one, but you said september 1st. If it is september 1st, it cannot be the day after labor day, because labor day would be the following monday. It is. It is plausible that the first tuesday is september 1st, in which case that's fine. In other years, we likely would have moved our september meeting to the following tuesday, so we were not doing it bef before labor day. We could consider that I don't think it's important this year because we're going to be doing it by zoom from wherever we are anyway, but I just would like to know. Is it really is september first really tuesday, and is tuesday really yet september? 1St is tuesday and tuesday is the date. That's on the website. As of right now cindy you got your hand up yeah, I think. Last night we were told that there's a joint parks and transportation meeting on tuesday september, 8th okay, so that was the day that transportation is clearly the eighth okay. So all right, so the full board is really the first. It's just that it's before labor day, it's not after before the other thing is the other thing that mark mentioned a concern about public input. If we had some issue that we think we want to have a special meeting about, I don't really see that as a problem. If we do the usual blast type of blast, email and if we have at least a reasonable amount of notice, the steering committee is a public meeting. Like any other meeting that we have, and I think we could characterize a an important steering committee meeting and publicize it to the public and get public input. If there's something we think is important enough, that it can't wait yeah we can. We can decide what kind of a meeting we need based on whatever it is. That prompts the need for a meeting. I don't think steering is sort of a fallback, but but it could be either way so mark. Mr freeman has his sign off to talk up about the agenda items. Yes, correct, I'm following up with a comment that elizabeth just made about the importance of community input- and I can tell you, as a member of the community, that the the untidliness lack of agenda, untimeliness and lack of meeting minutes, untimely and lack of resolutions is very off-putting to your community. I've spoken in person to mark about this, so I want to speak to you all so that you can circle your wagons. People want to be included this moaning about why people don't want to be included is very, I don't even want to get into the to what it is it. It's not disingenuous, it's something I can't. I just can't understand. Honestly. I cannot understand why you won't put out an agenda and get input and invite people. You have more experts in this community than anywhere on earth, and yet you start a discussion about education in the dark. You've talked about transportation in the dark. Thank you, mr friedman, that I don't thank you very much appreciate your input. Mark I mean you're talking about borrowing and taxing. How long have you worked them? Have you worked more than 30 years? I mean I don't understand any of this. Mr freeman, we're not going to talk about my background. Thank you very much for your comments. We appreciate your sharing them with us and we're going to move our agenda on the next. The next part of our excuse me. Okay, the next part of our agenda is, is making up for something that we missed at full board. I believe I put it out to the full to all of our colleagues by email, but I want to mention it tonight that at full board in september per our bylaws, we will accept nominations for all board offices. So that's one chair, two vice chairs and two co-secretaries josh cohen, has graciously agreed once again to be our the chair of our elections committee, and I will work with him to populate that committee. Obviously anybody who wants to run for any of those offices- I see you jerry, should not be a member of the elections committee and we will take care of that christian. Go ahead, jose a question. Thinking that we should be doing this remotely. Have we started thinking as to how this boat is going to take the logistics of how we're gonna do the votes wow. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. No. The answer is. I have not given a shred's worth of thought and you're, absolutely right that we need to figure that out. It may be the first time that we have a transparent vote for our officers, or maybe we can get a korea to go around and pick up the boats yeah. They saw a masked socially distant courier service. Thank you. A drone service. You might want to ask me, I know haddadjo about how to do it. Roberto roberta was in outer space and now she's on west 79th street. No, actually I'm on 71st street okay. I thought I should be in the community board instead of out of space. Thank you. So so sorry, you know. Maybe the once you delete your community yeah. Maybe when the election community has formed, they can discuss them on themselves and come up with a proposal. One possibility would be to use a polling function on unsoon to do that, but you know, but the community should be, should be able to talk about it and come up with a system. Okay, I think this brings up the urgent idea of appointing a committee to work with josh yep, we'll get we'll get that done. Thank you so then the only other thing is the review of the full board agenda, which was circulated and essentially has three items on it right now. There's a bci there's, I'm actually not sure what environment yeah there's a pne this and then there are a couple of preservation issues and is there one from transportation? Yes, there is on the 72nd street bike. Lane got it okay, so those are the five items for committees that will be the full board agenda for september 1st and there it is there. It is okay, oh christian, put it up. Thank you. I was wondering how that got there thanks? Okay, so we can. We can end that share. Do we know how controversial the preservation items are? I'm just wondering if we need to switch the agenda order at all between, I don't think transfer the 72nd street is going to be overly controversial, but there are no. I don't believe it. I would never guess, but two of them are pretty straightforward, the other one we haven't heard yet, which is the esplanade 305 that concerns some stuff on the roof. I that you know, I don't know that might take a little bit of time. Yeah okay, looks good to me. Then, okay, all right. Anybody who has any concerns about that. Please email me, hey mark! Yes, sir. The issue that was just brought up earlier about how the votes are going to be handled, I'm assuming will be an issue for all 59 community boards throughout the city. Will the borough have or the borough's legal department gail's legal department have anything to advise us on as a way of doing these things, I'm doing which things I'm sorry recording votes, recording votes for our elections, officers yeah. Yes, I will absolutely check in with rosie who is april and rosie to see if they have confronted this issue. Other boards have held their elections already this year. So that's my first point of contact and and then we'll learn from there. It may be that we have to. We have to do a roll call vote right, which you know, transparency, wise, we've votes are always votes are always available to be reviewed at the board office, but but not announced person by person. If that's what we have to do, that's what we do thanks, okay, and that I think, concludes our agenda unless there's new business that anybody wants to raise. Mr friedman, I'm going to encourage you to use the chat we've heard from you several times this evening, and I think that is where we're going to leave this mark one: a newbie new business. Given the recent problems we had with the having the agendas on the on the website, I just wanted to ask: do we know if there is an issue in terms of like getting the information timely nowadays because of the pandemic, or was that maybe just a logistics issue on having to get adjusted to this new situation and maybe going forward? We won't have that problem. It's a little bit of both. It turns out that today do it shut down completely right, yeah, right yeah! So, and we are, we are always subject to do it. There has been growing pains in terms of getting things coordinated between the district office and do it, which is you know, a function of adapting to working remotely. I have done my best to be in touch with penny, who has been in turn: she's been a terrific resource in trying to navigate these waters and get these things done efficiently. So I'm grateful to penny for all of her support and help. There are things that we would all like to see happen faster, and I will commit to continuing to try to make that happen. Andrew yeah, just because we've had such so many discussions about the importance of getting people back on mass transit and how important that is to the future of our city and our way of life. Just as a fyi today, the department of buses announced an amazing app that can actually let you know how crowded the upcoming bus at your stop will be right. Now, it's available for apple devices. Next month it will be available for android and you can go on to new mta.info or mymga apps and see how crowded your bus is going to be so we're moving in the right direction on getting people to feel more comfortable about getting back in the system, except for those of us who use android yeah. Thanks, I know that the office that you're limited in terms of administrative support, but do you have any ideas to when we may get a new board list? Thank you. I was trying to sort out the committees at the same time so but you're right that it's overdue and I will make sure that happens in the next week. In fact, I'm you can't see me, but I'm writing a note right now. Oh that's right! I can't see you, but you can see me. Thank you. A new board list and a new, updated list of committee members on the website will both be coming. Your way, I'm sorry, I'm hearing different people, who's calling roberta go ahead. The roster of board members on the website is incorrect. Thank you. Hopefully, when we get the correct list done to you, we'll also get it on the website, but thank you a motion to adjourn and have a healthy and safe summer without objection for me, anybody else that good second, third, all right, echo. Third. Fourth, thank you all appreciate your endurance. Well done.
