Oh thanks, hey andrew hi, andrew clary, I got an email today from janice horowitz and she was so thrilled by the parks committee meeting.
So I have to get a green screen because I have what they call a three-year-old camera on my yeah a mask somebody wearing a mask: oh hi, there, sarah all right, hey, sarah hello, cindy, hey cindy hello, hey howard, hey andrew, hey, mark, hey there!
If anything, we want to say as a board with respect to the potential for using outdoor space for schools, you may have seen a piece in the new york times that was published in between the time in which this was put on your agenda and today talking about some of the advantages of this and actually we're counting some interesting history that apparently this was done during the cove, the covid, the spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as well as various bouts with tuberculosis in outbreaks here in new york city in the early 1900s, as well as other times as well.
This was kicked around a little bit at transportation and, I believe also at yel- I'm not certain of that yes say again, ken yes, okay as ways in which to mitigate some of the effects of return to in-person learning, to the extent that we do that, and I don't think we are as a board but I'll, listen.
It seems to me that a letter would be possible leveraging those of statements of our board to then go the next mile and say to the extent that there are plans for in-person education, that they should include the ability to use outdoor spaces, whether they be parks or curbside or plazas or whatever it is, that might be available to each particular school.
So I'd be curious, I see shelley's hand and I'm going to call on you first, but I'd be curious to see, first of all, to hear your thoughts about whether that is a fair leveraging of prior community board statements and, secondly, whether you think that is an appropriate thing for our board to be doing regardless so shelly.
To begin with, this would just, I think, exacerbate that need that need for creating legal, legalistic documents, but I hate to you know, but I think things that we have talked about and had resolutions support, outdoor learning, so rooftops yards playgrounds, but not streets or parks.
Yeah this you know we were able to to build a hospital in central park, pretty much overnight in tents and there's no reason why we can't cordon off streets and sidewalks in front of schools to expand their footprint.
If we can double the number of students able to use classrooms, then we can cut the occupancy of the actual physical rooms in the school in half, and that means more people, more parents who don't have to stay home, which also is a big way, a big help to the economy.
Yes, yes, I think cindy was the next person we were going to go to so go ahead, cindy and then we'll figure it out from there, and this will be one by the way, guys where I see a lot of hands.
I just wanted to disclose that they sit on the board of a funded school that serves 80 some odd children with language-based learning disabilities, so they all have ieps and I've been we've been I've served on the task force about reopening and one of the things that school wanted to inquire of the community board and the council member about was potential use of the street as a type of a play space.
I know that safety is a very valid concern, but I don't feel that the community board should substitute our judgment for that of the administ school administrators as to what's safe and what's not safe, and what can and cannot be done.
So I would, I would definitely endorse sending some kind of letter giving schools as much space, especially outdoor space, which everybody knows is much safer and less likely to help spread the virus so yeah, I'm totally in favor of it.
Yes, I was that's not the only possibility but buddy, but he heated tents or they were set up in the early part of the 20th century when tuberculosis was running, but I see a vast difference between setting up a facility in the park and setting it up on the street, but I just wanted to be clear about what you said shelly I in part I to a great extent agreed with you that setting up a classroom situation curbside would be hardly appropriate.
Yes, okay, I I'm sure all of us have seen the curbside dining facilities, and somebody else mentioned that, and I don't know if any of us are thinking about something comparable to those for classroom.
I think all of our efforts are have married, there's an architect in my office who's working with his kids school in queens, and there are a lot of other factors I mean a tent is great.
I think it's great to write a letter in support and that we would give assistance when called for the specific sites, but I'm kind of with shelly that we're opening up a can of worms here and we don't know all the circumstances- the class size, the kids capacity, what form they're in.
So I want to echo what cindy said, especially in response to shelley and paige and jerry and others is that I don't think we need to be prescriptive.
I think what we want to do is just a blanket, a statement that the doe should be exploring all options, and that includes working with other agencies, especially the dot and also parks and any other agency, to explore any possible space that could expand the amount of space that's available for schools, and I don't think we need to say any more than that and we can trust the doe that they're not going to do something.
I don't think we can, but there are a number of members of our community who are extremely concerned about a number of big questions that haven't been answered, and one thing we might do is just try to raise a list of the most important questions that should be answered extremely quickly, because parents have just the next few weeks before we have to tell the doa whether we're sending our students to school in september or, if we're going, 100 remote and there's a lot of information that we're lacking, that we need to have to be able to make that decision and that's something I think the board might even consider- and I know it's we're getting into august, but we might consider having a town hall just to hear from parents in the next week or so to hear what are those questions and put that out for elected officials and for the doa to hear you know.
So I have a seven-year-old daughter and we did remote schooling from you know mid-march until the end of the year, and while we had a decent experience, it is far short of an in-person experience, and so I do think that anything that we could do to give our schools and the district a chance at getting more kids, giving more kids an in-person school experience would be sort of the best thing that we can do.
Am I still there yeah you're here, yeah I'd like to have an open mind about the streets in front of schools, the adjacent space, but I suspect that between issues of weather and safety and noise and cleanliness that probably those spaces are not going to make it.
Do it without some kind of sanctioning affirmative permission from the parks department, but my concern would be that that would likely lead to inequities where the perhaps the private schools are the ones with the stronger parents, association or the ones with more power or the ones who were more savvy would get there first, they would take the space and because you're not going to have lots of them, even if you have any in our parks, and it would lead to inequities that I think would be a bad thing.
I think what we're talking about is offering schools the greatest possible latitude to provide an education which is more difficult than ever so to the extent we can give them another tool, a closed street.
I'm going next to courtney, followed by stephen yeah I'll, just echo very quickly what I think we're starting to hear, which is that I agree with what cindy and rich and fema and howard all said, and I actually think at the last yl meeting.
What I believe we began talking about was the fact that we as a board do best when we support the decision-making processes and the decisions made by those with the greatest most specific expertise for coming out and making some very specific recommendations so like cindy and rich and fema I'd support a general statement that encourages schools and officials to really think creatively.
While addressing both the opportunities and constraints that are specific to them, whatever those may be, because we don't have the expertise to do that, but I do think that to miss the opportunity to really encourage schools and the officials to think creatively is to really do a disservice to our kids as someone with a young child, the idea of extended distance learning is not exciting to me so anyway, I'd support a general statement like so many others have already mentioned.
I would see us at yale having a very specific meeting and discussing that and having a resolution either in support of the details or against the details, but this is a resolution or a statement just to support the idea- and I can tell you this we're in a time of crisis and the idea that we wouldn't explore something because of things that could happen, but we don't know seems counterproductive to the way I would think about it.
I don't think anyone questions that, but I agree with all the sentiments we need to support a plan to look at every option we have and then those people that are responsible for determining what is safe.
We're talking about a blended model where families that again need to go to work and don't have reliable child care are struggling to think about how they're going to manage their children.
It's going to continue to be difficult, the more children we can get into schools in a safe way, the more equitable our city will be so that I think, is a top priority and you know we need to have space.
I also just wanted to mention, because I wasn't able to join the yell committee, but I know that the district 3 green schools committee had written a statement.
I know you're talking about a letter mark but like are we do we need to vote on that?
I think several board members expressed what I believe, which is that focusing on outdoor space misses a much larger point is that the city should be scrounging around for every available space.
Of course, the resolution I think is out of the question too late, but if we're going to write a letter, I would favor much broader as rich robin said much broader letter, you can mention, as sarah said, closing the streets because that's a specific request in terms of procedure.
I think, given the hour and the fact that our council member is patiently waiting for us that it's time to wrap this up, what I propose to do since I think we all agree that a resolution voted on september- and this is almost the entirety of the point- is that I will draft something in the way of a letter that takes in and is, I was about to say school.
I don't want to speak for you all, but certainly beyond my expertise, and I will circulate that to this group to the steering group and, if that, if that works for everybody, we can either sign on to it as individuals or as a board if we think that there's consensus around that and that it's a fair statement of our previous previous statements.
The agenda item that we want to welcome you to discuss is in part relating to our district needs statement and our work for that, but in turn there is a and I'm going to turn the ball over to cindy cardinal, who is the chair of our of our budget and strategy committee, but to sort of tee it up.
You were obviously one of the members of the budget negotiating committee and we're we're confronting the idea of trying to make recommendations both as to district needs and as the budget priorities with respect to the fiscal year 22 budget, and we were hoping that we would hear from you on any topic about that.
You want to share with us, but especially about the severe budget cuts that we already are experiencing and the ways in which the current fiscal 21 budget was balanced, which may be a one-year one-off and then I'm going to turn it to cindy and follow up on more specifics on that.
That's on this tax and if you're interested, I can talk more about it in terms of the community board's district needs statement.
I don't schools, just don't know whether or not they will need more space.
So I think the department of education feels confident that principals are going to work out a nine to one nine students to one teacher ratio in all the buildings, but so I'm a little less worried about space.
I'm going to ask cindy cardinal, our the chair of our budget committee to sort of jump in here and bring us focus a little bit more in terms of questions.
One of the things that our budget committee was actually talking about was how the list of most pressing issues overall that new york city planning puts out and as far as I know, it's what we're using still this year doesn't have some of the issues I mean you can check other and write in, but affordable housing, yes, is on their schools is on there, but you know maybe issues surrounding racial equity, that's not on their issues surrounding covet 19, supporting small businesses.
So we were kind of discussing that and we were also talking about our goal this year, which is to reach out to organizations outside the board, and I think that goes to europe point helen about cutting beyond the fat.
You know beyond obviously, nurses and social workers and all the schools, affordable housing, I think, was our number one priority last year, great well, you know but funding for food pantries and so that our are creating yeah.
Our committees need to be reaching out to those organizations to say you know to get more specifics and also to have maybe have them advocate as well and include their letters in our district needs statement, which is not something we really did so much last year.
We didn't have so much supporting material, but I think we'd like to include that this year, if we can yeah it's great point and I would reach out to the usual suspects and you know, project find and it's senior centers.
I mean, I think the main point is to the extent the community board could be supportive of the city borrowing and contemplate even a resolution about it and then send it to your state, elected officials.
Given my background at omb and I've done a lot of research on this people, I've written an article about it in the nation, but you know we don't have to go into the details here at all happy to follow up with anyone, yeah, okay, so I'm borrowing to provide basic services.
Okay, thanks mark, I think I'm sort of half on topic in it maybe a little half out, but I'm in topic, because it's about schooling, hi helen.
I know you, don't hey good, to see you, I think, in terms of education.
You know what is the requirement or what is the goal for how much time will actually be spent in remote learning in terms of live, educational teaching and I've asked this to dozens of people and haven't been able to get a single answer.
You know yes, steve you're nailing it you're nailing the problem, and I think I asked the question you just put out there.
So, council member, thank you very much for joining us and for all of that insight and you kind of teed up perfectly the next part of our conversation and I'm gonna, look again at our budget chair cindy cardinal to try to lead us on the next part of it.
What we're going to talk about next is the nitty gritty of getting a district needs statement in order and in place and how we want to go about doing that in timing and so forth.
What needs to be advocated for what is being cut beyond fat, although I know most of them would not think there was any fat already and then we were talking today that we had a committee meeting in terms of preservation preserving what is the last thing that should be cut?
Actually, the question is we will get this ready for you for september, the first week of september, because we always get our dci always has our dna statements on time mark I wanted to ask you: can we have a- and I christian don't hate me, but can we have a meeting a committee meeting in august then so we can go over it with committee?
A lot of committees find that it's more efficient to do this offline, but if you want to have a meeting you absolutely may I don't know christian.
Are we also going to have an opportunity to make suggestions about revenue raising proposals sure, but they will be voted on by the full board, so we could that's something we could put in dns, but not obviously in the budget request, because that's right, so there's got to be a way to include that.
I tried that this past month our business agenda kind of went past that time, but it did seem to work a little better and I was just wondering if anybody had any comments or alternatives that they would like us to consider with respect to the full board agenda, so I see roberta's hand and elizabeth's hand, so the two the two chairs before me.
So you know, if you think one is going to have a bigger block of people that want to speak, then you then you allow, you know, let's say half an hour or 40 minutes.
If you think something like bci is going to be a quick vote, you could allow seven or ten minutes to that and then you have a time frame, and you know if it's a minute or two over it's fine, but it seems to work better and then you're at the point where the electives can speak.
Thank you and in order to make that work I'll need the input of the committee chairs.
Who will be running that part of the meeting and that's a good suggestion, and I will I'll do that for september, although I think we only have three items on the agenda that doesn't mean we can't find something to take our time just the same.
Having the elected officials speak at the beginning of the meeting and tell them they need to be there between 6, 30 and 7 or 7 15, or else you know, that's it like they get a minute afterwards and I know it's hard, but I just think it's been a real disservice to a lot of board members who give up their volunteer time when we have people talking about the same things.
Sometimes don't even know what they're talking about when they get on a call- and you know I think it's great to hear from them, but I think it just needs to be structured in a way that can be productive for the board meetings thanks.
We know that when paul like, when elected officials and candidates and people show up at meetings, they're going to want to talk- and it puts an undue burden on you, so anything we can do to set some ground rules beforehand.
Rich robbins, you're next yeah, not sure how to do this, but the september full board meeting is still six weeks away from now and I'm sure that there are going to be issues before the community.
Just given the crisis that we're in that we're going to want to discuss and likely vote on at the full board meeting, and I'm wondering if it makes sense to have some kind of ad hoc meeting in advance of it or some way of bringing up new business and voting on it on whatever the crisis might be.
Clari is next yeah, just two things, one in terms of when our september meeting is mark.
We could consider that I don't think it's important this year because we're going to be doing it by zoom from wherever we are anyway, but I just would like to know.
As of right now cindy you got your hand up yeah, I think.
I'm just wondering if we need to switch the agenda order at all between, I don't think transfer the 72nd street is going to be overly controversial, but there are no.
If that's what we have to do, that's what we do thanks, okay, and that I think, concludes our agenda unless there's new business that anybody wants to raise.
Given the recent problems we had with the having the agendas on the on the website, I just wanted to ask: do we know if there is an issue in terms of like getting the information timely nowadays because of the pandemic, or was that maybe just a logistics issue on having to get adjusted to this new situation and maybe going forward?
Thanks, I know that the office that you're limited in terms of administrative support, but do you have any ideas to when we may get a new board list?
