We wanted to meet so we could really work with another restaurant to help them out so make sure that they didn't have to wait until september.
He has a he's: the owner of a kosher restaurant over on the east side in the 40s on 46th street, that he's owned for a number of years now called barnea, bistro sort of standard kosher restaurant with with reasonable closing hours that garnered a great deal of of acclaim and he's looking to do something new he's, not sure yet whether this restaurant's gonna be kosher or not, he's leaning toward towards not kosher, but the food concept he's very clear on and that's gonna be small plate, tapa style food, the restaurant's going to be called bonito and, as was shown on the the application that he submitted very reasonable.
You know restaurant method of operation, we're talking about 35 to 45 seats, reasonable closing hours for your neighborhood recorded background music.
Only fellini does have a licensed sidewalk cafe, and so we are also going to have a licensed sidewalk cafe once sidewalk yeah once the city is doing sidewalk cafes again and the temporary covered stuff is over and so we're both here and we're happy to answer any questions that the committee may have great.
We have two items after this new business and I love your input and we- and I think everybody has a lot of opinions and there's a lot going on in our neighborhood.
We have to think first, let's vote on this folks, so all in favor, if you can place your hands on the participants area, please the committee members first paul.
The next discussion actually might be interesting for you we're going to talk about the sweat law, that's being resurrected by our state assembly, woman, linda rosenthal, and- and we find this from the perspective the restaurant's really egregious, especially it's always been egregious.
You want to weigh in here and talk about it from the perspective of a restaurant, an owner I mean I've said before.
That was the discussion, and we wanted to know if everybody was on board with that doug you you're dealing with this firsthand, I mean with your clients.
I think, okay, thank you so so the issue is that there are people that would take advantage of this and could use the employees and I'm not I'm.
The issue is: will people use this as undo leverage to almost for lack of a better term extort an owner into you know putting a lien on someone's personal assets and homes when otherwise they have some protection through a corporate veil and force?
What we're talking about is a letter coming from the business and consumer issues, committee of community board, seven saying that we are very much against it if we're very much against it, which is why we're having this discussion.
Okay, we have to be a little careful about a letter that looks like it's coming from cb7.
Let's work toward that and yeah absolutely and everybody will have a chance to review and as always what we do on this committee is everybody participates and we do it in tandem and everybody and we incorporate everyone's edits and we will send it to you, of course, as we always do, but the language will be coming from the business and consumer issues, maybe okay, rover and then michelle after yeah.
This is it's an alarming letter kind of draconian, but I really think it's a it's a shot before the bow and it's a warning in these difficult times and it's a warning to unscrupulous restaurant owners and the abuse of employees, and if we consider the history of restaurant workers over the years, you have to take into account that these scenarios are very real possibilities.
If what george is saying, I'm going to have a look at the law just for my interest, I'm supporting the committee, but I think if you're talking about the manager candy, no, that you know no, but I'm just I'm just making the point that I understand the deterrence factor and but I agree with the committee's outrage and that the committee should send a nice letter so I'll get it that's so nice, okay, who else wanted to speak peter and then david how's that peter?
So I would actually like to see a bill that if an employee sues you and they lose the case, they pay your legal fees and I guarantee there won't be as many if you're going to be punitive to the owner.
This would never happen, but to me it would level the field and it would save many restaurants, a lot of heartache to say like if you're, okay, if you're bringing a false case and you lose you're gonna end up paying the fees.
This is an oversimplification and I'm not an attorney, but I would be delighted with a bill that eventually would put a lien on an owner who has egregiously offended and broken laws by not paying their employees and it was proven in court and then possibly there would be some liability, personal liability that makes pierce the corporate veil, but not until such time that it was proven and yeah and if you're going to walk away from your liabilities, especially with regard to wages, which is a major no-no.
I'd be okay with that, but just because you know people have to be innocent until they're proven guilty, and the fact is that there are a lot of litigious employees and there are many more employees than there are owners and the and it's not as much the employees, but many of the attorneys and again not trying to attorneys.
If everybody on our committee is in agreement that we can draft a letter from business and consumer issues, we got a an ii here, then I will doug with you and christian, and I work on the letter in the language and then everybody can we'll do that I'll get this going!
That seems to be the most difficult one, but the belt player we've got those issues too, but primarily the lucerne is the one that's affecting our restaurants, the most because we've got we we're getting reports of aggressive panhandlers, which is which obviously is discouraging diners on the street, and so we've got some issues and it's not you know, and we want it's not that we are a native, a community.
The drug deal go down on saturday, so on broadway in 79, so we've got some issues, so I think again we're going to write a letter.
This is an issue where I think that, to the extent that the community board seven speaks at all, it needs to speak with one voice and we're not in a position to do that right now.
So as soon as we learned about this, which was after it was a done deal as I think everybody knows, we set to work trying to address the issues as they came up, we're losing you mark, I'm sorry say again: we lost you there for a moment.
Oh okay, I didn't lose you, so I so thanks for letting me know.
We've been working with the nypd to try to enlist their help, especially with respect to things like drug dealing, and some of the answers are not the answers that you'd want to hear the nypd that there is private security, that is, that is contracted by the service providers.
Essentially, if, if they don't see a drug deal with evidence right in front of them, there's nothing they can do either, and I mean like seeing it across the street is not good enough.
One is contemplating a communication by email using our email blast to the wider community to try to share some of these things as well, not because this is going to be the information that everybody wants to hear, but because we should be sharing it and then in part because well and then the question is whether I hold or we hold a a specific meeting about this with the community at large and while, on the one hand, I don't want anybody tagging cb7 to say that we are the authors of any of these discussions or decisions.
As far as I know, he wasn't a resident in a shelter anywhere else either there have been some incidents of aggressive behavior in our restaurants and you're right to be concerned about that aggressive panhandling, almost isn't the right word, because it sounds nice, and this is accosting people in a very challenging way.
One of the things that we were given to understand in the early going was that, because these hotels, let's face it, they're much nicer properties to live in than some of the places that these folks are used to in terms of shelter, it would be a lever to say that they needed to behave in a way that you know we would hope for our community, but it is emerging that active drug use, for example, is not a disqualifying event with respect to the shelters.
I think that we ought to hold a meeting, even though I am wary of doing so, and the reason is that we're not the author of these decisions, I am I'm not confident that dhs would show up to a general community meeting where an awful lot of the angriest voices will be heard.
It is absolutely the case that these hotels are near schools and they are near residential neighbors, and I got to tell you that the lawyer-like answer that was given that you know that only the registered sex offenders who were allowed to be near there are near there.
You know you can hear the conflict in my voice too, because I want to be compassionate and I want to be appropriate, but I also want to have the right answer for our community and it doesn't appear as though anyone is owning the predictable collateral consequences of these actions.
In some sense, even though I don't know that there's anything we can do with that information, I think it's still important for us to set to hear firsthand as much as we can.
I mean this meeting could go on for 18 hours, so I'm not gonna, I'm not going to agree to that and we're going to hear things that are going to be hard to hear, but I still think that there's.
I also think that if we don't hold such a meeting, then come september 1st, with our next full board meeting we're going to hear it anyway, and then we will be dealing both with the issue of whatever folks are saying and the fact that they feel aggrieved by the fact that we didn't give them enough an opportunity to speak before that.
So if people concerned about issues they should bring it up with their elected officials, and you know question why there was no process with the community and that the services hardly can be provided properly to 283 people at the lucerne 288 people at the belclair, but that that's not the resident's fault.
But if we're going to have a community meeting, I think that we can have the two precincts and manhattan north commander come and speak.
I think it's important that the community board has some type of forum before september comes because people expect it.
The last thing I want to say is: there are two issues here: two major issues: there are street homeless, which we've had for a long time and the numbers have increased and then there's the shelter people and to distinguish who's doing what is very difficult for most people, there's also the third group and that's the ordinary person who's doing something wrong.
So well, I said a lot, but I think we have to be mindful of the broader situation who's responsible for it and it's not the homeless people who are brought up from other shelters who are responsible for the fact that they're there and the fact that they do not have they can't get their services properly in this highly concentrated, overloaded hotel situation.
I will try to let me just interject, because steve brown has his hand, please with the discussion that he and I had earlier, and I had suggested that hhs and yell because they deal with families, and it was you know and pertinent to them that they write a letter, because bci's focus had to do with the local businesses that are so challenged right now.
That's why I suggested other committees, but I think you know, and also because we don't have a meeting this month.
This was the bci meeting that had been called as an emergency in order to address an application, and then we discuss this, but I'm going to call on steve brown now, because I know that you want to discuss this too yeah well I'll, be I'll, be kind of straightforward and simple in hopes of anticipation of a further meeting and to linda's point at yale.
You know around the pedophiles around walking in certain areas around youth, but I I'm not sure if mark had made a final decision, but we've had some dialogue and I would actually ask if we had a broader meeting.
So I'm going to formally request and or support that meeting and if that does so, then I think it would be much more impactful on that level.
So I will just make a different comment and I think the challenge that I see with government in particular dhs, is their methodology and way they do things, and it's become clear to me that vhs, I believe, looks at things in a capacity issue, but not a community appropriate issue and we've seen it ravage a very successful women's shelter on the upper west side, and it was probably because some algorithm came forward that sort of made sense to do this and as a as we listened to the government, we listened to the mayor's office.
So I'll just leave it at that, but I think that we should be communicating to dhs that the upper west side welcomes people that need help, but we want them appropriate.
If you want to continue to do this, then you need to work with us and get the right area.
That would be my a major theme of what I think should be going out to the community to the people into new york city.
Barbara yeah, I don't think there's anybody in our community who has not given this very serious thought people have questions concerns people are upset.
I don't understand why selected people were invited and I frankly I don't think it makes sense to have this meeting now for a very selected group of people on bci when everybody from cb7- and I can't tell you how many calls I have gotten from people who want.
So you know, and so it's a missed opportunity as shelly was talking about, but I don't think anybody dropped the ball.
What who the right people are to bring to that meeting I mean I would love for it to be dhs, but I have no hope as shelly was saying, I have no hope that they'll engage on that level.
There is, and then there's also a need for having a little bit of experience so that we can, I mean, obviously the experience has been troubling, but there was a need for a need for a basis of information, we're now getting to a point where I think we have that and if I was interpreted before as demonizing the shelter clients or demonizing the folks who are in need, I apologize for speaking badly because that wasn't the last thing that I intended to do while acknowledging that there are difficult circumstances to deal with and trying to make that better.
You know these are like really ridiculous issues again: systemic that are just hamstringing us even more in a very difficult situation, and I just want to I you know- there's been a lot said about writing letters or having meetings.
The new stand guys, you know what do they want?
You know for all sorts of criminal activities and also another thing at the 79th street block association meeting gail brewer herself announced that dhs was supposed to provide us with at least four of its own police officers, who have the authority to make arrests.
We may not get to the right people at all, and you know more and more time is passing as september comes more and more families are going to move back into the city.
Somebody talked about it and this is my backyard, but you know what I've been having conversations with people who come into work in my backyard, like the woman who takes care of the 77th street playground on amsterdam, you should go talk to her about how she was harassed and literally chased out of the playground in tears by some man who came in to use the bathroom to just clean himself up from top to bottom.
I don't know if everyone did that when they applied I'm a relatively newish member in the group here, but but it seems to me that if we could all sound sort of pollyanna, but if we could all get together as many people as possible, even if a lot of them are angry and let everyone be heard, then we can perhaps all work together to make sure that we all have some input in this and that's what I would hope for is that we would have a meeting that that, ideally, the community board would take a leadership role on setting up.
The board was divided on whether or not that was a good idea, but still we held the meetings and we let people be heard.
I've got a lot of family stuff going on, but this issue is really important.
I feel so much for the restaurant owners and the business owners that this is like the thing they didn't need.
On top of all of it and madeline, you did raise this months ago not weeks ago, and I think it really is it's a time to really for the community board to step up and set up some sort of meeting.
But at this point I think the consensus I'm hearing from this meeting is that we know about what we're gonna know so now's the time so and if that's something that well anyway.
I mean I'm still obviously conflicted about a number of things that we've that have been said and but I'll try to deal with that in a more productive way than this.
Thanks mark, I think I think, susan's everybody's, you know we hear everyone's frustration.
We have one more thing: we're going to talk to david honor because he's a restaurateur who's dealing with a different issue about his seating, and I took some photos that we'll put up now if we want to see fred's open.
If I could just real quick in the interest of open meetings, I think it would have been really useful to have it on the agenda with a better description of what it was going to be, so that more people could have been involved.
You know in all my conversations with mark he's been very kind and supportive of when we've talked about and empathetic to these people and if it came across wrong, I wanted to be a second person to defend him and not have him defend himself and in all my conversations he has always been willing to listen and evolve his position.
I think the biggest thing to focus on is now that it looks like we're going to have a meeting, so you know it's to make these decisions is never easy and- and I just wanted to take a moment to say that I thank you steve, thank you for before we go.
So a lot of things that the government will do the city will do they're going to be doing them without consultation, as we saw and as it already has happened, and I think the best opportunity we have to be able to have any anything positive come out is to have that work that working group going so that the working group, if the working group is established, it will be a means of communication between dhs, the the service providers and the community and and, as we know, mark is working on that.
We've got a lot of families up here and a lot of kids and a number of people with mental health issues and the whole system needs to be looked at and we need to support our local providers and maintain some contact with them so that they hear what we're seeing also so just feeling like that would be a real help right now.
Thank you also before we go I'd like to congratulate peter on the open, amsterdam students on saturday for for restaurants to be on the street between 97th and 110th, and there were some issues, but I'm sure that going forward that things can be can improve will probably continue to be some issues, but thank you for coming out christian.
