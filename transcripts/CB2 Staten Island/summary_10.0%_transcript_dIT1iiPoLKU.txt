We go good all right, so I want to thank everybody for coming to community board to second regular monthly meeting Tuesday June 16th, it's our second virtual meeting, zoom and so far so good and use the raise hand function if you'd like to speak.
Let me just thank everybody for coming to this meeting like we'll be doing this for a while until we got our marching orders and, in effect that's how we're going to function going forward so until further notice, one of you to be supposed I don't have too many points to bring to everybody's attention.
Jack Bogle and Sal general base are the more members Thank You, Sal and Jax is not here, but if we get notify, we will let everybody know if you guys won.
Every branch could to be eight total branches separated amongst Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx we're looking at two right now on Staten Island I, don't know which two at this point, they're true they're, still trying to figure out what buildings would be conducive to social distancing.
Overall, the plan is to use the branches that are opening as like test cases, and if it's successful the system that's being set up, they will open more branches in a second phase.
We are reopening, we are preparing and trying to keep the branches as safe as possible for both the staff and the patrons when they do come into the branch and I could take any questions, even no problems.
All right, I said it three times already, but I think that might be the end of the public session.
Next up, we have a presentation from Department of Parks and Recreation they're, going to present a new design for dying and playground walks you're up all right.
So I mentioned before on Dave McConnell I'm with a director for New York City Parks Department, and this is a little change of pace, we're looking to life beyond life beyond pandemics, and we are designing donggeun playground very excited about it.
Jordan Weber's on the line here, she's the project manager in the designer we spend a lot of time looking at the park, understanding the flooding, that's in the neighborhood understanding the physics that are in there to give you something: that's gonna function and and and be safe and be resilient.
So with that I'm gonna hand it over to Jordan and let her go through the presentation and I hope you guys like it.
The project is scheduled for completion for next January 2021, so the goals of the project are to basically increase the play capacity within the park, while also mitigating the flood issues that are currently on site, as well as providing programs for people of all ages and abilities so as I'm sure you're familiar.
This is our proposed plan along Duncan Hills Avenue, we're keeping site access fairly open, how it is now just expanding some of the planting beds back where the game tables used to sit, we're putting in synthetic turf and moving some game tables over to the center of the park.
There are only bucket swings on site, so we're adding some strap, swings and accessible swings and then keeping some nice open circulation through the space, so we're raising all the elevations bringing everything up out of the floodplain and we're also going to be integrating some below-grade things to help mitigate flatus use as well.
For the big kids- and this is a look at the synthetic turf area, so we're raising what was once sunken up to basically flat level so that we are meeting the planting beds they're in an aerial view.
If, if you wanted cameras, that's perhaps we could go down I, don't know that you needed here, it's just something that we typically as a minimum, that we would recommend if they, if you have to come back to the border and some concurrence or some support for us that that's one of the items, you're gonna correspondent, you have a lot of street grade or below street great homes.
Jordan, yes, okay, so the end of this week we'll be submitting this to the public design, commission, and so for that we hope.
Yes, I'm still here, Donald ERISA from New, York, City, Comptroller, sorceress office, I'm, just gonna, be very brief to move everything away like a minute I promise to you 60 seconds, maybe even less you know: we've been working on over the land.
Okay, all right any other issues before we get to our feature presentation so I want to make sure and and the host.
That's seven days a week, we switch down to two days a week for our co-ed meetings, but we still were meeting individually and the purposes of all of these meetings was to get University, Hospital, Rumsey, the nursing homes and everyone to work together to be able to deal with some of the challenges that were facing Staten Island in particular, dealing with koban, so that you understand the nursing home landscape.
It essentially walked in the front doors with our visitors and with our staff, and while the at first nursing homes I think we're a bit resistance to taking COBIT positive patients from hospitals.
The governor signed an executive order stating that nursing homes would not be able to use the Kovach status of a patient as a means to refuse admission to the nursing homes, so the admissions had to be sort of coded blinded.
There are challenges on a weekly basis in getting eyes shields and and sometimes simply gloves, and so our incident command would try to work and share contacts such and such a pharmacy was willing to provide supplies at a discounted rate to nursing homes, and so we were trying to send out information and share information about accessing PE accessing support staff.
They made a concerted front to the governor, and it was one of the rare times that there was an exception subsequently made to an executive order, and that was to allow nursing access to the same medications that were used in the hospital if they had the facilities to be able to administer them.
So things like oral medications that were being used in hospitals were then able to be used in nursing homes, and this was a significant success win for the nursing homes of Staten Island.
Furthermore, we were an integral part of the movement of patients from being impatient to stabilization and then being able to go home, and we found there was a bottleneck because char's or community health agencies visiting their service Visiting Nurse Association northwell were at first resistant to taking the cases at discharge because they didn't have their own PPE for their own nurses, who would be going out in the field.
Our greatest density of positive cases occurred very much in the beginning when I believe there was a lot of cross contamination from visitors still coming in from staff moving from facility to facility, and then somebody had on a political basis had criticized the governor about the rate of nursing home illness with kovat, and he turned his eye and really sort of started to take on the nursing homes and another thing one's I think felt that he really declared war on them.
Best majority of this loss is because there's no rehab business, the rehab patients who are able to leave early in the outbreak all left and we just have losses of patients on long-term care to the k√∂ppen virus, and we don't have new admissions coming in.
Yes, some of that will eventually be paid back under FEMA, but I'll point out that for superstorm sandy there is still you know, outstanding FEMA creditors on Staten Island, so I don't see that this is going to really help them with their cash flow issues in the next year or two.
By having this very tight group meeting on a regular basis, really tried to push out a lot of information and pushing to the nursing homes had its challenges.
We all worked very closely together to try to get antibody testing done in the nursing homes on Staten Island, and this was really a push that I had because I think that population testing would really allow us to cohort patients appropriately in the nursing homes by this I mean that patients who had either tested positive or would all be together.
Those who demonstrated no exposure to coded could be protected in different wings of the nursing homes and based on the size that one has and the physical plant one could then allow for appropriate cohorting of residents, so that really was sort of at the cornerstone of what I wanted to do at Egger as the rehab patients will quickly discharged.
We took over one of those rehab floors on the second floor and designated that as a co-ed positive-only unit, and this really helped us to be successful in isolating kovat within the nursing home.
I had weekly meetings with my medical staff and with consultants who are in the nursing home to be able to share information about the status in the nursing home, share thoughts on difficult to manage cases and also share our collective experience in our offices and in the hospitals, and bring that to us, for instance, the identification of one components of Kovan 19 being the thromboembolic feature of the disease patients who have the disease, it seems that after they, initially stabilized when they later within in the second week of the illness, start to crash, it's usually coming from inflammation and thrombosis.
Looking at the cases per 1,000 of nursing home residents, with positive diagnosis of kovat and per 1000 in New York, there were 98 similar in Pennsylvania with 94 in New Jersey, which is a much smaller state.
We have really been able to tightly control people who are positive for kovat coming in contact with our patients when the test is done appropriately to check for pcr and the RNA virus by nasal swab.
We also have done antibody testing on patients and staff, so we know who has been exposed in the past and that has helped us to do our internal cohorting as well I'm, looking to take this opportunity of the summer when things are a little quieter to really get us prepared for the next wave.
Right now, we are forced to use a private lab because the public facilities are still only supporting the hospitals and and one less thing about nursing homes as an important piece of a continuum of care.
I would point out that the nursing homes that have accepted Kovac positive patients on Staten Island can only speak to that experience have successfully discharged patients after rehabilitating them so that they could go home after they had succumbed to their Kovach 19 illness.
If the nursing homes had not accepted those early patients, the successful decanting of the hospitals so that they could handle the cases that they dealt with I, just don't think that that would have occurred.
Well, I think for our first phase, I think Staten Island has done really well social distancing, I, don't think, can stop right now, I think we still need to use our masks.
I think that meetings like this will continue to be the norm for a while, but the good news is that our hospitalization rates are low.
Do they currently believe that if you've had the Coben, you are not going to catch it again and if so, are they using people who have already recovered from corona to treat patients and like the facility?
The other arm, interestingly, is for exposure for persons who are in nursing homes, so if you've been exposed but you're not sick, when convalescent plasma prevents you from coming down with the illness, so there are studies occurring and, and some of them may be enough.
Okay, I have a script so I'm, just gonna read it and everybody just has to be patient.
Do you guys have business again, I don't know when, but the next meeting will be in September, so I just wanted to thank everybody, as always we'll be reachable and that's it.
It's been a number of years and I think they need to be looked at and possibly some changes made yeah.
Second motion to adjourn all right: Jerry I knew it I had it down, and thank you very much.
