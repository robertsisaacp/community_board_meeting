Everybody is in good health and I mean that from the bottom of my heart, as far as the netiquette and the other kiss for tonight's meeting, it's the same as if we were in the board office at the Brielle, nearly different series, as the host mentioned.
I just wanted everybody to know that, most importantly, probably one of the most important things that I mentioned tonight, I just wanted to acknowledge the passing of an Trinity.
Correct Debbie right Jerry that she, the longest member we have on the board, as you know, and always sat next to me and asked me questions about things and explained everything on how to get through the meeting and connected to history.
What do we need to know, especially all the notices from notifying New York City and the endless information that she provided to us to keep us safe, Debbie I just want to publicly acknowledge and thank you for all of the work that you've done when with Cheryl as well.
Thank you, I want to thank all board matters for your continuing dedication and understanding of working with us and getting us to this point tonight.
Please let W know by email, we'll try to work out everything for the next meeting, which will be the last minute for FY 2010.
There are enormous number of links to everything in the city and everything we need to know that you can pass on to people that you may know and need some help about something, but it does have its it's quite comprehensive and it's quite current and thanks aper and Debbie truck keeping all of that up to date.
So it's our representative or she's here, hi everyone, it's great to see all of you via zoom and I, look forward to the day we can be together again, I hope you and your families are healthy and safe and I just wanted to take a few minutes to update you, because there's been a lot of obviously transition over the period of time that we've been unable to see each other and by the way, usually I'm in session on a day like this, and so maybe this is a way that we can join you in the future when we're in Albany, and so we could still stay in touch.
With regards to phase one you're, probably hearing from business owners you're hearing from people that would you want to get back to work and I know it's.
So with that, I wanted to also add that you know we continue to do what we can to just help people get by at this time, so whether it be the PPE or unemployment, or you know, food drives I'm working closely with the Kiwanis Club, as well as the Verrazano Kiwanis Club, as well as Miss Richmond County outstanding teen, Angela who's.
As many of you know, the Staten Island downtown Alliance has been opposing a homeless shelter anywhere on Staten Island number one, because we have a thousand people identified homeless, and so that could be taken care of with permanent housing and number two is we just approved a B Street corridor rezoning, which would be provide plenty of opportunity for affordable housing in the North Shore close to all of transit, so the downtown Alliance has said no to any homeless shelter on Staten Island period, but in particular with this site.
We recognize that this site should not only not be used for children and women who win is supposed to serve on the shelter site, but it should not be used for habitation at all, and so we are stating- and we have enlisted other civics and the community board one in the area and asked for letters of support to some environmental remediation to reject the application if it is for the purpose of a residential development of any kind.
So I know they noticed because tomorrow is the deadline for comments were notified because, as we went out asking for people to reject this application so again, I'm here to say to ask individuals if you would please, if you would please consider saying that you noticed, but if you could just get in any commentary focused on the environment, I'd appreciate it.
So before we I comment on Leticia statements want to make sure there aren't any other public speakers or elected officials, don't want to speak and then I'll come back till the teachers position and the weekend hi.
I know for all of you, but it is great that we're able to gather virtually for what seems to be the foreseeable future for now, but some quick things we really have been honing in on a lot of various issues, whether it relates to food insecurity, analyzing data on frontline workers to help inform those who make policy in our city and state to drive various legislation and whatnot.
It's just a central location where you can get as much information as possible from every single level of government, and we know that information is changing rapidly and it's been a fantastic resource that we have had up for almost two months now, one of the major things that we actually just did was we launched a formal investigation into the city's preparedness and response to the pandemic, and we basically at this point just requested documents received, created or issued by city, government officials and agencies related to the public emergency.
You know there definitely will be more on that, and the last thing I want to touch on quickly is our city's budget, which is immensely important and is going to probably be one of the most consequential budgets that were going to be going through in recent history and the mayor released.
We fundamentally need federal aid in the city in an estate, as do many of the cities and states across the country to get through this, but we don't know if that's gonna happen and lastly, is the peg program, which is more or less trimming fat at City agencies, and we believe right now that the mayor's executive budget does not do enough of that, and we need a lot more of that.
So we do not know what that final product is going to look like, but we expect to be in a much more severe financial situation over the next coming weeks and months as this pandemic progresses.
It is definitely a very challenging time financially for the city and for a lot of people across the city, and we will wait to see ultimately with the council and the mayor come to an agreement on and I will, of course, be more than happy to come back and provide updates on how that progresses and whatnot, but I definitely appreciate the time questions comments, concerns I'll, definitely take them, but I'm glad to see everyone here and glad everyone is doing well, thus far.
Our Commission has been doing web seminars every Tuesday, giving the public elected officials and community boards, as well as a community partners, information along with no updates on the agency, things that we implementing as far as making changes and then gladly taken concerns that are coming up from them.
Those sites have to apply for a certificate or authorization that has to be posted on the on the job site, letting you know they and there's a map on our website as well.
And then we come back to us again right, yeah I, just you know, I think beefsteak Charlie's was beer and wine that was in the 70s.
These things I mean you know by the time we get them attorneys they come down.
You know we can take this conversation of the firm yeah, okay, Thank You Jerry, but the borough Commission of want to know about this I mean maybe something I can get more than where it may be.
Okay, maybe he left all right, we'll just he'll just have to read our transmission after in the public record, all right all right, so that closes out this issue when these applications come through and it goes through.
Did you hear the discussion we that we ensued between I appreciated, so God thank God I'm a board member and I can get to you people and we can kind of understand these things as they work out.
Okay, I want to applaud everybody for that, but I don't know what that does for us for Juicy Lucy, because all the things he promised us and nothing I know that I know that Robert, but would not you know they can promise everything in the world, but that doesn't mean that it becomes true.
I understand you, but I want you and the rest of the board and the public to understand that when Debbie, when we get these things, we take them serious.
Please raise your hand and let the hosts know so we can discuss and address okay, all right so before we go to new business.
Be you know in the position for chair is now closed.
Thank you, everybody, okay, any other nomination or election stuff that we have to do correctly.
Okay, all right, let me go back to the agenda because it looks why believe it or not went down to any new business.
I just want to thank everyone and know that I take your confidence to heart and I always do the best for this community and the people of Staten, Island and I.
Okay, it looks big agenda, but I think we're up to new business, but before we do that one more time for new business is there anyone that didn't get a chance to say something and the board that wants to say something and raise your hands.
