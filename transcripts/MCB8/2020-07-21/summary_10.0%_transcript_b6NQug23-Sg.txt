This is the health senior social services committee, which also includes a criminal justice or when one chair left alita, asked.
I did speak to people and write to people, and people contacted us and sent information, so I think we'll start with the last part of it, which is criminal justice, because I know that's what billy is interested in well.
Can we think about a role in addressing public safety and criminal justice, issues?
So I'd like to see us do that, and I think, given that we have the word health in our committee and that we have a public safety component.
I, know people through my son who work who worked at Rikers on issues with worked at Rikers on with rather sort of Probably the wrong word, but prisoners, and I think that getting a sort of perspective on what that what the criminal justice system means to the accused, is, I, think, very important, and I- think that that's part of what we ought to be looking at.
That's, I think, of a committee with overarching ideas within the particular parts, And I'm afraid when we get into the other areas besides criminal justice, that we can, I mean, maybe we'll create 15 months in a year rather than just 12, because right, I don't know I Could it be bail, reform and defunding, or certainly defunding, and talking about other avenues for a pal program or youth program or a community watch program, or something like that?
Budget, for example, I was just going to say: I thought the contact tracing series went really well, especially because you know each meeting was focused kind of on a different issue And Then the one where we wanted resolution.
Yet these fascinating people that go to bed thinking about things like this, there's a kind of role for the overarching committee, and maybe the issues that were sort of sort of we've immediately zoomed in on which have to do with criminal justice, essentially might not be the most important for this particular committee that this particular committee might be able to focus more or should focus more Can focus.
I, don't know what the right word is on something like health, equity, that the problems that rich people have better access to healthcare, and so how do we?
Absolutely get health care in the same way that the housing committee has to really dedicate themselves to thinking about housing, equity , well, I think pretty much what we discussed before the question that we're talking about all these issues about bail reform and all that, whether it should be an overarching committee or a small committee- And I think that it should be a smaller committee, because if you put bell reform- and you put issues like criminal justice and other things together under that that those issues It, does anybody on the committee or that's on the phone.?
And I think perhaps the idea of having like a big forum where we could get a lot of people to talk about criminal, the criminal justice system.
I know you want to come up with that with a resolution on this, but it may be that we need to plan for a big event to bring in a lot of people.
Tell me if you disagree, but it doesn't mean that members of the committee can't that we can't have two meetings one month where other people sort of take it over and do things with.
I mean I agree, but I also found just based on working on the contact tracing series that having working groups that aren't as committee dependent if you're very focused and interested in one issue, could be a good use.
As far as september is concerned, I think that the primary overarching issue is going to be what's happening with the schools, because that is an incredible incredibly large and impactful decision, because you know parents have to deal with.
Could you make a subcommittee that go back and to look into the timing and some of the people that might speak on some of the social service, juvenile criminal culpability issues, because august is a lousy month, regardless of pandemic?
I actually think that merrill is right that you know the committee can do preparations in august and then have speakers lined up for september.
I there are a number of community boards that are actually meeting in august, even though they generally don't because of things starting up again and issues that are really crucial.
This is the first thing of health by the way just to get through with seniors, I mean, I think.
I, don't know what just what people think of that issue.
Only thing I was against was an unnarrowed focus on a specific area of health care, but no In fact, I asked sarah if she would be able to help us with it, and she said she does have people from.
We have to make sure that we're looking at some of the other issues involved, right, and I, think we can get people to do that.
I think we need to look at the changes in medicaid because it is disproportionately affecting people of you know.
The people need right, So well, would that fit in, because I would like to focus on the fact that this is a a committee for racial injustice that we're talking about today.
If there is a second wave, more people will lose their jobs, so I think the committee would be doing the public a huge service.
You could have a session on finding insurance and how you do it, regardless of whether your old young, rich poor, but it's paramount on people , I think it's very important, because I I'm having a problem at high school september, 33 at new york hospital, because nobody, I'm getting my doctors- I know those are at those hospitals of the stupid school hospital.
This conversation underscores the issue here that there's a big problem about lack of information, This idea of just what sarah chu said, the idea of committee about our health care and how it has to change and the what's.
Are you talking about it, because elita asked us to focus on issues, I, think privilege and healthcare and equity, because we're a little unmuted, and I want to keep doing.
In a month, we had the small business care program, every other week, so we're going to go to what they're interested in And I'm, not saying medicaid couldn't be part of a discussion, but I personally feel that what sarah wrote was just such an important thing and that would be sort of a big meeting.
One other issue that I think elite was, in my conversations with you And, that's public health.
You know that that's where they make their money and since the copic thing, not only are they not doing those, but people are afraid to go to a hospital now because they don't want to be exposed.
It is basically like city md in their hospital and Is that if you go to city md with a bad stomach ache- And they think you have an appendicitis, they then send you to the hospital here They would you're in the hospital Well, you know, I, think the main point of this meeting was to just kind of brainstorm, especially about issues related to racial equity and because I know we had talked about in the fall doing something on seniors and mental health.
It's also a racial equity issue, because a lot of seniors who have more money, have access to private, health, insurance and private therapists and private ways of dealing with with the quarantine, even like having access to technology and being able to facetime their relatives and their friends and being able to watch nightly opera streams or look at museums or find access through other mechanisms of staying in touch with people.
It's like a 50-hour week of working on that not anymore so much barbara, Because, they're, really much shorter You don't have to look around because, even if you know people can zoom in, they don't have to travel right.
