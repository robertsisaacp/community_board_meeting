and I think that billy's notion of having meetings that have someone from the da's office, someone as from the public defender's office I, know people through my son who work who worked at Rikers on issues with worked at Rikers on with rather sort of Probably the wrong word, but prisoners and I think that getting a sort of perspective on what that what the criminal justice system means to the accused is I think very important and I think that that's part of what we ought to be looking at Certainly on this committee and certainly in the larger committee as well.
, That's, I, think of a committee with overarching ideas within the particular parts and I'm afraid when we get into the other areas besides criminal justice that we can I mean maybe we'll create 15 months in a year rather than just 12, because right I, don't know.
You know it's just more meetings and if we're only planning to do it through this committee and have one meeting a month, it's going to take a long time to get to whatever the end goal is We want to treat it almost like the contact tracing series where we have several events in more rapid fashion, then I think it makes more sense but I'm open to dragging it out a little bit longer.
You can do 45 minutes on bail reform in 45 minutes on the police budget, for example, I was just going to say: I thought the contact tracing series went really well, especially because you know each meeting was focused kind of on a different issue and then the one where we wanted resolution I think we could actually get a lot done and maybe work with the other committee too, which I see has an overlap and maybe see what role they have I admit.
Yet these fascinating people that go to bed thinking about things like this there's a kind of role for the overarching committee, and maybe the issues that were sort of sort of we've immediately zoomed in on which have to do with criminal justice, essentially might not be the most important for this particular committee that this particular committee might be able to focus more or should focus more, can focus more I , don't know what the right word is on something like health equity, that the problems that rich people have better access to healthcare, and so how do we?
Equity well, I think pretty much what we discussed before the question that we're talking about all these issues about bail reform and all that, whether it should be an overarching committee or a small, committee- and I think that it should be a smaller committee, because if you put bell reform- and you put issues like criminal justice and other things together under that that those issues It, does anybody on the committee or that's on the phone will is shelby from the from the council members office Is the funding mean and what should be funded?
Does anybody not agree with me because, knowing that we may be playing for 12 months here, but we have 24 months worth of issues and I think perhaps the idea of having like a big forum where we could get a lot of people to talk about criminal, the criminal justice system.
I know you want to come up with that with a resolution on this, but it may be that we need to plan for a big event to bring in a lot of people all right.
, it's also health Could you make a subcommittee that go back and to look into the timing and some of the people that might speak on some of the social service, juvenile criminal culpability issues, because august is a lousy month, regardless of pandemic?
and I mean meryl is our new second public member with ellen palovey the youth, education and libraries committee is actually I believe in conjunction with keith powers office having a meeting on monday with representatives from DOE on the reopening of schools in the fall As far as far as what the DOE knows, hang those things are illegal and you're not supposed to be on the sidewalk on those I want to hear you yelling at somebody without a mask.
This is the first thing of health by the way just to get through with seniors, I mean I think that one meeting really should be on a model of nursing homes and specifically I guess, if we're doing racial justice with the public hospitals, what went wrong?
I don't know if we want to read What sarah wrote, which is more, the moral and the ethical questions and the real reality questions about linking healthcare to employment during this term kovid and health crises So, it's a different focus , I think we need to step to the side away from the new york health act and really address what sarah talked about, because that's much broader In one day thousands of people lost their job.
The people need right so well would that fit in, because I would like to focus on the fact that this is a a committee for racial injustice that we're talking about today.
Do you do have lots of topics and actually, if you have an overarching theme, such as health, equities or insurance, or which is part of health equities or something you can have, if you want to do it as forums as hour-long, webinars or something you could do multiple ones In a month, we had the small business care program every other week, so we're going to go to what they're interested in and I'm not saying medicaid couldn't be part of a discussion, but I personally feel that what sarah wrote was just such an important thing and that would be sort of a big meeting forum.
Maybe there's way more implicit bias in the health care system than we as opposed to new york hospital with a private doctor, Could I say something here, because maternal mortality ought to be something with the women and families committee It feels like because it's women So, if you guys want to talk to each other and that's another way of doing more forums, is to combine with other committees, like you did yesterday last night on the contact racing and the other the previous weeks as well, and that's public health, In fact when I was talking to dr long's assistant, either this morning or yesterday about the contact racing I said and she asked what hospitals are in our district, so public hospitals are essential, I, don't know if it's a nursing home, it's a long-term care , it's different than jacoby and elmhurst Yes, but the public hospitals have been trying hard They have money problems, I think they will be essential, but they're talking about more community health, centers Also to deal with more equity until we get some change, I think that could be an important topic to talk about.
You know, optional procedures, and you know things that aren't necessarily you know for your health, You know that that's where they make their money and since the copic thing, not only are they not doing those, but people are afraid to go to a hospital now because they don't want to be exposed and I don't know if getting rid of their emergency rooms would help only because the emergency rooms they still do get reimbursement from the insurance companies and then, if they admit people to the hospital, then they have a patient You know I think the main point of this meeting was to just kind of brainstorm, especially about issues related to racial equity and because I know we had talked about in the fall doing something on seniors and mental health during the time of quarantine.
Could I just say something rebecca about the mental health for seniors I'm very pessimistic about this about a second surge and another lockdown, or something like a lockdown that be our meeting this month, but based on the conversation we had at land use, we thought it was important to show that you know we're putting our money where our mouth is and not wasting time to focus on these concerns, but seniors It's also a racial equity issue, because a lot of seniors who have more money, have access to private health, insurance and private therapists and private ways of dealing with with the quarantine, even like having access to technology and being able to facetime their relatives and their friends and being able to watch nightly opera streams or look at museums or find access through other mechanisms of staying in touch with people While.
That would seem to have some significance, as especially with the merger potentially of more virus and more people staying at home again, and we don't know about their health care It's, all part of the same thing to me, but if you want to zero more in on the on the racial issues by all means, go ahead.
