This is the health senior Social Services Committee, which also includes a criminal justice or when one chair left Alita, asked.
I'll call it my committee, I apologize, yeah, To pay attention to all these issues, and obviously health, seniors and social services is a real, is a real logical place and criminal justice and criminal justice.
I did speak to people and write to people, and people contacted us and sent information, so I think we'll start with the last part of it, which is criminal justice, because I know that's what billy is interested in well.
Can we think about a role in addressing public safety and criminal justice, issues?
I. Think a lot of people do not even you know, start from that.
We could have a whole event on the New York City Police, Department, Budget, and I do not have a problem with doing those things, but what my email, says- I think we could really drive a larger conversation.
So I'd like to see us do that, and I think, given that we have the word health in our committee and that we have a public safety, component, I think we're well situated to do.
I, know people through my son who work who worked at Rikers on issues with worked at Rikers, on with rather sort of the most at- risk, mentally at- risk prisoners, probably the wrong word, but prisoners, and I think that getting a sort of perspective on what that what the criminal justice system means to the accused, is, I, think, very important, and I.
That's, I think, of a committee with overarching ideas within the particular parts, And I'm afraid when we get into the other areas besides criminal justice, that we can, I mean, maybe we'll create 15 months in a year rather than just 12, because right, Could it be bail, reform and defunding, or certainly defunding, and talking about other avenues for a pal program or youth program or a community watch program, or something like that?
You know it's just more meetings and if we're only planning to do it through this committee and have one meeting a month, it's going to take a long time to get to whatever the end goal.
I was just going to say: I thought the contact tracing series went really well, especially because you know each meeting was focused kind of on a different issue And Then the one where we wanted resolution.
Yet these fascinating people that go to bed thinking about things like this, there's a kind of role for the overarching committee, and maybe the issues that were sort of sort of we've immediately zoomed in on which have to do with criminal justice, essentially might not be the most important for this particular committee that this particular committee might be able to focus more or should focus more Can focus.
I do not know what the right word is on something like health, equity, that the problems that rich people have better access to healthcare, and so how do we?
Because, knowing that we may be playing for 12 months here, but we have 24 months worth of issues, and And I think perhaps the idea of having like a big forum where we could get a lot of people to talk about criminal, the criminal justice system.
I know you want to come up with that with a resolution on this, but it may be that we need to plan for a big event to bring in a lot of people.
Tell me if you disagree, but it does not mean that members of the committee can't that we can't have two meetings one month where other people sort of take it over and do things with.
I mean I agree, but I also found just based on working on the contact tracing series that having working groups that are not as committee dependent if you're very focused and interested in one issue, could be a good use.
You are the committee that we spoke about at the last meeting right when we had the big like what are we going to do?
I feel that while we're waiting in September as they expected a peak to happen around then- And also, there are a lot of people that are all around or even if they're, at a different part of New, York, Upstate or whatever I think it's very important that anybody have ideas about how we can not be so afraid for September October November.
I think that the primary overarching issue is going to be what's happening with the schools, because that is an incredible incredibly large and impactful decision, because you know parents have to deal with.
I actually think that merrill is right that you know the committee can do preparations in August and then have speakers lined up for September.
This is the first thing of health by the way just to get through with seniors, I mean, I think.
I do not know what just what people think of that issue.
I've encouraged the two committees to work together because you're looking at it from different points of view, and so that's If. You want to work together, that's fine, but it's not a question of either everyone paying or everyone going, or only about people going on to Medicaid.
The only thing I was against was an unnarrowed focus on a specific area of health care, but no In fact, I asked Sarah if she would be able to help us with it, and she said she does have people from.
I think we all know somebody who lost their job And, what's happening to their health.
I think we need to look at the changes in Medicaid because it is disproportionately affecting people of you know.
For me that sounds good, because I know that I can find people to talk to the idea of racial injustice in the Medicaid system.
Finally, like many of the New York doctors- do not want to take it, which is you know, I understand, because they're not going to get not going to make money, but This conversation.
One other issue that I think Elite was, in my conversations with you And, that's public health.
You know that that's where they make their money and since the copic thing, not only are they not doing those, but people are afraid to go to a hospital now because they do not want to be exposed.
Think the main point of this meeting was to just kind of brainstorm, especially about issues related to racial equity and because I know we had talked about in the fall doing something on seniors and mental health during the time of Quarantine.
It's also a racial equity issue, because a lot of seniors who have more money, have access to private, health, insurance and private therapists and private ways of dealing with with the quarantine, even like having access to technology and being able to facetime their relatives and their friends and being able to watch nightly Opera streams or look at museums or find access through other mechanisms of staying in touch with people.
You know I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep it, but I'm, seeing people in various ways.
You know I want to do the criminal justice part of it or that type of thing.
