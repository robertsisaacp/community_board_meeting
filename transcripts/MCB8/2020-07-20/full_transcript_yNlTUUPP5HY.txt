Okay, all right do we want to get started, get started. Okay, thank you. Okay, hi, I'm Elita Camp, I'm chair of Community Board, eight welcome to the third and community board. Aids contact chasing series. Doctors have been telling us how important taste, testing and tracing is to stay healthy, to be able to go to our restaurants and stores to keep our jobs countries credit their success in controlling the coronavirus, to the extent that they have on testing and tracing as the weeks since New York City's reopening have gone by we've seen a lot of changes in information and even in whether businesses can reopen. There have been a few constants, though, in addition to wearing a mask social distancing, washing our hands and not touching our faces. We've been told that testing and tracing are essential to controlling the virus. Cb8 wants every new yorker to remain healthy, every store and office to remain open and those places like sports arenas and museums and theaters that are still closed to open. We ask that everyone participate in New, York's, test and trace program for yourselves, your friends and family and neighbors your favorite businesses and everyone else in the city, I'm thrilled to introduce Dr, Ted long, executive director of the test and trace corps at New, York, City's, health and hospitals. He will first explain why testing and tracing matters so much. Then you will answer questions. Dr long is vice president of ambulatory care at New, York, City, Health and hospitals, the largest public health care system in the U.S, providing health care services to over one million new yorkers he's been transforming hnh into an efficient and health care network that provides care to all new yorkers. He also runs New York City care, a program to guarantee access to health care for uninsured New, York City residents prior to making h a vital resource for everyone residing in New York Dr Long ran 20 federal health care programs and before that he ran the Rhode Island Department of Health he's also a doctor practicing primary care and a faculty member at the Yale and Harvard Medical schools we're very fortunate to have Dr long available. To answer questions about contact, tracing Russell, squire, a cba member and co- chair of Cba's environment and sanitation, Committee is our moderator. If you'd like to ask questions, please raise your virtual hand. You'll find it under the participants menu. Everyone will be muted until Russell calls on you to ask your question when you're finished speaking, you'll be muted again after everyone who has a question has been able to ask it. You may ask another question: we want to be sure everyone with a question gets an answer. Please keep your questions under a minute. We want to answer as many as possible and we'll provide contact information for Dr long if you have additional questions or would like more information after the program, I'd like to turn it over to Russell now Russell. Thank you. Thank you Alita. So I just wanted to give a little bit of brief context here for this meeting before we hear from Dr long. So this is the third meeting that the Community board has had related to contact tracing. This has been a joint effort from a number of folks. First of all, two committees, the health seniors and Social Services, Committee co- chaired by Barbara, Rudder, Lori, Boris and rebecca dangore, and also the environment and sanitation Committee that Kaz Spagnaletti and I co- chair as well as Sarah Chu and may malik and elita we've sort of been. You know, working together on these contact tracing meetings and the first one that we did was a Q&A session and we had a number of questions sort of left over from that one. We thought it'd be helpful to to have another session where the public could get a chance to ask questions and members of the board could ask questions that they have about the contact tracing program and so with that, let's turn it over to Dr Ted long. Who can tell us a little bit about the the program? Hi great. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you, okay, wonderful! Well, I first wanted to say thank you everybody for your time tonight on in the evening to listen to me and to hear about our contact tracing program. I won't. I know that you're very familiar with this, so I won't go into great detail about what contact tracing is or some of that background. But I do want to give a little bit of a backdrop to how we've structured our program here just to make sure that we're all on the same page, because if you take one thing away from me here today, it's that our program, all of the work we've put in, is only as strong as everybody in New York City. That participates in the program and our tracers themselves. This is very much a local effort and it will only be as successful as we're able to work together. So I hope that by the end of this I can gain your trust in the program and if we call you that you'll pick up the phone and want to be part of the work we're doing together to suppress Covid-19 so there's three ways that we want to suppress the coronavirus in New, York City. Three things we must do, we must do together and they follow sequentially. The first thing that, as a city we must do is we must do a lot of testing for coronavirus if we do not test enough people and do not find people that are positive, we can't trace them and we can't figure out who we need to help to offer services to. So I'm proud to say that since we conceptualized how we wanted to approach testing in New York City, this was a couple of months ago. Now, we've actually tripled the number of tests that we're doing. We were doing around 10,000 tests per day, we're now testing 30,000 new yorkers every single day, we're leaving the country and testing no question, I'm proud of that. I'm proud of it in particular, because it's something that I did not do it's something that every new yorker that comes out to get tested to keep their neighbors safe to figure out if they have something that could be contagious. That's what's driving this and the time all of the new Yorkers or all of us, Yorkers are putting in that's. What's allowing us to do so many tests and that's a key way that we're keeping each other safe so as we test and as we figure out who has the coronavirus the next second thing we must do together is: we must figure out for those that are infected? Who did they potentially infect as well? In other words, who do they expose as contacts and that's what contact tracing is so contact tracing is talking to people newly diagnosed and figuring out how we can reach out to people that are high risk for having been exposed to the coronavirus. Our team of more than 3,000 tracers calls every single new case and talks to them and then figures out with them who the contacts are that we then need to track down, in other words, who the people that are in New York City now that are at risk for having been exposed are, and how can we get through to them, and how can we then bring them in for testing and then how can we give them what they need to be successful in getting through this, because, if you've been exposed to the coronavirus, it can take up to 14 days for the virus to present itself, we call that a 14 day, incubation period so, if you've been exposed, we want you to stay home for 14 days without running the risk of exposing others to the coronavirus. But then the third part of our program is, after we've tested a lot of people figured out. Who is at risk for having been exposed? What can we then do to help you, I'm a doctor, and my patients tell me all the time when I diagnose them with Coronavirus. The reaction first is: oh, that's the virus I've heard about in the news. I think it's good we're getting the word out about what coronavirus is, but their next question is well. What am I supposed to do now? I live with my immunocompromised family member. I live with my grandmother. I live with my kids. Am I exposing them to the coronavirus, and I also have to work to support my family? What am I supposed to pragmatically do so? What we've done in terms of the third pillar of the program is we want to do everything in our power to help new Yorkers meet them where they are and get help them to get through this together? So, for example, thousands of new Yorkers, more than a third of all the people in our program, have told us that they can't do this alone. They need help they're telling they tell our tracers as part of our contact tracing operation. So what we've done is we've created a new role called a resource navigator, which is where we pair new yorkers up with things like food delivery, help with medications even help with things like. If you have an eviction threat or if your employer is saying that they're going to fire you if you're staying at home and quarantine, which is the right thing for New York City, which, by the way they can't do state law precludes them from doing that. But I hear from my patients that's unacceptable, so our resource navigators work through all of that with my patients and with everybody in New, York City. So it's important to us that we give new yorkers a way to get through this and do not just say you know, you're diagnosed with the coronavirus and there's nothing. We could do to help you there's a lot. We can do to help you and for thousands of new Yorkers, I'm proud to say, we've been able to help so far. So I actually I'll be brief, but I really am here to listen today and to answer your questions, so I can actually I'll pause there and happy to go into any more detail about what contact tracing is what you can expect from us, our team, our contact, tracers or take us any direction. That would be helpful. I'm at your disposal, thank you, Dr long, so I'm going to just start off with. I have some questions that I'll ask that you know some of us have put together and then you know we'll also as it's going on. If other folks who are on the meeting have questions, you know, raise your hand and you'll be acknowledged and you'll be able to ask your questions. I just want to emphasize. As Elita said, you know, we want to make sure that we have a chance to hear from everybody. So if you do have a question, please do keep it to to one minute, but let me just start off here and ask just sort of a basic question. You know what questions do. Contact tracers ask when they call you in the course of contact tracing- and I guess, are there different questions that you get as a contact or you know compared to questions that you might get as somebody who's tested, positive, great question. So I'll walk you through it. So let's say that you came to one of our more than 50 health and hospitals testing sites. By the way we have more than 200 testing sites, acrosss New, York City you come in. You have a test, that's positive, regardless of where you had it. All of those tests go up to a state database and then we draw from those and that those are the people that we call for the program with our contact. Tracers important, to note it's agnostic to where you had the test done. All of the results come in the same way. So what we do is we call you first thing we say is: are you okay? Are you having symptoms? Do you need help we have if you do need help, we have our Covid-19 hotline, which we stood up at the peak of the crisis, where we can pair you with the Clinician instantaneously, so we're there to help you clinically in any way that we can once we've asked you about your symptoms and once we're make sure that you're safe, where you are at home, and everything like that from from the perspective of if you're, feeling, okay and able to continue the interview, we then go in and ask you questions about who you've been in contact with and where you might have been so who you've been in contact with we defined for you, one of the one of the definitions is somebody that you've been within six feet of for more than 10 minutes. So, if you've just been in the elevator with somebody, fortunately there's very low risk of transmitting the virus. We know from multiple studies that the criteria of six feet for 10 minutes is. Is that where we really confer is much greater risk for you? We also ask you, if you've been to certain settings, for example, we've asked, we ask you if you've been to certain gatherings in certain types of facilities like either congregate settings like a nursing, home or healthcare facility, and that gives us a sense of where you may have exposed others and what your what your profile looks like. Then we go on in the interview to ask you if you need help, so we ask if you need things like food delivery, any other services we can provide, and if you do, we pair you up with one of our resource navigators. So by the time you're off of the phone call with us. We've talked about your symptoms to make sure you're okay, and we can pair you up with a clinician. If not we've asked you about people, contacts or people or gatherings where you may have been to exposed others or to have exposed others, and we ask you what we can do to help worthy of mention. Not every other place asks acrosss. The country asks what they can do to help it's a big priority for us, though, in New York City. We really want the we want to do everything in our power to help new Yorkers get through this together. So that's we're proud that our program is really strongly emphasizing that. So I want to pick up on that. That's another question that I have so the assistance that the city provides and resource navigators and that kind of thing you know: we've heard that you know if you are in a situation where you live with other people, and you can't isolate from them that the city will put you up in a hotel. You know you've mentioned assistance with getting food. I I've heard also that there's assistance with things like having your dog walked, and I think all of that makes a lot of sense, but it almost sounds too good to be true, and so I'm wondering if you can provide basically if there are statistics about how many folks have been helped in this way, to kind of make it more real for people and also just other information about the mechanics of how that sort of assistance is provided to sort of reassure people that is there and they do have these resources available. So I'm going to walk you through. This is actually something that I've walked. My patients through, because in New York City, one of the challenges is a lot of us- do live with other people and if you share a bedroom in a bathroom with multiple other people, it's hard to avoid, potentially exposing them to you when you're infectious, especially the sharing the bathroom issue. So the way it works is if you can't safely self- separate to keep your family members safe at home. We will pick you up at your apartment. We will free of charge we'll drive. You to our hotel free of charge, we'll give you free pajamas when you walk through the door and the entire stay, including being medically monitored, is free of charge and free of charge will give you meals as well. I appreciate your compliment. It does sound like it could be too good to be true, but it is 100. True, we've thought about this very carefully and we're proud to be able to offer this. Your second part of your question was who's. Taking us up on this. You know I'll tell you, the hotels have been people have been interested in them, but far and away what we offer. People at home. Thousands of new Yorkers have taken us up on this so far, so new yorkers vote with their feet. So definitely people are preferring the option of having us offer services at home. But if you want us to drive you to a hotel because you feel more comfortable there and we'll give you free meals, free pajamas and have a nurse chicken on you, that's on the table as well. You so I see Barbara has a question Barbara Rudder! So, let's I meet Barbara, you may just have to confirm. Thank you. Thank you. So much you do hear me now right. Yes, okay, great! Thank you so much. I do have a question about the contact person, so you said 10 minutes, and so, if I'm walking with somebody outdoors is that that's considered a contact. Also, if I'm with somebody 10 minutes- and you can't be six feet apart- that's that would be a contact. I do not understand the timing to me. This would be very difficult. So if somebody was just walking with me but feeling fine and then they have to quarantine for 14 days, that is a lot am. I right is not there a chance to take a test earlier than that, so that they can see if they're negative and make it less than 14 days, or is the timing not possible to do that, so I'm going to use my words carefully here for you. So if you are walking next to somebody that has coronavirus so you've been exposed to them and the virus in your body can take 14 days to present itself. It's actually not very common for it to present on day 14, but we've seen it so. The reason 14 days is, I know it's annoying, because it's two weeks is a long time. But if you got tested on day, 10 is nothing to say that you could not on day 14 develop the virus, because the incubation period can be up to two weeks. That's why getting tested is important because, if you're positive, we want to know that now because then we watch for your symptoms and we want to then figure out who you've exposed to the virus if you're positive, but a negative result before 14 days does not tell you that you're definitively not going to develop it on day 14, because the incubation period can be a full two weeks, but I do think of timing. So if somebody gets sick they get tested, it may be three days before they get the test result. So that is not part of the 14 days. That's I just the math, but I guess you're asking people to please stay isolating now. Are they allowed to go out and do grocery shopping with a mask, or do you mean they have to stay home, a contact person, not a sick person, but a contact person, who's feeling? Fine? We do want you to stay home. We make certain exceptions, of course, and actually one of them is to see me at the doctor, but if grocery delivery is the reason why you might have to leave your house, which you're right is the number one reason we're told people have to leave, their houses will deliver food for you for asking that and wearing the mask or not wearing the mask. If I walk with somebody and we're both wearing a mask, does that alleviate the problem or it does not make a difference as far as you're concerned with the contact tracing it definitely makes a difference, but it's not a hundred percent. Okay. You've answered my questions. Thank you so much. I hope I do not walk with anybody that gets sick. Elena has a question lita. You are unmuted, so you can go ahead. Thank you. I meet myself on my phone, so Dr long. We know that a lot of people are asymptomatic and yet still transmitting the virus. So let's say John is with Susie. John is sick. Susie has now been traced and is quarantining for 14 days. If she shows no symptoms, does someone come in and test her any time during that period to see whether the people in her family have been exposed to the virus? How do you know whether she actually has been infected or not? Thank you so, if somebody's exposed to somebody with the coronavirus, the first part of your question, if I can add on a little bit a couple extra layers there is, when do you typically show symptoms of coronavirus if you've contracted it? The answer is around days four to seven. So it's I do not know if we've ever seen a case where somebody contracted it from some somebody with the coronavirus and on day one they showed symptoms. It takes a few days for the coronavirus to have that effect on your body, so what we say is best to get tested and we do want in your situation that the person that was exposed to get tested, but if you can best to wait at least several days, because that's the window when most people, if they did contract it, are going to have a positive test result and or are going to have symptoms. If you get tested on day four, we still do. Ask you if you've been exposed to complete your quarantine for two weeks again, because if you may be one of those people that it's going to take 10 days for the virus to present itself and day, 4 would not predict what's going to happen on day 10.. So we do. I know it is two weeks is a long time, but we do in that situation. Ask for you to remain quarantined from your family, but in your case the other, the third layer of what you're saying is if you've been exposed and you're quarantining at home, meaning you have not had symptoms yet, but you're in that two week window. Would we then test your family members? We would rather have the emphasis be to have you safely separate from your family members to limit the risk that if you are contagious, that you'd give it to them. So we do not consider them contacts. We do not bring that. We do not call them to bring them in for testing the, but the final thing I'll say is in New York City and I'm proud of this we're one of the only cities in the country and the large city, of course, but we're the largest city anyways to have universal testing. You can come to any of our sites regardless of symptoms. If you're worried and we'll test, you can come to any of my health and hospitals, 50 plus sites. Do it tomorrow morning, we'll test you we're not going to we'll never turn anybody away. Other cities and states have restricted who they test. We welcome everybody because a lot of times people are worried that they may have had an exposure. Even if it's not technically the amount of time, and we want to support you so come in and get tested anytime and just to follow up on that quickly are those tests are free. Is that right? Yes, very important point: the tests are free. We will, if you're, if you have insurance bill your insurance, but not a penny to you all right. I see that cars has a question. Yes, so I test positive, you call me you're the doctor or you're the contact tracer. You call me, I tell you oh I was I was with Joe the other night, but at the same time I was with his whole family when you call the per that person what happens to the whole family, if there was say two adults and two children do they gets quarantine, isolation, the two children, the two adults, and how does that work? Yes, that's a real world. It's a real world example. The answer is yes to everything. You said. Yes, we call the family, yes, they all need to quarantine. What we tend to hear is that, especially in that scenario, if you're, if you're live in a smaller apartment, it can be impossible to have everybody stay away from everybody else. So what we do is in our hotel rooms. We have adjoining rooms, things like that. So in that situation the hotel might actually be an easier option than trying to make it work at home, though, if you can make it work at home, we'll do everything in our power to support you, including food delivery. Okay, the my follow- up on that is contact tracing, so I test positive. The results do not get to you for two three days by the time you contact the person it's another two three days. Sometimes they do not answer, so it could end up being a week or two weeks before you contact everybody. Then you call the contact the person. They basically give you some information. That may not be the whole information, so it takes a lot of time. So will digital contact tracing be anytime soon and would not that speed up the process instantaneous rather than a week or two down the road great question? So there's two parts to the first part of your question: there's two different time frames you laid out, so I want to talk about each of them and then I'll talk about the digital piece, the part around it. Let's say if it takes two days or so to get your test result back, the digital piece won't solve. That is what it is and that's, and it's nationally we're having trouble with this. As other cities, you know, unfortunately, are going through what we went through in April, so that piece is something we're working on, but that that's to decide for your question. The second piece is so once we have the result back from you. How long will it take before you hear from a contact tracer? The answer is we're our goal and actually about 85 or so percent of the time. Now for people we have phone numbers for. Actually, I think, that's that was 86, we're actually calling you within 24 hours and reaching you within 24 hours. Wow. It's not easy. I mean I've. It's been years of my life taking to make this this program work, but I think we're doing a good job and our goal is really to do exactly what you said to meet the challenge of getting through to everybody within 24 hours, to the greatest extent that we can so the digital piece is an interesting one, and this is something we've thought a lot about. My view on this is that digital adjuncts can always be helpful, but do not replace the person- to- person conversation where and you know. Quite frankly, this is sensitive stuff. If I'm asking you, if you've potentially exposed people, you love to a virus that could hurt them. It's not my expectation that you'd be forthcoming and immediately say. Oh, these are all the people I may have exposed. I think it's a hard thing to talk about, especially with other diseases. We've seen that this is not something that's easy for, nor should it be easy for people to talk about. So in our tracers are all new yorkers. These are not people from they've never been to New York before or you know, do not understand what it's been like for us here. Our program is all for by new Yorkers for new Yorkers, and I believe that if I'm talking as a new yorker talking to you, I'm going to be more likely to get information that is sensitive from you than you'd be than you would put into an app. So our contention here is that having new yorkers really do this for other new Yorkers is going to get us better information than you'd be willing to not it's not 100 times. Maybe certain people would be fine entering anything into an app, but our view is, in general, we're going to get better information if we have new yorkers talking to other new yorkers. Okay. Thank you. So I see Tanisha Rag has her hand up hi Dr long. How are you I am from marymount Manhattan college and I'm just curious to know if you have any advice for schools or institutions of higher education about you know, classroom settings and how the best way to handle classroom settings if there is in fact a positive case, classroom or dorm settings. Also, I was wondering whether or not there is you know, plans for a specific tracer to be, or maybe a team of tracers to be assigned to schools- or you know oh yeah, those are finished but you're dead on oh good and also on also on that note testing for institutions of higher learning in the works. Everything you just said is in the works: yeah you're, yeah you're. I grew. I agree with the sentiment of everything you're saying we will and plan to and will have dedicated teams for different types of settings for sure, because that way we can really figure out what's going on in different settings in terms of price and that's what orange do in terms of pragmatically around your point of what can higher education settings do I just want to really drive this point home nothing's 100, but it makes a big difference if you're wearing a mask and if you are socially separating more than six feet apart. If everybody- and you know quite frankly in New York City now we have the lowest number of cases that we've had since this whole thing started, and that is you know, new yorkers have earned this. You go outside many of our communities mike what I've done. My count is 90:95 of new Yorkers are wearing masks and anybody can contradict me if you have a different experience, but I'm always, you know overwhelmed with pride, seeing new yorkers really, you know inconveniencing themselves to take care of everybody else and to keep everybody else safe when you're in the settings that you're talking about it's even more important to be wearing masks. So if there's any one thing you take away from me, it's for sure that we're in masks and maintaining a distance of six feet is not just words. It really makes a big difference, but beyond that, if there is transmission, we're doing everything that you just said and we're going to be calling institutions if there are clusters of cases things like that for sure I totally agree with you. So let me ask a quick follow- up to that which was related to a question. We got online, which relates to schools. You know not higher education, but just elementary and high schools, and that kind of thing you know, is there a plan to have contact tracing in place for those, and is there a specific sort of school- oriented plan that you guys are looking at if the schools reopen yep we're formulating our overall school plan now, so specifics will be shared by the mayor soon about that, it's a. I can't tell you how many hours today I spent on that issue. It's a it's a complicated one, but extremely important, and please know there's not a snippet of thought, that's being not used towards making sure that we have the best possible plans for schools. The first part of your question I just want to emphasize too, though, is that contact tracing for any setting is up and running now. So the way the program works is it? Will it catches every case in every setting? What the next step is, as Tanisha was saying, is we want to we're also going to have dedicated teams and we're going to be formulating. Policies like how we're going to have our overall schools plan in concert with everything else, we're doing with contact tracing so more to come on that, but we're going to have something very comprehensive. That's going to be put out soon: okay, just another quick follow- up before we go back to folks with their hands raised just about institutional contact tracing. There was a question about nursing homes, and I know those have been particular areas of Covid-19 spread and that kind of thing- and so are there particular things that you're doing around nursing homes for contact tracing, yeah, so nursing homes. I sort of said this quickly earlier, but I'll I'll make more of a point of it. Now. Nursing homes are something we refer to as congregate settings where people are inherently living in very close proximity of each other and, needless to say, as you're to the point that you're making there are very high risks because you just have people that are very close to each other. So we have a very important tool in our tool belt for congregate settings. That tool is. We have one of the best public health departments in the whole world, if not the best, not just in our country in the whole world, and I'm serious about that dohmh or our city. Department of Health is a pro at this and they're leveraging the totality of their resources towards congregate, settings understanding. That is one of the higher risk types of scenarios, so you're completely right and identifying. That is something where we need to pay extra attention and just know that you have the best of the best on it as we speak. Thank you all right, lori's had her hand up for a while. So let's unmute Laurie, okay, you're, okay, all right! Thank you. Thank you. Dr long, I really appreciate the information, so I had a test about. I do not know three weeks ago, maybe four and it was negative and but you know I'm living my life and like today. This morning I went to the doctor and then I went for a few errands around town. I went to a I went to a place and I got a massage. You know because I was under stress, so my question is like how you know. How often should I get tested I mean. Is it? Is it something that I should do you know once a month I mean I just. I do not know what the protocol is yeah great question, so the first thing I'll say is that we do based on our universal testing policy. As a city, you can come and get a free test at one of our more than 200 locations whenever you want so just to be clear, it's that the ball is in your court. We just have an open invitation and offer that we've extended to you that you could take us up on as early and often as you like. We want to make sure that you always feel supported by us. That means a lot in terms of the specifics of how often should you as an individual, get tested. It depends a little bit on your job. It depends a little bit on on your occupation, in other words, or it depends on if you're going to be, if you believe, you've been exposed or you're going to be, for example, visiting family members. So one of our recommendations is, if you are going to visit like an elderly family member who we know Coronavirus might. Unfortunately, people that are older, with comorbidities have a more severe reaction to the coronavirus if you're worried about potentially being contagious to a family member, but you feel fine come and get tested before you visit your family member, it's a safe thing to do, and it's something again that we want to offer to you. So we have in our health advisory notes notice, I believe, number 18 from the city. Health Department include more specifics, which maybe we can circulate to this group after this. That goes into a little bit more detail about some of those scenarios where we identify you know: hey here's where you might want to consider coming to get getting tested again, even if you've been tested even recently. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome, Rebecca hi. Thank you so much for coming. I have one question: do you believe that contact racing should participation in contact tracing should remain voluntary? Why am I not yeah my view on this? Is that I think we're doing a good job if we can earn people's trust and convince them on a voluntary basis that they I want people to want to be a part of this program again. Other programs, like this in other cities, have not taken the step that we have to offer them a huge amount of resources to help people to get through this, with their families to be able to stay at home or to be able to go to a hotel. That was a creative idea that we that we came up with. So our my view on this. In our view on this is definitely that we want to earn your trust, and we believe that, if you believe in the program, you're going to tell us be more likely to tell us more people, more contacts or more people that you may have exposed. So we want to do everything we can to do a good job with the program, and this is where we could use your help in terms of getting the word out to people, because if nobody trusts our program and if no, if, if we can't earn your desire to participate in the program, I do not believe it's going to succeed. So I believe this has to be all of us working together. So thank you, you're welcome. Let me ask you another question that was submitted beforehand. If there's a concern with a contact tracer, you know, I guess something that comes up during the course of the conversation or something you know related to that contact, tracer, that I guess they've done something inappropriate or who knows? Is there a number for people to call to to alert the you know to alert your program to that yeah? So if there's a concern about, what's happened with a contact, tracer there's a couple of different roads. Unfortunately, I hope that's not happening too often. Now I you can let our human resources people know you can even let me know and I'd be happy to obviously address anything that I can as quickly as possible. We do not. We do not want that to ever happen, but if it does happen, we want to be able to intervene to make sure that everybody in New York is safe and comfortable. You can also call there's a an inbound line to the contact tracers. That would be another way as well, but if all else fails, you can really reach out to me and I'm here to help as well or a member of my team for sure all right, all right, let's go to Elita Lita has another question. Thank you on a practical level. What happens if the person that you're tracing does not speak English or one of the more common other languages? Do you have translators? Do you have tracers who are fluent in any of those other languages? Thank you. Yes and yes, our tracers speak more than 40 languages and one in New, York, City, Health and hospitals. We have a very robust interpreter program which we do over the phone. One of the interesting facts that I learned recently, which makes me proud, is, did you know that Elmhurst hospital in Queens is the most diverse hospital in the entire world, judged by the number of languages that we do translation services for? So I think we're pretty good at that and we're leveraging all of that towards this program. All right, Barbara, I am requesting one. I forget if it was phase two of phase theory, one of the wonderful things that happened is that we can now dine outdoors and I love it, but I'm nervous at the same time, and so it's about what is safe, but also how you do contact tracing. So what I notice is just about everybody walks in gets seated with a mask on and most of the time immediately takes their mask off. It seems to me that when a waiter comes and takes an order, you're not wearing a mask and you're sitting, probably one. How wide is the table one foot, two foot away from each other for a whole dinner. I understand it's hard to eat with a mask on, but is there something that we should change our message and say please keep your mask on whenever possible. If a, if a waiter gets sick, how do you do tracing etc? And is this an issue, or am I worried for no reason at all? No, not at all, I think you're, not sorry for no reason at all. So it's okay! No, it's the real, basically the what you're the principle of what you're saying is that how does this work in the real world, which is a great it's a and there's no easy answer to that. You know a couple things, so one is that well, there's of course, risk being in proximity to anybody. Still, the risk is higher with them less than six feet for more than 10 minutes. So the waiter should be sure to not do that. Yes, it's ideal for people to be wearing masks for sure, but you can't wear a mask while you're eating the waiter can wear a mask, though, and the waiter can minimize her or his interaction. So those are just real world sort of things we can do. We have seen a lot less transmission of the coronavirus outdoors than indoors. So that's why we're doing outdoor dining now? So that's another thing that we, you know from a policy perspective, can do to mitigate the risk of having the coronavirus transmitted and in terms of how contact tracing works, to be clear if you're sick, we do not want you to be working under no scenario, masks or no mat or mat, even with a mask being sick. No because sick people, we know, are contagious, of course, but if you do have a positive result for coronavirus and you're a case, we're going to call you and we are going to ask you if you've been at a restaurant, we're going to ask you who you've been in contact with the restaurant. So we are going to. We consider the restaurant a scenario where you could have either been exposed or could have exposed others for sure. Everything else is to your point, just a real world way that we can mitigate the risk with everything we know about the coronavirus. But if I'm going with a friend, not a family member, that I live with and they're like two feet away and we're eating for 45 minutes, I assume that's a higher risk. Am I right absolutely yeah, so I want to ask about the confidentiality and security of information that's gathered, so we actually are our last meeting touched on this and we heard from assemblyman gottfried and also from carried itself from the Knight Institute talking about an assembly bill a10500-a that addresses confidentiality of contact tracing information. So it's basically kind of a two- part question. The first is what you know: how is contact tracing information kept secure both in terms of confidentiality and data security, and then the second question is, you know: do you guys have a view on this assembly bill? That's moving through the legislature dealing with confidentiality of this information, yeah great questions, so you know confidentiality and privacy. I thinking back to the overly generous introduction you guys gave for me, but one of the things that really made an impression on me as a person is with NYC care when we were starting that program. I remember we had a lot of conversations around, especially with a program that is purely dedicated to people that are uninsured yeah. What how can we make new yorkers that are uninsured, feel comfortable, that we can protect their their privacy and protect their right to confidentiality, and I think, with NYC care we were able to. We put a lot of hard work into making sure that we could communicate to people about the vast protections that we do have to be clear with you to first part of your question, we will not ask you for your immigration status. We will not share any records with law enforcement and we will protect your confidentiality and privacy to the fullest extent under this New York City Health code. These things are all things firm, tenants and principles that we live by, but I think there's an opportunity for us and you to do a better job of communicating to new yorkers, about even everything that I just said from talking to New Yorkers. I'm not sure people fully understand the extent to which we really do have these protections in place and that, even with what I just told you I do not know if anybody is or if everybody knew what I just shared. But if you did not go tell five friends because they probably did not either so those are things. I think we want to continue to work with you to do a better job of communicating with community members about because it's something we could not take more seriously and all those protections are in place now. But if people do not know that, then they can't trust our program as much as they possibly could and that's where we need to work together in terms of the the state bill. Our teams are reviewing that now I will say. Of course, I support the principles of confidentiality and privacy. We also want to make sure that, there's that the bill is compatible with our program being successful too, and that's what our teams are reviewing now, but the principles that we applied to NYC care we've fully leveraged those same principles to this program now and if anything, I would want to ask for your help in terms of being able to address legitimate issues or questions that people have, but once those are addressed, helping to work together to convince the yorkers that they can trust us, because if we do not have that trust, the program can't succeed in suppressing the coronavirus. Thank you. So Tanisha Rag has another question yeah, so I mute her there. You go she's in you. Okay, if you could possibly explain how the mobile testing units work and how one could possibly become a site or a location, for course, for mobile testing sure. So we are. We have more than five mobile testing vans now and the way they work is they drive to a certain location that we designate with input from our community members so that you can the best way to see if you can get a mobile unit to come to. You is, let me and my team know and we'll take a look and yeah we'll prioritize acrosss other requests we get to, but we'd love to hear from you. If you think that there's a need, that's 100 of the places we go to now are based on people telling us these are the places we're needed. We exist to serve so let us know for sure, and then we set up shop there. Sometimes it's for a day, sometimes for a few days, sometimes for a week or two, it just depends on the need in the area, but these vans exist to allow us to sort of be mobile if you will and being able to offer testing to people in areas where they do not currently have a great place, a great option in terms of where to get tested, elita go ahead. Elite actually asked to have Cos go first yeah, but, oh sorry, I did not see that so Dr long. This program is very robust in New York City in New York state, but we have a lot of people coming from Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and everywhere else. Is there any correlation or liaison between? You know, New York and the other states yeah good question, so we do work with other states of course, and like, for example, in the tri- state area. We have the port authority that we work with within the tri- state area for people coming in and out. In addition to that, one of the challenges we have is there are certain states that really, unfortunately, are being more affected by Coronavirus now, so the state designates those other states and of those 20 or so states that have been designated. If you travel. If you fly into New York, we ask you to fill out a form where we get your contact information, and then we ask you to quarantine and we call you to see how we can help, but also ensure that you are quarantining as per the governor's executive order. We keep that part of the program up and running in terms of if new states are added, but that is something with travelers that were we've built up over the last week or two, as we see what's happening outside of New York state, but what about enforcement? So, in terms of enforcement, the governor's executive order is the requirements and there's a fine that the port authority can administer it's a two thousand dollar. Fine, if you do not give us if the information, your contact information when you're getting out of one of the airplanes from one of the twenty designated states. In terms of going beyond that, you can come on us calling you texting, you maybe even knocking on your door, but when we reach out to you in any way, you can also count on us offering to help you, okay, just so to follow up on that. Are you guys getting contact information from other jurisdictions like if someone in you know, New Jersey, let's say, has a positive test, and hopefully there's some kind of contact racing going on there, and one of the contacts is somebody in New York? Is that sort of transferred over to you guys to follow up with that person who's in New York yeah? We do tran, we do if it's out of jurisdiction, issue yeah pretty much. What you said and same goes for different counties. So if somebody outside of New York, we would we would communicate with different counties based on that as well. So our program we're only calling people that are in New, York City, so let's go to Pixel 3 Xl, and I would just when we unmute you. If you could, please identify yourself with your with your name. That would be great before you ask your question. Oh I'm, sorry, I'm Julia Klaus! Can you see me now or am I am I yeah? We can see you yeah. We can hear you sorry. I did not put my name in there. Dr Long. I understand the objective of contact tracing. I also feel that I've had many conversations with health departments. County tried to reach city state and I have often not always encountered what I do not feel to be a lot of give and take. I feel that it's more a this is what you have to do, and this is how it has to be so also within the contact tracing framework. That question was my question about. If you encounter an issue with a contact tracer or a concern, where is the people that the health and H stands for, what I'm sorry, oh New, York, City, Health and hospitals, so health and hospitals? You said we could contact. You is I'm finding contacting anybody at health in very difficult? Do you put your number out for everybody to see? Is it a well- known fact, sir? Can you can you guys see me still? Yes, we can see you, okay. Ah there we go. My computer is being weird for a second, so Julia would it be if it would be helpful after this call? Why do not we circulate the contact information for you to be able to reach out to for any issues with contact tracers yeah? No, but I mean, if you really want to have trust, then this is something that I would suggest everybody. I mean that it's out there front and forward. If there is this, please contact this because I almost feel like this is a government organization that, while I think what you're doing is you know meaningful and has reason just pure fundamentally as a government organization, the people you serve have absolutely no way to put forth a comment. It's just not a an accessible thing. It sounds like so Dr long you mentioned. There was an inbound number for things like this and I think you know we might be able to even circulate it on this call and if not, we can certainly speculate it afterwards. So if you send it to will he might be able to put it in the chat? If that's something that we can announce, is it the New York state number? What is that number city? Nothing hospitals, contact, tracing, right, yeah, there's we have an inbox and more than one phone number, but I think Julia, your point's really well taken. So why do not? If it's okay, I unfortunately have to hop off in a second here, I'm being called away, but I would like to circulate with this group here a couple of different ways that you can reach out to us for everything that you're saying to me because again, if people do not trust in the program, then it's not going to it's not going to work, and I, if I could put one more plug in Julia- and this is something I care a lot about- is that with how we structured the program in terms of how it may feel like a government type program, or things like that? We've really gone out of our way to do things extra that we think are important for new yorkers, like the hotels program. Literally, we would, you can call a number right now and we'll pick you up free of charge, drive you to the hotel and give you free pajamas and free food and nursing care the entire time you're there we did not. Nobody said we had to do that and that's not in any textbook for contact tracing, but we want to do it because we want to convince new yorkers that we're in this together and that they have our support so that things like that have meant a lot to us and we want to. If you have other thoughts or more things we can do. You can email me personally I'd love to hear them. Thank you very much. Thank you. So much so one question I do want to ask and make sure that we get to before you go. Is you know what are the barriers to contact tracing and what is what is it that we folks in the community, but in particular this community Board Community Board 8? What can we do to help and what can we do to help overcome the barriers to contact tracing and just generally to assist with the contact tracing program? Yes, thank you number one. Two and three get the word out. Really that's what we need. We need people to know what we're doing so when they get a call from a contact, tracer, they're, not surprised and hopefully they'll even be already feel, like look or feel supported by the time they get. The call because we're doing all of this to support New, York and the program will only be as good as people believe in it to be. So please get the word out about what we're trying to do that. We do exist, we're here to help. If we call you pick up the phone talk to us, that is really the key thing. I would love your help with. That will make the biggest difference all right. We can do that Elena. Did you want to ask another question before I did and I'll be very quick? Are there a lot of spam calls and scammers out there? I understand that. There's one number that shows up on phones is that correct, or it says something to identify the caller as a contact tracer. Would you be able to tell us what that is, so that people know what to look for? Yes? So if you have certain carriers, they actually, instead of the phone number it'll, say contact tracer. It's like a fancy. I do not know exactly how it works, but it, but it's good. If you do not have that carrier. Another thing we can maybe circulate after this meeting is on our on our website on our faqs. We have there's like two different ways: the phone number can start. So it's on our website. We can circulate that to make sure that you have that that's good and we could post that as well. I can't thank you enough for spending you part of your evening with us and sharing so much useful information, because we're with you on this that contact racing is essential for the health of New York and the vibrancy of the city. So it was such a pleasure to have you and to listen to everything you said and Cornelia said you were always smiling, and I could see that so. Thank you so much again for just sharing your wealth of knowledge with us, there's a tremendous amount of information out there and you were able to really focus it and we're very grateful. Thank you. Thank you all so much for again we're only as strong as we are together. So I really appreciate your time. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay, Russell is there in thank you Dr long. Is there anything else that you'd like to do now? I do not think so. Thank everybody for participating in this call and for your questions. It was very helpful. You know I do not think we have more of an agenda really for this meeting other than the you know getting these questions answered, but these are very it's a lot of helpful information, so we will incorporate that into what we're doing going forward and obviously we'll try and get the word out so and then I hope everybody on this call will get the word out. So, thank you very much. Thank you. Let's try and figure out how to post everything, so we have it concise and succinct and easily accessible to people both in content and in presentation. So you did a great job. Thank you so much and thank you, everyone for participating and listening. If I could, I would toast you all so. Here's to the help of New, York and New Yorkers, and thank you for tuning in that's right. Thanks, everybody good night.
