Doctors have been telling us how important taste, testing and tracing is to stay healthy, to be able to go to our restaurants and stores to keep our jobs countries credit their success in controlling the coronavirus, to the extent that they have on testing and tracing As. The weeks since new york, city's reopening have gone by we've seen a lot of changes in information and even in whether businesses can reopen.
This is the third meeting that the community board has had related to contact tracing First of all two committees, the health seniors and social services committee, co-chaired by barbara rudder, lori, boris and rebecca dangore, and also the environment and sanitation committee that kaz spagnaletti and I co-chair as well as sarah chu and may malik and elita we've sort of been You know working together on these contact tracing meetings and the first one that we did was a q a session, and we had a number of questions sort of left over from that one We thought it'd be helpful to to have another session where the public could get a chance to ask questions and members of the board could ask questions that they have about the contact tracing program and so with that, let's turn it over to dr ted long I first wanted to say thank you, everybody for your time tonight on in the evening to listen to me and to hear about our contact tracing program.
But I do want to give a little bit of a backdrop to how we've structured our program here just to make sure that we're all on the same page, because if you take one thing away from me here today, it's that our program, all of the work we've put in, is only as strong as everybody in new york city that participates in the program and our tracers themselves.
We can't trace them and we can't figure out who we need to help to offer services to So I'm, proud to say that since we conceptualized how we wanted to approach testing in new york city, this was a couple of months ago.
They need help they're telling they tell our tracers as part of our contact tracing operation What we've done is: we've created a new role called a resource navigator, which is where we pair new yorkers up with things like food delivery, help with medications even help with things like if you have an eviction threat or if your employer is saying that they're going to fire you if you're staying at home and quarantine, which is the right thing for new york city, which, by the way they can't do state law, precludes them from doing that.
So our resource navigators work through all of that with my patients and with everybody in new york city So, it's important to us that we give new yorkers a way to get through this, and don't just say you know, you're diagnosed with the coronavirus and there's nothing.
So, let's say that you came to one of our more than 50 health and hospitals testing sites By the way we have more than 200 testing sites across new york city All of those tests go up to a state database and then we draw from those and that those are the people that we call for the program with our contact.
Tracers important, to note it's agnostic to where you had the test done, So. What we do is we call you first thing we say We have our covet hotline, which we stood up at the peak of the crisis, where we can pair you with the clinician instantaneously, so we're there to help you clinically in any way that we can once we've asked you about your symptoms and once we're make sure that you're safe, where you are at home, and everything like that.
Basically, if there are statistics about how many folks have been helped in this way, to kind of make it more real for people and also just other information about the mechanics of how that sort of assistance is provided to sort of reassure people that is there My patients through because in new york city, one of the challenges is a lot of us do live with other people and if you share a bedroom in a bathroom with multiple other people, it's hard to avoid, potentially exposing them to you when you're infectious, especially the sharing the bathroom issue.
Why getting tested is important because, if you're positive, we want to know that now, because then we watch for your symptoms and we want to then figure out who you've exposed to the virus if you're positive, but a negative result before 14 days, doesn't tell you that you're definitively not going to develop it on day 14, because the incubation period can be a full two weeks, but I do think of timing If somebody gets sick, they get tested.
But the final thing I'll say is in new york city, we're one of the only cities in the country and the large city, of course, but we're the largest city anyways to have universal testing, You can come to any of my health and hospitals, 50 plus sites We welcome everybody, because a lot of times people are worried that they may have had an exposure Even.
Other programs, like this in other cities, have not taken the step that we have to offer them a huge amount of resources to help people to get through this, with their families to be able to stay at home or to be able to go to a hotel Our my view on this, in our view on this, is definitely that we want to earn your trust, and we believe that, if you believe in the program, you're going to tell us be more likely to tell us more people, more contacts or more people that you may have exposed So, we want to do everything we can to do a good job with the program, and this is where we could use your help in terms of getting the word out to people, because if nobody trusts our program and if no, if, if we can't earn your desire to participate in the program, I, don't believe it's going to succeed.
To be clear if you're sick, we don't want you to be working under no scenario, masks or no mat or mat, even with a mask being sick No, because sick people, we know, are contagious, of course, but if you do have a positive result for coronavirus and you're a case, we're going to call you and we are going to ask you if you've been at a restaurant, we're going to ask you who you've been in contact with the restaurant We. Consider the restaurant, a scenario where you could have either been exposed or could have exposed others for sure.
Under this new york city health code, These things are all things firm, tenants and principles that we live by, but I think there's an opportunity for us and you to do a better job of communicating to new yorkers, about even everything that I just said from talking to new yorkers Not sure people fully understand the extent to which we really do have these protections in place and that even with what I just told you I don't know if anybody is or if everybody knew what I just shared I think we want to continue to work with you to do a better job of communicating with community members about because it's something we could not take more seriously and all those protections are in place now If people don't know that, then they can't trust our program as much as they possibly could and that's where we need to work together in terms of the the state bill.
What is that number city, nothing hospitals, contact, tracing, right, If, it's okay, I, unfortunately, have to hop off in a second here If people don't trust in the program, then it's not going to.
To do things extra that we think are important for new yorkers like the hotels program You can call a number right now and we'll pick you up free of charge, drive you to the hotel and give you free, pajamas and free food and nursing care, the entire time you're there and that's not in any textbook for contact tracing.
