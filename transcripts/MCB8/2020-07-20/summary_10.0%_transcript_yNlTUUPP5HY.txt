Doctors have been telling us how important taste, testing and tracing is to stay healthy, to be able to go to our restaurants and stores to keep our jobs.
First of all, two committees, the health seniors and Social Services, Committee co- chaired by Barbara, Rudder, Lori, Boris and rebecca dangore, and also the environment and sanitation, Committee that Kaz Spagnaletti and I co- chair as well as Sarah Chu and may malik, and elita You know, working together on these contact tracing meetings and the first one that we did was a Q&A session and we had a number of questions sort of left over from that one.
Do want to give a little bit of a backdrop to how we've structured our program here just to make sure that we're all on the same page, because if you take one thing away from me here, today, it's that our program, all of the work we've put in, is only as strong as everybody in New York City.
So I hope that by the end of this I can gain your trust in the program and if we call you that you'll pick up the phone and want to be part of the work we're doing together to suppress Covid-19 So, there's three ways that we want to suppress the coronavirus in New, York, City.
Our team of more than 3,000 tracers calls every single new case and talks to them and then figures out with them who the contacts are that we then need to track down, in other words, who the people that are in New York City now that are at risk for having been exposed are, and how can we get through to them?
You have an eviction threat or if your employer is saying that they're going to fire you If you're staying at home and quarantine, which is the right thing for New York City, which, by the way they can't do state law precludes them from doing that.
Contact tracers ask when they call you in the course of contact tracing- Are there different questions that you get as a contact Compared to questions that you might get as somebody who's tested, positive, great question.
The way we have more than 200 testing sites, acrosss New, All of those tests go up to a state database and then we draw from those and that those are the people that we call for the program with our contact.
So we're there to help you clinically in any way that we can once we've asked you about your symptoms and once we're make sure that you're safe, where you are at home, and everything like that from from the perspective of if you're, feeling, okay and able to continue the interview, we then go in and ask you questions about who you've been in contact with and where you might have been.
Basically, if there are statistics about how many folks have been helped in this way, to kind of make it more real for people and also just other information about the mechanics of how that sort of assistance is provided to sort of reassure people that is there My patients through, because in New York City, one of the challenges is a lot of us, do live with other people and if you share a bedroom in a bathroom with multiple other people, it's hard to avoid, potentially exposing them to you when you're infectious, especially the sharing the bathroom issue.
We want to know that now, because then we watch for your symptoms and we want to then figure out who you've exposed to the virus if you're positive, but a negative result before 14 days does not tell you that you're definitively not going to develop it on day 14, because the incubation period can be a full two weeks, but I do think of timing.
Does someone come in and test her any time during that period to see whether the people in her family have been exposed to the virus?
It takes a few days for the coronavirus to have that effect on your body, so what we say is best to get tested We do want in your situation that the person that was exposed to get tested, but if you can best to wait at least several days, because that's the window when most people, if they did contract it, are going to have a positive test result.
So, there's two parts to the first part of your question: There's two different time frames you laid out, so I want to talk about each of them As other cities, you know, unfortunately, are going through what we went through in April, so that piece is something we're working on, but that that's to decide for your question.
Unfortunately, people that are older, with comorbidities, have a more severe reaction to the coronavirus if you're worried about potentially being contagious to a family member, but you feel fine come and get tested before you visit your family member , it's a safe thing to do, and it's something again that we want to offer to you.
Other, programs, like this in other cities, have not taken the step that we have to offer them a huge amount of resources to help people to get through this, with their families to be able to stay at home or to be able to go to a hotel.
Our view on this is definitely that we want to earn your trust, and we believe that, if you believe in the program, you're going to tell us, be more likely to tell us more people, more contacts or more people that you may have exposed.
That's another thing that we, you know from a policy perspective, can do to mitigate the risk of having the coronavirus transmitted and in terms of how contact tracing works, to be clear, If, you're sick.
No, because sick people, we know, are contagious, of course, but if you do have a positive result for coronavirus and you're a case, we're going to call you And, we are going to ask you if you've been at a restaurant, we're going to ask you who you've been in contact with the restaurant.
I remember, we had a lot of conversations around, especially with a program that is purely dedicated to people that are uninsured How can we make new yorkers that are uninsured, feel comfortable, that we can protect their their privacy and protect their right to confidentiality, and I think, with NYC care?
If people do not know that, then they can't trust our program as much as they possibly could That's where we need to work together in terms of the the state bill.
We've fully leveraged those same principles to this program now and if anything, I would want to ask for your help in terms of being able to address legitimate issues or questions that people have, but once those are addressed, helping to work together to convince the yorkers that they can trust us, because if we do not have that trust, the program can't succeed in suppressing the coronavirus.
You guys getting contact information from other jurisdictions like If, someone in you, know, New Jersey.
We do if it's out of jurisdiction, issue So our program, we're only calling people that are in New, York City.
We've, really gone out of our way to do things extra that we think are important for new yorkers, like the hotels, program.
We need people to know what we're doing so when they get a call from a contact, tracer, they're, not surprised, The call because we're doing all of this to support New, York and the program will only be as good as people believe in it to be.
