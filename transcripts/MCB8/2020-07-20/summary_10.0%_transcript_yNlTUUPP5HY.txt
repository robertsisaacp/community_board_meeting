Doctors have been telling us how important taste, testing and tracing is to stay healthy, to be able to go to our restaurants and stores to keep our jobs.
Ask that everyone participate in new york's test and trace program for yourselves, your friends and family and neighbors your favorite businesses and everyone else in the city I'm thrilled to introduce dr ted long executive director of the test and trace corps at new york, city's health and hospitals.
You know, working together on these contact tracing meetings and the first one that we did was a q, a session, and we had a number of questions sort of left over from that one.
We thought it'd be helpful to to have another session where the public could get a chance to ask questions and members of the board could ask questions that they have about the contact tracing program and so with that.
But I do want to give a little bit of a backdrop to how we've structured our program here just to make sure that we're all on the same page, because if you take one thing away from me here today, it's that our program, all of the work we've put in, is only as strong as everybody in new york city that participates in the program and our tracers themselves.
So I hope that by the end of this I can gain your trust in the program and if we call you that you'll pick up the phone and want to be part of the work we're doing together to suppress Covid-19 So, there's three ways that we want to suppress the coronavirus in new york, city.
Our team of more than 3 000 tracers calls every single new case and talks to them and then figures out with them who the contacts are that we then need to track down, in other words, who the people that are in new york city now that are at risk for having been exposed are, and how can we get through to them?
What we've done is we've created a new role called a resource navigator, which is where we pair new yorkers up with things like food delivery, help with medications even help with things like if you have an eviction threat or if your employer is saying that they're going to fire, you If you're, staying at home and quarantine, which is the right thing for new york, city, which.
Contact tracers ask when they call you in the course of contact tracing- Are there different questions that you get as a contact Compared to questions that you might get as somebody who's tested, positive, great question.
All of those tests go up to a state database and then we draw from those and that those are the people that we call for the program with our contact.
Basically, if there are statistics about how many folks have been helped in this way, to kind of make it more real for people and also just other information about the mechanics of how that sort of assistance is provided to sort of reassure people that is there My patients through, because in new york city, one of the challenges is a lot of us, do live with other people and if you share a bedroom in a bathroom with multiple other people, it's hard to avoid, potentially exposing them to you when you're infectious, especially the sharing the bathroom issue.
Does someone come in and test her any time during that period to see whether the people in her family have been exposed to the virus?
If it's not technically the amount of time, and we want to support you so come in and get tested anytime and just to follow up on that Yes, very important point Or you're the contact tracer.
There was a question about nursing, homes, and I know those have been particular areas of Covid-19 spread and that kind of thing- And, so are there particular things that you're doing around nursing homes for contact, tracing, Nursing homes are something we refer to as congregate settings where people are inherently living in very close proximity of each other and,?
Other, programs, like this in other cities, have not taken the step that we have to offer them a huge amount of resources to help people to get through this, with their families to be able to stay at home or to be able to go to a hotel.
We want to do everything we can to do a good job with the program, and this is where we could use your help in terms of getting the word out to people, because if nobody trusts our program and if no, if, if we can't earn your desire to participate in the program, I, don't believe it's going to succeed.
Perspective, can do to mitigate the risk of having the coronavirus transmitted and in terms of how contact tracing works.
No, because sick people, we know, are contagious, of course, but if you do have a positive result for coronavirus and you're a case, we're going to call you And, we are going to ask you if you've been at a restaurant, we're going to ask you who you've been in contact with the restaurant.
If people don't know that, then they can't trust our program as much as they possibly could That's where we need to work together in terms of the the state bill.
We've fully leveraged those same principles to this program now and if anything, I would want to ask for your help in terms of being able to address legitimate issues or questions that people have, but once those are addressed, helping to work together to convince the yorkers that they can trust us, because if we don't have that trust, the program can't succeed in suppressing the coronavirus.
You guys getting contact information from other jurisdictions like if someone in you know new jersey,, let's say, has a positive test, and hopefully there's some kind of contact racing going on there, and one of the contacts is somebody in new york?
We do if it's out of jurisdiction, issue So our program, we're only calling people that are in new york city.
We've, really gone out of our way to do things extra that we think are important for new yorkers, like the hotels, program.
The call, because we're doing all of this to support new york and the program will only be as good as people believe in it to be.
