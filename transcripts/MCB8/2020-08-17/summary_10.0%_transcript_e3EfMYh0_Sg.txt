Everyone is muted and they're unable to unmute themselves to try to cut down on the background noise, and so how you'll have to be recognized by jane and david It's a little easier for everybody to see you'll see at the bottom of your screen, a button that says participants and it looks like two little people standing next to each other and has the number 20 next to it.
We will hear from the applicant then from the public, and then the committee will go into executive session and formulate a resolution that will be sent directly to the commission.- There is no full board meeting in august for community board.
Is I mean by clicking all right, because I'm going to mute you for a second, while you're figuring everything out eric What's, the true scope of this project?
There was a an issue with the rear, wall, rear parapet and we had an approved design approved set of drawings, and there was some disagreement with landmarks when we went to get final sign-offs about the detail of that paradigm.
The gutter moved up, so we never intended to put back any corvolene because it would just be alien to the structure floating in the middle of the rear wall, because assuming it would need to line up with the adjacent and will not support the gutter.
You know a few times and never kind of mentioned this before, but in talking about putting back a cordling in a situation like this in a property that has no rear access, so you have to go through the house in order to get to the backyard And we're talking about erecting scaffolds, sidewalk bridges covering the neighbors and our own properties, just to put a coiling back that, like gustavo, just said, is not exactly the same as any other one.
So I just want to add that we discovered that the whole rear wall and the parapet have been compromised and it had to be taken down to the level of the existing roof.
Don't think we want to get too technical right as a landmarks.
Okay, it was all built, but landmarks decided that they had misunderstood your drawings and therefore they want you to redo it right with corbin, correct, so I think I, don't know.
The permit was issued the contractor in good faith built it the way it should be to repair the back wall Where we could never reach it, just doesn't make sense and the person missing in all of these discussions we had with landmarks was the owner and he believes in good faith.
The work was submitted, it was approved and it was constructed exactly the way we showed it through christians, structural drawings and our our architectural set.
Even I, don't want to tell you how I'm going to vote right now, but I would be surprised that landmarks would even suggest pasting something on, but apparently they are We have to decide whether something that is going to look like what landmarks decides.
I, think I'm, trying to figure out if we can get the design that has integrity when the materials, don't Can, we make it look the way landmarks might want it to look with a lesser material that would in effect, be an application and not an integral use of the material, and I.
This is the rear, facade the landmarks approved it as built and is now coming back for what could be described as the second bite of the apple, and it seems to me that there that gluing, a plastic facade, putting a plastic core ball to the to the existing masonry wall is just silly Yes, okay, my first impression is, and the last permit is the issue that you cannot sign off.
The point is that for that part, probably that trigger the issue that they, that landmark, doesn't want to approve you, the rooftop edition.
That landmarks in theory, approved and then, as anthony said, took a second bite of the apple and then decided it wasn't correct, but I would hate to set a precedent where owners felt that they could go ahead with construction when every duck wasn't lined up.
So I think we should go with that judgment, call on landmarks, bar, except the fact that the building is higher, except the fact that there are many precedents for doing that, and then it comes down to accept a simple, integrated design, You know, as anthony pointed out paste something on top of this building, which is not appropriate from a constructional point of view, and certainly not from the point of view of the long-term stability of the building, the weathering of the material and the long-term look of the material long-term.
Do it sounded like there was a point made during the presentation that the the rear of the structure wasn't part of the landmarks designation.
We have an open application with landmarks for minor work or a minor amendment to be bulkhead materials and rear facade, but they wanted to have us present the entry door replacement as they deemed it, couldn't be reviewed at a staff level.
The point of this being is you'll see further along in our rendered elevation that we want to propose doing a semi-transparent glass in the doors, as opposed to the current clear glass.
On, the left hand, side are the existing entry doors, as I mentioned, they're, a steel frame with decorative mill work with a painted black semi-gloss finish.
If we apply what we did in last application, you shouldn't be here because, while doing construction, you modify these the scope of work and therefore the landmark should follow the same procedure with you.
I, don't particularly like the lever, but on balance, I think you did a fine job, so I can certainly support the application.
