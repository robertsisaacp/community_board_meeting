That is it'll change in a second I, see a lot of focus Do. You want to sort of tell people how to vote or that use your little that's, who it's their first time at one of our virtual board meetings or committee meetings, So, it's a little easier for everybody to see you'll see at the bottom of your screen, a button that says participants and it looks like two little people standing next to each other and has the number 20 next to it.
East 51st street was just part of the roadhouse, as you can see in the approved roof plan by lpc and DOB department of buildings, We called out the height of the fourth floor, the height of the terrace and the height of the railing, showing that intent of the proper wall going to the top and meeting with the railing, because we cannot have a floating railing in the rear.
You can see on the drawing on the side how we, how we show the water, drainage and the steel in place and the whole construction tied together in our discussions with landmarks They want us to do analysis of the real facades just to show them how amazing the side of the roof will not be chewed or unheard of in this location, and, as you can see what we did, we mapped out the rear elevation of every building on this block and none of the rear character.
You know a few times and never kind of mentioned this before, but in talking about putting back a cordling in a situation like this in a property that has no rear access, so you have to go through the house in order to get to the backyard and we're talking about erecting scaffolds, sidewalk bridges covering the neighbors and our own properties, just to put a coiling back that, like gustavo just said, is not exactly the same as any other one All. The time is sort of very upset about this whole scenario of how we ended up here with this sort of unclosed project So, we put a steel beam and to support the new railing and the new terrace, and in order to take down the parapet to the original level, or even to try to build it the core but have to deal with it with a steel beam, it's more complicated than it meets the eye.
Well I don't think we want to get too technical right as a landmarks committee It's our rule to our mission to look at appropriateness Maybe, you should finish up or we'll never and give the committee a chance to comment.
it was that we, you know, had it designed a certain way, but again it was just amazing to us not to be picked up until the end of the project did all the work and landmarks came back at the end on the basis that the took the fourth certificate of no effect, which applies to this condition was never fully approved and therefore they have the right to clarify.
It was all built, but landmarks decided that they had misunderstood your drawings and therefore they want you to redo it right with corbin, correct, so I think I, don't know.
The actual odd type of thing that you're discussing tonight is to, as it says, the application is to keep existing condition of the built parapet while in place without modification We know your firm well enough to know you would never do anything inappropriate from a process point of view, nor from a design point of view, if you were to have wanted to put a corbel in, would a real corbel have been possible when you were designing it not really because again with you could see the height of the steel, it would be floating in space.
They'd like it to look at look like versus something which was designed and approved as a design that had integrity to it , I think I'm, trying to figure out if we can get the design that has integrity when the materials don't Can, we make it look the way landmarks might want it to look with a lesser material that would in effect be an application and not an integral use of the material and I.
This is the rear, facade the landmarks approved it as built and is now coming back for what could be described as the second bite of the apple, and it seems to me that there that gluing, a plastic facade putting a plastic core ball to the to the existing masonry wall is just silly Okay, my first impression is- and the last permit is the issue that you cannot sign off: Look the curviline, because the carbon is the bad guy right here that doesn't allow me to finish, and the curviline is less important than the gutter I'm going to limit my opinion exclusively in about the issue of the extension , you yourself show that is the only extension in that block you will that create a precedent to everybody in that block to continue So?
It's a very confusing application, but I have to say that marco made a very good point about setting a precedent, I'm still confused that landmarks in theory, approved and then, as anthony said, took a second bite of the apple and then decided it wasn't correct, but I would hate to set a precedent where owners felt that they could go ahead with construction when every duck wasn't lined up So I'm going to have to go with marco on the principle of setting the precedent and vote against the application.
The upper east side, historic district Doors on the architect is jg, knock and The project architect for 49, east 68th street We started construction last year in august, and we're aiming to complete construction in september of 2021 We have an open application with landmarks for minor work or a minor amendment to be bulkhead materials and rear facade, but they wanted to have us present the entry door replacement as they deemed it, couldn't be reviewed at a staff level.
It's exactly what we're looking at, with the exception of the glass which will be semi-transparent, correct, okay, I can support this I, don't particularly like the lever, but on balance, I think you did a fine job, so I can certainly support the application.
