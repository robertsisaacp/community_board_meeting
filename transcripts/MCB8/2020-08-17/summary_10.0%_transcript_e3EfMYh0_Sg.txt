Everyone is muted and they're unable to unmute themselves to try to cut down on the background noise, and so how you'll have to be recognized by Jane and David So. It's a little easier for everybody to see you'll see at the bottom of your screen, a button that says participants and it looks like two little people standing next to each other and has the number 20 next to it.
Is I mean by clicking all right, because I'm going to mute you for a second, while you're figuring everything out Eric What's the true scope of this project?
There was a an issue with the rear, wall, Rear Parapet and we had an approved design approved set of drawings, and there was some disagreement with landmarks when we went to get final sign- offs about the detail of that paradigm.
There were additions to the scope of work, first repairs and modification of an existing rear, balcony.
Second, one was interior structural work issued on November 20th 2017, signed off by the LPC on December 13 2018, the Rear balcony, issued on October 4th 2018 and signed off on February 19th 2019, and the rooftop edition that included the architectural structural and HVAC issued on May 25th 2018.
Our documents that were approved that showed the proposed work and the executed construction conforms to what we actually had shown on our documents.
This construction is not visible from the public thoroughfare, I'm going to step back and let Eric take you through some meetings that we had with LPC starting in January.
He wants the rear of his building to remain as it was initially designed and initially approved by LPC.
We called out the height of the fourth floor, the height of the terrace and the height of the railing, showing that intent of the proper wall going to the top and meeting with the railing, because we can not have a floating railing in the rear, facade.
We never intended to put back any corvolene because it would just be alien to the structure floating in the middle of the rear wall, because assuming it would need to line up with the adjacent and will not support the gutter.
When, we saw our construction, we had lowered the we removed the roof and we found that the rear wall had set delaminated from the structure.
You know a few times and never kind of mentioned this before, but in talking about putting back a cordling in a situation like this in a property that has no rear access, so you have to go through the house in order to get to the backyard And we're talking about erecting scaffolds, sidewalk bridges covering the neighbors and our own properties, just to put a coiling back that, like Gustavo, just said, is not exactly the same as any other one.
So I just want to add that we discovered that the whole rear wall and the parapet have been compromised and it had to be taken down to the level of the existing roof.
So we put a steel beam and to support the new railing and the new terrace and in order to take down the parapet to the original level, or even to try to build it the core but have to deal with it with a steel beam, it's more complicated than it meets the eye.
I do not think we want to get too technical right as a landmarks.
Okay, it was all built, but landmarks decided that they had misunderstood your drawings and therefore they want you to redo it right with corbin, correct, so I think I do not know.
The work was submitted, it was approved and it was constructed exactly the way we showed it through Christians structural drawings and our our architectural set.
If I go to the left, hand, And I go to the second picture on the top on the right, where you have gutters with cordling under it, one is white No, there's no karbaling as built part of the issue Is that you know our gutter had to be raised up higher by necessity, and you know it's a question of you know you're putting the core bling in where the cordling used to be.
This is just a paste on and I'm surprised that landmarks would even I do not want to tell you how I'm going to vote right now, but I would be surprised that landmarks would even suggest pasting something on, but apparently they are and we have to decide whether something that is going to look like what landmarks decides.
Can we make it look the way landmarks might want it to look with a lesser material that would in effect, be an application and not an integral use of the material, and I.
Do we want something which is visually one thing or something which is an integrated, design, The gutters are running there because, of course, you need the drainage and in order to put in the cordless, reconstructed or, however, it has to go under the gutter, and so it will look like it's floating nowhere.
This is the rear, facade the landmarks approved it as built and is now coming back for what could be described as the second bite of the apple, and it seems to me that there that gluing, a plastic facade, putting a plastic core ball to the to the existing masonry wall is just silly Yes, okay, my first impression is, and the last permit is the issue that you can not sign off.
The gutter you can address in the I would like to discuss if you wanted construction.
The point is that, for that part, probably that trigger the issue that they, that landmark, does not want to approve you, the rooftop edition.
That landmarks in theory, approved and then, as Anthony said, took a second bite of the apple and then decided it was not correct, but I would hate to set a precedent where owners felt that they could go ahead with construction when every duck was not lined.
So I think we should go with that judgment, call on landmarks, bar, except the fact that the building is higher, except the fact that there are many precedents for doing that, and then it comes down to accept a simple, integrated design.
It sounded like there was a point made during the presentation that the the rear of the structure was not part of the landmarks designation.
Supporting it in its entirety, because I think that's what people want more people, want, We were asked to approve maintaining the built wall.
We have an open application with landmarks for minor work or a minor amendment to be bulkhead materials and rear facade, but they wanted to have us present the entry door replacement as they deemed it could not be reviewed at a staff.
