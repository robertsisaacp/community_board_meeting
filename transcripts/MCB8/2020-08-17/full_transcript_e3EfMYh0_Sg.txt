C, foreign one, this a thank will yes, hi Jane hi. I hope this is a short meeting. Jane, I'm expecting you to make it a short meeting. Oh no, but you are better at that than me well. Do we have old business or new business? I hope neither well I'm sure. Elizabeth will want to discuss the zoom meeting with Sarah Carroll. It's a zoom meeting, not an in person! No is not it. A zoom meeting will correct yeah. Are we going to be able to see you I'm just looking at the agenda? Oh yeah you're, I'm here. Okay, how do I? Oh? I see? Okay, I had I had turned off my camera. While I was getting everything set up. Okay, I'm trying to get the. I can see you, but I do not see anybody else. I thought right now. You can get the gallery view, but I do not seem to be able to be able to do that. There's only three of us right now that our cameras on Michelle has a black screen. Okay, but usually I can see everyone but oh well, you're on an ipad yeah, but usually, if I click on the left side, I can get the see everyone, but some for some reason. It's not working tonight. That's odd yeah! Maybe because right now, I'm sharing my screen. Oh that's! Why that's? That is it! That is it'll change in a second okay. Thank you. The Ana Fox Anthony Khan is here. We've only got one minute to when the meeting starts. I'm really hoping a lot of them show up right on time is Fox an applicant. I do not. I do not know who Anna Foxx is. I have the list of the folks speaking for for item one and item two, so an applicant would have to be visible, yeah, Greg, adrian Craig, Hiller or hill from. Are you the person speaking on behalf of item two greg? Yes, okay, great? What is your last name? Hitler? I'm sorry, yeah I'll, leave you as greg H. If that's, if it's your preference, it does not matter. It's fine, okay, one and I'll. Take two! It's always better. If you take one jane, oh no, this time, you're taking one- I took one last time and it was so long. Well, let's hope it's just apparently, okay, it looks like a gigantic set of drawings for just a parapet. If I have to do it, they won't get it till next week. I see a lot of focus. That's fine! That's fine! If it's next week, I think we have more time this time. Oh I see. Oh there's a big group here: okay yeah. We just had a lot of folks join right on time. So, okay! Well, I think we can start is Elizabeth here. I do not know. Elizabeth is here: okay, oh yes, you're right, oh and Russell squire is here, that's interesting! Russo! Welcome! Will I think we can start? Do you want to sort of tell people how to vote or that use your little yeah I'll, give my normal Spiel so for anyone, that's who it's their first time at one of our virtual board meetings or committee meetings. Everyone is muted and they're unable to unmute themselves to try to cut down on the background noise, and so how you'll have to be recognized by Jane and David is by using the raise hand, feature in the participants menu. So if you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll see some actually I'll stop sharing my screen. So it's a little easier for everybody to see you'll see at the bottom of your screen, a button that says participants and it looks like two little people standing next to each other and has the number 20 next to it. So you'll open that box and you'll see a button on the box as you open it. That has a little hand up and says Ray's hand. That's the only way you'll be able to be recognized by Jane and David. So do not try to wave at us through your videos because we might miss it. The chat is there for anybody. If you have any questions, you can chat me and ask me a question about the software other than that it looks like we have our folks for the first presentation. Thank you will good evening. This is the August meeting of the Landmarks Committee of Community Board 8.. We have two applications for certificates of appropriateness. We will hear from the applicant then from the public and then the committee will go into executive session and formulate a resolution that will be sent directly to the commission. There is no full board meeting in August for Community Board eight. So with that, I think we will proceed to item number one David Halpern. The co- chair will take number one: 220 east 61st, Street, Treadwell, Farm, Historic, District, Paige, Airs, Cowley, architect, late Anglo, italianate style house, designed by F S barnes in 1871. application is to keep the existing condition of the built parabolic wall in place without modification and who's. Here to present I have Paige and Eric and Gustavo you guys can all unmute yourselves right below that. I should say event detail. You may need to push a button at the bottom of your screen. I see Eric and Gustavo. I do not see there. She is yeah. We're here. Paige is having trouble logging on right now. So give me one second hello page. So will somebody tell me the true scope of this project? Is I mean by clicking all right, because I'm going to mute you for a second, while you're figuring everything out Eric you're in you're in charge of responding? I'm sorry! What was the question eric? What's the true scope of this project? It's talking about a parapet, a very large set of drawings yeah. So we, the paige, will go into a little bit more detail when she joins, but we we have a permit for minor work and a certificate of no effect. I was multiple parts to the project. It was a rooftop addition and the parapet is. There was a an issue with the rear wall, Rear Parapet and we had an approved design approved set of drawings, and there was some disagreement with landmarks when we went to get final sign- offs about the detail of that paradigm. So that's what we're here to talk about today, so we have to go back to to a public hearing, because it's the staff is not able to approve the as well condition as it's constructed and it's the rear power up, rear, paraben yeah. I'm not able to see if she's on or not Paige did just sign on. So I'm going to unmute her page, you may have to confirm at the bottom of your screen. Hey. We can't hear you. Oh sorry, I just muted you back. I'm try that again. Okay, we good we're good all right. Thank you very much. Come all on, I'm here all right, you're up paige, oh hi, good evening, everyone, my name is Paige Cowley, I'm principal and founder of pack up page airs, Cali architecture. Our firm was retained by Mr Prasanth Rao Kathy, owner of 220 e 61st in June of 2017, with construction commencing. Shortly thereafter in August 2017., the initial scope of work was limited to the Interior and the installation of a small single passenger elevator. During the construction phase, there were additions to the scope of work, first repairs and modification of an existing rear balcony. At the second floor and a modest rooftop edition set back from 64th street and not visible from the street, the project was filed with the department of buildings, with several structural and architectural amendments to keep pace with the changes in the school of work. All of the work was inspected by the appropriate DOB section heads representatives and signed off by the Department of buildings. There were four LPC permits filed and issued at stat level staff level as per the U.S ltc requirements, all of the permits required or certificate of no effect. The first cne was for interior work issued on June, 2nd 2017, signed off by the LPC on December 13 2018. The second one was interior structural work issued on November 20th 2017, signed off by the LPC on December 13 2018, the Rear balcony, issued on October 4th 2018 and signed off on February 19th 2019, and the rooftop edition that included the architectural structural and HVAC issued on May 25th 2018. This one remains open as a result of a final site visit by the LPC. This inspection was called for on January 23 2019. We had all the final DOB sign- offs ready to go to close out any open permits and to call for a temporary certificate of occupancy. We had assumed that the LPC had been in sync with all of our submissions. We are here this evening because, although all the required permits were issued and approved all, but the final cne was signed off, the LPC at their final site visit took exception to the rear parapet wall that conformed to our submission. Our documents that were approved that showed the proposed work and the executed construction conforms to what we actually had shown on our documents. This construction is not visible from the public thoroughfare, I'm going to step back and let Eric take you through some meetings that we had with LPC starting in January 2019.. Please note that our owner of the building moved into the townhouse prior to the December holidays. We did not need the DOB final Tco, because there was one because it was a single family residence. They had. The client had sold their previous residence and wanted to settle their children before the restart of the school year in January. So that's the timeline and the scope of work eric over to you. Okay, so we had a meeting and several discussions with LPC staff to debate potential solutions to this condition. The staff agreed that the increase in the parapet, height was modest, and but they recommended that we construct and apply a molded polymer panel to the rear wall. To recall the brick coiling that was removed- and this is this type of detail- is not something that we typically recommend not only in terms of appearance, but also longevity. It would have to have been applied to the rear wall after construction was already completed and after the client had already moved in and occupied the building. The client was not present during any of these discussions with LPC staff, and he has not agreed to that solution. He wants the rear of his building to remain as it was initially designed and initially approved by LPC. So my colleague Gustavo will show you some drawings and diagrams to illustrate the azvil condition and the area that's subject for discussion here in the presentation or just for clarity before you start on that. What is the material that landmarks wanted you to put on the parapet? They had suggested that we put it like an artificial power, polymer panel applied to the to the rear wall, to recall the core bling gosh. Your microphone is a little distorted okay anyway. So we're ready for the presentation, please, you should be able to share your screen figure I'll start from the beginning. So, as you can see, this is the property that we are talking about. Discussing 220 east 61St street. The front of the facade has no decorative elements, has no stoop no cornice, and you can not see the rooftop edition, which is the reason why it was a staff level approval you can see in the 1940 tax photo. Nothing much has changed since then, there was by the time the building was designated. All ornamentation had already been stripped from the facade, and the definition report does not mention anything about the real facade, any corvolene or anything other than just adjacent buildings that maintain their cornices and decoration. 220 east 51st street was just part of the roadhouse, as you can see in the approved roof plan by LPC and DOB department of buildings. We had, we always showed the roof, the rear balcony and the rear turrets and the rear railings all the way to the edge of the property line, all the way to the edge of the back of the back wall, including the rear parasite wall. In our proposed drawings. We in the elevations, the one on the right is the rear elevation and we all. We called out the height of the fourth floor, the height of the terrace and the height of the railing, showing that intent of the proper wall going to the top and meeting with the railing, because we can not have a floating railing in the rear facade. We did show the line of the previous existing roof and I'll show you in the section why we did that. So in the side view you can see and designed this rooftop edition to set it back, we also had to deal with the slope of the roof, how to float from the front to the back. That was in a detail that we had to figure out to manage the water drainage, so this shows the real existing roof which we use for the water drainage, and you can see in the back right at the edge. We have the railing and we have the terrace going into the private wall. In section you see more of the structure, so you can see how the water was meant to run underneath the addition and run out the back to maintain the existing drainage system in the back for that section of the roof, and these enhanced edition, enlarged elevations you can see on the bottom- is the rear elevation that we're talking about, and you can see the height of the terrace, the height of the railing. Here you can see the photograph of the before and the after and the asphalt. So you can see clearly in the before picture, how the parabolic walls never really aligned. So it was not a consistent straight level. You could see the corvolene which, in our building was already modified. It was cut to allow for the drainage. It was actually cut on both sides. Where you see on the adjacent buildings that went to the end and the in the asphalt condition as we installed the terrace and the new fourth floor, the gutter moved up. So we never intended to put back any corvolene because it would just be alien to the structure floating in the middle of the rear wall, because assuming it would need to line up with the adjacent and will not support the gutter anymore. The gutter is now elevated to catch the water. From the from the upper floor, you can see we have a little scupper to guide the water from the front, and that remains the same as was back before in the existing condition. So here is a rear elevation showing the similar to the picture, just a drawing showing the existing and the and the before and the. After again, we called out the height of the of the roof and the parapet and the turrets during construction. The reason why we initially removed the carboline and well besides that we never intended to have it there. When we saw our construction, we had lowered the we removed the roof and we found that the rear wall had set delaminated from the structure. So the power bit has to be moved down almost to the window level and reconstructed in the reconstruction. In order to support the fourth floor above and the deck and the roof deck, a steel beam had to be installed and, in addition to tie in the existing roof and the drainage and the whole entire new waterproofing membrane had to be wrapped around the inside and installed within the structure and the reappraisal wall. So you can see in the following photographs. How is one big system that works together? The private wall, with the structure and the waterproofing to allow for proper drainage and safety for the railings and for people not to fall off? You can see on the drawing on the side how we, how we show the water, drainage and the steel in place and the whole construction tied together in our discussions with landmarks. They want us to do analysis of the real facades just to show them how amazing the side of the roof will not be chewed or unheard of in this location, and, as you can see what we did, we mapped out the rear elevation of every building on this block and none of the rear character walls line up at all, including you can see. Some of the buildings have had higher editions and some of them have had equipment and modifications in total. When we, when we look at this, we did an analysis. We found that 19 out of 19 buildings have real facilitations. One story or more 14 out of 19 of these buildings have reader editions, including bulkhead additions or fencing around mechanical equipment. Nine out of nine out of these 19 buildings have real top conditions and we also discovered an analysis looking at the quarterly you can see in the next photo that not all the quality is the same, and not all the buildings have bubbling in this real facade. In this rear elevation of these buildings, we found four three different types of corbyn. We found sodium without problem and we found six different configurations of those different types of coraline, so there's nothing that it was nothing consistent in the rear. It was nothing that you know lined up and made. It seem like a uniform appearance for all these buildings to have the same quality acrosss, and you can see in these two other pictures more examples of the rear editions. The rooftop editions, the built out edition you can see you know one building has even a whole new storm to the side. It does not match the brick of the underbuilding. You can see. On the other side the modifications to the corbelline, some of them have dopamine. Some of them do not have. Some of them are angled. Some of them are straight. So in general there was nothing meant to keep these callings in place, but I believe at this time I could turn it over to our on more of the construction aspect of what word intel that we need to put back this quarterly more discussion. I think he was trying to hand over to fred. You may have to push a button there. You go, I did good evening everyone, so we, the plan, showed that the cordling was going to go and speaking with the structural engineers, we've all decided that look. It was compromised. I think a lot of these buildings are compromised in some of the structures of the top walls where all the roofs have been mended and so on. It was sort of puzzling to us that we got to the end after landmarks had visited the site. You know a few times and never kind of mentioned this before, but in talking about putting back a cordling in a situation like this in a property that has no rear access, so you have to go through the house in order to get to the backyard and we're talking about erecting scaffolds, sidewalk bridges covering the neighbors and our own properties, just to put a coiling back that, like Gustavo just said, is not exactly the same as any other one. I'm not sure that that's sort of a solution at this point, so the structural integrity. Behind this that, I think the structural engineer was here. He might want to talk about the complications of us. Actually, having to take that wall down, it's not as easy as taking just 12 rows of brick down incorporating the cordling and putting it back up. You know the owner[ Applause], who I have to deal with directly. All the time is sort of very upset about this whole scenario of how we ended up here with this sort of unclosed project. So I'm going to leave it to the structural engineer, just to explain a little bit about the structural integrity of how we're going to how we would have to even move forward with this, and- and that's christian. This is to rebuild to put corbelling in. Is that correct? That's correct, yes, yeah! So I just want to add that we discovered that the whole rear wall and the parapet have been compromised and it had to be taken down to the level of the existing roof and we were to be rebuilt and also well the roof structure in the. If you see here, the roof structure has to be reinforced and we basically built another structure on top of that for the little rear terrace and to allow like Paige was saying to allow for drainage to go. You know under the new terrace and into the original roof. So we put a steel beam and to support the new railing and the new terrace and in order to take down the parapet to the original level or even to try to build it the core but have to deal with it with a steel beam, it's more complicated than it meets the eye. I mean, probably if you have to put like a easy, Like, polymer corbeling, but that should not match that would not match anything there. In order to put this, a more serious corbin would have to take down and rebuild the parapets temporary shore. The beam that's there and you know deal with the waterproof figure. Roof figure everything. So it's a it's a pretty complicated process just to do the new corbeling there so yeah it has structural implications. I'm sure fred can talk about like the warranty of the waterproofing and the roofing and everything else that will be damaged during this well, I do not think we want to get too technical right as a landmarks committee. It's our rule to our mission to look at appropriateness and it's interesting to understand the technical issues, but it seems to me that we have to decide whether what you have done is appropriate or whether putting cordling in would be appropriate. So I think, unless there's a lot more, that we need to hear, I think fred. Maybe you should finish up or we'll never and give the committee a chance to comment yeah I mean I think the committee could take over at this point. I would just like to say out of you know all my years doing landmark: preservation work throughout the city. You know, look as a builder, there's always complications and there's always things that we'll have to face of what could stay, what can't stay if something's damaged? How do we replace it? How do we change it in this case? That was not really where our focus was besides. Taking down what was already damaged, the structure that we had it was that we, you know had it designed a certain way, but again it was just amazing to us not to be picked up until the end of the project. Until everything was finished, I hear you, I hear what happened with the process. I just want to make sure we're all clear on the process that there were four certificates of no effect. The fourth one was never fully approved, but she went ahead, got DOB approval on all the work did all the work and landmarks came back at the end on the basis that the took the fourth certificate of no effect, which applies to this condition, was never fully approved and therefore they have the right to clarify it was. It was approved that the drawings were all approved and perforated if they were, it was a misinterpretation of our drawings by the staff when they came back in the end, when we were trying to get the sign off so it was, it was in fact approved and perforated, so you're saying that it was approved and the staff decided after they approved it, that they had misunderstood what you were intending that's right and therefore they wanted you to do a major reworking of what they had actually approved that yes and therefore you now have to get a certificate of appropriateness for what's built. I believe so. That's right. I just want to make sure that we all understand the context in which we're going to be talking about this. Essentially, the certificate of no effect was approved. Dob was approved. Okay, it was all built, but landmarks decided that they had misunderstood your drawings and therefore they want you to redo it right with corbin, correct okay, so I think I do not know if there's anybody from the public there who wants to talk. Okay, you wanted to comment. Yes, I did. Am I unmuted yeah? Okay, I just wanted to say everything had been approved. That's why I went through the issuance of a permit. We would never have done the work had we not had the permit and the Landmarks Commission throughout the process. It was an open door because of the sequence of the owner, making decisions to keep increasing the scope of work. It was a rolling process until we ended the construction. The issue is not only just putting the corbel back, but it's putting a fake cordle back on the back of the building and the owner believes that we filed everything correctly. It went through the building's department, it went through landmarks, we were given approval. The permit was issued the contractor in good faith built it the way it should be to repair the back wall and that's why we can't go back and make a real corbel. It would be applied and, in my practice, putting something fake back. That could be a problem to maintain and collect birds etc. Where we could never reach it. Just does not make sense and the person missing in all of these discussions we had with landmarks was the owner and he believes in good faith. The work was submitted, it was approved and it was constructed exactly the way we showed it through Christians structural drawings and our our architectural set. So that's why we're in this predicament we're not asking for a certificate of appropriateness. The actual odd type of thing that you're discussing tonight is to, as it says, the application is to keep existing condition of the built parapet while in place without modification, so I've never I've never been in this position before and I believe we've now satisfied all of the preservation requirements and that, frankly, of the owner end of story for me thanks. Well, we would we know your firm well enough to know you would never do anything inappropriate from a process point of view, nor from a design point of view, if you were to have wanted to put a corbel in, would a real corbel have been possible when you were designing it not really because again with you could see the height of the steel, it would be floating in space. I mean it's an interesting question. David you raised because most of the time we try to put- or we do not want to have scrambled eggs and just rearrange details, but if it were possible to recreate that canted brick and put the gutter in some reasonable proximity on top of it, I think we would have done it and for whatever reason it was not done and I to be honest. This goes back over two years ago, so I can't remember all the discussion, but we wanted something that would be very easy to build and, as you can see, the aggressive schedule we will work. Fred was working there almost well, not illegally, but he had a huge crew with the different permits going at the same time. All I can say is: it was not featured in any discussions with the staff who were wonderful. They came they liked fred, they enjoyed the project, but they never ever mentioned anything about the corporal until after all of the work was completed, that's the tragedy here. Okay, so that so what we're being asked to talk about as a committee and rule on whether we call it a c of a or not it's the equivalent from our point of view, is a polymer corbel which still requires some rebuilding or is it okay, as it is, that's really what our options are tonight? Is that correct? Yes, okay, so again, I'll ask if there's anybody in the public who would like to comment? I guess we go to the committee. I was just going to give a friendly reminder for everybody, because we have a few people who joined that they need to raise their hand through the participants menu. If you have any questions, sorry- and I think why do not- we do what we did last time- we'll start alphabetically going forward and then alphabetically going backwards. So with this one, why do not we go forwards? So I guess that's Elizabeth, but I'm going to rely on. You will, because you have the names in front of you, although I could probably I have them in front of me so you're in good hands. Hopefully Elizabeth you're unmuted, oh okay, do you have a drawing of what was originally approved and what they now want you to do side by side so that I can compare it. I must say I'm extremely sympathy. I have a great deal of sympathy for the applicant in this situation, but I think, in order to do what we're supposed to do, I would like to see what the actual issue is. I mean the physical issue is: can we compare what they want now and what you got approval for? Should I answer that? Yes, that's fine! That's fine! Yes, the issue is no because the we do not have a side- by- side. Comparison. We've studied the issue of where that gutter line would be, it would not be at the top, it would be somewhere floating and the problem is the owner does not want that detail. We he likes the clean lines and the very you know we did follow the type of the gutter and the spirit of how the gutter was placed. So we sort of reinterpreted in the current top part of the parapet. Wall we've interpreted it the way it would have been, but we never put the corals back, because it would be too difficult with all of the anchorages that would be required. Fred. You might want to add something to that, but that's the gist of it. If that helps so Elizabeth well, we know that technically it's a problem. I guess the only thing that you can show Elizabeth is some of the photographs again the carboling. You know on some of the other houses or we can even get a close- up of the carboling that was on the current house. We do have an existing conditions photo. That was to the left of the photo. The panel you were just looking at and these are, as Gus said, we did a study of all of the corbeling that exists in the perimeter block. We actually did both sides of the perimeter block the donut and they're all different and they're all compromised in some ways. Some are missing: teeth to allow cell towers and communications to creep up party walls. I can't really point to one that's perfect. While I'm driving towards Paige is, if I go to the left hand, side- and I go to the second picture on the top on the right, where you have gutters with cordling under it, one is white was red. I mean essentially that's what we're talking about. Yes, absolutely thank you David, and there is no cobbling on the current. No there's no karbaling as built part of the issue is that you know our gutter had to be raised up higher by necessity, and you know it's a question of you know you're putting the core bling in where the cordling used to be it's no longer supporting the gutter as it was originally intended to do. Well, I do not think anybody would have expected the cordling to just float there. I think the name of the game would have been to simulate. What was there once upon a time with a higher cutter and a higher court? The question is how it's built, and do we want to put in something which is a fake representation of what might have been done correctly once upon a time yeah. It is there a very lightweight mater because this obviously is at the top of the building. So it is not like looking at it on the ground floor. Is there some lightweight material that can be used up there to replicate what the korviling would have been? That's what landmarks trying to think of a way that would be easy to, because I think it is too bad that you've lost the kobeling, but I see the problem and that you were not required to put it in there. So so I'm just trying to find a way, a middle ground and there's a lot of stuff that I've seen put up that you know on the fourth floor or something or other looks fine. You would not look good on the ground floors. I do not know when we have architects on our committee, so maybe they know something that can be done well. The applicant has already given you the answer. They can put up a lightweight material, basically pasting it on, and the reality is that it would not be integral and it would not be real and landmarks does accept substitute materials, for example, they'll accept fiberglass instead of metal sometimes, but it's done the way the metal would have been done. This is just a paste on and I'm surprised that landmarks would even I do not want to tell you how I'm going to vote right now, but I would be surprised that landmarks would even suggest pasting something on, but apparently they are and we have to decide whether something that is going to look like what landmarks decides today, they'd like it to look at look like versus something which was designed and approved as a design that had integrity to it. I think I'm trying to figure out if we can get the design that has integrity when the materials do not. I think it'd be very difficult in the longevity of it also, you would not have the same longevity on something like that. It would probably come down in about 25 years. In any event, I think you've said it very well Elizabeth. Can we make it look the way landmarks might want it to look with a lesser material that would in effect, be an application and not an integral use of the material, and I think that's really that that's really the decision do we want something which is visually one thing or something which is an integrated design, yeah. Okay, it's clear, yeah! Thank you. Okay next is Gail Baron Gail you're unmuted, since I did not hear the presentation I'll pass. Thank you next to me Michelle then Michelle yeah. So let me just understand something that I'm just unfamiliar with this, and I want to understand something the gutters are running there because of course you need the drainage and in order to put in the cordless, reconstructed or, however, it has to go under the gutter, and so it will look like it's floating nowhere. So, if that's the case, can I ask you why the gutter is not running from the top of the addition down the side and wherever else it has to go down the side of the building for drainage? Why is the gutter starting from the rooftop, but not the rooftop, of the addition, and if it were to start at the rooftop of the addition, could that solve your problem in the sense that the drainage would be coming down the sides of the structure leaving the immediate top of the original structure free to install a corbola? So am I understanding this or misunderstanding the possibilities here? Well, I think, if the little hand can go to the in this section, we have the equivalent of a corbel spain, with the gutter running underneath the balcony in the front. That's that little piece that sticks out, so we have a gutter at the top or in the upper part of the rooftop edition, has its own gutter system that feeds into it. On the left hand, side where the ladder is where the gutter, the drainage from the rooftop edition, comes to the terrace, and then it goes into a gutter and joins the original leader. We thought that was important to keep. The only thing that's missing is the quarbling, because we needed structurally reinforced masonry to tie the delaminated rear wall, so we could not put the cordling back in. There was a four inch separation between the top floor and the actual structures. Christian and Fred pointed out our builder, so we did the best we could and we mimicked the line of the gutter. We could have concealed the gutter on the top all together, but we said no. This is the way these buildings were drained, so we put the gutter as it was just lifted higher, but no cordline, because we could not cantilever the brick without compromising the integrity of that ditched. Wall. Okay, I understand that so basically, there was no way to make the gutter on top of the addition adequate for drainage down the side and bypassing a gutter on the original construction. That's really my question: was that not a possibility michelle the gutter on the page? Yes, please do I just want to end this. The gutter on the addition has nothing to do with the gutter, on the edge of the building they're totally separate gutters, and the fact that they tie together, which they do for drainage, is not what we're really talking about. What we're talking about is the gutter at the edge of the building on the main roof line, and that gutter has to be there one way or the other well. That was precisely my question: did that gutter have to be there because, in other words, that the one at the top of the addition could not suffice with sufficient drainage down the side? So if that's the case, then that was my question. Thank you. The answer is that you have to have that gutter. Next, please next, is our board chair, Lita, all right first, I just want to say that I know Paige and have tremendous respect for her work so high Paige. Second, I this committee has asked owners when they've not complied with certain landmarks decisions, to go back and fix them. However, as Elizabeth said, I'm also sympathetic to the owner, on the other hand, that the owner likes the streamlined modern look is not sufficient for me, so I'm not really sure. Where I stand. I know it's artificial and applied still. It went with the original building. It fits in with the neighbors in some way that it's floating, I think, makes it peculiar. So I'm really I'm just really not sure and I'm anxious to hear what my colleagues say. Thank you. So next would be Sarah Chu. I do not see her here. So if you are here Sarah and just under a different name, please raise your hand. Otherwise I'm going to move on to Anthony. I think there are a couple of things here. This is the rear, facade the landmarks approved it as built and is now coming back for what could be described as the second bite of the apple, and it seems to me that there that gluing, a plastic facade, putting a plastic core ball to the to the existing masonry wall is just silly and that's all I have to say after anthony is Marco. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, my first impression is, and the last permit is the issue that you can not sign off and you say do not look at that. Look the curviline, because the carbon is the bad guy right here. That does not allow me to finish, and the curviline is less important than the gutter. The gutter you can address in the I would like to discuss if you wanted construction, but this is not the issue right here. I have many years doing discount buildings in construction too. So I have a lot of experience in that part and to hear that the structural engineer is does not have a solution. Well, I respect that, but I'm not going in that direction. I'm going to limit my opinion exclusively in about the issue of the extension and, if you or see the next, can you pass the next drawing please? Yes, that one as you see clearly, you yourself show that is the only extension in that block. You were changing the character completely in that part, and I think this is why La, the other was not the other taller buildings and the other this one as smaller and in this smaller one you will that create a precedent to everybody in that block to continue. This is minor enlargement. So the point is that, for that part, probably that trigger the issue that they, that landmark, does not want to approve you, the rooftop edition, so going back to the to the parapet that you want one us to discuss- and I think I consider is wrong because we have to see as they met they. Actually, what is the problem right here? Their problem started because you do you need an enlargement that they were approved, somebody the Ob. We do not care the origin. The only thing I care as long as with the zoning resolution, and then you have enough for area they do not care, but they ca. The only thing institution that carry this is, according with the historical value, is landmark, but you are saying that it was approved, but, however, even that they were approved now you are, you can not close the rooftop addition, so my concern is in that direction and paige. I know that you're, a very good professional and I respect always your opinions, and always I know that you are in the West side, also with the same predicament, but in this case I think it's wrong completely, and I completely I'm going to this myself, I'm going to go against this application because it does not say the truth and if we allowed to do that from now on, everybody is going to do the rooftop additions and then we'll come with parapets with something else, and I think we have to stop this predicament and for myself I think I'm strongly go in the direction. Thank you Jane. I guess it's your turn. Well, David, it's a very confusing application, but I have to say that marco made a very good point about setting a precedent. I'm still confused that landmarks in theory approved and then, as Anthony said, took a second bite of the apple and then decided it was not correct, but I would hate to set a precedent where owners felt that they could go ahead with construction when every duck was not lined up. So I'm going to have to go with marco on the principle of setting the precedent and vote against the application. Thank you. I think that Paige and her group have done an excellent job on the rear facade. It's simple: it's in keeping with the rest of the building the fact that it's a little higher than the other buildings. That happens all the time that precedent has been there and I do not think we're setting a new precedent. In fact, you can see it as you look at that line of buildings and we have certainly approved facades that are a lot more contemporary, a lot more modern where the fronts were actually far more ornate, and yet the backs were far more modern. Here you have a back which is much more associated with the front, so I think that the architects actually did an excellent job in doing something very simple and appropriate, particularly given the relationship between the front and the back. I do not buy this thing about this as a precedent. That's going to change the rules, acrosss the Upper East side. That's a ridiculous idea. In all deference to my colleagues that President is there already many times and I think the name of the game is we look at this from point of view of appropriateness, it's the appropriateness with the respect to each individual situation, and sometimes you want to maintain the cornice line, and sometimes you do not. But I do not think this is one of those times when maintaining the cornice line is what's critical. Not only that landmarks did not think it was critical to maintain the cornice line, they accepted the fact that the building could go higher. So I think we should go with that judgment call on landmarks bar, except the fact that the building is higher, except the fact that there are many precedents for doing that, and then it comes down to accept a simple, integrated design, that's appropriate in terms of front and rear, or do we want to? You know, as Anthony pointed out paste something on top of this building, which is not appropriate from a constructional point of view, and certainly not from the point of view of the long- term, stability of the building, the weathering of the material and the long- term. Look of the material long- term. This is going to look much better than applying a piece of plastic. So my vote is to please vote to approve the rear, facade as it is to prove the parapet as it is David you still have Christina Davis from as a public member and two I did not, and then you have two other board members who are also here. I did not know okay. Well, let's go to them. They've heard my point of view. Christina you may need to do something to unmute. I think it's star six or Star nine star six. I believe okay Christina otherwise going in alphabetical order Harrison. I did not see, but I see now and russell my apologies for jumping in because I know you're here, Kristen you're good to go any questions or comments. We can't hear you if you're speaking, hello. Yes, sorry, can you hear me? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, we can harrison. Oh okay, sorry about that. I was having a Mic issue, any questions or comments. No, I think I'm pretty much set. I think everyone did a great job of you know exploring this topic thoroughly and Russell. Thank you. So I mean I do not have too much to add. That has not already been said, but I think basically, on the one hand, you know I'm very sensitive to the idea. I think. Ordinarily, you know if there was quarbling before there should be corbelling after, but I think here there are unusual circumstances that were not a sort of departure from that, and also that, I think, mitigate the concerns about the precedent that we're selling I mean. I just think this is sort of an unusual situation that that does not make it as strictly President presidential, as I think folks are concerned about, and also I think precedent is sort of what we make of it. But I think the fact that the applicant basically relied on you know in good faith on the original commission finding in doing what they did. I think you know I think we should take that into account. I do think the fact that it's in the back means that you know that sort of ways in favor of approval. For me also as Anthony noted- and I do it sounded like there was a point made during the presentation that the the rear of the structure was not part of the landmarks designation. So I sort of defer to others on the committee as to how significantly we should weigh that, but that does seem to be somewhat significant, but I think, most importantly, is just the fact that it does not appear that there is any more appropriate alternative to what's been done here, and so I think, if the focus really is on appropriateness in the absence of a solution, that's really more appropriate and then the face of basically our best guess as to what the alternative would be. We it seems like it would be, it would be less appropriate from a landmark's perspective, I'm inclined to approve the proposal. Have we covered everybody? What about Christina? There was Christina, I'm trying to get her to unmute, but I can't get her to unmute, so she may have set the phone down or something well. Okay, we've now spent an hour on appeared to be a simple application. So we've seen it raise your hand Christina. Would you hit Star six and see if you can unmute is well, I do not know what's happening, but I'm hearing Marco not Christian, that's that seems to be what was happening. I really like to bring this tournament. I think we could go to a vote Dave, it's what I just said Jane this is it's getting. You know a little bit out of hand. So why do not we formulate a resolution? Well, I would like somebody to formulate oh yeah. Well, it sounds like it's a move to approve. Could I can I make a friendly amendment, hello, Elizabeth. We hear you hello Elizabeth. Can you hear us? He can't hear us, please Elizabeth. We can hear you I'm going to chat here. Elizabeth. Can you hear us hello? Can you hear me? Okay, Elizabeth? Yes, you can hear us. We can hear you hi. Can you hear me? Yes, okay. I think that the application, so our position should reflect what we're requested is it'll save people on the appropriateness position. The application is to maintain the existing wall and I think that if we stick to that, then more people will be comfortable. Supporting it in its entirety, because I think that's what people want more people want, I think that's right forget appropriateness, because we were not asked to do that. We were asked to approve maintaining the built wall. Thank you, Elizabeth. That's a good way of raising the resolution. I think that's what was intended, but thank you for the language. Are we ready to vote? No, all right. I will get up the vote sheet. Everybody should hopefully see a vote sheet now we're just going to go through. This is a an approval for item one Elizabeth. Yes, Gail, are you still unmuted? You are yeah. Yes, you michelle you're, so unmuted, yes, Alita, yes, and I know this may not be the appropriate time but David. I would ask if you could put in the whereas clauses, just very specific language about why this is different for everyone is concerned about precedent. Setting of this. Thank you anthony, yes, David, yes Jane. I just wanted to say that the reason I'm voting a no is because I'm so confused by the application. So please put me down as a no marco. You may have to mute. Thank you, I'm sorry. This is not the right to say that but yeah, but I'm going to vote no, but I think we have to start discussing about parliament procedure because, according with parliament procedure, the chairs are completely impartials in this process and it has to allow the applicant to speak whatever they want and as we supposed to debate and whatever direction we want, and obviously the chair has the opportunity to say whatever he wants to, but this is a parliament procedure a leader. This is not the first time that happened in all the community meetings and thank you so much, I'm sorry to bring another leash. Thank you so Christina I see you're still following along, I got your email, so just email me your vote. If that's acceptable for David and Jane, yes, fine with me, okay Kim is not here harrison. You can hear me. Yes, yes, I'm voting. Yes! Thank you all right. Thank you russell! Yes, thank you all right on to the second one. Thank you. We're moving along to number two 49 east 68th street between Park and Madison avenues, the Upper, East, Side, Historic district. The application is to replace the existing double entry. Doors on the architect is Jg Knock. Is he here? Is he ready to present? I believe Greg is going to present on behalf. Yes, right could great what is your last name? Greg Hitler, I'm sorry Hitler! Yes, thank you. Okay, thank you can proceed all right good evening. Everyone, my name is Greg. I work for Jg, Newcomb, Architecture, John Newcomb is the principal and I'm the project architect for 49 East, 68Th Street I'll. Try to keep this relatively brief share my screen here. So we are currently under construction for a renovation at the property. We started construction last year in August and we're aiming to complete construction in September of 2021.. We have an open application with landmarks for minor work or a minor amendment to be bulkhead materials and rear facade, but they wanted to have us present the entry door replacement as they deemed it could not be reviewed at a staff level. So, just to give you a little bit of context, the property is located at 68th Street between Madison and Park Avenue, we're on the north side of 68th. One lot in from park here are just a couple of quick views of 68th street. To give you a little bit of context, the buildings at the top are looking south on 68th and the photos at the bottom are looking north. You can see our site here and one lot in from Park Avenue. So here are a couple quick photos for your reference. The photo on the left is the primary facade prior to us, starting construction. You'll, see here that, prior to this photo being taken, that the front entry doors were taken away to storage for protection and replaced with these temporary doors for construction access. The two photos on the middle and right are tax photos from 1915, and I believe this one's actually from 1940.. I do want to point out that in the 1915 photo there are a pair of white doors here, so the existing doors that we currently have are not the original. So here are two older photos dating back to August 2013. These are the existing doors that we currently have in storage that we are proposing to replace you'll see. These are both black painted black rail and style, steel doors, brass hardware and a decorative scrim on the front. I want to point out that there is about a five foot setback from the sidewalk. There are a few steps up to a landing in the area way and then an additional step up to the door threshold. So real quick. Just to give you a background on the design changes on the interior. The plan at the top shows the pre- existing plan, which we've since demoed, but excuse me so the existing ground floor plate was actually elevated, so you'd come in through the entry doors and there's about a two and a half foot step up several steps leading up to the ground floor plate. The plan at the bottom is our current construction plan, where we've lowered the floor plate so that the ground floor entry is now flush with the entry doors. The point of this being is you'll see further along in our rendered elevation that we want to propose doing a semi-, transparent glass in the doors, as opposed to the current clear glass. The rationale behind this is that now there is an increased sight line into the entry foyer and we just want to give the owner a bit more privacy now that this condition has changed. So here is just a elevation, showing our proposed doors in the context of the front facade one more slide here. So this is the comparison of the existing and the proposed. On the left hand, side are the existing entry doors, as I mentioned, they're a steel frame with decorative mill work with a painted black semi- gloss finish. The hardware is brass you'll, see, there's a brass knob on the right door leaf and on the door, the left door leaf, there's a brass mail slot and strike, and the existing doors had a clear, transparent glazing. The rendered elevation on the right are the proposed new entry doors, they're, a solid bronze profile and we're proposing a oil rub bronze finish, we'd like to change the hardware to a lever within the sketching plate and, as I mentioned, with the floor, plate difference we'd like to give the owner more privacy, so we're proposing a semi-, transparent glass in these and you'll, see here that we'd like to remove the mail slot from the left door leaf for security purposes. So real, quick here, just some materials. The photo here on the left is the door hardware that we're proposing the lever for both door leaves the image in the center is the semi-, transparent glass. We still want to get some light through, but again want to have some obscurity for the interior and then the photo on the right there's a range of bronze samples for reference, but we want to go relatively dark, so there is not a much of variation or difference from the existing contrast of. What's there now here is just a drawing for documentation. Again, I want to stress that we're we want to match these doors in kind, just making slight modifications to the finishes in the door hardware, but we want to keep the decorative metal front as exactly as is and lastly, here just a couple of the existing photos of the doors before they're moved to storage, so you can sort of see just the age and I they've been repainted several times we feel like we can give a contextual door that matches with a really nice finish, and that's all thank you so much. Thank you. Is there anyone from the public who wishes to speak to the application? If not we'll, go to the committee and follow David's point that will start at the end of the alphabet instead of at the beginning of the alphabet for the committee members and just to confirm, you want to go committee members, public members, other board, members, Right Jane, that's correct. I guess, although maybe the other board members have decided to join the committee, I do not know anyway go ahead. Will I all right I'm going to start then with Marco Tamayo, marco. Thank you. So much the applicant, you did the right thing in this case. Yeah. Probably the issue should be the hardware you change from brass to black. That could be an issue, probably in this case, but you know what, if we apply what we did in last application, you should not be here because, while doing construction, you modify these the scope of work and therefore the landmark should follow the same procedure with you. So you should not be right here. You should finish and when you finish, you come right here. That is the one we discussed before and I think you are doing the right thing by the way, and I appreciate that you come in and yes, you improve the when you remove the slot for the mail. I think this is much better and I like that- and I do not want to continue, but I'm going to say thank you so much and I will support this application. Thank you. Marco next would be anthony. This is fine. The essential issue here is that they've changed from painted steel to bronze they're, not the original doors, although they're old and so yeah. I will support this. Thank you, Anthony has joined us. The next person, then, would be Elita. Thank you. Thank you. I like the doors, I am okay with the finish. I do not like the lever at all. I think it does not fit the style of the door. The gorgeous detail on the metal work, the facade, and then you stick in a very utilitarian contemporary lever. It just does not make sense to me, so I just do not like the floor. Thank you. Alita next would be michelle, so you're, replacing the doors you're not stripping them down, you're, replacing them to be bronze. Is that correct, right? We're replacing these with brand new doors brand new and it'll be exactly this design, it's exactly what we're looking at, with the exception of the glass which will be semi-, transparent, correct, okay, yeah. I can support this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle. I agree with Elita. I do not particularly like the lever, but on balance, I think you did a fine job, so I can certainly support the application Elizabeth. I can support it as well. Thank you, Elizabeth. Thank you. Gail Christina, would you hit Star six at last at last? Thank you. Yes, I can support this, as I did the last one. Thank you stay unmuted. I do not want to lose you as we vote and then so Russell and then we'll go to Harrison wait. I just had a question on page nine, it looked like of the presentation. I could see the the color for the proposed new door, and I was just wondering is it was not clear to me if the among the colors that are there on the right side is the existing door. If that's the case which one it is, could you just point that out and if not you know such is it? No sorry, those are just for reference to give you a color variation. So we could see how dark it was. None of those there are the original or the existing. Excuse me. Okay, all right thanks that was live. Thank you. Harrison yeah! You guys can hear me right, yes, yeah, so I actually I really like the design of the doors and I think they'll look great and Greg. I think you did a great job on your presentation, and so I do not really have any questions. Thank you, though, David and Jane, or how are you guys? I guess me maybe go ahead yeah. I approve it. I think they'll be beautiful in bronze and you need a lever handle because of the ADA considerations, and I think that they've done a very good job and certainly have my support. Thank you. I think we can go to a vote. It sounds like a unanimous approval. If anybody wants to disapprove, could they raise their hand? Well, I do not think you have to go through the whole role on this item. Okay sounds great. I'm just going to quickly mark everybody as yes, so everybody can see it. You guys can start moving on. Thank you will I just want to make a comment on item number one which I voted no on. I just felt the presentation by the applicant could have been clear and I do not think it should have been left to Elizabeth to sort of clarify the language on what we were exactly voting on. I just wanted to make that point. I think we're ready to discuss. Is there anything under new business new business? Does anybody have any agenda item they wanted to address under new business or old business? Marco has his hand up marco, hello. Yeah, that's great! Thank you. These are going to go down as committee resolutions because the full board is not meeting. I just wanted to remind everyone of that, and then we have our Zoom meeting. Alita has arranged for the chairs and Elizabeth to meet with Sarah Carroll on a zoom meeting on September 1st. So we will report back to the committee next month, so Jane. If it's all right with you, I'd like to ask that if people have specific topics, the reason we were approached will- and I by Sarah Carroll- to set up this meeting because of all the letters that we've written and our passion of position on preservation. So if anyone has any particular topics, they would like to raise to just email all of us, Elizabeth Jane David and me- and I think if, if this is an appropriate time to say so, I think that we should just have a conference call beforehand a day or a couple days before just to cover what we want to talk about. If that's all right- and I believe, I'm speaking for will- I know I'm speaking for myself- that we'll just be in the background and leave the bulk of the discussion to Jane, David and Elizabeth in more than competent heads. Thank you. That's perfect, 100 agree. Yeah. Thank you. So much guys are the experts. Everybody enjoy the rest of August and remember we're. The only committee are not we elita who met this month so kudos to all of us, and thank you for the two new people who came Harrison and Russell. It's always nice to have new blood. You know what can I take 10 seconds and put in a plug for the Hss committee meeting next week on preparedness for a second Covid-19 surge? Oh my gosh, I do not know. Okay, yes, thank you Elizabeth just so it's out there, six o'clock, okay, I think we're ready to adjourn. Thank you have a great summer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, hello.
