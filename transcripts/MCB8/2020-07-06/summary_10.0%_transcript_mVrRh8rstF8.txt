It only works if everyone participates and it's very hard to ask someone who has little faith in our government right now, that this information won't be shared with ice and with other law enforcement agencies, or if the individual cares deeply about privacy, and so with that, I would like to turn it over to Assemblymember Godfrey to discuss the bill.
You know how local profession, What- have- you when we went to try to see where in the law is this written down So we set about to draft confidentiality legislation specifically for HIV and AIDS, and it got to be very elaborate very complicated because we wanted to be a if you're going to test people.
Or else people are not going to give up their information to city health authorities and again, I said to my son- is not there is not there confidentiality legislation to protect information, particularly with communicable diseases, as this is and again, I went to look for it and discovered guess what it is, not fair, So we very quickly working with the New York Civil, Liberties Union and several other advocacy groups.
If you're dealing with the city contact tracing people, apparently they will do things like offer to help in a hotel room for you or arranged food delivery, etc, and so we wanted to enable that information to be used for that purpose.
But we said it would have to be with the consent of the person whose information you're dealing with That's what the bill does You know, because we wanted to get a lot of people's opinions on it.
If a piece of information says this person who is 6 feet tall was in Macy's shoe department last week on Thursday, you may think that D identifies them, but if you've got all the information that Macy's and the Facebook and all those other people have about you, they probably know that you're 6 feet tall and you were in Mason shoe department last Tuesday, buying brown shoes and that your size is We put a lot of that into the bill, and so the bill says that, within after 30 days.
We authorized them to keep it an extra 15 days, if they're actually using it racing so that it is not just sitting around and certainly if it, if it turns out that the infirm, that information is generally needed longer than that you know the bill is not going to be engraved in stone, and, frankly, if between now and when it's enacted, if the State Health Department wakes up and pays attention to the bill and says: oh, my god, you know 30 days is not enough.
It can be difficult to predict these kinds of things, but you know, given that contact tracing is already going on and the sooner we can get these protections into place.
The confidentiality protection is the main thing within my you, know, work, area, okay This is just been thinking, privacy and protected information.
I. Do not think I've heard stories like that in a long time, partly because hospital records are now almost all electronic, but the health Department's confidentiality track record is pretty darn complete, but could something be written in the bill that all the information collected wherever it goes is protected?
The New, York, State, Health Department knows exactly where and when that was, and what the diagnosed and that information does not get out, and it could do a lot of damage if it did the HIV data and all of that all has a very successful record of being kept confidential.
So I did catch the previous presentation in this series about New York, City's, test and trace program, and it was incredibly illuminating about the kind of information that the program is collecting through the contact tracing efforts.
So first, you know these programs should be voluntary and it seems as though New York City's is that no one is being compelled to share information when they're called, and it really relies on a kind of active participation of the public, and that depends on trust in the system.
It's, not going to reveal the identity of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 or displaying symptoms after coming into contact with someone who's been exposed to that person's contacts when they reach out They'll just inform contacts that they may have been exposed within the relevant time period, and so that's a great starting point for maintaining anonymity of the folks who are sharing their health information with a contact tracing program.
The information that I described as being collected as part of New York's program fits the bill and it all seems directly relevant to the public health purposes that are motivating this contact, tracing effort.
But you know importantly, the fact that we're facing a current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to collect information and stockpile of government data databases for use for unknown purposes down the line.
We were just talking about this with the Assembly Bill, but the kind of detailed contact information that's being collected through these programs may largely irrelevant for public health, purposes.
It may be that contact tracing programs, as we were discussing earlier, require the detailed contact information for a longer period, just to be able to reach out to as many people as possible, but there should be some end points to the retention of the data that's being collected as part of these programs and then ideally, but information should be kind of automatically deleted.
The information should really be kept safe within the public health authority system to the fullest extent possible and fifth Systems and databases should be tested by data security experts and you know kind of examine to make sure that they're as secure as possible to prevent inadvertent disclosure or hacking, and it seems as though there may be pre, existing health, different regulations or other laws in place that assure that health information is being maintained in a secure, environment.
You know door to door kind of telephone based individuals, calling other individuals and asking for their information, and that concern relates to the digital divide that exists in New, York, City and other places in United, States them all around the world, and the fact that a lot of people may not have an up- to, date, smartphone or reliable data plan, and so any contact tracing tool that relies on an app that you would install on your phone might leave out large portions of the population and potentially portions of the population that are particularly hard hit by Koba 19.
Does a good job of trying to address the disclosure of contact tracing information It seems to be the key purpose of the bill in ensuring confidentiality.
This goes back to the purpose limitation that I mentioned before you know: Again we're only collecting this information because we're in this current health crisis and it's needed for that purpose, specifically, and once we start letting it bleed out into other purposes.
You know, information being shared from the contact tracing program with federal authorities.
And I think that there are arguments to be made against disclosure of contact, tracing information to federal authorities, but at the outset, even just issue, a subpoena.
You know that does go a long way in state court and again state law enforcement and local law enforcement like there are a lot of very worthy protections that are not subject to the same kind of override by federal, authorities.
I. Think that it may be that said that de- Identification de- identified and aggregated information, which really does kind of protect individual privacy, much more so than identifying information, certainly could serve those same purposes, and my reading of the bill allows for that.
If you know within this time frame where your identifying information is being maintained by the public health authorities, researchers say this is a person that we'd like to followup with and asked a lot more questions.
You know sign in writing that you're waiving the confidentiality provisions of this bill- That's another way to get more information and potentially a lot more information about people who have tested positive for come into contact with Co Vat19 and that still respects Lewis.
And I know the Assemblymember addressed this and said that there are probably other laws or regulations in place that require health information to be maintained in a secure fashion, but I just think that having some outside data experts or some kind of security audit is probably a good idea just to provide added assurance that this information specifically won't be exposed to hackers, or you know, just sent in an email like a password shared by mistake or something along those lines.
They've recently come in contact with so not from what I see to be honest, and it may be that other people have not more information, but I do think that one of the strong features of this program and most of the contact tracing programs they've seen in general or that they are voluntary and that provides a good protection against people who have particular concerns about sharing certain sets of information.
It also means that it's that Community Trust is the most important element here, because that's what's going to encourage people to share their information, and so putting these other confidentiality protections into place.
You know, individuals who just believe and cling fast to their belief that they will never share this kind of personal information with government authorities, and you know my hope in my sense, just based on the my New York neighborhood, and the communities around me is that a lot of people are really kind of pitching in to stay safe and wear masks and do take other precautions that have been encouraged by the state to protect our broader community and so that people will view this program in a similar light and kind of take to it with a civic, mindedness.
You know something somebody an expert to make sure that the technology is as safe as possible to say that we approve the resolution and encourage the state in the assembly to do we have a second is that Peggy?
And I do not know if you've looked at this enough, but given that someone I think which Harry had said that the analog people calling and having that personal touch is more effective for getting a higher percentage of people participating in the contact.
So, every other information, I'm hoping I'm, not protected, whether the privacy at all well I, think you know in the first instance.
Is there and I have to assume that if it is protecting that, at this point, correct, existing law, My understanding is that the contact tracing information that the bill addresses and that has to be expunged or de- identified within 30 days, includes both the information about the person who test positive and their contacts information.
Let them know everybody that I feel was exposed to, and then they of information who can explain and I would just like to offer a friendly amendment to Barbara's resolution, which is that we include a clause that mentions that we're in support of this remaining totally voluntary, both sure and mention that it's essential to gain public trust Then I do not know if maybe Russell wants to introduce the second part a separate resolution after So this one also had Lutz the data privacy, though right it only cuts out the federal stuff.
So it's particularly important when you're dealing with information like that to ensure the security of that data You know the need for the strictest and strongest data privacy.
What our first resolution is in favor of So I do not think it needs to be, or should be interpreted as meaning that there's nothing wrong with the assembly bill or the assembly bill You know again in the absence of knowing precisely what the sort of general data security stuff is in the state- Certainly there's going to be protections and stuff for health.
The idea is that you know for this, that's going to be collected very widely and again to provide the assurances to people as much as possible, which is really the goal here, because we want people to feel secure enough to actually participate in the program that there's really no harm to provide to suggesting the strongest possible data protections and hope that the you know the state and any entity doing contact tracing would implement those and really ensure that the data from a data security perspective again not from a sort of like confidentiality perspective of who you're allowed to share it with, but purely from the sense of just.
No, but even that first individual I think has a lot of sensitive private information that can be revealed through contact tracing, but they do not.
I do not want to put people in a position where they, you know are like if they support the federal portion of it and want to vote against the data.
