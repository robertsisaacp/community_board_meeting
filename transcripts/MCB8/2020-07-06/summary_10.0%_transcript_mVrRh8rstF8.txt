It only works if everyone participates and it's very hard to ask someone who has little faith in our government right now, that this information won't be shared with ice and with other law enforcement agencies or if the individual cares deeply about privacy, and so with that, I would like to turn it over to Assemblymember Godfrey to discuss the bill.
You know, I, don't know if I need to do a quick explanation of what contact tracing, Public health people would talk to the person who was diagnosed with syphilis or something else and ask them.
You know how local profession what-have-you, when we went to try to see where in the law You know if you're gonna, test people, you want to provide that information to their doc, there's and health care providers and what took months to get this drafted, but once we got it enacted a Well, when kovat 19 contact tracing became something that we wanted to do on a large scale, I and others involved with privacy issues and the like, said.
If you're dealing with the city contact tracing people, apparently they will do things like offer to help in a hotel room for you or arranged food delivery, etc, and so we wanted to enable that information to be used for that purpose.
But we said it would have to be with the consent of the person whose information you're dealing with You know, because we wanted to get a lot of people's opinions on it.
You may think that D identifies them, but if you've got all the information that Macy's and the Facebook and all those other people have about you, they probably know that you're 6 feet tall and you were in Mason shoe department last Tuesday, buying brown shoes and that your size is It has to be either completely erased or de-identified, although it allows an extra 15 days if the contact tracing entity is in fact actively using that information for the purposes of contact tracing.
First one It can be difficult to predict these kinds of things, but you know, given that contact tracing is already going on and the sooner we can get these protections into place.
The confidentiality protection is the main thing within my you, know, work, area, okay You call me I, give you information, you enter it online A lot of people have learned that a lot of things that we thought were I think I.
Think I've heard stories like that in a long time, partly because hospital records are now almost all electronic, but the health department's confidentiality track record is pretty darn complete, but could something be written in the bill that all the information collected wherever it goes is protected?
The New, York, State, Health Department knows exactly where and when that was, and what the diagnosed and that information doesn't get out, and it could do a lot of damage if it did the HIV data and all of that all has a very successful record of being kept confidential.
So I did catch the previous presentation in this series about New York, City's, test and trace program, and it was incredibly illuminating about the kind of information that the program is collecting through the contact tracing efforts.
And then just you know anyone they might have come within six feet of and spent ten minutes or more with, and disclosure of this kind of information you know, certainly beyond the health authorities, would raise very significant privacy concerns.
So, first, you know these programs should be voluntary and it seems as though New York City's is that no one is being compelled to share information when they're called, and it really relies on a kind of active participation of the public, and that depends on trust in the system.
It's, not going to reveal the identity of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 19 or displaying symptoms after coming into contact with someone who's been exposed to that person's contacts when they reach out They'll just inform contacts that they may have been exposed within the relevant time period, and so that's a great starting point for maintaining anonymity of the folks who are sharing their health information with a contact tracing program.
The information that I described as being collected as part of New York's program fits the bill and it all seems directly relevant to the public health purposes that are motivating this contact.
We were just talking about this with the Assembly Bill, but the kind of detailed contact information that's being collected through these programs may largely irrelevant for public health, purposes.
It may be that contact tracing programs, as we were discussing earlier, require the detailed contact information for a longer period, just to be able to reach out to as many people as possible, but there should be some end points to the retention of the data that's being collected as part of these programs and then ideally, but information should be kind of automatically deleted after the end of that period- D identification is a tricky process, but you know there's some good definitions that work in the assembly bill, and so hopefully those can be carried through forth.
The information should really be kept safe within the public health authority system to the fullest extent possible and fifth Systems and databases should be tested by data security experts and you know kind of examine to make sure that they're as secure as possible to prevent inadvertent disclosure or hacking, and it seems as though there may be pre-existing health, different regulations or other laws in place that assure that health information is being maintained in a secure, environment.
You know door to door kind of telephone based individuals, calling other individuals and asking for their information, and that concern relates to the digital divide that exists in New, York, City and other places in United, States them all around the world, and the fact that a lot of people may not have an up-to-date, smartphone or reliable data plan, and so any contact tracing tool that relies on an app that you would install on your phone might leave out large portions of the population and potentially portions of the population that are particularly hard hit by Koba 19.
You know in particular, I think to Bill does a good job of trying to address the disclosure of contact tracing information It seems to be the key purpose of the bill in ensuring confidentiality, the bill, provides.
This goes back to the purpose limitation that I mentioned before you know: Again we're only collecting this information because we're in this current health crisis and it's needed for that purpose, specifically, and once we start letting it bleed out into other purposes.
You know, information being shared from the contact tracing program with federal authorities.
And I think that there are arguments to be made against disclosure of contact, tracing information to federal authorities, but at the outset, even just issue, a subpoena.
You know that does go a long way in state court and again state law enforcement and local law enforcement like there are a lot of very worthy protections that are not subject to the same kind of override by federal, authorities.
If you know within this time frame where your identifying information is being maintained by the public health authorities, researchers say this is a person that we'd like to followup with and asked a lot more questions.
And I know the Assemblymember addressed this and said that there are probably other laws or regulations in place that require health information to be maintained in a secure fashion, but I just think that having some outside data experts or some kind of security audit is probably a good idea just to provide added assurance that this information specifically won't be exposed to hackers, or you know, just sent in an email like a password shared by mistake or something along those lines.
They've recently come in contact with so not from what I see to be honest, and it may be that other people haven't more information, but I do think that one of the strong features of this program and most of the contact tracing programs they've seen in general or that they are voluntary and that provides a good protection against people who have particular concerns about sharing certain sets of information.
It also means that it's that Community Trust is the most important element here, because that's what's going to encourage people to share their information, and so putting these other confidentiality protections into place.
There is kind of a second layer of privacy protection in the sense that your name will not be shared with your contacts through the program: It does, but I still think that if I miss a positive and that company gives it to my information, buddy else to contact me.
Is there and I have to assume that if it is protecting that, at this point, correct, existing law, My understanding is that the contact tracing information that the bill addresses and that has to be expunged or de-identified within 30 days, includes both the information about the person who test positive and their contacts.
And so it's particularly important when you're dealing with information like that to ensure the security of that data You know the need for the strictest and strongest data privacy for that type of information isn't specifically addressed in the bill.
What our first resolution is in favor of You know again in the absence of knowing precisely what the sort of general data security stuff is in the state- Certainly there's going to be protections and stuff for health, related information.
You know there is sensitive information that can come through the contact, tracing information and even the Supreme Court When the contact person contacts me They tell me, you may have been in contact with someone that tested positive.
Don't wanna I, don't want to put people in a position where they you know are like if they support the federal portion of it and want to vote against the data.
