We all know that contact tracing, successful contact ratio tracing is essential to our fight against kovin 19 The problem is, it only works if everyone participates and it's very hard to ask someone who has little faith in our government right now that this information won't be shared with ice and with other law enforcement agencies or if the individual cares deeply about privacy, and so with that, I would like to turn it over to Assemblymember Godfrey to discuss the bill.
You know if you're gonna test people you want to provide that information to their doc, there's and health care providers and what took months to get this drafted, but once we got it enacted a Well when kovat 19 contact tracing became something that we wanted to do on a large scale, I and others involved with privacy issues and Do something to guarantee confidentiality of this information, or else people aren't going to give up their information to city health authorities and again, I said to my son:: isn't there isn't there confidentiality legislation to protect information, particularly with communicable diseases, as this is and again, I went to look for it and discovered guess what it isn't fair It says nobody who is in law enforcement or immigration enforcement can be engaged in contact tracing and no contact.
You know if you're dealing with the city contact tracing people, apparently they will do things like offer to help in a hotel room for you or arranged food delivery, etc, and so we wanted to enable that information to be used for that purpose, but we said it would have to be with the consent of the person whose information you're dealing with You know, because we wanted to get a lot of people's opinions on it.
If a piece of information says this person who is 6 feet tall was in Macy's shoe department last week on Thursday You may think that D identifies them, but if you've got all the information that Macy's and the Facebook and all those other people have about you, they probably know that you're 6 feet tall and you were in Mason shoe department last Tuesday, buying brown shoes and that your size is We put a lot of that into the bill, and so the bill says that, within after 30 days, it has to be either completely erased or de-identified, although it allows an extra 15 days if the contact tracing entity is in fact actively using that information for the purposes of contact, tracing There's any members of the public who have any questions already Assemblymember just raise your hand in the participants talk, some sort of change could be looked into, don't bother doing anything because it's not private and in my case I wasn't as worried about law enforcement, I'm very proud to say, but insurance companies, my jobs, my children's jobs and contacts go on.
The cloth begins to run when the information comes into the hands of the contact tracing agency, so that postpones when the clock begins running, we authorized them to keep it an extra 15 days, if they're actually using it racing so that it isn't just sitting around and certainly if it, if it turns out that the infirm that information is generally needed longer than that you know the bill is not going to be engraved in stone and, frankly, if between now and when it's enacted, if the State Health Department wakes up and pays attention to the bill and says: Oh my god, you know 30 days, isn't enough.
The one negative voice we've heard is from the City Health Department, not Health, Department, the City Health and Hospitals corporation, because, as you may have read the mayor for reasons we don't need to get into chose to put the Health and Hospitals corporation sort of in the driver's seat of the contact tracing process in New York in New York City, rather than the Health Department, not a good idea in my book, but that's what the mayor is doing and when Health and Hospitals looked at it They thought that some of the language in the bill gave the health department too much authority, and they thought it would interfere with their ability to do their job The wording does what you were thinking it does and, second of all, if this bill puts some authority in the hands of the health department which has been doing contact tracing since the eighteen, hundreds frankly I'm happy about that The first, one It can be difficult to predict these kinds of things, but you know, given that contact tracing is already going on and the sooner we can get these protections into place right.
You know there are federal laws about how the immigration people go about their business and, to a certain extent, you can make a case that the states have authority under the 9th or 10th amendment to be to have primacy in areas relating to public health and if I was to change , I would I would make I think a fairly strong case that New York has this ability, if necessary, to protect public health to keep it out of federal hands.
You know, nor is a contact tracing program voluntary if it's a condition on one's ability to go to work or go to the grocery store or, and these other kinds of limitations that we've seen put in place in other countries Second, any contact tracing program should try as much as possible to maintain the anonymity of the individuals who are speaking to contact tracers, and you know again, I understand that New York's, test and trace program really does try to maintain anonymity It's not going to reveal the identity of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 19 or displaying symptoms after coming into contact with someone who's been exposed to that person's contacts when they reach out they'll just inform contacts that they may have been exposed within the relevant time period, and so that's a great starting point for maintaining anonymity of the folks who are sharing their health information with a contact tracing program.
The information should really be kept safe within the public health authority system to the fullest extent possible, and fifth Systems and databases should be tested by data security experts and you know kind of examine to make sure that they're as secure as possible to prevent inadvertent disclosure or hacking, and it seems as though there may be pre-existing health, different regulations or other laws in place that assure that health information is being maintained in a secure environment.
You know door to door kind of telephone based individuals, calling other individuals and asking for their information, and that concern relates to the digital divide that exists in New, York, City and other places in United, States them all around the world, and the fact that a lot of people may not have an up-to-date, smartphone or reliable data plan, and so any contact tracing tool that relies on an app that you would install on your phone might leave out large portions of the population and potentially portions of the population that are particularly hard hit by Koba 19 So I.
You know in particular, I think to Bill does a good job of trying to address the disclosure of contact tracing information, and it seems to be the key purpose of the bill in ensuring confidentiality the bill provides.
The contact, tracing information will be kept confidential and not disclosed to others, except as necessary for contact tracing purposes specifically So. This goes back to the purpose limitation that I mentioned before you know again we're only collecting this information because we're in this current health crisis and it's needed for that purpose specifically and once we start letting it bleed out into other purposes, You run the risk of a people losing faith in the system, but B just creating too much of an intrusion into personal privacy, That's not justified by the current crisis, and the bill really limits.
But regardless you know, the contact tracing program will only be as effective as it is kind of speedy, and so that goes more to the effectiveness of the program at the outset, and you know savvy technologists with access to enough other data often can readily reaiiy denta fie somebody, but the language of the bill, as I said, seems like a good initial protection on that score and then again, just going back to the purpose.
It really limits the collection and disclosure of that information again to public health purposes, and you know it seems like the core of this bill is preventing the sharing of this information, particularly with law enforcement and immigration authorities and in the context of administrative and judicial processes.
If you know, within this time frame where your identifying information is being maintained by the public health authorities, researchers say this is a person that we'd like to followup with and asked a lot more questions.
I think I mean I was quite impressed with it on first reading, It I'll be honest, and the one kind of omission that jumped out to me is just the data and I know the Assemblymember addressed this and said that there are probably other laws or regulations in place that require health information to be maintained in a secure fashion, but I just think that having some outside data experts or some kind of security audit is probably a good idea just to provide added assurance that this information specifically won't be exposed to hackers, or you know, just sent in an email like a password shared by mistake or something along those lines.
They've recently come in contact with so not from what I see to be honest, and it may be that other people haven't more information, but I do think that one of the strong features of this program and most of the contact tracing programs they've seen in general or that they are voluntary and that provides a good protection against people who have particular concerns about sharing certain sets of information It also means that it's that Community Trust is the most important element here, because that's what's going to encourage people to share their information, and so putting these other confidentiality protections into place.
And, so it's everybody whose information was collected for the purpose of the contact tracing program that information, the expense turkey identified So If you tested positive, your information too, would be deleted or scrubs after that 30-day Now your medical information, but just the information retained by the health authorities as part of the contact tracing That, gives me encouraged to let them know everybody that I feel was exposed to, and then they of information who can explain and I would just like to offer a friendly amendment to Barbara's resolution, which is that we include a clause that mentions that we're in support of this remaining totally voluntary, both sure and mention that it's essential to gain public trust and, and then I, don't know if maybe Russell wants to introduce the second part a separate resolution.
I don't know that you know really doing a resolution just for more data security is really necessary because never yet I think carry still on because she stitches what this is an issue that she alerted us to throw I'm wondering, if maybe you could I guess, I kind of like Russell's formulation, just the idea that you know you can put all of the legal protections in place that you want to protect against disclosure of this information If you have insecure databases where the public health authorities are maintaining all of this information, it might not imagine end of the day if they can be hacked or if it's just either subject to leaks, know.
You know provision there that says that these protections apply to the data That's already been collected through the contact, tracing programs , My I guess my only wish was that we would have added that to our resolution and support the legislation, but I think we can still address it here, but I we should.
would and it's your resolution , don't want to put people in a position where they, you know are like if they support the federal portion of it and want to vote against the data privacy.
