And I think we can get started now. What do you guys think sure your call I agree works for me: okay, hi everyone I'm. My name is Rebecca and Angora and I'm a co- chair of the health seniors and Social Services Committee, and this is the July meeting a joint meeting between our committee and Environment and sanitation. I just want to mention all the other co- hosts here: Barbara rudder and Laurie Boras co- chairs, the palace seniors and social services, and then we have Cos and Russell, who are co- chairs of Environment and sanitation and I would also like to thank Aleta, Sarah and May, who have also worked really hard to help us put this together. So the first part of this meeting is going to discuss a bill, a 10500, a which evaluates the confidentiality issues when it comes to contract contact. Raising. We all know that contact tracing, successful contact ratio tracing is essential to our fight against Kovin 19. But the problem is, it only works if everyone participates and it's very hard to ask someone who has little faith in our government right now that this information won't be shared with ice and with other law enforcement agencies or if the individual cares deeply about privacy, and so with that, I would like to turn it over to Assemblymember Godfrey to discuss the bill. Well, thank you very much. You know. I do not know if I need to do a quick explanation of what contact tracing is for everyone. Essentially it's it comes. It's got a long history coming from dealing with various communicable diseases, particularly what used to be called venereal diseases. Public health people would talk to the person who was diagnosed with Syphilis or something else and ask them. Who else have you had contact with and then they would go out and talk to those people and say? First of all, you should know that you may have been exposed to syphilis and second of all, you know who have you had contact with you know years ago in the in the Mid late 80s 1980s, when we were working to encourage people to get tested for whether they had HIV, and that was a time when getting people to do. That was very difficult, because people were concerned that if people heard that someone had AIDS or HIV, there would be social stigma, they'd be discriminated against, etc, and what was quickly realized was that, in order to get people to be willing to come forward to be tested, we had to guarantee them as complete confidentiality as possible and I. Remember thinking at the time. You know why do we need a law for this? Do not. We have confidentiality of health information that would protect everyone, and it turns out that guess what no we do, not almost all of the. Certainly at that point, almost all the rules of confidentiality about health care information were custom. You know how local profession, what- have- you when we went to try to see where in the law is this written down, it was not, and so we set about to draft confidentiality legislation specifically for HIV and AIDS, and it got to be very elaborate very complicated because we wanted to be a if you're going to test people. You want to provide that information to their doc, there's and health care providers and what took months to get this drafted, but once we got it enacted a it was very successful and B. It became a model for legislation all acrosss the country. Well, when Covid-19 contact tracing became something that we wanted to do on a large scale, I and others involved with privacy issues and the like said. We better do something to guarantee confidentiality of this information, or else people are not going to give up their information to city health authorities and again, I said to my son- is not there is not there confidentiality legislation to protect information, particularly with communicable diseases, as this is and again, I went to look for it and discovered guess what it is, not fair, and so we very quickly working with the New York Civil, Liberties Union and several other advocacy groups. Privacy organizations pulled together a bill that basically said it says a couple of things. One is it says nobody who is in law enforcement or immigration enforcement can be engaged in contact, tracing and no contact. Tracing information can be given to law enforcement or immigration. And beyond that, we also said contact. Tracing information can only be given to a government affiliated contact tracing agency like the Department of Health, and may only be used for purposes of contact tracing. We put in an opportunity for the individual to waive that confidentiality, including for what the bill calls support. You know if you're dealing with the city contact tracing people, apparently they will do things like offer to help in a hotel room for you or arranged food delivery, etc, and so we wanted to enable that information to be used for that purpose, but we said it would have to be with the consent of the person whose information you're dealing with and that's what the bill does it's. You know it's not all that complicated we've. You know, because we wanted to get a lot of people's opinions on it. We've been making amendments while drafting amendments to it, I think we're about ready to nail it all down. The bill has I, do not know like I, think, 50 or 60 co- sponsors, it's supported by the New York Civil, Liberties Union or a lot of groups. Various health organizations and I am hoping that when the legislature comes back into session, which I expect will be at least briefly in the next. You know two or three weeks that this will be part of the agenda. So that's the story. Thank you and I do not know if you could maybe briefly also explain and that the bill mandates that all information has to be expunged or de- identified every 30 days. Yes, you know we did not want to have the information you know just lying around. You know bad things happen when information is left lying around, and so the bill says that it must be either expunged erased eliminated within 30 days or it can be de- identified and there's a fairly elaborate definition of that. It means making it so that no one can look at that information and say: oh that's, my friend Bob they're talking about now people have been D identifying information, particularly in the health area. For a long time with computers and whatnot D identifying has become a more involved process, because, apparently you know computers and artificial intelligence and whatnot can figure out who somebody is from information that maybe 10 years ago, you and I would have thought was completely scrubbed of any identifying information. But with so much of the knowledge about us being around, we put in some extra language that basically says nobody should be able to use any technology to trace back who this is talking about. You know if a piece of information says this person who is 6 feet tall was in Macy's shoe department last week on Thursday, you may think that D identifies them, but if you've got all the information that Macy's and the Facebook and all those other people have about you, they probably know that you're 6 feet tall and you were in Mason shoe department last Tuesday, buying brown shoes and that your size is 8 and a half so scrubbing information about you takes more than it did maybe 10 years ago. So we put a lot of that into the bill, and so the bill says that, within after 30 days, it has to be either completely erased or de- identified, although it allows an extra 15 days if the contact tracing entity is in fact actively using that information for the purposes of contact tracing. So if it takes a little longer, they can get a little longer. But generally there comes a point where it's got to be: wiped out or wiped very clean I think we would like to take some questions. If there's any members of the public who have any questions already, Assemblymember just raise your hand in the participants talk but I do see. We have two board members would question so Barbara something it was not was communicable that questioned whether I had some sort of change could be looked into. Do not bother doing anything, because it's not private and in my case I was not as worried about law enforcement, I'm very proud to say, but insurance companies, my jobs, my children's jobs and contacts go on. How is protecting now and my second question that I want to ask is and what, if somebody does do something? What if somebody says, did you hear that Joe Smith's was really what consequences yeah? Well, the confidentiality of genetic information I'm not up specifically on what current New York law is on that my recollection is that, a few years ago we passed genetic information, confidentiality legislation which at least applies in New York, yes and I did go through the genetic testing, but Yo years until I did it yeah, and so your other question. What if somebody breaks the law- and you know over dinner- says oh you're, a way to I know you who I found out has coded 19. You saw his movie last week and the answer is that would be a violation of the public health law and because this bill would be in the public health law and any intentional violation of the public health law is a misdemeanor so obviously like with any crime. Somebody's got to be caught, they've got to be convicted, but it would be, it would be a criminal act. Yeah I was thinking that somehow insurance company found in suddenly denied by insurance so raised my rate or something like that yeah, which was not worried that I had yeah and by the way one other I do not know. If anyone will ask this question, it occurred to me, the instant I started drafting the bill that to get this done quickly. Now we limited it to cove in nineteen, but it really ought to apply to contact tracing or any communicable diseases, and my plan is that once the bill is signed into law, I'm going to introduce a bill to amend it to make it apply to any communicable disease. Do not tell the governor. The next question is from Brian, hey, yeah, I priest I. Definitely appreciate the explanation in the beginning and I'm, of course, supportive of any type of contact, tracing measures. I guess my thing, I always go back to is just in timing right, so the diseases that you talked about initially obviously have a longer incubation period and lifespan than Cove in nineteen. So, given you know when somebody shows symptoms to Cove it'd so when they get tested to when they get resolved so when they actually meet with the contact, tracer I mean they're. Talking about weeks have passed, you know, since they, you know had a day had the disease in most cases. So how do you kind of proceed? You know this being successful. Given you know the again, the lifespan, an incubation period of Khoka yeah it it's not a magic wand, I mean until there's a really very effective cure or a very effective vaccine. We do not have a magic wand, but what it will enable you to do is certainly reach out to a lot of fair. We fresh contacts so that they can quickly modify their behavior quickly get tested and it will also help one or two or three steps down the line. You know you go from the from the principal individual to one level of contents. You then talk to those contacts find out who they've been in contact with, and so the earliest people in the chain may be people where it's too late to make a whole lot of difference in the progress of their disease, but it will enable you to hopefully catch the next ring of people and also help the contacts who you reach at least modify their behavior so that if they were not wearing masks, as you know, why do I need to wear a mask? You'll have a better way of explaining to them just why they really need to wear a mask, so it will. It will do good. It won't solve the problem. It'll help contain it yeah and I think yeah for sure, and certainly knowing you know where people have been, you know, they've come in contact with I mean it's all going to lead to, hopefully God willing some type of herd immunity if we can get there before we get a vaccine. Okay, the next question from card yeah I. Guess you took away. One of my questions is the bill general or specific to urban 19. If you make a general, then really you do not have to do anything next time, it's already there, so that eliminated that question now I'm in contact with somebody from Massachusetts. They go back. They test positive Massachusetts cause me now. This bill is only for New York. Is there relevant cross state privacy or once it leaves New York? It's open, known, open season. At this point the bill you know the bill would allow giving the information to contact tracers from Massachusetts, but it does not. It does not on its own. It does not restrict what Massachusetts can do from the way to try to do that. Next, step, which New York I think has done. You know voluntarily, for contractual agreements with other states is to say we'll give you our information and you'll give us your information, but only on condition that we both are committed to not dispersing it. You know in violation of confidentiality and States regard that kind of cross arrangement as being enough in their interest that it has been used a lot, but until it's federally mandated it becomes a federal law. There could be one state that really bucks the system and it's a free- for- all so until on now, the thirty days before the data is expanded. Is that too soon? Or should it be sixty days because by the time I test, then it takes several days for you to contact somebody, then it they never no answer. So by the time you can contact somebody, it could be a week or week and a half, then they've got a quarantine for 14 days. So by that time is the 30 days too. I do not think so remember. The cloth begins to run when the information comes into the hands of the contact tracing agency, so that postpones when the clock begins running, we authorized them to keep it an extra 15 days, if they're actually using it racing so that it is not just sitting around and certainly if it, if it turns out that the infirm that information is generally needed longer than that you know the bill is not going to be engraved in stone and, frankly, if between now and when it's enacted, if the State Health Department wakes up and pays attention to the bill and says: oh, my god, you know 30 days is not enough: it's got to be 60 or we're going to have the governor veto the bill. You know we probably amend it to 60. Okay. Thank you. Next, our board, chair, Aleta. Sorry thanks, Rebecca I had a couple of quick questions. One is, did I miss this and if I did I apologize, does it apply to providing information to insurance, companies- yeah there would be there would be no providing of information to insurance companies. I mean unless the person who's, who is the subject of the information were to consent. I do not know why they would, but it is very strict that the information can only be used for contact tracing which is defined in the bill, or it can be used broader than that with the consent of the of the person about whom you know who the information is about. So if they want to give it to your insurance company, if they want to give it to your landlord, if you want to if they want to give it to your Uncle Harry, they and I'll do that and then and then just to piggyback. On what Cos said. I read that within the last couple of weeks they found that there are super spreaders, that a small percentage of the population seems to be responsible for spreading a large amount of the virus. So with 30 days or even the 60 days or 45 days, with the extra 15 account for that. Because would not that be an important information to figure out that person a has spread to five people within 10 days and then another 10 people within 20 days, so that they and I do not know enough about how it was spreading it, but is there? Is there any kind of accommodation for that? And then my last quick question is who is opposing? Is there anyone opposing this bill? Well, the in terms of finding people who are you know who are super spreaders I mean what you really want. I think what you really need to find out is which people who are infected are having contact with a whole lot of people. If somebody is more highly contagious than others, a higher percentage of the person's contacts might have become infected, but how many people they contact in a given period may not be any different from anybody else and again, if the, if the information is being actively used for contact tracing, you can get an extension of the time and then, when you're, reaching out to the contacts, essentially they then become the starting point of a new round of contact tracing and you've got. You know a new 30-day clock running on the question of who's opposed to it. So far we have not found anybody opposed to now that may it is often the case with legislation that people who really hate your bill until they see it really moving, they may not surface the city. The one negative voice we've heard is from the City Health Department, not Health, Department, the City, Health and Hospitals corporation, because, as you may have read the mayor for reasons we do not need to get into chose to put the Health and Hospitals corporation sort of in the driver's seat of the contact tracing process in New York in New York City, rather than the Health Department, not a good idea in my book, but that's what the mayor is doing and when Health and Hospitals looked at it. They thought that some of the language in the bill gave the health department too much authority, and they thought it would interfere with their ability to do their job, and you know to run the program and I said to them. Well, first of all, I do not think so. I do not think it. The wording does what you were thinking it does and, second of all, if this bill puts some authority in the hands of the health department which has been doing contact tracing since the eighteen, hundreds frankly I'm happy about that. But so far the Health and Hospitals corporations comments have been the only negative comments. I've heard now, of course, that do not mean tomorrow the Health Department might wake up and say: oh my god, this is the most God- awful bill in creation. Thank you next fire thanks so and thank you for coming in Sullivan. So I had two questions. The first one and I understand it's difficult to estimate, and you just estimate- and you just got into some of the reasons why but I was wondering what the sort of expected timing is for the bill. I mean I. Understand that it's you know nothing is certain. It can be difficult to predict these kinds of things, but you know, given that contact tracing is already going on and the sooner we can get these protections into place right, the better. You know what your guess is there, what your sort of estimate is yeah well, the legislature has been I mean since the beginning of April. We have convened two or three times we have convened. You know like for a day or two at a time we've come together remotely like we're doing right now, which is an interesting process. I expect that we will be next in session towards the last couple of weeks of July I mean that's not definite, but that's what people are expecting, and so, if the bill is keeps moving forward, as it has been I'm hopeful that we will be voting on it in the assembly and Senate sometime in the latter part of July. Now that does not guarantee the governor signs. It does not tell us when he will sign it, but we're going to do our best to get him to get on board with it. Thank you. My other question is one that I am planning to ask Carrie, but I'm kind of curious to get your views on it as well. So I think the bill is pretty clear about the limitations on the sharing of the contact. Tracing information is very clear that it can't be shared of law enforcement and so on. My question, though, is what can be done, or is there any possibility for federal law enforcement to get this kind of data notwithstanding the bill, because you know through a federal subpoena or something along those lines? I mean. On the one hand, you know this data that's collected pursuant to sort of state and local authorities, so hopefully they would have the last word on how it gets used. But I just been wondering what your thoughts are on that yeah. Well, as I often say they do have bigger guns than do legal and otherwise the other I mean there would be a court fight. Whether a state or federal court would tell a federal agency. Sorry, you do not win here. I do not know I do not for the federal government I do not think it would be an open- and- shut case. You know there are federal laws about how the immigration people go about their business and, to a certain extent, you can make a case that the states have authority under the 9th or 10th amendment to be to have primacy in areas relating to public health and if I was to change, I would I would make I think a fairly strong case that New York has this ability, if necessary, to protect public health to keep it out of federal hands. We may we may end up having a call up my high school classmate, Jerry Nadler, and get him to where he in his workplace all right. Thank you, I ask my question. I just want to remind everyone that it's star nine, to raise your hand on the phone and that all of the chats you're sending to well are part of the public records, and only questions raised by raising your hand will be acknowledged, and my question is currently arts participation. Numbers for contact reasoning are still too low in my opinion, for it to do all the success that we need it to, and so my question is: I mean I'm. Assuming that, if this drill is fast, becomes law that, hopefully those rates will increase, but have you thought of any other ways besides, just through protecting the confidentiality to help improve our number, the confidentiality thing is the to me is the main missing piece. I, think part of what needs to be done is as with the census. You know public announcements trying to be persuasive with you know, having the health commissioner and rock stars and whatnot go on TV and try to just you know, encourage people to come forward and be cooperative. The city and state will need to make sure they keep hiring enough people and training them well. I. Think in terms of legislation, though, the confidentiality protection is the main thing within my you know, work area, okay, thank you and we have another question from card yeah. This is just been thinking, privacy and protected information. You call me I give you information, you enter it online and it goes somewhere. Is that protected, digitally, yeah? Well, I think it depends on what system you're using it in I. Think a lot of people have learned that a lot of things that we thought were we're pretty secure can get hacked into, including our bank records and a whole lot of other stuff. I think I. Think the history of protecting the security of Health Department information has been pretty good. You know, there's a there's, a lot of information that it that they hold that, if it's not out, could be pretty mischievous and you know it used to be that every so often you hear a story about some hospital that had put cartons and cartons of what they thought were old records out with the trash and people were rummaging through it. I do not think I've heard stories like that in a long time, partly because hospital records are now almost all electronic, but the health Department's confidentiality track record is pretty darn complete, but could something be written in the bill that all the information collected wherever it goes is protected? Was that to follow required? Well, you know the bill says that I do not think that would be done in this bill. It would be, and I think has been done in Health Department regulations in their practices. There may be statutes that deal with that. I. Do not think this is the place to try to spell all of that out, but I think I can say with a lot of confidence that there are in place very solid safeguards that we can rely on and, if you think about it you know the health department has records of you know all sorts of adoption information they have records of news out and abortion. They have all kinds of health records about I mean if you've ever been to a hospital. The New York, State, Health Department knows exactly where and when that was, and what the diagnosed and that information does not get out, and it could do a lot of damage if it did the HIV data and all of that all has a very successful record of being kept confidential. So that means I. Can sleep I? Can sleep soundly tonight? Well, you would know that better than I would I do not think you have to stay awake worrying about whether your health department information is going to leak. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I do not see any more question, so I just want to say. Thank you so much. These are very welcome, thanks for being interested in this for coming and for hoping that it'll be past noon and we will help advocate and inform people of any changes. That happens great. Thank you, okay. So for the move to the next part of our meeting, we're lucky to have carried a cell through the staff attorney as a night First Amendment Institute at Columbia, University and she's, going to further elaborate on all the kind of security and privacy concerns related to contact tracing. So with that I'd like to turn it over to Carrie hi everyone thanks so much for inviting me to join this discussion. So I did catch the previous presentation in this series about New York, City's, test and trace program, and it was incredibly illuminating about the kind of information that the program is collecting through the contact tracing efforts. And you know this information includes a lot of sensitive personal information as presenters readily acknowledged. It includes information like names and birthday and demographic details, including race and ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity. I understand also, obviously, information about symptoms that people may have been experiencing and then the people that they come into contact with, including household members, intimate partners folks who come and work in their homes, and then just you know anyone they might have come within six feet of and spent ten minutes or more with, and disclosure of this kind of information. You know, certainly beyond the health authorities, would raise very significant privacy concerns and so I'm very encouraged to see the bill. I was just being discussed and the privacy protections and confidentiality assurances that it seeks to put into place and was also encouraged to hear that the test and race program is particularly committed to protecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality and the way that it collects the information and stores it. So I guess I just like to highlight a few of the key privacy kind of protections that could be put into place to really create community trust in these contact. Tracing programs, which public health experts seem universally to agree, are completely necessary if we're going to start reopening society and a healthy and safe way going forward. So first, you know these programs should be voluntary and it seems as though New York City's is that no one is being compelled to share information when they're called, and it really relies on a kind of active participation of the public, and that depends on trust in the system. And you know beyond that. When it comes to sharing of information collected through these contact tracing programs, you know we would emphasize that voluntary participation means really informed consent based participation, and so that's something else that were encouraged to see kind of reflected in the assembly bill. You know, nor is a contact tracing program voluntary if it's a condition on one's ability to go to work or go to the grocery store or, and these other kinds of limitations that we've seen put in place in other countries. But again you know it seems clear that that's not exactly what's going on in this context. So second, any contact tracing program should try as much as possible to maintain the anonymity of the individuals who are speaking to contact tracers, and you know again, I understand that New York's, test and trace program really does try to maintain anonymity. It's not going to reveal the identity of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 or displaying symptoms after coming into contact with someone who's been exposed to that person's contacts when they reach out they'll just inform contacts that they may have been exposed within the relevant time period, and so that's a great starting point for maintaining anonymity of the folks who are sharing their health information with a contact tracing program. Third, these contact tracing programs really should minimize the data collected to the kind of data. That's absolutely you know necessary and most relevant for public health purposes and I think. The information that I described as being collected as part of New York's program fits the bill and it all seems directly relevant to the public health purposes that are motivating this contact tracing effort. This massive, very impressive contact, tracing effort underway in New, York City, but you know importantly, the fact that we're facing a current health crisis should not be used as an opportunity to collect information and stockpile of government data databases for use for unknown purposes down the line. The core focus of these programs should be on confronting the current Koba 19 crisis and, as a result, the data that's being collected should be limited, as I mentioned, the data that's most relevant to that purpose and relatedly. It should be erased after it has served that purpose- and we were just talking about this with the Assembly Bill, but the kind of detailed contact information that's being collected through these programs may largely irrelevant for public health purposes. You know far beyond the incubation period of Covid-19, which I understand based on current research is two weeks. You know change and it may be that contact tracing programs, as we were discussing earlier, require the detailed contact information for a longer period, just to be able to reach out to as many people as possible, but there should be some end points to the retention of the data that's being collected as part of these programs and then ideally, but information should be kind of automatically deleted after the end of that period, or at least you do not know mentioned this a little bit later, but de- identified and mentioned earlier. D identification is a tricky process, but you know there's some good definitions that work in the assembly bill, and so hopefully those can be carried through forth. You know the program has to impose strict limitations on the sharing of information that is collected through contact tracing. This goes to the core of community trust in the program and people's willingness to participate at the outset. But again the information should be shared only insofar as is necessary to actually achieve the purposes of contact tracing and address the current Covid-19 nineteen crisis. Any program should ensure that information will not be made available to law enforcement or other third parties for any use beyond contact tracing. You know whether it's immigration enforcement or marketing for that matter. The information should really be kept safe within the public health authority system to the fullest extent possible and fifth I think this is something that maybe cause raised a little bit earlier. But you know the program. Systems and databases should be tested by data security experts and you know kind of examine to make sure that they're as secure as possible to prevent inadvertent disclosure or hacking, and it seems as though there may be pre- existing health, different regulations or other laws in place that assure that health information is being maintained in a secure environment. But that's one thing not to lose sight of when we're talking about more intentional disclosures of contact information. There is always the risk of unintentional disclosure or kind of malicious hacking. So I'll, just you know note in addition to all of those key privacy concerns that I do think that in New York is avoiding a real concern. That's arising in the context of discussions about digital contact, tracing programs. By focusing its effort on human contact tracing programs, you know door to door kind of telephone based individuals, calling other individuals and asking for their information, and that concern relates to the digital divide that exists in New, York, City and other places in United, States them all around the world, and the fact that a lot of people may not have an up- to- date, smartphone or reliable data plan, and so any contact tracing tool that relies on an app that you would install on your phone might leave out large portions of the population and potentially portions of the population that are particularly hard hit by Koba 19. So I do think this rollout of a very significant human contact tracing effort in New York City is laudable. For that reason, as well beyond that I'll just touch on some of the features of the assembly bill that we were just discussing. That seemed quite promising to me. You know in particular, I think to Bill does a good job of trying to address the disclosure of contact tracing information and it seems to be the key purpose of the bill in ensuring confidentiality the bill provides. The contact, tracing information will be kept confidential and not disclosed to others, except as necessary for contact tracing purposes specifically. So this goes back to the purpose limitation that I mentioned before you know again we're only collecting this information because we're in this current health crisis and it's needed for that purpose specifically, and once we start letting it bleed out into other purposes. You run the risk of a people losing faith in the system, but B just creating too much of an intrusion into personal privacy. That's not justified by the current crisis and the bill. You know it's disgusting really limits the retention of the information to this 30-day period potentially 48:45 day period and to me at first blush. That seems like a pretty reasonable retention period for this information. You know it's important for people to quarantine as I understand it. It's important for people to quarantine within 14 days of having been exposed to somebody. You know if you're not contacted for another two weeks, it may be that the cat's a little bit out of the bag at that point, but regardless you know, the contact tracing program will only be as effective as it is kind of speedy, and so that goes more to the effectiveness of the program at the outset. I think then need to retain information for much longer periods of time, and you know I'll just kind of emphasize what the Assemblymember was saying. It's just in the sense that de- identification is quite difficult. These days and I think the definition in the assembly bill is fairly robust. You know it's a good, robust protection and it remains to be seen whether or not somebody can put into a place put into place the kind of identification measures that are described there, but the definition itself to me seems quite good. It's just worth noting that the identification can be difficult and you know savvy technologists with access to enough other data often can readily reaiiy Denta Fie somebody, but the language of the bill, as I said, seems like a good initial protection on that score and then again, just going back to the purpose. Limitations. I think it's good to see that the bill prevents the disclosure even of aggregate de- identified information for purposes other than public health purposes. It really limits the collection and disclosure of that information again to public health purposes, and you know it seems like the core of this bill is preventing the sharing of this information, particularly with law enforcement and immigration authorities and in the context of administrative and judicial processes, and you know, especially at the state level. This is a really important and necessary protection. In my view, I'm happy to touch on Russell's question a little, but unless we want to save that for him to ask again, but it's I think this is an important protection, even if federal authorities may be able to override it with subpoenas and court orders in certain cases. So under the Constitution Supremacy Clause, you know a valid exercise of federal authority can preempt or override even state law protections that are as clear and important in my view, as this one subpoena that's issued under clear federal Authority, and it may be able to overcome the obstacles presented in this bill. But that said, the bill itself can really bolster an individual's expectation of privacy and this particular information and that might give rise to a fairly strong Fourth Amendment claim against. You know, information being shared from the contact tracing program with federal authorities. To basically say you need to get a warrant at the very least, to be able to demand this kind of information, because it touches on information that I have a very clear, strong privacy interest in, and so the government's held to a heavier burden to justify demanding disclosure of that information. So there are, you know, I think it certainly would end up in court if that conflict arose and I think that there are arguments to be made against disclosure of contact, tracing information to federal authorities, but at the outset, even just issue, a subpoena. The federal authorities would have to issue a reasonably specific subpoena. You know they would not be able to go on a big fishing expedition for information being collected through this program and I. Think the language just clearly prohibiting the sharing of this information from the beginning will provide a good foothold for other arguments that people can make against the sharing of this information, but I do think. Ultimately, we need Congress to enact stronger protections against the disclosure of contact, tracing information to any authorities other than public health authorities and for purposes other than public health purposes. Thank you, yeah. Sorry, if that's not the answer folks were looking for, but yeah I was going to go ahead. Sorry, Rebecca, I do not know. I was going to say that you I think may be brief. React, although it's kind of absurd but yeah I, think I answered the question. I mean it was. It was yeah you answered it. I mean it sounds like it's. It's a live legal issue and there's going to be good arguments to be made on both sides, and it's certainly not a sure thing that this provides the protection, although you know, hopefully it would, and but that does not mean that we do not also need good, strong state level protections. So I think that's the answer to the question and the protection. You know that does go a long way in state court and again state law enforcement and local law enforcement like there are a lot of very worthy protections that are not subject to the same kind of override by federal authorities. All right, but I found out yes, I have comment, but I do have a question or an observation. When we talk about scrapping the data, I wondered if we want to do that. I should imagine that some of the information we get can be used for research. For instance, Ëletís comment about super spreaders: why is it I've been exposed and I did not get sick and then somebody? You know somebody else spread it to 14. People is not this information that possibly could be used. Where maybe my name and my age and other things, maybe not my age, maybe an age range would be scrubbed, but do not you think that for further research for further it would be important to know certain things. So we can analyze more so learn more about this disease that could possibly lead us to the next one, probably not be under use from hell. Yeah I've, actually, some other folks at Columbia University have been developing a different kind of Kovan tracking tool that it really is a survey based tool and they're, using that to try to predict new hot spots in the epidemic and pandemic and to direct resources, Public Health, Resources appropriately, and so there are related purposes. You know for which this data makes a lot of sense to be to be used in certain ways. I think that it may be that said that de- Identification de- identified and aggregated information, which really does kind of protect individual privacy, much more so than identifying information, certainly could serve those same purposes, and my reading of the bill allows for that. So if you have this D identified aggregate set of data that can be directed to other public health purposes, you know certainly ones related to their co, vid, 19 and emic. But potentially you know even at one further remove I'm, not I'm, not sure exactly how the bill is envisioned with that particular provision. Artifice study, I'm, not Barbara, but Iran number 583 I may have an age range. I may have a diagnosis. What is it so I guess? I am but I think that there's ways of doing it, but this can be very important information. You know why did people in nursing homes get sick? Why is it the black and brown population that's getting in they? Finally, more and more now, by getting this information and working with it can be very important in the future as long as privacy is not abated. So there's the gray line along with it yeah well I, also know it's like the consent provision in the bill. So if you know within this time frame where your identifying information is being maintained by the public health authorities, researchers say this is a person that we'd like to followup with and asked a lot more questions. Then you can be provided with a waiver form and be asked to participate and volunteer to participate in that study. As long as you understand fully what you're agreeing to- and you know sign in writing that you're waiving the confidentiality provisions of this bill- that's another way to get more information and potentially a lot more information about people who have tested positive for come into contact with Co Vat19 and that still respects Lewis. We're finding that people, then with me, have neurological problems, may have heart problems and things that can follow up so I see that some of that information could be very interesting. However, ADA is dangerous, so you had your hand up earlier, but it's lowered now, I do not know if you had a question. No, it's fine, no I guess! My question was: if the federal wants information, they must have a specific reason for wanting that person's information. So I mean they're not going to go after everybody. So are we putting too much dependency on privacy from the federal and by the time the data gets expunged by the what 30 days the courts will have the federal titer for six months by the time they give them permission by that time the data is scrubbed. So what are they going to get yeah I? Think the first point is really important: I mean, even if you are even if the health authorities do receive a subpoena from federal authorities, it has to be reasonably specific to begin with, so they have to kind of know what they're looking for, and that is a protection in its in its on its own I. Then you know it's possible that if you're subject to a subpoena, you would have to preserve that information, while you're testing it out in court, and that arises lots of times in the context of court cases where there are things called litigation holds and you're told not to delete things. That might be part of the case going forward, so I think in general. The 30-day deletion requirement expungement requirement is very important because if you do not receive a subpoena within that time frame when the information is gone to begin with, and so that provides a very strong protection against the sharing this information going forward, there's just this narrow window where it might be an issue, but again, as you described it I think it is a fairly narrow window. So I can't hit the erase button rather than the Snipe button yeah it's you might get in trouble with the courts and the federal authorities. If you delete the data, that's specifically being sought under a subpoena before the court has had a chance to weigh in, but putting that aside. I know there are some good protections here. Thank you and I have a question. Are there any measures that you feel this bill should address that it's not currently doing so, especially as how we're doing contact tracing might changed was a great question. I think I mean I was quite impressed with it on first reading. It I'll be honest, and the one kind of omission that jumped out to me is just the data. Security provision and I know the Assemblymember addressed this and said that there are probably other laws or regulations in place that require health information to be maintained in a secure fashion, but I just think that having some outside data experts or some kind of security audit is probably a good idea just to provide added assurance that this information specifically won't be exposed to hackers, or you know, just sent in an email like a password shared by mistake or something along those lines. So that's a kind of a side concern from the main confidentiality concerns that are addressed in this bill and, like I, said, D identification is tricky and so I think the definition and the D identification requirement in this bill is looks quite good on paper. It would just be worth involving technologists to flesh out what those requirements really mean on the ground. I, do not have a technology specific background, unfortunately, but there are lots of experts who I'm sure would be willing to help out with that great, oh I see we have another question from Peggy price: hi yeah thanks very much so I've been reading that some people who have become victims of Covid-19, refusing to disclose the names of people they recently come in contact with there anything about the bill or any other way. The state is interesting. This issue of what to do about refused to divulge the names of people they've recently come in contact with so not from what I see to be honest, and it may be that other people have not more information, but I do think that one of the strong features of this program and most of the contact tracing programs they've seen in general or that they are voluntary and that provides a good protection against people who have particular concerns about sharing certain sets of information. But it also means that it's that Community Trust is the most important element here, because that's what's going to encourage people to share their information and so putting these other confidentiality protections into place. It's kind of crucial to establishing that trust. You know shy of imposing some kind of a mandatory contact, tracing requirement or information sharing requirement. There I'm sure are going to be holdouts. You know, individuals who just believe and cling fast to their belief that they will never share this kind of personal information with government authorities, and you know my hope in my sense, just based on the my New York neighborhood, and the communities around me is that a lot of people are really kind of pitching in to stay safe and wear masks and do take other precautions that have been encouraged by the state to protect our broader community and so that people will view this program in a similar light and kind of take to it with a civic mindedness. But there are going to be some folks who just won't and we have a another question from Barbara who's already unmuted. It may be too early, but I would like to place resolution to say that we approve of this bill possibly and I would like what we're asked to say and it somebody who understands privacy I do not know if you want to mention. Carrie's name has said that the bill you know is good. Your wording would be much better than mine, but possibly to say we would like to add something about technology being. You know something somebody an expert to make sure that the technology is as safe as possible to say that we approve the resolution and encourage the state in the assembly to do we have a second is that Peggy? Are you raising your hand? Yes, okay, yes, okay, great and I. Think we can. We do not have to spend too long, but I would like to make sure that any board members who have a point they want to make sure is included in the resolution has an opportunity to do so. If you have any comments, I would love it. If you would just raise your hand, so yeah I think so. I agree that the assembly bill we should encourage that it yeah that it get passed and signed by the governor and then I think. Basically it sounds like there are sort of two issues that are beyond the scope of the assembly bill that we probably also want to include in our resolution. If we're only doing one resolution and I think the two issues are number one: the data privacy issue and number two, the federal legislation issue, so I would say you know it would be good to have the resolution say we encourage you, know similar federal legislation to the assembly bill. You know to also provide protections at the federal level and then I think, for you know, David data privacy, I think you know we want to say that you know that we want to make sure that any you know use of technology or even absentee I mean it's an issue, even absent the use of an app. It sounds like basically you know you have. We just want to make sure that. However, the data is stored, that you know the necessary or the highest level of data security. Protections are in place for people's information and I guess to Barbara's point any. Maybe we should say that they should I do not know if we want to specify you know who they should consult or something along those lines, but I definitely want to make the points that carries it on about. You know ensuring that this stuff is maintained securely to you know and is not going to get hacked or disclosed, or anything like that said it much better than I did Russell. Thank you, sir. Next Aleta thanks Rebecca I do not know where the place for this is and I do not know if you've looked at this enough, but given that someone I think which Harry had said that the analog people calling and having that personal touch is more effective for getting a higher percentage of people participating in the contact tracing. If that's something that you want to add about using people rather than apps and I know that there's a whole world of questions and analysis required in thinking about apps. But if it's, if it's something that you just want to look at in some way, based on her comment, thank you yeah and I. Guess what I'm wondering if we want to, if it's better, to separate everything, we're discussing into two resolutions or just one, if we, because I do think it's very important to show how supportive we are of the bill and so I do not know. I do not know what everyone else wants to do, but I'm wondering if maybe we address the federal. If you in a different piece of legislation, I think it is appropriate to raise the problems with data security in the bill and support, but I'm not sure what you guys think so. Laurie, yes, I agree with everything you just said: I think that to come out in support of this bill, and if you do another with the federal you know and the use of apps- and you know other things, fine, but I do think that we need to you know, speed this along and support this bill, so I see well know who's on the phone has a hand that I asked questions about privacy of if I go to get my get tested and the places where I got tested said that I'm positive and after that, how can I everybody should be protected a day they're going to have to get in touch with anybody? That was a contact the with how they should protected I think carry a bell on it. I can so I can take a stab I think this depends on the mechanics of the New York City program. My understanding is that, if you test positive, then you may be contacted by a contact tracer and then asked to provide information about the people. You've come into contact with, so they can reach Orson, but okay, but in order for them to find out all the people that I'm in contact with that's going to bring out all the information, my personal business to contact those other 50 or 60 people. So every other information, I'm hoping I'm not protected, whether the privacy at all well I, think you know in the first instance. It's your choice to provide that contact, information and I hope I'm, not miss characterizing, the New York City program, but that's the voluntary nature of this program. You know you get to decide whether you provide that those contacts to the contact tracer to reach out to and then when they do. If you do decide to do that, when the contact tracer reaches out to your friends or family members or whoever you list, then they won't say that you were the person who tested positive or was exposed to Coba 19 they'll, just tell those individuals, you may have been exposed, and so please get tested or please start self quarantine. Or what have you? So there is kind of a second layer of privacy protection in the sense that your name will not be shared with your contacts through the program. Okay, hey, okay, that's right! Yes, it does, but I still think that if I miss a positive and that company gives it to my information, buddy else to contact me, that's when it gets not righted well, I think it would, if I can just jump in I. Do not think it's the testing. Whoever tested you and gets the positive result back would not be the ones to share the information they would just share. You know if you get tested at a you know wherever and they get the they provide. You with the information that you tested positive, for example, all they're doing is providing that information to you and then it's up to you to get in touch with the contact tracing program for them, I. Think from what I've read and saw that sometimes the contact tracer calls you and says how you may have been in contact with somebody that tested positive, but you know you may have already heard it from your doctor right. So your doctor knows the doctor may contact you or the doctor must contact the Department of Health, who then gets the contact traces right, so the concentration in touch with you I'm sorry, the doctor puts the contact tracer in touch with you after you test positive, oh my god, sugar who the doctor contacts, but the doctor can't contact you or the contact Trace that contacts you, because from what I saw in that video that, when the contact trace, of course and said, you may have already been told by your doctor, but you may have been you know with the you tested positive, so the doctor knows and the contact tracing knows you may know- or you may not know, depending on how you feel in contact with your doctor. But we need, if you never we're, actually walking around it with them. The time long who's going to contact me when they got a content meet but it'd be a few days after beginning to thicker and running I. Think your doctor has to tell you regardless I mean my game I. Think about my doctor, wherever I'm getting say Finch, they need bit register and backup, and it's not forgiveness. For me, a better system I need you suppose, I go. No, they do tell you go for a test. You give them information on your phone number and they contact you. So you go to a hospital wherever you go for a test, they notify I got it. I got paid. Email said your negative. If I was positive, whether it's the lab that sense it or the City MD that somebody contacted the tracer, the tracer would call me. I could say, do not bother me I'm, not picking up the phone and I'm, certainly not telling you everybody is with or I could cooperate and tell them. You know talk to them and or give them the information who I was with. So that's the part. But when you go to City MD or your doctor, you they know your information and when they go to the lab, the lab knows whether you're a positive or negative I mean you know. There's a certain amount that people know. Duane Reade knows every time I've gotten a flu shot because I go to Duane Reade for it. No, that's not what I'm talking about it and this and that part where do not understand is how is information protected under this legislation that they're trying to pass? How is it protected, more protected and then just going to the lab? And then, if you a positive, the tracer gets in touch with you and then you go from there. I think what the one part that one piece of this legislation is: it's really focusing on what happens as soon as a contact tracer finds out that you've tested positive and contacts you. So the main one of the main takeaways is that this information, your information about. Let's pretend you tested positive: it will only exist in this database for 30 days or it will be identified. Okay, I thought, I thought the bill, stipulates the person being contacted. That's been in contact with somebody that tested positive if I go for a test and the test is positive, there's no. The personal information is already protected under the legal, pepper 30. The 30 days refers to you've been in contact with somebody that was positive. Your information is the one that is deleted or erased or exploit, or whatever you want to call it after the 30 days, not the person that tested know, but that it's also your associate I thought that those connections will be expunged as well. No, it's no information that you provide to the contact tracing program could correct that's what gets to delete it if I go to City MD and take the test or go to exit the test knows who I am they know my name? They know I'm positive, they know my age. Probably you know what mice you know. They know my information they get back. So even if there's no contact tracing there is some information. Is there and I have to assume that if it is protecting that, at this point, correct existing law, yeah that's treated to carry quickly just the weekend, yeah I just wanted to say I think so. My understanding is that the contact tracing information that the bill addresses and that has to be expunged or de- identified within 30 days, includes both the information about the person who test positive and their contacts information, and so it's everybody whose information was collected for the purpose of the contact tracing program that information the expense turkey identified. So if you tested positive, your information too, would be deleted or scrubs after that 30-day No. Sorry now your medical information, but just the information retained by the health authorities as part of the contact tracing. Oh yes, no! It's good that your doctor has your medical history and all of that now and the 30 days makes a big difference. I did not hear I did not know about that, because I came in late, but that's very good. That gives me encouraged to let them know everybody that I feel was exposed to, and then they of information who can explain and I would just like to offer a friendly amendment to Barbara's resolution, which is that we include a clause that mentions that we're in support of this remaining totally voluntary, both sure and mention that it's essential to gain public trust and because I think they kind of go together. I think, let's call the question and then I do not know if maybe Russell wants to introduce the second part a separate resolution after okay. So this one also had Lutz the data privacy, though right it only cuts out the federal stuff. Yes, I think we should have the data privacy as a separate one. This just a clean resolution on the bill. Yes and then the other stuff can be okay great. So if you want to know yes vote, no or abstain or not vote for cause raise your hand. Otherwise we're going to assume that you are voting YES. So she may have a comment. Sir I may just let her explain her vote. Yeah, hi I do not know. If I need to not vote for cause or not because I work for the Innocence Project and the Innocence Project is supporting this bill in the assembly, no there's, no financial, guy, yeah, no you're. Okay, all right I just wanted to make sure that I just closed that and okay. Then I vote. Yes, great! Thank you! Okay, so it looks like it's unanimous and I wrote down all of the names of the board members great. So like it's got. The second part, so is the second one is there's one like omnibus resolution for everything else. That is not the Assembly Bill right yeah, that's fine with me I think. That's a good way to do it so I would that's how we should do it kind of be framed as a you know. What else needs to be addressed? Yeah Russell. Can you tell me again what I mean I understand the data like independent authority be sure that you know the data is kept or not kept case. Maybe, but what was the well I? Guess? That's not yeah. Well I mean maybe we should I do not I do not know. Kerry has a view on the need for, like an independent report to me, it seems like the key is ensuring that the that the data is secure and then ensuring that data privacy for the information that is collected, because it's health information is, you know, be as secure as possible. I think that's the main thrust of it and I think you know having an independent expert to do. It might be an additional protection on top of that. Well, do not think that the bill as it stands, I was under the impression anyway that the bill as it stands does that yeah, it's not so much from I mean the bill does not address data privacy. So what I think the additional the additional point? It is that you know anytime you're dealing with public health, information or individuals. Health information that's very sensitive, and it could be the kind of thing that bad actors would want to go after, and so it's particularly important when you're dealing with information like that to ensure the security of that data and so I think that's you know the need for the strictest and strongest data privacy. For that type of information is not specifically addressed in the bill. You know it's sort of theoretically, you know the state should be taking good care of its data generally and hopefully would do that. But that would be. The additional point is that this information relates to be protected from a Dena security perspective, as opposed to it. Just sort of you know, general confidentiality and whether it gets revealed perspective well, I think it I was just I was just going to say: I did not I'm, not a lawyer and I did not read. You know very thoroughly the bill, but I am under the impression. That is definitely what the Assemblyman is wanting to do about this, and so it feels to me like this is the DoubleDown is like, and we really mean it kind of thing now: I'm, not sure that it addresses anything, that's different from what's already there, it's just my opinion and, as I said, yeah I think the question I think Murray's question was just about to do the privacy stuff, ya, know and I, and yes, it was that what and I also I'm in support of encouraging federal legislation as well I think my understanding is this would be a resolution. That's calling for an expert in the field to evaluate the database currently and ensure that it meets all of their security standard. You know as an aside, if you are in a restaurant or any establishment dealing with credit cards, your system is ordered that every six months, that's what the credit card companies require should do. We need to put something of that any digital data going anywhere the wherever it's going must have been ordered on their system for data security and data privacy. I mean that's more specific than I personally want to be comfortable just because I do not I do not know enough about a security justify how they do it, but I think yeah, pointing an expert to run basically so assess it and ensure that it's going to be handled correctly. I think you know, I have to leave, can I vote? Yes, now the leaders shaking her head- yes, I, can't see it. Aleta I do not I. Do not think you can do that, because I once asked Jim Klein's. If I could vote in absentia- and he said no, you have to be present with a vote resolution that we encourage data privacy and I mean this is not going to be tomorrow. It's not going to be next month. It's maybe six twelve months down the road. What the Esper I think, because sorry I'm we're all unmuted and Brian has his hand up. I just want to make sure we got it. Thank you Thank You, Rebecca I, appreciate so I'm, not an attorney either, but I do work for a health insurance, company and I have to agree with Laurie that I'm, not sure outside of HIPAA or pH I or pH I disclose err that there's really anything else in part as data privacy or data secure that we can possibly do I mean you know everybody has, since you know the big anthem breach about five or six years ago. With you know, data with data security. Getting you know, leaked so scary numbers getting leaked everybody that I know out. There has fired birth, Cyber liability coverage so outside of just encouraging. You know you know any additional data privacy I do not know that you know really doing a resolution just for more data security is really necessary because never yet I think carry still on because she stitches what this is an issue that she alerted us to throw I'm wondering, if maybe you could I guess, I kind of like Russell's formulation, just the idea that you know you can put all of the legal protections in place that you want to protect against disclosure of this information. But if you have insecure databases where the public health authorities are maintaining all of this information, it might not imagine end of the day if they can be hacked or if it's just either subject to leaks. You know by mistake or otherwise, and so I do not I know. I do not know at all what the background regulations are in New York with respect to this kind of information, and it may be that there are already very stringent requirements in place and potentially even regular auditing of these systems etc. But I. You know it does seem to me that, with this information in particular and again going to the community trust point, it would be helpful to have some assurance that you know security experts, whether internal or external, just that there's some assurance that the data is being maintained in a secure system and I think, but you know by us asking for it, who knows: maybe they're already going to do it, but making a statement also means that it we want a response. So if it's done, we want them to be very vocal about that. Some people will feel more comfortable participating. Okay, Alito! Thank you. Do you want to say something about the data that's been gathered Retro actively and that it's not just moving. It's not just taking care of privacy for data that they are gathering subsequent to any act, but that it also applies, and things should be expunged or white. Just immediately. I would guess that if it's been in place for one all before the actives is before the legislation is enacted, that its purpose would have been achieved. So there's no reason to keep it, and maybe that's too much in the weeds. I do not know I, just also think about what happens to what they already have and to make sure that we're looking at that too, and maybe it's not necessary I- do not know. I am a lawyer, but I do not know a lot I'll just say that makes sense to me to have a retroactivity. You know provision there that says that these protections apply to the data. That's already been collected through the contact, tracing programs. Yeah I agree with that as well. My I guess my only wish was that we would have added that to our resolution and support the legislation, but I think we can still address it here. Rebecca. We can also address it at the full board meeting as an amendment yeah I think so I mean salaries. The parliamentarian I think you know a thing or two also but I we should we have an opportunity of full board and there may be discussions with other points that get raised to that. We just have not thought of so I. Think I would just like to fully clarify what is going to be included in the second resolution and Roth I do not know if you had any idea of the wording you want for the federal element. I think the federal part could be very simple, I mean I think it would just be the you know. We encourage the federal government to you, pass confidentiality protections or legislation providing confidentiality protections similar to what is in a whatever those some ago. 100,500 a so are you sorry go ahead? Lower Inori no I was asking if we now have two parts of the same resolution, because I'm still very hesitant about the first part so like what what's the exact wording, so I think, okay, so there's multiple parts, and maybe it makes sense to split it up, but I think the parts for the for the second resolution there's a part encouraging federal confidentiality protections similar to what the state has and I guess. We should also I know you know we should probably specify you know. Ideally the federal legislation would proton it would protect. Not only federally collected information would also protect. You know information collected by state and local authorities, so we should probably specify that. But that's so that's the federal part and then the other part is the Data security part, and the idea is that, because this is health information, that's particularly sensitive. You know we are encouraging the you know: implementation of the strongest possible data security protections for including you know, assessment and assurance by you know, data privacy, experts that the system is secure and that it's you know that there are operating an effective system, something along those lines. Essentially that's the data, privacy, part and I. Our idea was to combine all of the non. You know just to send we bill stuff into one into one bill resolution I should say right, but by the assembly statements that the health running is administering is in possession of you know, AIDS cases and abortions and, like all, really sensitive stuff. That has not gotten that you know so, and so it's a pretty secure system to begin with, not that you know in you know today's environment there could not be somebody who could hack it. I mean that's, you know, but I do not know. I, just I just get this weird feeling that we're kind of like saying yeah, we support it, but it's not enough. You know. We also want you to do this, and it feels to me, like his resolution, was enough. I do not know you can convince me, can try and convince me otherwise, but I do so I well, I! Think it's not meant to be a comment on the assembly bill and I. Do not think it's meant to be a criticism in the assembly bill or and I do not think it needs to be phrased in any way. That suggests that something is missing from the assembly bill I mean I. Think our you know we're very strongly in favor of the assembly bill and that's what our first resolution is in favor of so I do not think it needs to be or should be interpreted as meaning that there's nothing wrong with the assembly bill or the assembly bill does not go far enough. It's really a separate point and it's a point that so I think that's why it's being made separately- and you know again in the absence of knowing precisely what the sort of general data security stuff is in the state- and you know certainly there's going to be protections and stuff for health. Related information. I think. The idea is that you know for this: that's going to be collected very widely and again to provide the assurances to people as much as possible, which is really the goal here, because we want people to feel secure enough to actually participate in the program that there's really no harm to provide to suggesting the strongest possible data protections and hope that the you know the state and any entity doing contact tracing would implement those and really ensure that the data from a data security perspective again not from a sort of like confidentiality perspective of who you're allowed to share it with, but purely from the sense of just you know your going to have a database that has a lot of personal and very sensitive information in it. You really just want to make sure that that's not going to get hacked or otherwise compromised in some way. Yeah III guess I. Disagree that there's a lot of sensitive information. It does. This feels like paranoia to me. It really does so, but do not I mean the person has a phone number and a name there's no real personal private information, they're social. They do not have your driver's license, they have your phone number and maybe a name I think that's just a mute, Sarah cause I think she might have a response to Sarah or your muted, yeah hi, so I think on the face of it. The names and phone numbers may not appear to feel personal, but the way that they can be leveraged can be personal, and especially when were when different, when there's such a disparity and how different communities are policed and data takes on different values and can be leveraged in ways that can surveil a population that who you associate with can become an interest of law enforcement, and obviously this bill is designed to levy 8 some of those concerns, but just that the act of Association is it can be something that becomes punitive. And so that's why there is some concern about even just names and phone numbers, because they've been attached to you and they're people that you're associated with yeah, if I could jump in I completely agree with Sarah. On that point, that the you mean, if it's just even if it's just names and numbers of people that you've been in contact with over the past week or what have you know if I went to a protest last weekend? That's a lot of sensitive information about my First Amendment protected activity. If I am going to religious services or other things, you know there is sensitive information that can come through the contact, tracing information and even the Supreme Court has recognized that this kind of information might justify Fourth Amendment protection because it can reveal these sensitive associations but wait a minute when the contact person contacts me they tell me, you may have been in contact with someone that tested positive. They do not know where I've been. They do not know where I'm going I do not know what they know. Oh and it's also for the initial person where they say: okay, you've tested positive for Covid-19. We need to understand all of the people that you've been in contact with. So let's talk about your recent history, where have you been? Who have you been talking to who've? You spent time with and then I'm not sure if the contact tracing program goes to this next level, but if you have been contacted and told that you've been exposed to Coba 19, it may be that the contact racer then asks you about people that you've been in touch with recently. No, but even that first individual I think has a lot of sensitive private information that can be revealed through contact tracing, but they do not. They do not ask where have you been, or they know, is that I'm tight tested, positive I could have been you know, somewhere out of state or somewhere in a bar, or some with it, I contacted it when I tell them, I was in contact with a leader or Sarah, or somebody else and I give them a phone number. They do not know where they've been in contact with. They have no idea where they've been so. You know, I think we putting too much emphasis on this future that it's for the future. I think we should just you know, leave it alive for now and take it up at another time. Yeah I agree, yeah, Peggy and then Sarah one more time. Yeah I think we should vote on Russell's resolution as to whether or not we want it. So I'd like to second his resolution. Okay, great Sarah, so I would just say that one reason, one example or of why this would be of import is that in Erie, County and Nassau County law enforcement have been deputized as contact tracers. So if your municipality such as New York City, has a gang database, for example- and you are someone who's in that database and the law enforcement officer in Erie County or in Nassau County, look you up in that database before they call you and then they ask you for contact information of the people you've associated with then suddenly. That information holds a very different value, and so I just want to echo what Kerry mentioned about the about the import of this kind of information and we're privileged that it does not feel like it jeopardizes us and that I can name my contacts and give their phone numbers without fear that someone will be knocking down their doors for a reason other than contact tracing, and so just wanted to just raise the issue that this is a very real fear, even though it may not be something that that's in. That is a immediate problem for many of us on this call, but Sarah did not did correct me if I'm wrong, but did not I read that the City Council I think I'm, not sure which body it was. But I read about this issue and I understand what you're saying but I have not they Geron guaranteed or instructed that, like police and authority of you know that native people in law enforcement are not allowed to be contact tracers and that's in the assembly bill as well rightly stated. I. Think this just to refocus what exactly were talking about for this resolution? It's from my understanding, the part that seems to have sparked this larger debate was just simply calling or asking for a security expert to ensure that the database that they're using currently is protected. It's not about anything that has to do any of the information that exists within the database. It's just taking that extra level to ensure we've got the purpose of you know. The bill does not have any loose ends. I see sorry to have taken us off that point, but no and I would support the data and just to address I. Think one of the concerns earlier raised earlier is that again I we wanted to separate it. We did not want there to be any doubt that were in full support of the bill as it currently, because I think Peggy I think still has her. Oh I see Russell I'd like to call the question. I, just might be my one thought before we do, that is: do we want to separate if there's two issues and the second builder, going into separate thousand to two separate resolutions? Does that make it easier here we just put on both I mean I like I, would and it's your resolution so I do not even think you need okay, so that's yeah I'm going to propose to separate them. I just I. Do not wanna I do not want to put people in a position where they you know are like if they support the federal portion of it and want to vote against the data privacy. That's fine, and so, let's just separate it I think Peggy called two questions that we just need a bucket for the first, the data. Let's start with the data security second early died, might be like it, okay great. So let's take a vote again on the calling for an expert to come and evaluate. This was done if you like to vote, no abstain, not vote for cause. Please raise your hand great I'll, raise it wait I'll raise it, not your real hand, I'm. Looking for it hold on yes reactions, right reactions, no the blue hand in the participant there you go far so that Aleta can still raise to let's call her first Elita yeah, she lowered her hands. Sorry I'm I need my cell phone, my phone I'm, sorry for the confusion. I am abstaining because I'm not sure that having asking for dead a privacy expert to evaluate would slow down the whole bill and the privacy, and there are so many different questions about who would the data expert be? Who would appoint them? Who would evaluate them that I think it would do perhaps I understand the purpose and I know. I should not be giving this explanation, but maybe more delays than good, so I just be quiet. Now: okay, Laurie I'm, going to web Stain, also, okay, cause I, think we're jumping the gun and I still think it passed with the majority. Let me just count quickly. One two also Wilma. Thank you all right, I'm just going to quickly come this one, so seven yeses so it passes next gets all the questions. Another one yeah, okay, so I call the question on the federal one. Okay great. So if you want to vote now abstain or not vote for cause, please raise your hand Brian I'm. Sorry. Can we just clarify the question? Oh yeah I know this is part of your resolution. If you want to do it free date, sure so, yes, so we encourage. We call in Congress to pass similar confidentiality protections with respect to contact tracing, as are included in the assembly bill, both to protect information collected at the federal level and also to ensure the protection of the information collected by state and local authorities, so in other words, hands off yeah. That's the idea, putting it politely. Yes, okay, raise your hand if you want to vote, no abstain or not so for cause, see Nuns out posse unanimously before we do old business and new business I just want to thank you carry so much for staying on, but that's the whole time and helping us answer the questions. My pleasure again eternally debated the process so best of luck and I. Think again, thank you. Thank you. Sorry to backtrack. A little bit may just chatted me that she was abstaining and she could not get her audio to work. May would you had me which one of those figures dating from I assume from the first one that folks were first one. Yes, thank you so that you mean the second resolution, the data, your thirty part. Yes, okay, correct me if I'm wrong May in the chat, okay, oh the very first one federal level. No, that was the second one. No barrel is the third barrels. Three défendre was two to two point: yeah wait: I'll! Get you points here? Yes may you heard their explanation so just tell me which one and I'll make sure she'll get back to me. It's either the data one or the federal, yeah I. Think it's easier to think of it that way than numbering it, because we're yeah after your wife, only the federal one. Well, what well worth clarifying that I do not think H us have any old business puzzled. Do you hunt? No! This is our first meeting in a long time, so we do not have that a yeah not yet exactly, and does anyone have any new boots so which one of us is positive? You know if I'm going to get a phone call, I need to know. Yeah I think we're just waiting for me. The answer and never oh I, said: okay. Does anyone have a motion to Adjourn yeah? Second, okay. Thank this was very interesting. So thank you. Everyone. So much thanks for leading a rule. I guess you know, I mean it was kind of all of us all right. Take care.
