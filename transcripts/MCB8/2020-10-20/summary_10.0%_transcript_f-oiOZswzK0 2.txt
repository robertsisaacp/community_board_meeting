Lexington I'm, not sure it's weird how many people are there, but this tonight is the October meeting of the Landmarks Committee of Community Board eight, and we have six applications before us.
We are here to listen to the applicant, hear from the public and then go into executive session, and our mission is to vote on the context and appropriateness of the application within the historic district, and we do have one individual landmark tonight as well.
So with that we're going to go right to 135 East 71st street, the eppery side, historic district.
Are, are not energy efficient, so we need to replace all the existing windows and, let me just get my notes: The awnings are not LPC approved and they are all mismatched.
Rendering shows that originally the lower area was going to be a gray, clad granite and we are proposing to put the gray back right.
It is red and LPC actually calls it yellow brick, but it's not Apartment House, Yellow, brick facing above polished, stone, ground floor setbacks The building is listed as having no style and therefore does not contribute to the architectural character for which the Upper East Side historic district was designated.
The proposal for the storefronts, I'm just going to get to my notes, it's a bit of a tricky building, because it's on such a slant on Lexington avenue, Only about six inches above the sidewalk, where the window actually begins.
The granite, is such a small area that it has cracked and they've been having problems with the storefronts and holding the windows up the wall that holds the store fronts up right now is only four inches wide, so our construction of the new straw fronts will differ.
Anyone from the public who wants to speak to the application right, now?
The only changes to the master plan is the color of the windows on the 71st street side.
The height, is, will be about 30 inches, but it varies because there's also a slope on the 71st street side, so it ranges between I'm going to say 30 and 36 inches, okay, Right, now, they're, and they and it runs the whole length of the building.
You know it's a metal piece that just fills in that 12-inch area above the windows All, the awnings that are on Lexington avenue now are non- retractable.
But, as you see there, the second storefront in which is the left most storefront on the 72nd street building, because they're two different buildings, you could see, there's a big height issue with that.
The entire lower elevation that you're looking at when it says Lexington avenue north that whole set is the 72nd street building, which, for reasons no one has been able to explain to me, are not in the landmark district.
Is that when landmarks designated this as a no, style, building, Upper, East, Side historic district is one of the few districts.
Think it's ironic that so many buildings on the Upper East side, which are these generically described as white brick.
No significant issues with it, the design seems sound, seems like it will come out without disrupting the general architectural Gym. Then we'll move to the public numbers.
I think, is excessive, but still acceptable, and the second comment is: You are claiming the question about the existing windows.
I do think the presentation was not as concise or as informative or as narrowly defined as it might have been, but I'm going to approve the application.
Proposing is a master plan for the two visible facades of 969 park avenue to be in the existing six over one mountain grid, pattern.
The, Landmarks Commission, has raised the issue that they think that possibly the original condition was six over six But I would like to and tell the committee that the building has, since the 80s a unified alteration agreement that requires a six over one month and grid pattern, and that is what all of the windows that we're proposing for the master plan have now.
This is very hard when there, when the building has been, has taken the trouble to alter their alteration agreement and require uniform, fenestration, and I respect that I like to stay with that recommendation, even though it appears as though it's going to create some little bit of patchwork over the years, because eventually the aim is to get the building back to where it was so to approve what was, I won't say, an error.
Do think that the uniformity is a very strong argument in favor of approving the six over ones, because I can imagine what a mismatch it could be for years and this way, when you look at the building, it may not be perfect.
If my impression is that people seem to think that the the proposed aluminum version is going to look the same as the as the existing aluminum version, so I think, if that's the case, then it's probably fine.
I. Do not think people who I do not think a building that has made an effort to do it right, since the 1980s should be penalized and have to change all their windows to a different to a to a different arrangement.
No, because I want that position represented in this vote, elita going to abstain, because I think we ought to have some more definite response from Landmarks Preservation Commission about what the history was.
If I could just interject before you move on sure, I would like to remind everybody, particularly the newer members and the public members and our board members, that an abstention is a no It would be nice to just vote yes or no.
So I, think that if there, if it were possible for more clarity, I, that would have been appreciated in any event, it passed, and I know it's not the applicant's issue.
We discussed this with landmarks and they agreed that this is the least intrusive option and the best solution to provide power to those proposed signs, and we just hope that this solves any questions that you might have about the electrical supply path and thank you again for giving us the opportunity to come back and present.
The synagogue which is a beautiful individual landmark just wants to change on the signage to led signage, and we had concerns about the electric how the electricity was going to get to the signage.
I appreciate what the applicant did in terms of the conduit and and presenting us with a detailed plan of how this is going to work just with respect to the signage or the content.
But if we are going to design a resolution with regard to the sign, could it perhaps be limited to to aspects of the sign like the lumens and and kind of the physical constraints, or I do not know how you would say it, but rather than aspects that would impact the content.
I just want to confirm that the the sort of base area that the conduit is going to run along is the same color throughout, because I think from the picture on page 15.
And just on the pain, issue, I just think it's I think you know it's potentially going to look a little different, which is my my concern with that.
Images can be wholly distracting from the surrounding building, which would be a shame because everything in New York ends up being a busy street and people do walk by and it is a So in the city, and so that's why I'm, just more conscious of the sign , You know on Park Avenue, so I think that's what our concern is.
They spent a lot of time on this and I want to support this application, as presented.
We get behind this and support this beautiful, landmark building really on a non- residential street, with a landmark in police.
The 19th police precinct headquarters is right, acrosss, the street, it's an individual landmark and that wonderful old firehouse, which is also an individual, landmark All on this block facing each other, and I think David can join us now Then we should just go to a vote.
The churches and the synagogues need to be able to explain their programs and their mission to their members and to the public who may be interested Where does anybody want to formulate a resolution we're here to vote on the context and appropriateness for this individual landmark?
This is 61 E 77th street and it is a neo- federal style building with bozart features designed by hardy and hasselman and built in 1916 applications.
Would you like me how about if I share my screen, please, okay, the proposal is to add a handicap accessible ramp for first floor access to 61, East, 77th, street.
Ramp, there's an existing, a historic iron, fence, left and right of the entry.
Inches high for your hand to clear on the ramp railing as it passed by this right- hand, picture shows an existing gate, which is similar to the West side.
We have another picture here in the center, looking toward where the ramp would come up and a picture here showing the east exposure of the eastern Window area way through which the ramp would pass behind the existing columns.
In both inside of the entry here, you can see the set of doors, that is, the access to the residential lobby for the building, the picture on the right.
We overlooked that here's, a architectural line elevation of the existing building limestone, but all painted this is the proposed ramp, starting here.
Only elevator, the all the handrails would be stainless steel, but with a black painted finish to match the existing fencing, historic, fencing, which, of course, would be replaced and reconditioned, and so that that is as the presentation currently there is a a certificate of no effect from landmarks relative to the removal and replacement of the peers to allow access to the seller for the install of Mri, equipment.
You have to turn your mic on glad to be able to say that there was a person from the public named Aravatu, and you want to say something, I'm, actually, the next door, neighbor at 59, East, 77Th, street.
You know quite a significant amount of work over a protracted period of time, which, as the neighbor certainly has to be quite a distraction and inconvenience Thank you any other members of the public right.
The only thing is, I think, is you are knowing compliance, but in any event, we are no right here to analyze.
So I do not really know what you intend the rest of it makes sense, but I have to say that handrail for the ramp is hideous and you could do It's a beautiful building with a lot of detail, those, I, guess, Bay Windows and the and the metal work.
That's, not an issue, that's correct, with the design of the doors you're saying you're, making them wider, but are they going to look the same right?
No there's an additional neighbor comment that I think we can go ahead and allow I would only like to, and I do not believe in getting into design issues, and I.
Think if the architect would take a look at a Stanley, Catalog he'd find a lot of steel and bronze that reads charcoal and black, so you do not have to do a painted finish, So, going back to the neighbor again.
I think that the approval process, you know I'll say that the Community board has been very helpful and the LPC has been very helpful, but the department of the DOT that permitting for the sidewalk opening can take some time as far as putting the rest of the building back together.
I would say that certainly the building owner wants it done, and you know the the people at redneck and radiology one and done it's going on a long time.
It's on the north, it's on the north side of 62nd street, about 190 or so feet from fifth Avenue just to the left of the building at one east, 62nd.
We are now seizing the opportunity to change this entry awning that is completely out of character with the building and propose a new marquee that relates far better to Percival Goodman's design, intent.
These images are close- ups of the bronze louvers and we're presenting this to show you how, in our in our drawing here, how we replicate that detail to stay consistent with personal goodness design and then here the an important improvement we're making where the the giving this is not the historical portion of the thought , you're not going to get painted or recess into this rod, and you can see here in our detail how we're proposing that door be shifted to the front plate of the building.
Do, we now, and so now we go to the committee I'm sure this is a question that the community members are going to ask, but I just wanted to know how the marquee is being fixed to the facade.
I know why the the co, I understand why the congregation would want to have a canopy, but the building never did have a canopy, or at least did not originally have a canopy, and there is something marvelous about the sort of plane of the facade and the then setback of the of the entrance plane and then, following up on that.
We are going to reincorporate that door at the interior of the residential entry on East 63Rd Street, so that door will be retained and will be seen.
Re- incorporated a bunch of the charm elements in terms of the transom above the windows, they're, breaking up the glass panels of the windows introduced more masonry back into the facade and reincorporated the historic looking wrought iron door onto East 73Rd street on the entry.
I'm sorry first floor existing on second floor, correct, And. The final element was there: We had a wrought iron interior portion of the door at the entry of the resident residential entry previously on Lexington had a wrought iron door, a historic, looking door, even though it was not a landmark element.
Similarly, for the second order, okay, I think those are nice details on the building, agreed.
You know, I was not here the last time, so I do not have all the context, but it seems to me that changing the door from being on Lexington to being on the street is a big change and in terms of just considering appropriateness, you know looking at the other buildings on that block on Lexington.
Changing that, for this building seems like a big shift from that and the precedent that we have at the end of the presentation about you know taking the door off the avenue and putting on the side street.
And I gather that it's something that the rest of the committee has considered and is sort of satisfied, with, But Actually, I can speak to that point a little bit just to let you know the historic door.
I. Think that the if you can't look at the rest of the block, because this building is on the corner and in fact the functional reasons for moving the residential entrance around the corner are in fact pretty compelling.
A little quieter I actually do think that that's an appropriate solution to the sort of typical problem of four- story- buildings, with retail, on the first and second floor.
