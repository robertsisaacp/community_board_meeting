If, there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on If you could use the participants, menu, I don't want to see people raising their hands like this and miss you.
The owner and the applicant were well aware of that restriction for the yet additional reason that several years ago they came to the board of managers requesting a change that would permit them to sell alcoholic beverages from the retail unit.
We were a little surprised and taken aback that this application would have been made to the community board when the tenant and the owner of the retail unit know full well that, whether as a as a community, it would be permissible in this particular premises.
So john first and alex to close out any public just a time as to how long has the existing or the pre-existing restaurant been there, For how long has it been in possession of a license to serve alcohol?
That is a legal issue between these two, but our role is just only since there is nothing that tell me that this restaurant behave wrong in the community or doesn't fit in the in the commercial district.
That was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, le pen, cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district, and I would love to see them continue in business, with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the board of managers to amend their rules regarding legalizing.
I would have to respectfully disagree with marco and barry and lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no We're taking a position and putting a lot of pressure on the building, which, I, don't think, is what we should be doing since we're representing the community and that building is part of our community.
I think if we approve stipulation to the sla that there is a legal, binding agreement between the landlord and the establishment and let them have it out: okay, thanks guys, russell and then judy So, I I.
Regarding how late a place can stay, open or music, or things like that, I, mean, I, think, that's stuff.
That's, sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements and that kind of thing- You know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation.
No great I would like to make a motion that we approve the application, with the stipulation that there is a binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant and that the sla strictly look at it.
I. Don't have any issue with them, making a request to us, but we we would hope, sincerely hope that the that the board would respect the wishes of the unit owners who bought in this building, with the clear, concise and undisputed understanding that what the what the applicant wants to do cannot be done in the building, and I think.
He know the reason why the condo board has prohibited alcohol in the restaurant?.
I think that the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol served that there was going to be very restrictive types of retail, use, and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate.
Notwithstanding that the applicant understands that they have no right to serve alcohol from that premises.
I. Don't really understand why the applicant would come if there's a contract that prohibits it from serving alcohol and say I'd like a license.
I am a lawyer, as you know, I, don't practice, but I just don't think it is right to say a contract is irrelevant and the applicant could come knowing it signed an agreement knowing it bought the prop the the license or the name or the restaurant.
A slippery slope be considered that at that point we don't have a lot of people that are coming in and having a glass of wine with their breakfast, and we mainly serve breakfast at lunch or at lunchtime in 25 years , we've never expanded our alcohol menu at any of our locations.
Just it's a small avid revenue avenue for us, and it's just one that we just wanted to add on to help us navigate through these difficult times, You may have to push a button to confirm on muting there Thank, you so tell us your name and just a little bit about the application.
Another restaurant, because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the sla law, the community, and That, sometimes, and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say.
I, don't know it's not easy, but I'm willing to check the challenge just because it's next to the restaurant, so the diner went under the fire, very focused on good establishment serving the neighborhood, with the focus on you, Hopefully maybe dinner, depending when this is going to open up, because they're still doing the whole innovation under the building because of the fire and not they're, still doing the work, and maybe.
We will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full, like a license.
The whole thing: is, you know, a restaurant business is so much of a gamble ahead of time.
We have an enclosed, cafe, we're happy with it right, now, but I, don't know what six months from now a year from now.
Oh second, okay, so the issue right here is next, and that is correlated with the other application.
And I think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community.
These public spaces, that not every restaurant, has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses, and I've raised this issue with 3-1-1.
That's doing the open, restaurants, okay, great If other people want to speak, they should I'll withdraw my motion.
