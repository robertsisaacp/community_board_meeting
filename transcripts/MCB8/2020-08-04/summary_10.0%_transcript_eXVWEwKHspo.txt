This is for the 1131 madison avenue, okay, and this is showing as a new application for wine beer and cider they're, all actually new applications, The first question is tell us a little bit more of if there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on I'm going to invite questions on items a b, c d or e, since they are all identical.
You want to go to scott first, yes, scott You may need to push a button at the I I've, just unmuted I'm, an attorney with the firm of braverman greenspun, and our firm represents the board of managers of the terrain condominium, and my comments are I believe with item number d: That's on Lexington avenue and 65th street location.
I think the the restaurant has been there for several years Alcohol I only know that there that alcohol has not been served and The letter from the attorney I got copy of the letter right and we were hoping that, in light of the circumstances that they would reconsider, it's never a beer and wine have never been our main avenue revenue at any of our locations.
Yes, okay and they complain, is very valid from the attorney, but the issue What I perceive is we don't have to go inside of the small of the business between the co-op or the buildings and the tenant In this case, the restaurant or the cafe Our role is basically is to see if we comply or not with its own resolution on the sony resolution that place is located in group six, which is eating and drinking establishment having a drink and eating and drinking establishment.
That was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, le pen cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district and I would love to see them continue in business, with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the board of managers to amend their rules.
So I'm in support of the applications all together, taken as one thank you , I would have to respectfully disagree with marco and barry and lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no we're not being neutral in the discussion between the building and the proposed and the tenant, we're taking a position and putting a lot of pressure on the building, which I, don't think, is what we should be doing since we're representing the community and that building is part of our community I support.
Obviously, when we're sort of dealing with stipulations regarding how late a place can stay, open or music or things like that, I mean I, think that's stuff, That's sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements and that kind of thing-- and you know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation.
You know it's not resolution of some kind of legal issue on our part For. The record I will second, your initial motion to take four of them together and vote separately on Do, the four applications.
It is approved this application, so if we wanna disapprove, we can disapprove, but the liquid license authorities will approve Yes. Absolutely I will go against this place, but I don't hear complaints that there is garbage noise, drunks or any kind of issues that destroy the spirit of the sun resolution or the character of our community So. Therefore, I never see these displays by the way, but as long as it fits in that condition, I think this is reasonable to approve this application.
No great I would like to make a motion that we approve the application, with the stipulation that there is a binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant and that the sla strictly look at it.
Think that the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate.
Another, restaurant because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the sla law, the community and that sometimes, and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say, but for the last 24 years we are very happy and proud to serve the community and, like I just said, the last thing I want to do is open up another restaurant and the only reason why I'm doing this is because I'm helping out is because it's just next door to the restaurant In my life Now we have the pandemic and getting everything to work together.
Maybe three four five: six months from now open for breakfast lunch and dinner even later something more of a jg melon clarks uber, with the focus on the community and obeying and respecting the esla rules, and our neighborhood comes first, our community comes first and that's what we do You know we will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full, like a license.
Are we the first one to pull out the hours and if I cannot manage properly I do not need to give myself a headache if I cannot assure that I'm doing the right thing right , The motion is to approve Oh, second, okay, so the issue right here is next and that is correlated with the other application.
Do I have any public hands, okay, no public hands and then I will invite marcos the first hand and I think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community This is the community that we need these services You serve our community, and that is what we are looking for.
So I, don't think that it's appropriate to be commandeering these public spaces that not every restaurant, has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses I've tried to raise this issue with the community board and it doesn't seem to be gaining any traction.
