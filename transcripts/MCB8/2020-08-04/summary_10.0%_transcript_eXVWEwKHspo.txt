This is for the 1131 madison avenue, okay, and this is showing as a new application for wine beer and cider they're, all actually new applications, The first question is tell us a little bit more of if there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on I'm going to invite questions on items a b, c d or e, since they are all identical.
That request is denied, and, quite frankly, we were a little surprised and taken aback that this application would have been made to the community board when the tenant and the owner of the retail unit know full well that, whether as a as a community, it would be permissible in this particular premises and I do note that we have the letter on file as well.
I think the the restaurant has been there for several years Alcohol I only know that there that alcohol has not been served and The letter from the attorney I got copy of the letter right and we were hoping that, in light of the circumstances that they would reconsider, it's never a beer and wine have never been our main avenue revenue at any of our locations.
Just wanted to speak up in favor of their application has recently lost two places where people can go and have a glass of wine due to redevelopment at the corner of 86 and madison So peg quotation previously had organic wines on offer at the restaurant location, Okay seeing no other public hands, but if you do well, let me know otherwise.
That was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, le pen cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district and I would love to see them continue in business, with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the board of managers to amend their rules.
So I'm in support of the applications all together, taken as one thank you , I would have to respectfully disagree with marco and barry and lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no we're not being neutral in the discussion between the building and the proposed and the tenant, we're taking a position and putting a lot of pressure on the building, which I, don't think, is what we should be doing since we're representing the community and that building is part of our community I support.
Obviously, when we're sort of dealing with stipulations regarding how late a place can stay, open or music or things like that, I mean I, think that's stuff, That's sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements and that kind of thing-- and you know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation.
You know it's not resolution of some kind of legal issue on our part For. The record I will second, your initial motion to take four of them together and vote separately on Do, the four applications.
I think that the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol served that there was going to be very restrictive types of retail use and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate.
I am a lawyer, as you know, I don't practice, but I just don't think it is right to say a contract is irrelevant and the applicant could come knowing it signed an agreement knowing it bought the prop the the license or the name or the restaurant I purchased an apartment, along with my husband and family in this building, We carefully evaluated what type of commercial restrictions would be in this space downstairs with all of them outlined, meaning no cooking in the building, no alcohol and several others Was: we've had years of trash all over Lexington avenue that our building superintendent cleans up himself, there's been massive turnover in that location and we as a building, take on the responsibility of cleaning up Lexington avenue, picking up trash and taking care of that area.
Another restaurant because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the sla law, the community and that sometimes, and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say, but for the last 24 years we are very happy and proud to serve the community and, like I just said, the last thing I want to do is open up another restaurant and the only reason why I'm doing this is because I'm helping out is because it's just next door to the restaurant In my life Now we have the pandemic and getting everything to work together.
Maybe three four five: six months from now open for breakfast lunch and dinner even later something more of a jg melon clarks uber, with the focus on the community and obeying and respecting the esla rules, and our neighborhood comes first, our community comes first and that's what we do You know we will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full, like a license.
Applications for sidewalk cafe the first one is for zucchero and pomodoro renewal, unenclosed, six tables, twelve chairs, fourteen thirty, five second avenue between 74 and 75th We just applied in march for the renewal, but then the cop it happened yeah, she I had to close down the restaurant Do I have any public hands, okay, no public hands and then I will invite marcos the first hand and I think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community This is the community that we need these services You serve our community, and that is what we are looking for.
and I want to give me a blanket approval because I support businesses, which there no is no issue This is spice corner 1479 first avenue between 77 and 78 Nothing would change to the restaurant to this establishment.
So I don't think that it's appropriate to be commandeering these public spaces that not every restaurant, has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses I've tried to raise this issue with the community board and it doesn't seem to be gaining any traction.
