Next, full board meeting is September 16th, so all of those will go to that meeting unless there's any time sensitive applications that need to be sent out before then, in which case those will go as committee resolutions, and with that there's no questions for comments.
If, there's any members of the public that have any questions or comments on If you could use the participants, menu, I do not want to see people raising their hands like this and miss you.
The owner and the applicant were well aware of that restriction for the yet additional reason that several years ago, they came to the board of managers requesting a change that would permit them to sell alcoholic beverages from the retail unit.
We were a little surprised and taken aback that this application would have been made to the community board when the tenant and the owner of the retail unit know full well that.
There are a couple people from the public who want to speak on these, who do not know how to raise their hand.
So, John, First and Alex to close out any public just a time as to how long has the existing or the pre- existing restaurant been there, and for how long has it been in possession of a license to serve alcohol?
You may hi, so I live in the neighborhood near the 1133 Madison Location And I just wanted to speak up in favor of their application.
That is a legal issue between these two, but our role is just only since there is nothing that tell me that this restaurant behave wrong in the community or does not fit in the in the commercial district.
First of all, I'd like to request that all the applicants date, whether or not the location has outdoor area and the hours of the establishment?
That was not my first thought, but since the suggestion was made that we approve of all five applications, Le Pen Cuisine has been a well regarded establishment throughout the district, and I would love to see them continue in business, with the like of licenses that they're entitled to have and that they perhaps they can negotiate with the landlord or the board of managers to amend their rules regarding legalizing.
So I'm in support of the applications all together taken as one thank I, would have to respectfully disagree with Marco and Barry and Lorraine on this, because by allow by providing our support for liquor, license we're no We're not being neutral in the discussion between the building and the proposed and the tenant.
I. Think if we approve stipulation to the SLA that there is a legal, binding agreement between the landlord and the establishment and let them have it out: okay, thanks guys, Russell and then Judy So, I, I.
That's sort of getting beyond just strictly zoning requirements and that kind of thing- And, you know there are times when we even vote to disapprove an application that may comply with the zoning regulation.
No great I would like to make a motion that we approve the application, with the stipulation that there is a binding agreement between the establishment and the tenant and that the SLA strictly look at it.
I do not have any issue with them, making a request to us, but we we would hope, sincerely hope that the that the board would respect the wishes of the unit owners who bought in this building with the clear, concise and undisputed understanding that what the what the applicant wants to do can not be done in the building, and I think.
He know the reason why the Condo Board has prohibited alcohol in the restaurant?
I think that the unit owners who purchased units and for most people their most significant investment, was to live in a building that was not going to have any food cooked or alcohol served that there was going to be very restrictive types of retail, use, and I think that there are two different issues: there's what the community might want and appreciate.
It goes from you, know, just from cider to wine, to beer, to six seven to eight to nine, to ten, and I think that everybody knew the Le Pen Catinia knew the unit owners knew what could be done in these premises.
Notwithstanding that the applicant understands that they have no right to serve alcohol from that premises.
I do not really understand why the applicant would come if there's a contract that prohibits it from serving alcohol and say I'd like a license.
Just do not think it is right to say a contract is irrelevant and the applicant could come knowing it signed an agreement knowing it bought the prop the the license or the name or the restaurant.
Another restaurant because I know what it means serving alcohol dealing with the community, keeping everybody happy from your staff to staying within the code with labor law, everything to the SLA law, the community, and That, sometimes, and most of the time that the restaurant owners they do most of the work and with the last or the least say to say.
We will have a little bit of a counter outside serving the the grab and go for good sandwiches, and you know for people that want to maybe take food at home, and you know you know that's with a bar full, like a license.
The whole thing: is, you know, a restaurant business is so much of a gamble ahead of time.
Oh, second, okay, so the issue right here is next and that is correlated with the other application.
If I know one, all the places have to be closed, and so I do not think that he's going to be open at the four o'clock, at least within six months, but whatever it is.
So I do not think you know there will be any problems for this corporate for this restaurant to apply.
And I, think I'm very happy to see you right here and doing business in our community.
Do not include me because I just came back just at the very end, and I want to give me a blanket approval because I support businesses, which there no is no issue, but I really did not hear enough.
I did have somebody who had earlier said they wanted to raise an item of new business if they're still here, And I'm, an architect, and I live in the Upper East side, for I would say about the past year or two: The publicly owned private space, that's above tony Dinopoly at the corner of 64th and second, has been closed due to construction.
These public spaces, that not every restaurant, has access to and to hand them over for commercial uses, and I've raised this issue with 3- 1- 1.
At this point, That's doing the open, restaurants, If other people want to speak, they should I'll withdraw my motion.
