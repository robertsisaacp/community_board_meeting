Okay, I bet you do a lot of these. It's a way to make him well, you have you started campaigning for your for the other sure. Well I had, but we certainly it is the new norm now on zoom calls I miss. I miss the old days of staying in front of knickerbocker looking people in the eye and letting them talk to you, whether a community meeting or in political life, but those days are not hold till. I guess. There's a vaccine tell us a vaccine right, okay, okay, ah well, it's 6:30! Do you want to start yeah? I do not see anybody signing up right now to get the link, so it seems like it's a good time to start. Do you need to really quickly give a summary of how the zoom works? Yes, please yeah right! So if this is your first time joining one of our community board zoom meetings, we have everyone, muted and you're, not able to unmute yourself the way that, whenever the co- chairs after they have opened the conversation up for questions, the way that you'll be recognized by the two of them is by using the raise hand, feature in the participants menu right. Now you can find that at the bottom of your screen, the participants menu. It looks like two little people standing next to each other with the number 15. Next to it. You click that button. You open up the participants, menu and you'll, find the raise hand button. So once you click that raised hand, button we'll be able to see you and as we go through calling on people to ask for them to ask their question of the assembly member you'll just have to unmute. Whenever I tell you to, and they'll they'll recognize, you and you'll be able to raise your question. If you have any questions about the platform or the technology, you can chat me through the Chat box at the bottom of your screen too otherwise I'll hand it over and they can get the meeting started. Thank you well, good evening, I'm Sherry Weiner, along with my co-, chair, anthony Cohn. We are the chairs of the Community board. 8 voting reform task force. Tonight's program is on voting in November 2020 and we know you have plenty of questions in June, 2020, 400,000, plus mail- in ballots were cast but 80,000. A full fifth of that number were disqualified on technical grounds. Tens of thousands were either sent out late by the New York City Board of elections, or were never delivered to the voters who requested them. Thousands were then thrown out by the New York City Board of elections, because they are not were not postmarked by the U.S Post service. Now that was overturned by a federal judge, but still many were not. Many of the absentee ballots were not signed, and not probably sealed to avoid this in the future. We'll be talking about dealing with mail- in ballots, but to to avoid dealing with the post office. You can drop them off at an early polling site and pulling and on at your piling place on election day. But the message we're sending out is get in your absentee ballots. Early they'll be sent out about the third week in September, which is why we do not have one here to show. We had hoped to do a demonstration of how to properly fill it out, but just real quickly. You just take off the outside envelope. You fill out the ballot on both sides. You have to make sure to sign it and do not seal it with tape. Those are the things that we have been advised, but we're very lucky this evening to have as our special guest one of Assemblyman Dan Court, who is very involved in election reform in Albany. He is the assemblyman for the 73rd district of New York, which is encompasses the upper East side, Midtown East turtle bay. In certain place. He was first elected in 2011 and he has been a staunch advocate for criminal justice reform and for working families prior to the to his election. He served on community board eight, where he served as co- chair of the transportation committee and chair of the Board Second Avenue Subway Task force. He worked with local officials to improve the Upper East side transportation system and was instrumental in getting funding for the Second Avenue subway when it's a shortage appear currently Dan chairs the legislative Commission on administrative regulations review. He is a member of five other committees, judiciary, alcoholism, drug and consumer affairs, and protection corporations, commission and tourism, profession, arts and sports development. He is a busy man and he has sponsored numerous election reform legislation in Albany, which is why we have invited him to come today to talk to us about the legislation that the governor has signed, the legislation that is pending and to kind of help us work through the this maze of trying to vote in this Covid-19 age. So, in my with great pleasure, I introduce Assemblyman Dan Court Assemblyman. Thank you Sherry, thank you Anthony, and will for inviting me on it's great to be back with former colleagues and friends at the Community, Board 8 and someday, we'll all be in the same room together. But for now a computer screen is what we'll share, and I really appreciate being able to address the committee and maybe in the future of the board, and we could do this again when the ballots come out. I think it really sherry would be instructive, not for me to be on for the board to be on how to actually vote and vote properly. So your vote is counted assuming it's open, we're going to do another meeting in October and hopefully we'll have the because they revised it since last time, because it was so confusing was what I was told so yeah. I guess I'll start with the obvious of the systemic failures of our voting system. There's certainly predate this year, but the pandemic has really brought to light. How deficient our voting system is. A lot of that goes back to problems in the legislature in updating our system, but a lot of things also with respect to the failures of the New York, City Board, of elections to modernize their system and to prepare for no pandemic, but a different desire on people on how to vote and vote to be counted. Many states acrosss this country have been allowing either larger absentee ballot voting or mail- in balloting. We could not do so for constitutional reasons, but now that's changed and there has been a multitude of changes in law and to Shari's point. It's been a hodgepodge between executive orders and changes of law and a lot of the difference between one and the other is mostly constitutional, where executive orders, under the governor's extraordinary power during a pandemic, allows him to make changes by executive order. That would maybe touch on the constitution as opposed to changes in law which are not do not require change in the constitution, something that we can just do by legislative action. So to that last point, we've, the governor's recently signed three different pieces of legislation that I co- sponsored and would make it easier to vote and would make streamline the process. Those are authorizing voters to request an absentee ballot due to quote-, unquote, illness and illness being defined as the pandemic itself. Essentially, a catch- all way in which anyone can vote by absentee based upon the pandemic that afflicts our everyday life. It would seem obvious, but we needed to pass a law to do that. We had done that by executive order previously. The second, most importantly, is to allow voters to request an absentee ballot today and right now, and that I guess, as we learn our lesson. Unfortunately, from the events in the primary in June, where there was a specific date assigned where one could apply and that did not allow the board of elections either, they did not have enough time or they simply could not. Ministerially figure it out to get people their ballots in time, and you had extra. You had measures in terms of first- class mailing of ballots the day before many people never got their ballot. Part of that can be solved by allowing people to apply online or in person now for their absentee ballots. Hopefully, that will allow the board of elections to send out the ballots on a rolling basis. Lastly, by law we change that allow ballots to be postmarked on election day. That was not true. If you voted in a primary it had to be, it was not clear. It might have had to be postmarked the day before have so that would allow somebody's vote to be countered or not to be counted by when they got it into the post box, which is somewhat of an absurdity. You should be allowed to vote up through 9 p.m, on election day and allow a postmark that goes up to 11:59 that night. If you go to the Post office on 42Nd Street, so we changed that by law and lastly, governor by executive order signed an executive order allowing absentee ballots to be returned to dropboxes acrosss, different counties and sites, and that is critical want to make it easier to. This will not come to news to people on this call about the chicanery and really, in my view, almost the legal actions by the United States postal service by making it harder for people by engaging in so- called reforms of the United States postal service, on the even of elect on the eve of an election which includes removing of post boxes. So the governor appropriately took executive order to set up drop boxes to make it as easy on pos as possible on people to drop off their absentee ballot upon receipt. Lastly, since 2013, for seven years, I've been fighting for and sponsoring legislation that would send essentially set up a tracking system for absentee ballots and before this pandemic, that would only apply to a very specific portion of the population who were permanent, absentees or had an actual physically documented reason or out of the jurisdiction, but with the pandemic that expanded it to hundreds of thousands of people who are going to vote by absentee ballot, and that's a good thing. We want people to vote by absentee ballot and have that option. So this essentially sets up a tracking system. The bill was not passed, but I'm proud, I'm happy to say that the bill and the advocacy behind the bill forced the New, York City Board of elections to come up with its own tracking system and to ministerially implement something. Now we'll see how good it's going to be. I would have preferred that there would be a legislative mandate to force them to do that, but at least for purposes of this November there'll be a tracking system where an individual can check whether an application for an absentee ballot has been received by the BOE. If the BOE has mailed out the ballot and whether your ballot has been accepted, that does it's a little different than whether your vote is counted, but at least it puts in place a procedure with there's some confirmation process that your request for an absentee ballot has been received by the board of elections and that your ballot has been sent out and received. That is essentially what has been going on in the last 60 days in Albany. There's one other question that Sherry and I and Anthony were talking about before the call on early voting sites for those of us in the northern part of Community board, 8 Rita myself and some others on the call. We do have the option of voting in an early voting site on 106Th Street. It does require it's a could, be a 20 block, walk or a bus ride, but for many of us in the Community board, eight area or not, including me, but many there is no. There is no early voting site, I'm not sure wagner at this point because it is a school and the schooling process is going to be used as an early voting site. But I had been in contact personally. My office has, with several of the large- scale cultural institutions in our district and trying to make a community- based argument to them about why it's important that they open their doors for a week and allow early voting, because early voting is a good option. It is a socially distant safe way. It's not for everyone, because you do have to travel, and there are some people who it's better, that they do not leave their apartment. But I'm personally involved in helping the BOE find institutions within the Community board, 8 area to serve as an early voting site, putting a little pressure on them in that eastside spirit and doing for your constituency opening your doors for a week, because the only place right now is on 106Th Street, the Jackie Robinson Complex, which is not it, which serves community board eight in our early voting, but is not within community board aid. So it's an important part of the puzzle of that cherished constitutional right of making it easy to vote as opposed to efforts in other parts of this country to make it harder to vote. For obvious reasons. We could save that debate for a different date. But what we must do here, as elected officials and community board members, is make the voting process as seamless and easy as possible and, most importantly, to give confidence to our neighbors to our friends that their vote is actually received and counted and that they have not been disenfranchised. So that is what a snapshot of the different bills and executive orders that seek to accomplish that and my efforts going back to 2013, but certainly more recently on to protect and expand this cherish right and with that I will turn it over to sherry and Anthony, and I thank you all for inviting me today. Thank you. Thank you. Just one question: do you have any idea where drop- off boxes are going to be set up, that people can put their ballots if they do not want to mail them? I do not think I do not think you can actually go to the board of elections right now, but I do not think they've announced the physical locations where the dropbox is, but my office and I'm sure will we will be in touch with the board of elections to find out the locations of where they're placing the drop boxes within the Community board. Eight area- oh, that would be great there better, be a dropbox or dropbox plural. Within the community board. You do not have to go down. No one should have to go down to 200 barracks Street. That's an absurdity! Well, in a way, it defeats the purpose of trying to protect yourself by not getting on transportation and essentially voting by well may absentee ballot, but just parenthetically, and we already have some questions just parenthetically. The board of elections website is still showing wagner as the early voting location they, and I hope that it remains that it. Just in my conversations with the board of elections, they represented that it was unclear whether they could continue at wagner. So wagner would be the best solution. Sure continuing solution from the primary, but even if wagner's in existence, I'm still looking for a different location, give people more options, cut down on their travel time, wagner's a good option, but not everyone lives in and around 76th street. So if there was another location in the east, 60s or the east 80s that we could find, it would just be better options and more options for people, especially this year for obvious reasons, but in general, as this state changes the constitution, hopefully in Albany, but also takes some basic steps to make voting so much more easier than what it has been for the last quarter century in the state. Thank you, let's see so we have some people with questions and Barbara. Rutter has raised her hand, and I guess will you should unmute her all right, barbara yeah, okay, great thanks! First of all, thank you. I will first of all just say that my son lives in Denver. I've been hearing for years how stupid our voting is, and thank you Dan you fixed it. He talks about the drop boxes and how he just drops off on the way to work, and things like that. So it sounds great. I do have one. I want to tell you a problem. I had and see help you know what to do about it. I got my absentee ballot. I know it's the right ballot because I had Carolyn's name on it. My address was fine and where it said county it said Bronx I was told I could cross it off and put in New York, but I did not know whether my it was taken or not. I do not know if mine was one that was thrown out, because of that I was told that there were some mistakes like that. I have no doubt there. I have no doubt there was. I mean your ballot should be counted, it's how I could track it. So I guess I would know today. You know this time whether it was taken or not. Am I right? I mean the problem, it's more mechanical, that in a contested election, where things are close, I have no doubt that one side or the other would likely object to that ballot through no fault of your own. So while the board of elections can claim- and understandably it's a mistake- and it happens, those are the type of ballots that get subject to litigation. Unfortunately, if a race is close and it was Barbara, it would tell they will tell you if you're they will tell you if your ballot is accepted or how to correct it. So you would have that opportunity if they, if they were going to reject it. That's under this new absentee ballot tracking system. That's right! So I said now I'd be able to find it out, then I'm so sorry I did not. My phone has not rung all day and it really as soon as this got on. So let me hide this. That's all right! Okay, Michelle, I think, is next up. Well, if you would yes, I will, and you do have two other board members and one member of the public who has a yes yeah. So a couple of questions. Firstly, let me just bring us back and hi Dan good to see you when this com, when this committee first started, which was over, which was I guess two years ago. It was right. After when we had a lot of difficulty with the voting machines and the locations, there were not enough voting locations and the machines were broken, and that was the year when you had all the talk about people waiting for two hours outside of you know, 151 or wherever and then one so that one of the aims of this committee. At that point we have a little. We have some different things to discuss now, but I'm sure in October we'll talk about this, and maybe you can shed some light, but it would be really. You know how do we had somebody from the board of elections come and talk to us? How do we make sure that the machines are working, that there are enough machines, a way to identify additional polling places which we tried to do? Last time we found out that there were fees involved. We went to some of the colleges. We went to marymount at that time. I do not know if they're a current polling site or not anyway. There was a whole exploration of the issue when, on voting day, do we have enough polling places and do we have enough working machines and if a machine breaks down during the process, can we get a repair person there or a replacement very quickly? So we can't solve that tonight, but I think that's very important for anybody and everybody who is even remotely involved in this process to really work on getting new sites and making sure we get a guarantee of sufficient polling places this year. My understanding is we're also going to have a shortage of polling volunteers. That's the whole yeah, that's a whole other story, but anyway that's a voting day thing and I think we need to talk about it. The other thing is when you talk about the drop- off boxes, what are what is the security of these boxes? What are they made out of? Are they metal boxes like the post like the drop off? You know the mailboxes, where they're middle and you can't lift them up and carry them off. Are they made of some lightweight material? What are they actually made of? Are they bolted down? You know, that's a that's a great question Michelle! I do not know the answer I we will. I will get back to you. I assume they're, similar to United States postal service boxes, but I do not know that, but it's an excellent question I'll get back I'll, get back to you with an answer great because to me that's really important, because if these are portable in any way where you know somebody with out with outside of goodwill, can pick one up and carry it off without much difficulty. That's a very big problem. The other thing is there any talk in this state about absentee ballots. Great. You know you sign them to me. That's great Ma! Is there any discussion of mass mail in ballots, unsolicited right that you're suggesting that every voter in the state? If you are a registered? Well, I'm not I'm not particularly for that. I'm just asking whether or not that's under consideration, because I can see that the enormous amount of problems that can result in it was not legislatively. No, I, the governor's executive orders dealing with elections did not make that a mandate. So it's nothing. It's nothing for it's nothing being considered at present. Okay, fine! Is that something that he could do by executive order, or does it have to be legislative? I mean ultimately, court will decide these answers, but I do not have time for court cases. No, I know I think, that's legislative. In fact it may be constitutional requiring a referendum before the voters. I do not think that's something that should be done by executive order, but again it has not been tested, because the governor has not issued an executive order to that. So it does not sound like that's anything that would be likely sort of sprung on us within the next month. That sounds unlikely. I think that would throw mayhem into the system, okay, so to the extent I'll pass it on, but to the extent that you have any influence in finding out for us the state of how many balloting places we have and how many you know how we can guarantee working machines and the status of the drop- off boxes. To the extent that you have any control on getting us that information, I would love it. That would be terrific all right. We will get as much information as we can get out of the board of elections. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you and you know we just have. We just have Dan for a short while longer, but let me I guess, will you should look for another 10 minutes anthony it's fine, okay, great! So, if you would unmute, I guess, Rita all right rita! You may have to dan hi Rita a few questions, a I'm a poll worker yeah. So there are things that I hear that your ballot not only has to be postmarked, but it must be received before November 3rd. Is that true, or just the postmark, the bill that was passed at your ballot must be received by the BOE by November 10th, but it allows ballots to be postmarked on the day of the election November 3rd. So if it's postmarked November 3rd, we assume 7 days at most for it to get to the BOE. There has to be a cutoff of some and I guess they gave it seven days from, but there should be no excuse. If I mean there should be no excuse in any respect that it should be received by November 10th, but certainly if you bring your absentee ballot to a polling place, an early voting place before November 3rd or your polling place on November 3rd, it should be postmarked by the BOE the following day or the day after there should be no excuses because you're giving it to a BOE official. So I mean also we have there is a police officer at every polling place. Can people bring their absentee ballot to the polling place and get it stamped that it is November? Third, that is we. Let me look into that because that that's a stan. What you're suggesting is a standard process of submitting a document at any office in the city of New York. So what it's? A great suggestion, rita a stamp a receipt stamp. Let me bring it up with the board of elections it would, it would give it would give greater certainty to people and it's justified. I worked that pole. You know with the lines and whatever it is. The lines are going to be longer because you have to stand six feet apart. They are they're going to go out the door, so I do not. I do not want people to get discouraged waiting on that line and walk away. So that's why if they could bring the ballot in and get it stamped that day, it's one thing. The last thing is to have an I.T person from the board of election right in the area. You not to wait four hours for that person to come and fix a scanner yeah. We that is key it and the board of elections has they have vehicles and they have their own cars and there's no reason why they can't. I have someone in each Community board area acrosss Manhattan to because I mean you've been there. You know from experience as I do. They do not go any election, even election, where there's low turnout without machines breaking down. So it's a good suggestion under better management it would have been employed already, but let me see what we can push them to do: okay, great and that well, if you could turn elitist Mike on elite you'll have to thank you, hi Dan, it's good to see you hi, so I apologize I tuned in late, and I do not know if you address this, but I have a lot of concern about the accusations that the guy in the White House is making about people voting twice and now the Secretary of State in Georgia, who he campaigned for, is going to prosecute whether intentionally or not. People who voted twice is: if you already answered this, then just please tell me, but otherwise what can we do? What can New York do to bulletproof this as much as possible and excuse the expression against accusations that voter that mailing by that voting by mail is fraud? There are organizations, not-, for-, profit organizations, so getting away from advocacy within one or the other political party. Obviously my view is one political party is enabling the president and making these recommendations, these suggestions, but be that as it may, there are many not- for- profit organizations who are focused on getting accurate information out to the american public. The best thing to do is to be factual, many states and in many states that have given their electoral votes to this incumbent. President have mail in voting and nobody was claiming any fraud four years three and a half years ago. So it's an absurd claim. It's meant as a tool of voter suppression amongst multiple tools of voter suppression that go on in this country for hundreds of years, but it can not. It should not be allowed to be stated without a very forceful rejoinder against it, because it's a lie. It's a complete untruth: we have mail- in voting, it's fair, it's accurate! It does not favor one per one side or the other, it favors those who want to vote in a safe manner, especially during a pandemic. So there are not- for- profit organizations that are focused on honesty in our voting process and voicing that in the next 50 somewhat days. That being said, the best thing we can do in New York is get a better product out of the New York City Board of elections, and we've already made changes in law and the governor by executive order. That should not ensure a smoother voting day if, as Rita pops Rita sets forth, then, but the board of elections has to do mechanical things to make sure that the inevitable breakdowns of machines do not cause these long lines, because that disenfranchised people we've all seen it people just I've, seen it at wagner campaigning people just walk away, say you know, I can't do this anymore, it's ridiculous! We make older people stand for an hour or two and they do and that's a terrible thing. I do not want to see that so it's really up on the board of elections and for us, this community and civic people to help them help themselves, make election day early, voting and drop in by mailbox or something tantamount to a mailbox easier. It's a total effort and it look. The arguments have been made political arguments, policy arguments, the people it's time for them to make up their mind on what type of government they want, but that starts in some states now. So this is upon us it's here and it's coming real soon in New York and that's a good thing, but we have to do better than what we did in June, because that was mostly deeply insufficient for how important the vote is. Thank you and thank you for everything that you're doing on the voters. Behalf. Okay! Well, if you could remember the public Yale Jokozian, I hope I said that sort of okay close enough hi. Thank you so much for all you're doing so. I I'm planning to early vote because me that seems like the best option for the most able- bodied people. The balance of getting your vote counted, and you know supporting the system is that right? Is that what we should be encouraging people to do? I'm going to vote early, and if I was not on the ballot, I would make an event a community event, but I do not think it's appropriate because my name's on the ballot to do that. I think there are great many people who, if they're physically able, if we are, we do a better job of expanding the number of early voting sites, not everyone. I live on 92nd street. I can walk to 106Th Street at the Jackie Robinson Complex and vote, but we also have to be mindful that not everyone can do that. We're not right. Not everybody feels safe, getting on a bus or taking the train to 103Rd and lex and walking over up. Ah, so I encourage people to do that, but I also do not want to prejudge somebody's physical ability to do that, whether they have a pre- existing medical condition that makes that decision not viable. So it is a good decision if you can physic physically able to do it, but it's no better, no worse than absentee voting. It should not be. I just I find voting at the Jackie Robinson Complex on 106Th Street to be safe, to be socially distant, to be a quick process and easy to do so. I personally encourage people to do it and one of these days, when there's a an election day where I'm not on the ballot, I would be more active in walking with people each and every day in the week before, because I think it's a it's a good civic thing to do to vote early, but in this in this environment you know I do not want to preach somebody's personal circumstances, why they would want to vote by mail. So can you order a vote by mail ballot, but then early vote instead or do you have to use that you do not have to use the ballot? If you get it, you do not. You do not disqualify yourself from voting in person, whether on election day or early voting, simply because you requested an absentee ballot. Okay and can someone other than the voter bring an absent a vote by mail ballot to the box? So you know if they did not want to put it in the mail they feel it's better. To put it in the box. Could for my grandma, could I take her ballot to the box? I think the answer is yes, but we'll confirm that for you, okay, thank you. Thank you thanks. So much all right! Well, if you could unmute Craig hi Dan, how are you good? How are you good thank you for joining us and thank you for all that you do quickly. Since I know you have to run. As you know, there are many states that are having challenges that are anticipating challenges, because they will not be able to open and process ballots until election day or after election day and that's a big contributor to what went wrong with the primary and why so many people are throwing around all these accusations about fraud which clearly did not take place here. My question is the legislature, or is the state trying to allow a change in law that would allow New York state to be able to process absentee ballots before so that way at 9:00 p.m? On election night those ballots are available and can be accounted, and people will have a great question craig, because other states allow that, and it's a good thing to do, because why should not the board of elections start counting on a rolling basis? Is what you're suggesting we're going to have to look into that? I do not know if it's legislative or constitutional is the answer or ministerial, which would be even better, because then the board of elections could do it without an accurate legislature. But I'm a big proponent of that and we'll start looking into that. It's not going to be applied this year, but it should in the future. So the answer is great question. We should be doing it, I'm a proponent of it. I do not know legally whether we have to do it by an act of the legislature and act by changing the state constitution, which is even more complicated or the preference is. Maybe the board of elections can be tasked to do it, ministerially, just as an actor when they can start counting, which they should start counting as soon as they can, so that we could get results and on election night or at least the day after is that something an executive order would be able to address. I mean probably the governor's issued 58:60 executive orders at this point when none have been challenged in court, so if he issued, it probably would apply in this election, but he has not issued that thus far. Thank you great. Thank you all so much. I really appreciate it and I look forward to staying in touch and maybe coming on in October as well. Wonderful, thank you. So much. Thank you. Dan before we close that I'd like to give you some important date, you you're on October, 9th October 9th, is the deadline to register to vote. October 27th is the deadline to apply for a mail- in ballot. Early voting is October 27 through November, 1st and election day is November 3rd. So keep those in mind and again our suggestion is vote early to make sure your ballot is counted. Anything. Do you have any anybody else asking questions? Yes, as a matter of fact, yeah we may have a well. Perhaps we can, but first there appear to be three people with hands raised and so will, if you could unmute Wendy Mackaver, she has to unmute herself she does, but when wendy at the bottom of your screen, you may have to push a button. If not, we can come back to you. Yes, okay, let's do that and then so, if you could unmute Regina, oh there, she is hi. Thank you for taking my question and thank you for having this this webinar. This is really informative. I also am a poll worker and I've been doing this for a while, and the question that I have this election is once these sites are determined for early elect for early voting, and will the board of elections send out information to the voters that their early voting sites will not necessarily be the same place. They go for election day, November 3rd, because in my experiences since early voting last year, some people are unaware still that the two could be different because the board of elections combines and makes super sites in each neighborhood in each district. So that was my first question: will the voters be informed of where they are to vote on election day and early voting? And the second comment that I wanted to make my experience? Experiences with somebody brought up the elderly waiting online. I've been an advocate for the board of elections to train part of their training is to keep an eye out for elderly and disabled when those lines do get long or whenever you know it's possible and bring those voters right up to the front. There's no reason really why anyone who has a cane or for whatever reason or elderly needs to wait on the line, and that should be part of their modus Operandi. So I just wanted to share that and ask those questions. I think I think in the we've actually had this conversation before the first question, where I do not think the last time around, I think, you're absolutely right. The last time around the early voting sites were not well documented and I think at all it was you had to ask now, in the past, we've always received these we've received these little cards. That say where you're supposed to vote, and you know reminders of your election district and assembly district, because most of us have no recollection from from year to year of what those might be. And what happens? Is you throw the card you get it? You say: oh yeah, fine, I'm going to go yeah, I got ta vote. You go to the same place. You always did, which is not the place you're going this year. Inevitably, hopefully, the board of elections will make a better effort to actually address the issue in a meaningful way, rather than just counting on all of us to look up our polling places which you can do, although, if they're changing polling places, it's not going to work out so well and I think you're absolutely right about- and I saw Rita nodding absolutely right about the issue of elderly and disabled people and just sort of trying to help move the line or move them up in the line which I do not think anyone would object to. I think that makes a lot of sense and folks can always call our office to check their polling place. That's a great idea. The other thing attention I wanted to bring is, if a person, when we do get those cards in the mail for voting, if people can bring them with it, it's so much easier because we are casting ballots now on ipads. It takes three seconds to have that card scanned and it will save a lot of time. So if there is some type of you know reminder bring your card, it would be, it would save a lot of time, so we do not have to basically bring you know their name up. It's done automatically yeah good idea. That is- and I remember now that you mentioned it- I remember that from last year, wendy is unmuted now, so she should be able to ask her question: okay, hi! Thank you so much. I wanted to share the experience I had today. I went online to request my absentee ballot and I'm at 81st and first and it does list Robert Wagner as my polling place, although it says that it might change. I also want to say that my experience in voting in the primary I was surprised since I had not voted by absentee ballot before to see that there was an envelope upon which you needed to sign your signature and an oath, and I think that most voters may not be familiar with that. There are so many new aspects to help us in voting that voters may not be familiar with and I'm hoping that cba will undertake some kind of public outreach campaign regarding the different aspects, if you're trying to vote by mail. The various aspects in that regard, if you are voting early, how to find that information about that, and, of course, if you're voting, you know in the regular way where we all showed up on a Tuesday when we were prepared for a line or not for a line that was fine. There are so many different ways to vote now. I think there needs to be a lot of outreach, including posters. It can't all be electronic. We have an enormous population of senior citizens right around between 81st and 79th. I think most of my friends now are seniors and they're not online, and that's not how they respond to information. I did not receive a postcard which I had not in past years regarding polling information, but you know I'm adamant about voting and have never missed an election since I was 18 and I'm quite a lot older than that now. So I was looking out for where to vote in the past, so if there could be a public awareness campaign that I volunteer to take it to supermarkets and post offices and put it up wherever you think is appropriate, but there needs to be information that people can copy down, use their phones and take a picture of or whatever to lead them to the proper information, because it's not intuitive and there are a lot of little glitches. I would hate that somebody went to the trouble of voting and taking their ballot to the post office and not understanding the oath Envelope. Also Dan Court spoke about a post office on 42Nd that was open until 11:59 that I just was searching it that actually it's not open till 11 59.. That would be a lovely thing if we could have local post offices open or some way to time stamp any entry, but that in fact is not a current available option unless you guys somehow magically wave your wands and make it happen. Thank you so much for listening. Can I just answer you on. We had hoped to have the new sample absentee ballot available for tonight, but they're, not they it's been revised because it was so complicated the last time and it will not be issued till about the third week in September. Then we will be having another program on voting and we're actually hoping to do a public service announcement to put on facebook to show actually how to fill it out. But, yes, you definitely have to sign on the outside. You should not seal it with tape and that's why. But we are planning to do that. So thank you for the suggestion. So you still have a few questions from Michelle sure. So, let's Un Mute well, actually, since yeah, let's unmute Michelle, that's fine! Thank you! A couple of things one I heard a while ago and I have not been able to verify this. I read this somewhere when early voting started to come into, you know come and practice, and it became apparent that not all the information about various candidates. This is mainly due to the independent vote. You know. Other people may have may have made up their mind, but that there was actually a process to change your vote. Does anybody know anything about that because, for example, early voting is starting before the debates for those people who are undecided or whatever they vote early? They may change their mind, but I heard that there was a proposal for a process to change the vote. Maybe Dan can help us about this. I read it somewhere, so it's not just somebody whispering in my ear. So if we can look into that I'll look into it as well. The other thing is. I was also going to suggest public service announcements through our email blast. You know so I'm. I hope that we can do that and the other thing is: if we get our voting cards, I mean, when you say, register to vote. You mean those people who have not voted before or who have not done absentee. I mean most of anything yeah they have just though they moved they yeah, but otherwise, if you're a registered voter in the same place, you're registered. I just wanted to put that out. There knew about that location. Thank you, okay will, if you could unmute Yale again hi. Thank you. Sherry did I hear you right to say that early voting starts October 27th, yes, October 27th before I it's, but it's, I I'm pretty sure it's October 24th, so that early voting 24th through November all right. I've obviously copying it off something so yeah. The 27th is when you have to request your vote, your ballot in the 24th. I okay, thank you just so everyone knows yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Michelle. I heard the same thing that someone who is very you know involved with voting right that if you can vote, you can mail. Your vote in and then vote on election day and it's the election day. One will trump sorry for the expression trump, but we'll trump, the you know that sounds like voting twice, though yeah I've heard that in New York it is I do not. I can't cite why, but just backing up what you heard the same thing, oh and then, if is there a way to volunteer through the community board, to help on election day? No okay, I'll figure it out thanks, okay! Well, if you could rita and then Valerie, I just want to add something to what the other poll worker said is that during the primary, even though those cards are wonderful that you put in and every they could not use that because of the pandemic, because they would have to wipe the shelf that the card goes on after every usage. So therefore, the cards were not used during the pandemic, and that slows things down yeah. I want you to know that. Thank you, okay! Well, if you could unmute valerie, that would be Valerie's, muted hi, a couple of observations I spent 14 days at the board of elections in July, watching counting absentee ballots, 14 days, 10 hours a day and the biggest I wanted to see what was happening and satisfy myself as to whether how difficult or whether fraud what was happening- and I can tell you that there is absolutely no fraud at all and that the poll and that the board of elections takes painstaking steps to make tick and tie absentee ballots to names, etc and to the other person's point. Before your, if that is part of what takes so long, is that they will check and see and make sure that you have not voted in person before they even open up your absentee ballot. So that's the final. That's the final tick in time. In observing all of these ballots, more than sixty thousand, it became apparent that one of the biggest errors that people were making that made their ballots invalid was that they had written on the ballot and that even if they wrote even if they circled something or they you know- or they wrote in their ed and ad in the box- that's empty. It was a basis for having your ballot be declared invalid, and I saw a tremendous wealth. We fought to have them counted anyway, where we thought that the that the marks were extraneous, but there was that was one big problem: people writing on their ballots. The other thing was people did not seal the envelope and the other was that they did not sign it. So those were the three biggest things that I saw over 14 days as to how people were making mistakes. The other thing that really slowed down the process- and this goes to the point that was made earlier about knowing your election district in your assembly district in terms of going into the polling place, I spent one day, counting 75 ballots, because there were temporary, just do not back up a little bit. Election workers were the hardest hit in terms of Covid-19. So when the ballot, when the primary day came, they had fewer poll workers than ever, because people were sick or they were afraid to actually be poll workers. So there were a lot of temporary people or poll workers who were doing it for the first time. In many instances people were who had voted before you could tell. We had so many people who had filled in an affidavit ballot, and we surmised out of these 75 that we had in this one election district, that the person who was in the front was sending all these people to the wrong table and that's why their names were not in the book and that they were in the right assembly district, but they were in the wrong election district. So I think it's kind of important if you are going to go in there to and if you have not voted in a long time or whatever, to know that is point to speed up the process. But you know, I think that you know the other piece is to get your to get your ballot in as soon as you receive it. I noticed we voted by mail in the in the primary, even though I did go down to the polling place to observe, but they are now having a tracking device on your on your absentee ballot so that you can track and see. You know when you sign up. If you do sign up online, you get a confirmation and a tracking number, so once you send it in you'll, be able to follow and see what happens. But I can tell you because I was also I was not involved in the litigation that ensued for the counting of ballots that were not marked out of the 60,000 ballots that were counted absentee. There were approximately 12,000 that were invalid, but only 900 of them were actually for failure to have a postmark, which is a very tiny number only 900, and it the post office does a fantastic job of actually handling this mail, and there is an opportunity for people in the district who want to sign up to be a poll worker that you can do. I think you can make an extra twenty eight hundred dollars, if you're so inclined, but you can sign up to be a paid poll worker and that's available on the website as well. Sorry to be so verbose, but I just wanted to give you some of my observations. Oh very helpful. Thank you Valerie! Yes, thank you Valerie I will, I think, Elita is needs. Her mic turned on. Thank you. I just want to mention briefly: will let's post the link to be a poll worker on the website and under the voting committee, so especially for the person who asked about volunteering on election day and any time frames, and also to be clear for the points that Valerie raised about the big issues for counting absentee ballots, so that or making sure that they're counted so that we have as much information in addition to the psa that Anthony and Sherry are working on and so to the poll workers? I understand that the application which can be done online and in about a minute and a half, because I did it so so that I understand that it needs to be done quickly because they're going to be starting training pretty quickly. So thank you and I put the link to the poll worker page on the BOE in the chat for everybody. Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. I think that just a couple of sort of in effect housekeeping issues, we are going to have a meeting in October to kind of follow up on a lot of this and to also begin to speak to some of the longer range issues that we've been talking about relative to voting. But I think we've come to the end of our agenda today. Yeah, so is there a motion to Adjourn, see Elita, I see Elita waving her hand, yes, Rita and Valerie also waved so seconding and Michelle has also raised her her thumbs up, and so all in favor aye or anyone opposed perfect all right so we're adjourned, and we will. We will see you all next month. Great. Thank you. Thank you. All thanks! Well, bye- bye, bye, everyone. Thank you.
