A lot of that goes back to problems in the legislature in updating our system, but a lot of things also with respect to the failures of the New York City Board of Elections, to modernize their system and to prepare for no pandemic, but a different desire on people on how to vote and vote to be counted.
We had done that by executive order previously. The second, most importantly, is to allow voters to request an absentee ballot today and right now and that I guess as we learn our lesson. Unfortunately from the events in the primary in June, where there was a specific date assigned where one could apply and that did not allow the Board of Elections either they didn't have enough time or they simply could not.
You should be allowed to vote up through 9 pm on election day and allow a postmark that goes up to 11:59 that night. You go to the post office on 42nd street, so we changed that by law and lastly, governor by executive order signed an executive order allowing absentee ballots to be returned to dropboxes across different counties and sites, and that is critical want to make it easier to.
But at least for purposes of this November, there'll be a tracking system where an individual can check whether an application for an absentee ballot has been received by the BOE. That does it's a little different than whether your vote is counted, but at least it puts in place a procedure. There's one other question that sherry and I and anthony were talking about before the call on early voting sites for those of us in the northern part of community board.
We could save that debate for a different date, but what we must do here, as elected officials and community board members, is make the voting process as seamless and easy as possible. And, most importantly, to give confidence to our neighbors, to our friends that their vote is actually received and counted and that they haven't been disenfranchised. So, That is what a snapshot of the different bills and executive orders that seek to accomplish that, and my efforts going back to 2013, but certainly more recently on to protect and expand this cherish right and with that I will turn it over to sherry and anthony. Do you have any idea where drop-off boxes are going to be set up that people can put their ballots if they don't want to mail, them?
Bronx I mean the problem, it's more mechanical that in a contested election, where things are close, I have no doubt that one side or the other would likely object to that ballot through no fault of your own. If you would, yes, I will, and you do have two other board members and one member of the public, who has dan good to see you when this com, when this committee first started, which was over, which was I guess two years ago. After when we had a lot of difficulty with the voting machines and the locations there, weren't enough voting locations and the machines were broken, and that was the year when you had all the talk about people waiting for two hours outside of you know, 151 or wherever and then one so that one of the aims of this committee.
At that point we have a little I, don't know if they're a current polling site or not anyway. So we can't solve that tonight, but I think that's very important for anybody and everybody who is even remotely involved in this process to really work on getting new sites and making sure we get a guarantee of sufficient polling places this year.
Don't want to see that so it's really up on the board of elections and for us, this community and civic people to help them help themselves make election day early, voting and drop in by mailbox or something tantamount to a mailbox easier.
I would make an event a community event, but I don't think it's appropriate because my name's on the ballot to do that I think there are great many people who, if they're physically able, if we are, we do a better job of expanding the number of early voting sites.
I personally encourage people to do it, and one of these days, when there's a an election day where I'm not on the ballot I, would be more active in walking with people each and every day in the week before, because I think it's a it's a good civic thing to do to vote early.
My question is the legislature, or is the state trying to allow a change in law that would allow New York State to be able to process absentee ballots before so that way at 9 On election night?
Your ballot in the 24th I heard the same thing that someone who is very you know involved with voting right that if you can vote you can mail, Your, vote in and then vote on election day and it's the election day And then, if is there a way to volunteer through the community board, to help on election day?
And there is an opportunity for people in the district who want to sign up to be a poll worker that you can do Will, let's post the link to be a poll worker on the website and under the voting committee, so especially for the person who asked about volunteering on election day and any time frames, and also to be clear for the points that valerie raised about the big issues for counting absentee ballots?
