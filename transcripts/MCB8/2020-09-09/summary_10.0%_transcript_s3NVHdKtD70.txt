Tonight's program, is on voting in November 2020 We know you have plenty of questions in June, 2020, 400,000, plus mail- Tens of thousands were either sent out late by the New York City Board of elections, or were never delivered to the voters who requested them.
He is a busy man and he has sponsored numerous election reform legislation in Albany, which is why we have invited him to come today to talk to us about the legislation that the governor has signed, the legislation that is pending and to kind of help us work through the this maze of trying to vote in this Covid-19 age.
A lot of that goes back to problems in the legislature in updating our system, but a lot of things also with respect to the failures of the New York, City Board, of elections to modernize their system and to prepare for no pandemic, but a different desire on people on how to vote and vote to be counted.
You go to the Post office on 42Nd Street, so we changed that by law and lastly, governor by executive order, signed an executive order allowing absentee ballots to be returned to dropboxes, acrosss, different counties and sites, and that is critical want to make it easier.
The governor appropriately took executive order to set up drop boxes to make it as easy on pos as possible on people to drop off their absentee ballot upon receipt.
That would only apply to a very specific portion of the population who were permanent, absentees or had an actual physically documented reason or out of the jurisdiction, but with the pandemic that expanded it to hundreds of thousands of people who are going to vote by absentee ballot, and that's a good thing.
We want people to vote by absentee ballot and have that option.
One other question that Sherry and I and Anthony were talking about before the call on early voting sites for those of us in the northern part of Community board, 8 Rita myself and some others on the call.
But I'm personally involved in helping the BOE find institutions within the Community board, 8 area to serve as an early voting site, putting a little pressure on them in that eastside spirit and doing for your constituency opening your doors for a week, because the only place right now is on 106Th Street, the Jackie Robinson Complex, which is not it, which serves community board eight in our early voting, but is not within community board.
What we must do, here, as elected officials and community board members, is make the voting process as seamless and easy as possible, and, most importantly, to give confidence to our neighbors to our friends that their vote is actually received and counted and that they have not been disenfranchised.
Off boxes are going to be set up, that people can put their ballots if they do not want to mail.
If there was another location in the east, 60s or the east 80s that we could find, it would just be better options and more options for people, especially this year for obvious reasons, but in general, as this state changes the constitution, hopefully in Albany, but also takes some basic steps to make voting so much more easier than what it has been for the last quarter century.
So, we can't solve that tonight, but I think that's very important for anybody and everybody who is even remotely involved in this process to really work on getting new sites and making sure we get a guarantee of sufficient polling places.
You may have to dan hi Rita a few questions, a I'm, a poll worker There are things that I hear that your ballot not only has to be postmarked, but it must be received before November 3rd.
But certainly, if you bring your absentee ballot to a polling place, an early voting place before November 3rd or your polling place on November 3rd, it should be postmarked by the BOE the following day or the day after.
Can people bring their absentee ballot to the polling place and get it stamped that it is November?
My question is the legislature, or is the state trying to allow a change in law that would allow New York state to be able to process absentee ballots before so that way at 9:00 p.m?
Those ballots are available and can be accounted, and people will have a great question craig, because other states allow that, and it's a good thing to do, because why should not the board of elections start counting on a rolling basis?
They go for election day, November 3rd, because in my experiences since early voting last year, some people are unaware still that the two could be different because the board of elections combines and makes super sites in each neighborhood in each district.
That was my first question: Will the voters be informed of where they are to vote on election day and early voting?
The board of elections will make a better effort to actually address the issue in a meaningful way, rather than just counting on all of us to look up our polling places, which you can do, although.
The other thing attention I wanted to bring is, if a person, when we do get those cards in the mail for voting, if people can bring them with it, it's so much easier because we are casting ballots now.
I also want to say that my experience in voting in the primary I was surprised since I had not voted by absentee ballot before to see that there was an envelope upon which you needed to sign your signature and an oath, and I think that most voters may not be familiar with that.
Before your, if that is part of what takes so long, is that they will check and see and make sure that you have not voted in person before they even open up your absentee ballot.
We voted by mail in the in the primary, even though I did go down to the polling place to observe, but they are now having a tracking device on your on your absentee ballot so that you can track and see.
Briefly: Will, let's post the link to be a poll worker on the website and under the voting committee, so especially for the person who asked about volunteering on election day and any time frames, and also to be clear for the points that Valerie raised about the big issues for counting absentee ballots, so that or making sure that they're counted so that we have as much information?
