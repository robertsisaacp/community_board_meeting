He is a busy man and he has sponsored numerous election reform legislation in albany, which is why we have invited him to come today to talk to us about the legislation that the governor has signed, the legislation that is pending and to kind of help us work through the this maze of trying to vote in this Covid-19 age.
A lot of that goes back to problems in the legislature in updating our system, but a lot of things also with respect to the failures of the new york city, board, of elections, to modernize their system and to prepare for no pandemic, but a different desire on people on how to vote and vote to be counted.
You go to the post office on 42nd street, so we changed that by law and lastly, governor by executive order, signed an executive order allowing absentee ballots to be returned to dropboxes across different counties and sites, and that is critical want to make it easier.
The governor appropriately took executive order to set up drop boxes to make it as easy on pos as possible on people to drop off their absentee ballot upon receipt.
That would only apply to a very specific portion of the population who were permanent, absentees or had an actual physically documented reason or out of the jurisdiction, but with the pandemic that expanded it to hundreds of thousands of people who are going to vote by absentee ballot.
We want people to vote by absentee ballot and have that option.
One other question that sherry and I and anthony were talking about before the call on early voting sites for those of us in the northern part of community board, 8, rita myself and some others on the call.
But I'm personally involved in helping the BOE find institutions within the community board 8 area to serve as an early voting site, putting a little pressure on them in that eastside spirit and doing for your constituency opening your doors for a week, because the only place right now is on 106th street, the jackie robinson complex, which is not it, which serves community board eight in our early voting, but is not within community board.
We could save that debate for a different date, but what we must do, here, as elected officials and community board members, is make the voting process as seamless and easy as possible, and, most importantly, to give confidence to our neighbors to our friends that their vote is actually received and counted and that they haven't been disenfranchised.
Well, if you would yes, I will, and you do have two other board members and one member of the public- who has Dan good to see you when this com, when this committee first started, which was over, which was I guess two years ago, After when we had a lot of difficulty with the voting machines and the locations, there, weren't enough voting locations and the machines were broken, and that was the year when you had all the talk about people waiting for two hours outside of you, know, 151 or wherever, and then one so That one of the aims of this committee.
Tonight, but I think that's very important for anybody and everybody who is even remotely involved in this process to really work on getting new sites and making sure we get a guarantee of sufficient polling places.
You may have to dan hi rita a few questions, a I'm, a poll worker There are things that I hear that your ballot not only has to be postmarked, but it must be received before november 3rd.
Can people bring their absentee ballot to the polling place and get it stamped that it is november?.
The best thing we can do in new york is get a better product out of the new york city board of elections, and we've already made changes in law and the governor by executive order that shouldn't ensure a smoother voting.
Don't want to see that so it's really up on the board of elections and for us, this community and civic people to help them help themselves, make election day early, voting and drop in by mailbox or something tantamount to a mailbox.
Don't you don't disqualify yourself from voting in person, whether on election day or early voting, simply because you requested an absentee ballot.
My question is the legislature, or is the state trying to allow a change in law that would allow new york state to be able to process absentee ballots before so that way at 9 On election night?
Those ballots are available and can be accounted, and people will have a great question craig, because other states allow that- I, don't know if it's legislative or constitutional is the answer or ministerial, which would be even better, because then the board of elections could do it without an accurate legislature, but I'm a big proponent of That I.
They go for election day november 3rd because in my experiences since early voting last year, some people are unaware still that the two could be different because the board of elections combines and makes super sites in each neighborhood in each district.
That was my first question: Will the voters be informed of where they are to vote on election day and early voting?
The board of elections will make a better effort to actually address the issue in a meaningful way, rather than just counting on all of us to look up our polling places, which you can do, although.
The other thing attention I wanted to bring is, if a person, when we do get those cards in the mail for voting, if people can bring them with it, it's so much easier because we are casting ballots now.
We voted by mail in the in the primary, even though I did go down to the polling place to observe, but they are now having a tracking device on your on your absentee ballot so that you can track and see.
Let's post the link to be a poll worker on the website and under the voting committee, so especially for the person who asked about volunteering on election day and any time frames, and also to be clear for the points that valerie raised about the big issues for counting absentee ballots?
