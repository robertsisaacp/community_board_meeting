So but 6:28, so we have two more minutes right. Do we have a majority of the committee members here so that we could get going? Yes? Is it exactly 6:30 I think it might be close? Let me see yes, it's 6:30, so, yes, maybe you could do your introductory remarks will about how to speak, etc. Thank you yeah, so for anybody, if it's your first time at a community board, 8 virtual meeting, you'll notice that you are muted and you're unable to unmute yourself. So the way that we'll take questions from the com from the public and from other folks is through the use of the raised hand, feature so you'll open up the actually. Let me stop sharing my screen, so it's a little easier for everyone to find it. Everybody get your bearings for a second while you can see at the bottom of your screen. There's a participants button that if you click on it, it'll open up a box on your screen that has everybody's names on it and at the bottom of that box is a raise hand button. So you'll click the raise hand button. Whenever we're ready for questions and comments and your hand, your name will pop up to the top of our list and we'll call on you. Then. If you're calling in from the phone it's star nine to raise your hand and if you have any problems with the zoom platform, you can always chat us through the chat box, but that's not going to be for taking questions or for comments for the applicant so with no further Ado, Jane and David. If you guys are ready, I've lost the view of everybody, so I may have to come back in again. Okay, well, I'll start the meeting. We only have one agenda item. This is the December meeting of the Landmarks Committee of Community Board 8. We have one application to here. We will. We are here to discuss the context and appropriateness of the application within the historic district and also in this case the Metropolitan Museum sits. This sits in city land, which is a landmark central park. The whole park is a landmark, so we will hear from the applicant we'll hear from the public. If anyone is present, then we will go into executive session to formulate a resolution which will be presented to our full board on this coming Wednesday night. So I'm I see a lot of people from the met are here. So please begin your presentation, so I'm not sure who's, gonna, I think I'll start hi everybody. My name is Brett Guyard and I'm the head of capital and infrastructure planning at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it's very nice to be with all of you tonight, virtually it's. My first virtual community board meeting, usually I like being able to see you all in person. So you know, please feel free to ask questions once we're done our presentation, we're all happy to answer them. There's many of us from the met. I! Don't want to spend our time going through introducing all of us, but we're all here to answer questions and we're here tonight to talk about the planned renovation of the Michael Rockefeller wing, which was built 40 years ago to house our arts of Africa Oceania and the Americas collection and I know that it's a strange time for all of us right now to be talking about a major capital project in the future. But even during this current crisis, we've been continuing to do our work to plan for the museum's future and to work on projects that we've started a long time ago. So we've actually been working on this for four years and we are ready getting ready to implement our enabling work so that we can start moving art out of the space and with major construction beginning in about a year. Michael Whetstone is here from buyer blender, Bell and I'll hand it over to him in a moment and he'll be able to go through the schedule with you in more detail too at the end. But the goal for our project is to address both the curatorial, our curatorial goals and our care of the collection and so we're reimagining, the collection in three distinct regions, the arts of Africa, the Arts of Oceania and the arts of the Americas. It was. This collection was gifted to the museum as primitive art and for the past 40 years we've been trying to address that failing and how the collection has been presented to the public, and this is a very important project, the museum to be able to do that. But, in addition to the reinstallation of the collection, we also need to address our failing infrastructure that houses the collection. We want to care for these objects in the same way that we do Greek and roman art or modern art and with the same level of conservation care and state-of-the-art tools that we have. And so a big part of this project is the replacement of the sloped glass on the south facade of the building. And that's really why we're here to speak to you all today, because, as you know, landmarks has jurisdiction over this replacement. We've presented to them and they agree with our approach and now we're coming to you and then eventually to a public hearing to review it with all of them. The our goals for replacing the glass are critical to address condensation water infiltration, daylighting control, also bird safety. There I don't know if there's any bird lovers out there, but we have a lot of bird deaths at this location of birds flying into the glass. There is it's reflective and we would like to address that, given our location in the park and our care for birds, you all are also probably aware, as our neighbors, that we have a sister wing to this, which is the sackler wing, and that will Mike will address that when he talks about the project, but the two wings, while they may look similar from the outside, have very different purposes on the inside. The Temple of Dender spent most of its life outside and is very much meant to feel as though it's outside and in the park, whereas the many of the objects that we have in the Oceania Collection, the Africa collection and the Americas collection- are actually light sensitive, and so the fact that they're right next to a south facing glass wall has been problematic throughout the wings history and that's something that's very important for us to address in this project. With that I'll hand it off to Mike Whetstone from buyer, blender Bell, he is a principal there Mike. Thank you, everybody thank you. Brett, nice to see everybody, I'm Michael Whitestone principal of Bayern, Bunda, Bell and I. Think I would like to share my screen. I'll try to do that. So I can show the presentation. Okay, so first question is: can everybody see the presentation on the screen? Yes, thank you. Okay and I will go right into it. So, first of all, the museum is located in central park, as you know, which means, by the way, that the Landmarks Commission requires us to go to all the community boards that surround the park. So this is, of course, the first, but that we're going to go through six community boards over the next five or six weeks before we come to the public hearing and just to give everybody the context. Here's an aerial view of the met with Fifth Avenue at the bottom and central park on the top and the Rockefeller wing. Is this modern piece on the south and just a little bit of the historical context. This plan of the Met is from 1970. It's the Kevin Roche and John Dinklewood Master plan that was adopted and what you see in pink is the extent of the museum in 1970 and the extent of the museum actually when it was landmarked in 1967. So at that time, of course, the full fifth Avenue facade by Richard, Morris, Hunt and Mckinney and White was constructed, but the parts of the museum at the rear facing the park were not yet completed. Museum had always intended to grow to approximately this footprint, so the Landmarks Commission approved all of the wings in yellow the master plan of 1970 and over the course of 20 years from the 1970s into the early 90s. All those wings were constructed, temple of Dender and the american wing, and the layman wing were first in the 70s, followed by these wings on the south side in the 80s and 90s, and so the Rockefeller wing is before the Landmarks Commission, because it is a modern edition that was approved by the Landmarks Commission 40 years ago, and we are proposing changes to that design that was approved by the commission and again, the part of the scope. That's really subject to landmarks review is this red area. It's this large sloped curtain wall, which is more easily seen in this aerial view. So here you can see outlined in red. Is that piece of glass 200 feet long and 60 feet tall and facing south? Now the scope of the project, as Brett mentioned, is the Aaoa galleries, which is the Mets acronym for arts of Africa Oceania and the Americas, and that 40,000 square foot suite of galleries is being redone. That's the major part of the project and, as you can see in the section, the orange line is the sloped glass piece that we are replacing. So that's the part of that is subject to landmarks review. Here's a south elevation of the building. You can see the large glass facade between the Mckinley and White Limestone, Wing K on the right and the Roshtinkalu 1987 modern wing on the left and just looking at the original proposal. This is a 1970 model by Rosh Dinklewood of that plan. You can see, as Brett mentioned, of course, that this large sloping glass wall faces South, which is a heavy burden for a glass building which is trying to protect fragile art objects and, of course, Rosh. Dingle understood that- and you can see in their original proposal with this glass facade, that they thought that perhaps the upper part of the facade would be more opaque and more reflective and the lower part of the facade would be more transparent for views and the construction drawings from 1975. So just that there's two kinds of glass: the bottom two rows were more clear and the upper rows were more opaque, and that was the intent, but the glass technology was not so sophisticated as it is now in the 1970s and the amount of light and the amount of solar gain coming through that glass wall has been problematic ever since these are some of the problems we're trying to solve. Here's a photograph of the inside on the left is the wing when it first opened up in the 1980s. You can see immediately from the very beginning there were mesh roller shades going from top to bottom. The full 60 foot feet height of the glass, because there was so much light coming in. Those galleries were modified in the mid 2000s to extend the second floor, paintings galleries, and so the original interior space by the glass has been changed, but you can still see right now. What happens is that these shades really block the view and I just attempted to cut down the light, but it was discovered about 15 years ago that, even with the shades, the amount of light coming in was too much for the art objects. So around 2005 they put a plastic film or screen on the outside of the glass which has deteriorated, and this is one of the problems the Mets would like to address. In addition to the fact that the curtain wall is beginning to deteriorate from corrosion and from chronic condensation problems. So for this reason, as these galleries are renovated, the met decided to propose to replace this entire curtain wall with a much higher performing technological glass piece, because better technology is available now than was 40 years ago, and here's a view of that entire facade, the floor plan, relationship to the galleries and there's just quickly. These are some of the goals that are proposed for the glazing system. One of them is the greater resistance to condensation, because the museum keeps a high level of humidity to conserve the art objects, 70 degrees, fahrenheit and 50 degrees relative humidity, during the winter, when the curtain wall becomes cold, there's a tendency for water and condensation to form on the inside of the curtain wall and for it to drip down, which is very problematic and the thermal breaks and technology for curtain walls at the time are not able to handle that amount of humidity. So we would like to address that. We also want to, of course, control the amount of light coming in. What we would ideally like to do is control the light coming in for art conservation, so you still get natural light, but we don't need to have those shades and there are treatments of glass which will allow us to do that. We'd like to be able to control the quantity of light, make it much more thermally efficient for energy savings and, as Brett mentioned we'd like to address the bird safety problem because birds when they see angled glass reflecting the sky, they think that it is the sky and they meet their untimely end by colliding with the glass and then, of course, there are other areas: gutters flashing, mechanical systems, we're trying to address all that comprehensively. So this is just what we're proposing to remove. It's really just the only the glass curtain wall you can see in section in an elevation in red, those are the removals and then we get into the proposed design. So in order to address all of these increases in performance for the glass we are proposing, a couple of changes to the design of the glass will look a little bit different and the system will look a little bit different and that's why we are going through a public hearing process. So I will show you what those are. First, you can see that the top is the existing elevation. The glass panels are quite small, two feet: six inches wide five feet tall and we are proposing for reasons I'm about to show you a larger grid. So we have a larger a panel of glass, seven feet, six inches tall and three foot seven inches wide, so the grid is proposed to change. We think that when you compare existing and new, when you think of this building as a single sheet of glass, a single volume of glass sandwiched between these two limestone, clad wings, the architect's original intent of a glass clad volume and a sheer glass surface is still going to be there. The differences we think are subtle, but the change in the grid so, as I showed you in that original model and intent by Roche Dinkulu, they understood the idea that we have to block some of the sun and so like they did we're proposing to have different glass at the top than the bottom. But we're proposing is that each row of glass will be different as you go up to the top, so the glass at the bottom would be where you could really see out and without shades. For the first time you will be able to see that and then, as you go up the rows of glass towards the ceiling up to the height of 60 feet, the glass little by little becomes more and more opaque and more translucent and less than light comes in to the top. When you get to the top in this kind of triangle of dead space up here very little light is coming in, but that's not illuminating anything. So that's, okay, so that is the basic concept for the glass scene from the inside. You can see that idea of being able to see out the bottom row and then glowing glass with decreasing amounts of translucency, as you go up to the top and we're able to achieve that translucency with films that are laminated between the glass rather than applied to the outside. So it won't be won't deteriorate in the sunlight. Like the current film has, then here's a view of the inside, showing both the change in the glass transparency and the change in the grid, and you can see the curators wanted to have a more open feeling with larger pieces of glass and by raising the height of the first piece of glass. One is able to get a good view out if you're a person standing on the floor, even though we wanted to get rid of all the shades there's so much light coming in and the art is fragile that we will have to have shades some of the time. So, during the warm summer months, when the sunlight is at its greatest, there will still be a shade that retracts from the floor and only covers the first row of glass, the first two rows of glass when the museum is closed, only the first one when it's open, but that will only be for a few months a year and not the typical condition. And since the different pieces of art have different sensitivities to light, it might even be that the Oceana has the shades up in America doesn't. But this is still, we think, an improvement because much of the time you'll be able to see out and there will not be the full height shades going from top to bottom. So this is just a rendering of the new galleries which are in design as well. At the same time as this curtain wall project, you can see on the left, the shades and what we hope will be a much more open feeling with the glass simply glowing rather than being covered by these shades and, of course, the glass and properties of the glass and light transmittance that you see in the curtain. Wall are very precisely calibrated for the conservation goals of all the objects that will be displayed in the galleries. So now, I want to talk about the glazing system and here's where there actually is going to be probably the key visual difference between the existing sloped glazing and the new sloped glazing. So at the top three drawings you can see what is there now, and it is a traditional curtain wall system or a sloped glazing system where there is a million cap on the outside. You see this aluminum grid cap on the outside of the million, and what we're proposing is a system that is newer technology, but is much more efficient, which is to have a no cap on the outside, simply to have a flush glass joint and to attach the glass from the inside and the reason. This makes a huge difference for the met with its high humidity levels. As you can see in the cross sections you have that aluminum cap on the outside, there are inevitably little screws or clips going through the glass between the joints holding on to the cap on the outside and those are cold bridges and they tend over the 12,000 square foot area of this class. They tend to make lots of little cold spots and compromise the thermal bridge so that the inside gets cold. Water forms on the inside and water begins to drip off onto the floor and onto the artwork. But if we can hold on to the glass and attach everything from the warm side of the glass and really leave the outside the cold surface, facing the exterior to be untouched by anything from the inside, it's a huge increase in efficiency. So this is something that is really a big aesthetic change, but it's an aesthetic change driven entirely by the need and desire to have better more efficient technology. It's not driven from a design point of view visually, but this, although perhaps the kind of system is not so critical in a residential or a commercial structure and a museum structure which is a very special environment that keeps these high levels of humidities. The difference in efficiency is enormous, so we are proposing to take this forward technologically a little bit more about the glass. It's a double laminated glass. The film on the inside lamination, is what controls the amount of light levels and on the outside are frits. You can see, there's little white dots and that is actually what prevents birds from flying into the glass. The birds perceive the little dots and this has been tested and there are now standards for bird safety. They perceive the little white dots as a solid surface, and so they won't fly right into it and the dots are visible close up, but just like the dots in a photograph in a newspaper once you back off a few feet, you really can't see them at all. Here's a couple of samples of the actual glass that we're proposing the left is the glass at the bottom row and one of the glass pieces of glass in the upper row of the right. Interestingly enough- and we just found this out last week- but this bird safety glass idea that the New York City, Building Code, is going to adopt it. So these bird DOT frits are actually going to be required in the building code for projects that are filed as of next year 2021. So these have gone from being a voluntary design feature in the park to being actually required by the building code and just some details. We're of course, going to replicate the profiles at the top of the gutter and the bottom and the sides where it connects to the rest of the building, but with better insulation and condensation control and just to show rendering, after all, that the technical information. This is what the glass looks like right now. You can see the aluminum million caps on the outside of the glass and then here's a rendering of what it will look like with this new technology. It'll be smoother, but it'll still be the same large volume of glass. You can perceive a little bit the changes of the glass as you go up the surface transparent to more opaque, however, because this glass is tilted back, 20 degrees, it's always reflecting the sky and it's an effect that you can see if you go outside and look at car windshields in the street car windshields, always reflecting some of the sky they're hard to see through so no matter the quality of the glass, whether transparent or opaque. It's still going to be somewhat reflective and I. Think, therefore, more of a kind of a unified look just a couple of other close-up renderings of the before with the old system and the new, but there's one important thing about this: the site, which is that this is not actually a part of the method you can walk right up to and get close to. These are those are photographs that I took, but for the average person walking in the park, you're usually quite far away from that glass. In these photos, you can see the pedestrian path on the south side of the Met is on the far left and the top photograph on the far right and the lower photograph you're kind of 50 to 75 feet away from the glass you're down the hill. There's a screen of trees in front of it. So inevitably, this glass is really seen not up close like a street facade, but it's a kind of a background. It's a background and it's a background seen through a screen of trees. So I think that means that the differences will be probably not noticed by the majority of people. Similarly, viewed from Fifth Avenue and the making and white facade, you can see that the glass wall, which is sloped 150 feet back from the street you'll, see it at a very oblique angle and might not be the change might not be that perceptible were asked by the Landmarks Commission. They were saying well, if you're going to change one of these glass wings I mean. Can you see it at the same time as other parts in the map where the glass touches the ground, which is a fair question, and this is a axonometric of the southeast corner of the met. So you can see that these wings are so big. The modern and contemporary wing, which has massive limestone walls, actually makes you have to walk about 450 feet to go from the petri court facade to the Rockefeller facade. So we think that this glass facade exists somewhat in isolation. You would never see it at the same time as some of these other wings, and so we think that the difference which is subtle will be acceptable, and you might have been thinking this to yourself, just as the Landmarks Commission did. They said well what about the symmetrical twin on the north side, where the Temple of Dender is housed, and as Brett mentioned, this is a symmetrical wing. There is no intent or there's no funding and there's no application to do anything to the Temple of Dendra wing at this time, but the LPC. They asked us to include this just for reference, and so we are doing just that and that is to say that the Temple of Denver Wing, which was built just a few years earlier, is architecturally pretty much exactly symmetrical. The difference is, of course, that it faces north and because it faces north, it doesn't have all the sun problems. However, the condition of the curtain wall is actually very similar. Eventually, it will need to be replaced and we would even propose to replace it with a similar system at one point and here's a rendering of the temple of denderwing at the bottom Rockefeller at the top. But this is only for reference, it shows a future intent and it is absolutely not part of this application. He asked landmarks to confirm that was the case and they did say that it was. Similarly one can ask the same question as landmarks did about the glass roofs of these two wings, which are actually not visible from the park as they're set back and fairly flat, and the idea is to do the same kind of replacement. The same kind of system eventually. But it's not part of the current plan. But it will be at some point in the future, but not part of this application included here at landmark's request just for reference for to show a future intent, and that would be the same kind of a system. Just one more thing before I come to the end of this, which is a precedent for this kind of system used at the met, and that is the skylights over the european paintings galleries. What we call wings, a b and c they're, the oldest wings, at the met at the back facing the park, although somewhat land locked now and under construction. Right now, and in fact, the first phase of that project was just completed and opened to the public over the past weekend. Is there a complete replacement of thirty thousand square feet of skylights over the paintings galleries, some of which are visible to the park, and so landmarks actually approved this on a staff level in 2017, because these skylights are kind of high up and not particularly visible, not as visible as the Rockefeller wing. But in this case, with this 350 foot long a slope of glass facing the park we did actually put in the same system. It went from a 1930s old system. You can see it illuminates the attics over the paintings galleries here to the system that we are proposing, corrugated wire glass to this new sleek silicone support, glazed glass I said this was approved by them same kind of system and one of the things that we showed them and they referenced it when we showed them. This project is just an interesting concept for approaching skylights at the met. The skylights of the met, of course, have been replaced several times every two or three generations. They need to be replaced Mckinney and white when they came to the met in 1907. The first thing they did was actually to replace all the skylights. This is what that wing looked like 120 years ago, but they have a note on the drawing that we noted in one of the skylight details, and the note says this section of the skylight is intended to be a standard of quality contractors shall use this type or another, equally good, to be approved by the architects, and we took this to mean that Mckeemie and White at that time understood that the skylight was a technology and a kind of a piece of infrastructure, and that really what the met should do is put the best possible kind on it and the skylight technology has evolved over the years and over the course of these european paintings wings. It's gone from Mckinley and White's flat wire glass to this 1930s corrugated wire glass, which overlaps like shingles, which was incredibly long-lived, but was terrible for condensation and thermal and to the one that we are putting in now. So there was this idea that we proposed to the met that really it makes sense for skylights at the met which are so critical to conserve the collection to evolve as the technology allows, and that should always have the best and it's really more of a art, conservation and mission kind of appropriateness than perhaps looking at the trueness to the original look of the glass. It's just a rendering of that subtle change facing the park, which is under construction now, and those skylights same kind that we're proposing for the Rockefeller wing under construction, and here they are on the west side of the museum facing the park under construction and this photograph was taken a couple of weeks ago. So that concludes the presentation. I'll just say, which is one thing about the schedule. If all goes as planned, this construction would begin next fall next November and take about 14 months and hopefully we'll be at that point soon. So thank you for listening to all that and we welcome your questions and comments. Well, thank you very much. It was a very impressive presentation. I think all the members of the committee would agree with that. Will I think we can stop the screen share yeah if Michael yep I will certainly do that. Yeah. Thank you. Are there any members of the public who wish to address the application and it's just a friendly reminder to go to the participants menu at the bottom of your screen pop open that box and use the raise hand button or hit star 9. If you're calling in from the phone any raised hands, will only Michelle burn bomb, but we'll go through that we'll go to the committee. If there's no other, no one from the public, we can go to the committee and why don't we hear in alphabetical order, I think that's easy or well? Okay, thank you! So much I'm going to lower your hand because you'll be back up in a second, so we'll start with Elizabeth Ashby at the top of the order. Yeah well. I would really like to hear from the architects on our committee, because I think this is one of the disadvantages of a zoom meeting. We don't get to see material samples. One thing nothing to do with architectural appropriateness, but I'm delighted that you're using glass that bird, safe glass I have no affection for glass buildings and that they kill birds is yes another thing I don't like about them, but I. Don't think that this is a dramatic enough change to oppose from, and I'm very grateful for your presentation, but I will reconsider when I hear all the brilliant things that my co-committee members have to say. Thank you. Elizabeth next would be gel. Baron. Give me one second to get her unmuted go ahead. Gail. You said that the glass will be smoother than it currently is. Will it be the same thickness? Thank you. The glass will be smoother only and that will not have those aluminum million caps forming a grid. That's what I meant by smoothness and the glass actually will be quite a bit thicker, because there are many more layers, so it offers many more layers of protection and the smoothness common was really about the removal of those aluminum grid caps, and is the insulation similar to what is currently being constructed on the skylights or is it different? It's actually a triple glazed glass and it is a probably about really the highest kind of insulation value you can get out of this kind of glass, so it's a very high performance system, that's being proposed, and also what about the wind loads we've had such bizarre weather. You know we're suddenly at 70 degrees of this, and then the wind is kind of swooping around at 100 miles an hour right. Well, the zit is being it has been very robustly engineered for that kind of thing. Okay, thank you. Those are my questions. Thank you, girl. So next is Michelle Burnbaum hi. Thank you, terrific presentation, easy to understand. It looks like good improvements and from what I can see unless I hear something really to the contrary. I think I can fully support it. Let me just clarify your first two levels from the ground and the one above it do those have fritz too, or do those not have fritz. They do have Fritz and what's interesting about the Fritz is they are really only visible close up and particularly from the inside, they really kind of dissolve into kind of what you call a slight haze or a slight glow and I use the analogy of dots that are making up a photograph in a newspaper once you're, you know a foot away, you don't really see them, but they so, but they are the same dimension as the dots I'll use that word going up. Yes, the you said the first two floors were transparent right, so there's two layers of screens in the glass, so the dots stay, consistent, the entire way up, and then the film actually on the inside is what becomes more and more opaque as you go up so there's two levels: it's not the fritz, it's just it's the layering! That's correct! Okay and I assume it's also, since it's sloped I, don't know if the sloping is different than the original or not the original, but what you're replacing so that it tolerates the weight of the snow. Yes, yeah, the other. The slope is exactly the same. It's exactly the same. Okay! Thank you. Michelle next is our chair. Elita Camp thanks will thanks Jane I, think it's fine I agree with Elizabeth on the birds and the proximity to other glass. Walls is not a problem, because the med clearly was designed and put together in different periods of time with different materials and different perspectives. So I don't have any trouble with any of that. I think it looks like it will be. Really terrific. Thank you and an excellent presentation. Thank you. Alita next is Sarah. Chu I have no questions. Thank you, Sarah. The next would be Anthony Cohen, okay, it wonderful presentation. Absolutely it's fine! It is so much an improvement over the existing. There is nothing worse than peeling film, but I do have one question which is more the architectural historical question. Why did or do you know why Rosh Ninkalu chose the class, the module that they did both across and up and down, and is it because it's what they always used everywhere or do we just not know? You know it's a good question, because it is kind of an unusually small grid and they- and that is something that they were using at that time. You know: Kevin Roche died a couple years ago and his office closed, but when we began working on the met about eight years ago, we actually went to his office and interviewed him and I was a privilege to hear him talk about his design, intent for the back of the met and what he said was he thought that you know the front of the met was so impressive, but facing the park he did not want to have a very imposing building, so his idea was that it would be alternating glass, which would be reflective, and you would only see trees and blocks of limestone which he envisioned being covered with ivy and it would blend in. So he was really trying to make these big tall wings at the back of the met kind of blend in and go away. So I can only tell you that was what I heard. Was this design intent historically, okay, thank you. Anthony next would be May Malik. Are you there? Oh, you muted yourself. Try that one more time! Thank you. So much sorry about that. Well, I. Don't have any immediate questions or comments. I want to thank the applicant for a really great and thorough presentation and I. Don't have any immediate flags. Thank you. May then Harrison hi, yes good evening. Thank you for a great presentation. So the one question I have I, don't know this might have been mentioned during the presentation if it was I, apologize I seem to fly over my head, but so the glass that is going to have you know a special design as to ensure that pigeons and other birds don't fly into it. Will that difference in design be visible to those inside the building too? Will it change the aesthetic of the glass walls at all for those walking within the galleries you know from the inside is actually not that visible because it's the white, dots or the gray dots tend to blend in with the sky and the brighter outside. So it's something that you can see close up, but once you back off more than a few feet, you just kind of get a slight haze or frosted glass effect. Okay, thank you very much. Marco Tamayo. Thank you. Can I see your presentation, I'm interested to see the details of the new connections of the new pundits. Can I see that please, because I want to ask. You is very specific question. Oh sure, absolutely let me just go back and all right. Let me see if I can go back so which part well you connected to the glasses. Let's see mullions. Do you mean this slide? No, oh yeah! Yes! What is this in the bottom, where you have a round circle and then what it is in the top? It is cocky what it is and right in here. Oh yes, so in the you can see in the drawing here, when you look at the outside of the glass, you have the pieces of glass and then there's really just a piece of sealant silicone sealant between them very thin, piece of sealant yeah and behind it as a piece of foam which holds it in place. So that's just really part of the okay, the sealant assembly. Okay, now I understand, okay, I! Think that's the question. Okay, now let me start saying the following: first of all, you inherited a nightmare because the design shouldn't be an abuse of glass is not your problem. You didn't create that and because there is less conscience of using and abusing of glass. Now you see that the proposal of the lamin, the lamination, the exterior lamination, is in very bad shape and that's one of your problems. The second problem is again: the abuse of glass produce condensation and the third part is you have too much light that now you have to figure out how so clearly it is said you shouldn't have too much glass, but that is again. You try to figure out something that is landmark something to for looking for a solution. So now your solution. Yes, you try to run away for the thermal bridge, absolutely right, but the thermal reach you can resolve for different weights. You can break the thermal reach and you still can have that kind of situation, because your proposal, I, think you have the same consequence of the laminate class. Because remember one of the biggest problem of when you face windows is the ultraviolet rays. The uv does is the most damages for no for any other element from outside, especially if you have large exposure like in this case, so using it like a my trainer used to say, Pookie I, don't know what it is spooky, but he's very ironic mentioned this silicon or caulkings or whatever. It is this all this element with the time the problem is, you have two elements that have different modules of the elasticity and this element works independently and that usually it fails that the material that is weak and usually the wick is exactly the silicon, because it's too much exposure and contraction. The fatigue is right away, so you may have a problems in your future using this kind of materials, even though that looks clean, it looks fine, but this solution probably was just on the whole. Probably maybe 10 I, don't know, maybe 20 years, and that's it. You still go back to the point zero. It's true that you try to improve with double or triple blast, which basically is no much difference. It is still the same problem, so the solution personally myself I find that the only thing you try to do is to replace in kind when you have an opportunity to make a different statement, and you have an opportunity to actually protect the extraordinary values that they have inside of this museum. So if I had to approve yes, I think your solution, I, don't think you're so much, but this is a technical solution. This is nothing that we judge in our committee in our community, we're going for the it was relevant. According with what we discussed, but at the end of the day, we have to see how it's gonna be how long it's gonna hold that solution and usually in landmark those buildings, and this is the list of Ashby she's right, always the traditional materials work better and you can see hundred years and still in good condition, Marco we're just dealing with the application in front of us I'm doing, because this is relevant on that part. But in order to make my comments, I had to write the technical issue to demonstrate one part of not only for this application by the way, all the applications are the same when we deal with windows- and this is a large- a huge window- 200 feet wide. So this is why I'm going in that direction- and this is relevant with all the applications when you mix two different materials, Elisabeth she's, right, she's, saying use the same traditional materials, the history of materials does is what it is, and that's is. Basically, we have your in this problem that maybe, if the solution looks clean, but in the future it's not gonna hold much. Thank you. Marco. Thank you so now we'll move to our public members, Christina Davis and then we'll move to Kimberly Selway after that. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you. I, don't have any more questions and I just would like to commend by our blender bell, for I mean this up to me. It's another example of their excellent work on historic landmarks, which they have all over the city, and we really appreciate it. Thank you Christina and finally, Kim Sellway and then we'll go back to our co-chairs. Thank you, Ellen. Thank you, Jane again, just echo what everyone else has said. Thus far great presentation and I agree with some of the comments from Elizabeth and Elite in particular, I. Think, given how reasonable this change seems to be. This is an application. I can support just given the benefits to the art in the swing. Thank you, Kimberly Jane and David. Well, I. Think, technologically it's an excellent solution. Proportion is really important and textures are really important and I think that what Kevin Roach did and 30 years ago, whatever it was I'll mix I'll miss the texture and the proportioning of that wall. But what we gain, on the other hand, is a much better wall in terms of its energy efficiency, its performance and from the inside out. It's going to be better because you will not have as many millions the view will be more expansive, so on balance, I think it's a winner, but I won't call it a home run, but I do think it's the right solution and it may be that Kevin Roach might have come up with the same solution 30 or 40 years later. So my compliments to buying Linda Bell I certainly will support it. Thank you David. You know we see so many presentations at the Landmarks Committee. It's just a joy to see a presentation that it was as thoroughly refined as this, including showing the aerials of the overall museum, the symmetry in the East and west with the glass it's so impressive, and it speaks to how important this museum is in our wonderful city, I think we're ready to go to a vote. It sounds to me like a move to approve anybody want to make a resolution move to approve. Second, thank you I. Will you could ask if there's anyone opposed and they could raise their hand yeah if anyone is opposed just raise your hand, so you see it. Elizabeth seems to have her hand or she did I think she was just giving me a thumbs up for the second thing earlier, but I can check with Elizabeth really quickly Jane I, just I, don't know if I'm supposed to do this or not, but I just want to disclose. I'm probably not alone in this that I'm a member of the met. Well, so my leader I, don't think it matters in this case. I love didn't either, but just to be above board on everything, and so thank you shaking her head too Kimberly I think we can go to a vote. Thank you, Elita. We could have a show of hands. I bet. A lot of us are members there. It's great, isn't it it's such a wonderful institution. In any case, is there anybody got their hand up? Will? No, so if you're ready, I'll call the roll and unmute everybody and we'll go okay, go ahead underway, so I just want to make sure everybody see the vote sheet on my screen. Great I'm just gonna unmute everybody on the committee very quickly. You don't have to confirm it right away. Then we'll run the roll, so Elizabeth Ashby, yes, all right, I broke my computer. Give me one! Second, sorry guys: okay, kill Baron! Yes! Thank you Michelle! Yes! Thank you! Elita! Yes, Sarah! Yes! Thank you! Anthony! Yes, David! Yes! Thank you! May yes! Thank you Jane! Yes, thank you! Harrison yeah! Thank you! Marco! Yes, yeah Christina! Yes, thank you and Kim. Yes, wonderful, unanimous approval! Well, it's really a joy to see in such an incredible presentation with so much historic material. I'm sure somebody has an item of new business. Does anybody have an item of new business? Any hands raised? Will no? How about old business? No old business? Well. I know that Elizabeth did draft a wonderful letter response to the Landmarks Commission over the Civitas initial Letter Elizabeth. Do you want to talk about that just for a minute? Well, I, just I think I emailed you about it before just to see. If we wanted to send a copy to the author of the letter that insulted us and we were, we see seed, everybody and his brother, including the organization they as far as I know. They see nobody and they did not see us. I was just sent a copy emailed a copy by somebody, so that was how we knew that they had sent a letter to landmarks opposing everything we said about protecting window monster plants, so we wrote a letter and sent it to landmarks and did not cc and I just wondered whether we wanted to send an official or unofficial copy of our letter to the organization and, if so, who should send it and who should receive it. So if anybody had any thoughts that was that I, just I'm not advocating one way or the other, but I, think it was the kind of messy way we got the letter and so I, don't know what you all think we should send them a copy or not. I sent the copy of our letter, plus the two original letters to every member of the committee. Well, I personally feel Elizabeth that we should send a copy of the letter that went to the commission to the head. I, don't know who the president of the Organization of Civitas is, but I definitely feel they should see our comments. I don't know if anybody has any other thoughts on that, but I would agree with you. Jane yeah, first of all, I don't think they gave us credit for understanding what we were doing with respect to the master planning of these windows and I think that they should see what we were doing. I don't think we have to be antagonistic, but I think it's good if they understand that they were off base, they didn't know what they were talking about. I'm saying it more nicely than you do, starting with complaining about a non-existent historic district, but still well. Thank you. Elizabeth I mean we were fairly derogatory in our letter and you know. Maybe we should downgrade our response by just simply sending it to the organization. Well, I would send it. Is it should be? The letter should be addressed to someone not just you can't just put civitos on the envelope. I would certainly try to find out. I'm sure it's on their website who the head of the organization is, and they should get the letter it might be. Jim Tripp, okay, Mark Alexander is listed as their president right now. Okay, is there any other anything else? I have something. If I may, I'm not really sure what to do about it, but there's a proposal to develop governor's island, the portion below the historic district with buildings that may be as tall as 30 to 40 stories, even though it's in CB1 and they're, actually new lerp and the Euler meeting at CB1 is this evening. It's a city-wide issue because it's a park for the entire city, it just happens to fall within CB1 and the buildings are just on the side. It seems. I went to one of the trusts presentations and it seems that the buildings are just south of the historic district and in one of their renderings, of what the historic district will look like in the winter with people. Building snowballs are the buildings in the background, so even though they won't be tearing anything down and won't be interfering in the historic area, it seems just the impact of the buildings alone will do something to that. So I just wanted to raise it. I, don't really know what to do about it, but it's a city-wide issue. Well, thank you. Alita I think we'd have to see some plans. I can't you know, I mean what do you think David? It's we have to see a visual of I know, I have they've done, presentations and the materials are available and I should be getting the resolution from CB1. I've asked for if they have one this evening, but I certainly should be able to present something. I mean not me per I mean there certainly should be some kind of visual available, leading I'm not familiar with the zoning on Roosevelt Island. Are you saying that they're building, not Roosevelt I mean on I'm at Ellis Island governor's? It was deeded with housing restrictions, for instance, that there's to be no permanent housing, but they I'm familiar with governors, island yeah. We don't want any tall buildings on governors, island and they're intending to take dorms as I. Don't want any more buildings on governor's island, but the truth be now well me too, but let's see how we can approach them, I mean. Can we see some visuals at next month's landmarks, Committee meeting and I'm sure? Yes, okay, so why don't we make it on the agenda under new business for next month and make sure we get some visuals Elita? Okay? Does that, okay with everyone I, don't think we can take a position unless we see I agree no I, just wasn't. You were thank you David and thank you Jay and I wasn't sure what to do about it. So this gives a direction. Thank you. Well, if Cd1 would like our support- or maybe we're happy to do it once we support their resolution, which would be the way I'd like to go, but we need to see some visuals first, okay, anything else, I see, Michael Whetstone is still with us, a really impressive presentation. You know the met in that huge, seeing those aerials what a stroke of genius that was really in the symmetry and the limestone versus the glass anybody else of any other comment on anything before we adjourn and wish everybody well we'll see each other on Wednesday night at our full board. Meeting no need for the met to be there really at our Zoom meeting, because it was a unanimous resolution from the committee, but of course, you're welcome to come and speak during the public session. If you wish to, and thank you Brett as well, you spoke first. Thank you. I just want to say. I just want to briefly introduce myself, I'm Frances Ascano and I work with the government Affairs department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and I just want to say thank you for allowing us to present tonight. Oh well, thank you. Have all these other boards to present to so you'll be getting a lot more face time nice to meet you and if you guys haven't heard Francis's boss, Tom Shuler, who you guys have probably seen over and over. However many years he's retiring at the end of the year. Oh, my so well you're sad for his loss, but you know the men will be here and I will be here to continue on with everything he's done and continue our great relationship with community 48. Well, thank you! So much guys this is so weird! Well yeah, oh I, didn't know my hand has been up all this while I was just going to ask Elita. Has the governor's island proposal come to the Borough board? Actually it hasn't yet it's in the first step of Euler, but CB1 requested that Gail send a notice to all of the Manhattan boards asking. If we would support, see Cb1's I, guess position, but they didn't have a position. They haven't had a resolution. Yet I asked the zoning committee, but they need a resolution from CB1 which may be coming tonight. To be frank, this is a personal interest of mine. I've been to governor's island any number of times and I'm trying to not as chair of this board, which ends pretty soon anyway, but just on a personal level to try and generate enough interest in the city to get the attention of the trust and the elected officials. Well, thank you so much I think if we see plans as long as Gail is asking all the boards for commentary that does pull everybody in anyway. So if we see plans I guess then we can address it. Yes, thank you Michelle. So is there a move to adjourn? Thank you thanks everyone, a great meeting tonight. Thank you very much. You guys on Wednesday, absolutely okay.
