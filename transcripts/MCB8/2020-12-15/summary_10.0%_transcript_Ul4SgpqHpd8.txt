Please begin your presentation, so I'm, not sure who's, gonna, I, think I'll start hi, everybody.
And, we're here tonight to talk about the planned renovation of the Michael Rockefeller wing, which was built 40 years ago to house our arts of Africa Oceania and the Americas collection.
This collection was gifted to the museum as primitive art and for the past 40 years we've been trying to address that failing and how the collection has been presented to the public, and this is a very important project, the museum to be able to do that.
It's reflective, and we would like to address that, given our location in the park and our care for birds, You all are also probably aware, as our neighbors, that we have a sister wing to this, which is the sackler wing, and that will Mike will address that when he talks about the project, but the two wings, while they may look similar from the outside, have very different purposes on the inside.
So the fact that they're right next to a south facing glass wall has been problematic throughout the wings history and that's something that's very important for us to address in this project.
So, First of all, the museum is located in central park, as you know, which means, by the way, that the Landmarks Commission requires us to go to all the community boards that surround the park.
So, this is, of course, the first, but that we're going to go through six community boards over the next five or six weeks before we come to the public hearing and just to give everybody the context.
Museum had always intended to grow to approximately this footprint, so the Landmarks Commission approved all of the wings in yellow the master plan of 1970 and over the course of 20 years from the 1970s into the early 90s.
Those wings were constructed, temple of Dender and the american wing, and the layman wing were first in the 70s, followed by these wings on the south side in the 80s and 90s, and so the Rockefeller wing is before the Landmarks Commission, because it is a modern edition that was approved by the Landmarks Commission 40 years ago, and we are proposing changes to that design that was approved by the commission and again, The part of the scope.
You can see, as Brett mentioned, of course, that this large sloping glass wall faces South, which is a heavy burden for a glass building which is trying to protect fragile art objects, and, of course, Rosh.
The bottom two rows were more clear and the upper rows were more opaque, and that was the intent, but the glass technology was not so sophisticated as it is now in the 1970s and the amount of light and the amount of solar gain coming through that glass wall has been problematic ever since these are some of the problems we're trying to solve.
So for this reason, As these galleries are renovated, the met decided to propose to replace this entire curtain wall with a much higher performing technological glass piece, because better technology is available now than was 40 years ago, and here's a view of that entire facade, the floor, plan, relationship to the galleries and there's just quickly.
What we would ideally like to do is control the light coming in for art conservation, So you still get natural light, but we don't need to have those shades and there are treatments of glass which will allow us to do.
We'd like to be able to control the quantity of light, make it much more thermally efficient for energy savings and, as Brett mentioned we'd like to address the bird safety problem because birds when they see angled glass reflecting the sky, they think that it is the sky and they meet their untimely end by colliding with the glass and then, of course, There are other areas: gutters flashing, mechanical systems, we're trying to address all that comprehensively.
Think that when you compare existing and new, when you think of this building as a single sheet of glass, a single volume of glass sandwiched between these two limestone, clad wings, the architect's original intent of a glass clad volume and a sheer glass surface is still going to be there.
Like, the current film has, then here's a view of the inside, showing both the change in the glass transparency and the change in the grid, and you can see the curators wanted to have a more open feeling with larger pieces of glass and by raising the height of the first piece of glass.
So now, I want to talk about the glazing system and here's where there actually is going to be probably the key visual difference between the existing sloped glazing and the new sloped glazing.
But, this bird safety glass idea that the New York City, Building Code, is going to adopt it.
These bird DOT frits are actually going to be required in the building code for projects that are filed as of next year.
Similarly, viewed from Fifth Avenue and the making and white facade, You can see that the glass wall, which is sloped 150 feet back from the street.
Similarly one can ask the same question as landmarks did about the glass roofs of these two wings, which are actually not visible from the park as they're set back and fairly flat, and the idea is to do the same kind of replacement.
Is there a complete replacement of thirty thousand square feet of skylights over the paintings galleries, some of which are visible to the park, and so landmarks actually approved this on a staff level in 2017, because these skylights are kind of high up and not particularly visible, not as visible as the Rockefeller wing.
In this case, With this 350 foot long, a slope of glass facing the park we did actually put in the same system.
This is what that wing looked like 120 years ago, But they have a note on the drawing that we noted in one of the skylight details, And the note says this section of the skylight is intended to be a standard of quality contractors shall use this type or another, equally good, to be approved by the architects, and we took this to mean that Mckeemie and White at that time understood that the skylight was a technology and a kind of a piece of infrastructure, and that really what the met should do is put the best possible kind on it and the skylight technology has evolved over the years and over the course of these european paintings.
I would really like to hear from the architects on our committee, because I think this is one of the disadvantages of a zoom meeting.
Don't think that this is a dramatic enough change to oppose from, and I'm very grateful for your presentation, But I will reconsider when I hear all the brilliant things that my co-committee members have to say.
I seem to fly over my head, but so the glass that is going to have you know a special design as to ensure that pigeons and other birds don't fly into it.
Will it change the aesthetic of the glass walls at all for those walking within the galleries you know from the inside is actually not that visible, because it's the white, dots or the gray dots tend to blend in with the sky and the brighter outside.
It is still the same problem, So the solution personally myself I, find that the only thing you try to do is to replace in kind when you have an opportunity to make a different statement, and you have an opportunity to actually protect the extraordinary values that they have inside of this museum.
You know we see so many presentations at the Landmarks Committee.
