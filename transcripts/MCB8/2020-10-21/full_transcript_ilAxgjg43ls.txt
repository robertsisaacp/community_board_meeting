Now, yes, let me I'm going to call her okay I'll meet you for a second there. She is okay, great well. My plan is to just do a very short introduction and then turn it over to Susan. Then we'll do the absentee ballad then we'll do questions sounds great: okay, shhh Sherry! I do not see a whole lot of other people signing in. So if you are ready, it's yeah, because I do not see many of the committee. People are not here. It's what I was looking for. I do see. Ed is about to join. Oh okay, all right all right! So do you think I should start okay good evening, everyone. My name is Shari Weiner, I'm co- chair of the voting reform task force, along with my co-, chair, anthony Cohn, who just informed me. He had a family emergency and will not be able to join us tonight. This is the second in our series of programs on voting in 2020. At our last meeting, we had Assemblyman Dan Court speak to us about the new reforms that have taken place in Albany dealing with voting very informative and tonight we're going to talk about how to implement those reforms. We're going to be talking about absentee voting early voting, we're going to give you specifics, we're giving you dates and then we're going to talk about the vote. Safe, New, York program that you all got and then we're actually going to go through your absentee ballot with you, I'm very fortunate, and then we're going to answer your questions. Obviously we're very fortunate this evening to have with us an expert on voting in New York, Susan Lerner, who is the executive director of common Cause New York Susan joined common cores in December 2007 she's responsible for setting their priorities strategy. Lobbying serves as their spokesperson, fundraising and leading the New York common course team. So she's gotten herself quite a lot of responsibilities before joining common core Susan serves as executive director of the California clean money campaign, she's. Also a member of the New York and California bar. She was a litigator for almost 20 years and she has a degree in psychology which always helps from the University of Chicago and her law degree from New York for School of War Barbara Chockey who's. One of our task force members had heard Susan speak about voting and recommended her to me and I'm so pleased that she has accepted our invitation to speak to the greater Community Board aid community about voting in November 2020, and let me welcome Susan Lerner. Thank you. So much sherry happy to be here this evening. It is a really challenging election this year because of the pandemic and the overlap with the presidential election, which is when more people come out to vote in New York City than for any other election, and certainly we saw the impact of the pandemic in June in the primary, where a really significant number of people voted absentee, and you probably heard from assembly member court about the fact that the expansion of availability of absentee voting has now been codified into law. So that means with the addition of early voting that was passed by the legislature last year that for the first time, New York's voters have three different ways to vote in 2020. So you have choices to make in terms of how and when you want to vote. So the most important thing that I can say to you tonight is make a voting plan decide where and when you want to vote, decide if you're going to bring somebody with you to vote if you're going to make it a social occasion. And the second thing that I would say to you is: do not delay once you've made your plan. If you decide that you want to vote absentee, then get your absentee ballot and fill it out, send it back as quickly as you can, but with three ways to vote. It's actually a interesting proposition for you to actually make your voting plan because first, you are entitled to an absentee ballot under the expansion in the law. You would anybody who has a fear of getting Covid-19 or passing on Covid-19 is entitled to an absentee ballot under the justification of temporary illness and for the first time we are all able to request our absentee ballots online and for New York City residents. I strongly recommend that if you want an absentee ballot, the fastest and most sure way to get it is to go on the vote. Nyc website that's vote.nyc and request your absentee ballot. You'll also be able to track your absentee ballots, progress through the board of elections through the mail to you and then back to the board of elections on that same website. Nyc it's vote.nyc and you can find a lot of basic information about voting. The third way in which you can vote this year is early voting and we're going to talk about that in detail and, of course, you are always able to vote in person on election day. So for the first time this year. Another change and a very positive reform for our voters is that the governor required every board of elections to provide voters with basic information about where and when and how they could vote. Usually, we get a little postcard in August. It reminds you that you're a registered voter, it does not have a lot of information. It might tell you where your election day polling place is, but does not tell you anything about early voting and you're kind of on your own. That's not the case. This year, this year, every registered New York City voter received this pamphlet. The votesafe NYC pamphlet with the masked statue of liberty on it, and it has all of the information which you need to determine how you want to vote. It's in spanish and it's in English, Avoid lines vote absentee vote early vote safe, and it provides you with information regarding the dates and also a voting card, a card that you could take with you to your polling place that will speed up the check- in process. For you, this is not an I d card, it is not required, but it is a convenience that will allow you to check in electronically. It's a fast pass tag. It is not a voter. I d, we do not have voter. I d requirements in New York state the way they do in some other states where they're trying to discourage people and suppress the vote. We make it difficult enough for people to vote. We do not have to go out of our way with an I d, but if you bring this card with you to your polling place, it has a bar code, which you then would be able to scan with the electronic poll book. The laptop or tablet that checks you in and verify your identity by signing the pad. So early voting is a new reform which, as I said, was passed by the legislature last year, which we've been working very hard to get set up and to inform voters about it. Early voting takes place for 10 days in New, York state. It starts at 10 A.M on October the 24th. That's this coming Saturday and it runs all the way through the following week to the following weekend: Sunday, which is November 1. on the weekends Paul. The early voting locations will be open from 10 to four, but the hours vary during the week. There are two evenings where early voting is available until 8 pm, and that is on and I'm checking my handy dandy, pamphlet, Tuesday and Wednesday. Yes, Tuesday the 27th and Wednesday the 28th yep correct, and so our early voting is open from noon until 8 on those days which gives you more flexibility. There are 80, plus early voting polling places in New York City. Unlike the situation in every other county in New, York State in New, York City, you have to know which early voting polling place you were assigned to. All of the other counties have county- wide early voting, which means that you could go to any early voting location. Even if it's not the one. You do not receive an assignment. You pick, whichever one is most convenient to you. That is not the case in New York in New York. You have to look up your early voting location and again make a plan. I know when I'm planning to vote, I'm planning to vote early and I'm planning to vote on Tuesday, the 28th between 1 and four at my nearby early voting location. My husband's planning to vote the day before studies have shown that when you make a plan to vote, you are much more likely to actually carry it out and, as I've said, it is actually a nice thing to bring a family member or a friend who is also planning to vote and make it a community social occasion. This time this year, for the first time, people are able to drop off their absentee ballots at early voting locations and at election day polling places, and unlike the situation with early voting, you can drop off your absentee ballot at any early voting, location or election day polling place anywhere in New York City, when you walk in to a polling place, whether it's an early voting location or an election day location. The first thing that you see is the information table on the information table in New York City. There will be a large box and it's going to have this design on it. The statue of liberty with the mask and it's going to say absentee ballot, and so it is a locked box which is right there attended by the poll workers that you can place your absentee ballot in and know that it's been received by the board of elections. Some people are concerned with all of the bad publicity and the strange things happening with the postal service, as they do not want to take the chance that their ballot might go astray, and so they want to drop it off. You can drop off your absentee ballot today. Well, it's a little late now, but tomorrow at your borough, which would be the Manhattan board of elections down on Barrack street. But if you do not want to trust the mail with your ballot, you can drop it off at in these large drop- off boxes at any early voting location between October, 24th and November 1st or at any election day polling place, and you do not have to stand online. You do not have to sign in you, do not have to do anything more than walk in deposit your ballot in that large box and walk out. So it's kind of a mid level solution to the pandemic challenge. You do not have to interact with anybody. You are leaving the house. You will be going into a space with other people, but you do not have to talk to anybody. You do not have to interact with anybody, and you will know for sure that your ballot has been received and, of course, all of the usual election polling places. Well, that's an exaggeration because there are usually some changes, but many of the same election day polling places will be open on election day, as we traditionally have here in New York from 6 A.M in the morning until 9:00 pm in the evening and again, the absentee ballot drop- off boxes will be in every polling place. As I'm sure you're aware, you need to know where your polling place is here in New York. You can't just wander into one that you happen to go by and vote. You have to be at your assigned polling place in order for your vote to count and, as we know often on election day, particularly in presidential years, there can be long lines waiting to go in and be able to vote and that's why we're urging people who want to vote in person to seriously consider voting early? Let's avoid the crowds, let's spread the voters out over a longer time period, so we have fewer lines and fewer people in the polling place at the same time. So, if you can consider voting early and voting early in person means that your vote will be counted on election day and included in the election night totals so there's some definite advantages. I think it was voting early answers, a lot of questions that people have about their ballot being received and when it's going to be counted, one thing that's very unusual about New York is that you can always vote in person in New York, no matter what you may have done previously regarding an absentee ballot. We are one of the very few states that if you request an absentee ballot or you request and return your absentee ballot, you still can go and vote in person either voting early or on election day and in every instance. Your in- person vote will override your absentee vote, but because we provide this backstop to voters, it takes New York longer to get to count its absentee ballots than some other states. We have a significant grace period following election day for the receipt of absentee ballots. There's a grace period of seven days, post- election day by which the board of elections can receive your absentee ballot, and if it is postmarked no later than election day, it will be counted. But what that means is that the board of elections does not really start to address everything about absentee ballots. Until eight days after the election and the eighth day after the election, the board of elections compares the list of voters who voted in person to the list of people who submitted absentee ballots. And if there is somebody who voted in person who had also submitted an absentee ballot, the absentee ballot is removed and it is not counted because, although you can come in and vote in person, even if you sent back an absentee ballot, you still have only one vote in New York, and that is the one vote that will be counted and that will be your in- person vote. So you have flexibility in terms of how you vote all the way through election day, but it slows down the count so, eight days after they compare everybody in New, York City to everybody who sent in an absentee ballot, they remove any absentee ballot that was sent in by somebody who then voted in person. They do the same cross check acrosss the state again to be sure that each voter has only one vote which counts, and only after they've completed those checks. Do they begin to count the absentee ballots and that's one of the reasons why it takes a while here in New York to get the final answer in terms of the election results. It's not because they're incompetent- and it's not because they're messing around in some way with the ballots. It's because our law really provides some safeguards for voters to be sure that their ballots will be counted. The time that it takes to count. A large number of ballots is time well spent, because it means that the count is going to be accurate and the count, and they will be counting only the votes of people who are eligible to have their votes counted so get ready, be patient and understand that a fast rush job in New, York City with a election night answer for who's ahead, is absolutely not going to reflect the true state of the votes, because we're expecting so many absentee ballots to be counted. Today. The board of elections indicated that they have received 1.6 million requests for absentee ballots now, human nature being what it is. We do not expect that everybody who requested an absentee ballot will end up returning it or casting an absentee ballot, and, as I said, you can always change your mind and go in and vote in person. But I would not be surprised if we are looking at close somewhere between eight hundred thousand to a million absentee ballots, which is an awful lot of ballots to count, so it is going to take time. The board of elections has made some changes since June to try and speed up the process of counting the absentee ballots. They've invested in high- speed, sorting equipment that also photocopies the what we call the oath Envelope so that it can be checked. The first pass is a high- speed, sorting of absentee ballots kicking out any absentee ballot. That does not have a signature that is going to save a tremendous amount of time and the fact that the machine automatically photocopies at the same time also is going to cut down on the time that the board needs to spend before they can actually start to count the absentee ballots. We've also had a very significant change in the procedure regarding absentee ballots that should cut down substantially on the number of absentee ballots, which are not counted. You may have read after the June election that there were a surprisingly large number, a larger percentage of absentee ballots in Queens and in Brooklyn that were disallowed than people were expecting, and certainly many more of them were ideal. As a consequence of that situation, the state has made some significant changes. There is now a cure procedure passed by the legislature, improved by the governor's executive order and further expanded by a court order, settling a lawsuit which the legal women voters brought. So now, if you make a mistake and forget to sign your absentee ballot, oath, Envelope or forget to date it the board of elections, will notify you that there's a problem that can be fixed with your ballot and if it's before election day, they will be going through the absentee ballots that they receive and notifying people of any errors that can be fixed before election day. So you can decide if you want to go in and fix your absentee ballot or vote in person. If the error is ascertained when the ballots returned election day or after the board of elections is required to notify you and give you an opportunity to cure the problem so that your absentee ballot will count, this is a significant reform and an advance that is very pro-. Voter, we're very happy to see it, and so we are expecting many fewer ballots to be invalidated and a much higher percentage of ballots to be counted. So I've thrown a lot of information at you. But again. What I hope that you take from this discussion is an understanding that you need to make a plan and you need to make it right away to determine which of the three ways you plan to vote and how and when you're going to go ahead and vote and also just to let you know that it's important to vote as early as you can, if you're planning to vote before election day vote during the early voting period, if you're planning to vote absentee get your absentee ballot request it online, do not let it sit around, fill it out right away, send it back or drop it off, we'll have many fewer problems and less accusations about irregularities. If we all vote as early as we can and follow the rules, exactly thank you Susan that was so informative. I was wondering: can you talk a little bit about the tracking system that was instituted? People might like to know about that? Yeah? Yes, so when you go to the board of elections website, which is vote.nyc, as I said right at the center, there is a box which allows you to request your absentee ballot and under it there is the ability to click on a tab and and track your ballot. When you request an absentee ballot, your request is given a six digit confirmation number which will show up on the screen and which also, I believe, but do not hold me to it- is emailed to you with that confirmation number you can get back online and you can verify that your request has been received. You can see if your ballot has been mailed to you and unfortunately, things do happen. So I know of people who requested their ballot in early September, and it's indicated that it's mailed to them on the tracker, but they have not received it, so they know that they have to get a second ballot and then, when you send your ballot back, the tracker will tell you when it has been received by the board of elections. So this is an innovation as well something new that was instituted after the June primary, because so many people wanted the information to know. Yes, you have my request for an absentee ballot. Yes, it's being processed, oh good, it's been mailed and thank goodness I mailed it back and you got it and so this allows. You know you get nervous at four o'clock in the morning. What's happened with my absentee ballot? You do not have to wait to try and call somebody you can check it online yeah, that's a that's a major improvement in the system and I think many people could take advantage of that. I'm going to go through know how to fill out an absentee ballot, but please take the opportunity to go to our chat and put in your questions, which Susan will be hanging around to answer and rita. Maybe you should ask her the question that you had asked me previously: okay, so this is your absentee ballot. You make sure that your name is correct will told me to cover my name up, so I did that. But this is your absentee ballot. So that's the outside envelope and then inside you have your ballot. You have your the ballot envelope and then you have your mailing envelope. So let's go through and Susan, please jump in. If there's something that I leave out. Okay, on the instructions on the ballot, it says you should black in the name, the box next to the person you're voting for but of course, the boxes. The little circle is above the name, but right that's going to fill in the bubble, not the bubble. The instructions say the one to the left of, but you'll see looking at it. It's really above it now, even though Joe Biden and Donald Trump are on numerous parties, you only can vote for one. So if you're going to vote for Joe Biden, you either vote for him as a Democrat or you vote for him working families Donald trump. You would either vote for him for republican or conservative. So you can't vote twice. That's my point. You can only vote once for each candidate and then you would go through. We have members of Congress. We have our state senator members of the assembly to vote for it. Then you have to turn it over, and these are our judicial, Judith Justice of the Supreme Court justice of the civil court and just judge of the civil court. So you would vote here so now you have filled out your entire ballot, okay, so far so good, then you go to your official absentee ballot envelope. This looks like this. Okay and you put your ballot in there. Now you seal it by taking this off, do not use tape that creates a problem to make sure there is no extraneous marks on your ballot, because that will also have it thrown out now to help us this year, this election, because last time there was such a problem on your absent on this envelope, they've actually put a red cross and that's where you have to sign and then you have to date. This was a problem in the last election. Many people forgot or did not realize that they had to sign it. Okay, so now you're signed, you have to use blue or black ink. I'm trying to think of all the hints that we've picked up, so you sign it and you date it. Okay, now we're going to use the official envelope now, here's where it gets tricky on the back, there's a space for a barcode. You can see over here. So then you have to figure out how to put this in the envelope. So your barcode shows. So you really have to do it. I found upside down right. So, let's see it's ups yeah, you have to do it upside down, so I'm putting it in with the wording facing me, but you're putting it in that way because you have to have the barcode showing over here. So you have to make sure when you put your envelope in that it has the barcode. So that's another tricky thing again: you use this tape to seal. It do not use scotch tape. You have to put your address over here. Oh, I know another thing on the ballot. This was a big issue. They made a mistake and they have on it absentee military. It should have had a slash through it, and people have been asking if this is the correct, it says official absentee military ballot and it should have had a slash through it, but they forgot, but this is still a valid. This is your ballot, even though you're, not in the military, it it's for everybody, who's filling out an absentee ballot. I wanted to make that point. I was trying to think of everything that people have raised now. A big issue that Valerie Mason on from the board has been following is the amount of postage. You would think it's just you have this time you have to put postage on in the primary you did not. You would think it would just be one postage stamp, but Valerie has found out that you have to put two on it. We recommend two but do not be concerned they have to. Even if you do not have two on it, they have to deliver it, but to be safe. If you're going to mail, your ballot put two stamps on there and then they have a checklist. Did you sign this and date? The statement we went through that did you put your mark ballot in the envelope we discussed that. Did you put your sealed ballot envelope and the retoning with the barcode in the window? Okay, we did that and did you put postage on okay? So now you all should be knowledgeable and comfortable with filling out your absentee ballot, which you can mail or, as Susan said you can drop off at your early voting, location or regular location. I just wanted the deadline for applying for an absentee ballot is October, 27th, online or November. Do not wait because do not wait, no decent chance that it might not get to you in time or get back to the board. I mean you can run the deadline. That's your right, but you're do not gambling and if you want to find out where your voting locations are, you can go to find my poll site. Dot vote, DOT NYC, many of us in the Upper East side. Our early voting place is Robert Wagner, Middle, School, 225, East 75Th street, and then for some it would be hunter college, brookdale, dorm, 440, East, 26Th Street or the Jackie Robinson Complex 1573 Madison. But, as Susan said, you have to go to the specific location that you're assigned for early voting. So go to that a website and have that confirmed for you, okay, I think we're ready to susan anything that I missed or anything more. You want. I think, we're fine. We think we're good. Okay, let's see if we have any questions, we do not have any questions share the they only go to me whenever they put them in the chat. So would you like to use our regular? We have several people with their hands raised, okay, and we can call on them in the order that they were raised and if it's anybody's first time at a cba virtual meeting, please use the raise hand feature to ask questions to for Sherry to call on you, go to the participants, menu and open that box and then you'll see a button. That says raise hand great well. The first one I see is craig letter who's. Member of the task force. Can you Un Mute Craig for us yeah good evening, hi Susan. Thank you so much for the presentation I missed the beginning of it. So I apologize if my question is a repeat in any way, but I was just wondering in addition to just learning so much and thinking about how frustrating is that? Inevitably, people are going to start to throw out all these accusations about New York, slow voting when clearly they're, taking all these measures to make sure that people actually can vote, which is wonderful. I was wondering what measures are being taken to protect both voters and poll workers for in- person, vote in- person voting on election day, and will there be limits to the number of people allowed in the room and has there been verification that the ventilation is sufficient in rooms and also I was wondering where we stand in terms of poll workers. Do you have any sense of whether we have enough poll workers given that there may be many who would have done in the past, who may feel they're a vulnerable part of the vulnerable population? That does not feel comfortable doing at this time? So thank you for those questions. Let me take the second one. First, I am really happy to say that there has been a very broad outreach program to get new people to apply to be poll workers both at the national level at the state level and locally, and there is, for the first time a much larger pool of people who have applied to be poll workers than we've ever seen before. We have a lot of first time poll workers. We have a very solid number of younger people, who've applied to be poll both directly to the board and through the national power to the polls website, where over 20,000 people applied indicated that they wanted to be poll workers here in New, York City. So for the first time I feel that the board has an adequate or a very close to adequate pool. You know things happen. People drop out, somebody gets sick whatever, but I think we are in a much better position regarding poll workers than we have been previously. I'm not. I do not know if there are additional capacity limitations in polling places for election day. I know that there are significant precautions, which the board has instituted both for early voting and for election day, and we saw a lot of them on the ground in June, so, for instance, the board has invested in barriers which are at each voting table so that the poll worker and the voter are not directly communicating with their breath. Everybody is asked to wear a mask if somebody has refused to wear a mask. They are supposed to be escorted to a separate section of the polling place where they can vote without being near any other voters. The machinery is being wiped down on a regular basis. We all receive our own stylus and pen that nobody else has handled to be able to sign into the electronic poll book and to fill out the bubbles on the paper ballot. The poll workers are masked, I believe, Globe there should be hand. Sanitizer available many polling places have additional masks that are offered to voters who are coming in without masks and for early voting they're going the extra mile and every early voting location is being thoroughly disinfected overnight. Another reason to think about voting early, thank you. Susan next up, Michelle Burbaum who's, a member of our task force and also with community board 8 member yeah. Thank you very much both of you. This is very informative, very thorough. Just a couple of questions that I have are there going to be voting boxes that are freestanding any other places in the city. Besides the voting locations as there are in other cities. Okay, I think that's a good thing, considering the the issues. The second thing is when you send, if a person sends in their absentee ballot, you said that they get a cross- check after election day to make sure that if they showed up in person that they do not have that both ballots are not counted. Just one ballot is counting. Is that done in a computerized way, or is that done by an individual by hand literally checking addresses side by side? I do not spit out by a computer. I do not have that answer. I would imagine that the first sort is likely to be computerized yeah I mean because we're talking about. We have four million registered voters in New, York City. That's why I'm asking we have 1.6 million absentee ballots that have been requested, and so you know the reason why it's important to have the bar code, showing if your return envelope is that, when it's received by the board of elections, they scan the barcode right away without having to open, and so they are able to track. All of the voting rolls are computerized if you've sent in your absentee ballot and you vote in person that is going to be picked up by the the system that they use. So you mean that it's time for them to load everything in and they run the check. So you mean that your ballot that you may have cast in person will have the same bar code on it as the one you mailed in and one no ballot has worked. So if they do a cross check what's happening crosstalk is they cross check the electronic poll book? Oh okay, that's where you sign the sign and not get a paper ballot without signing in and showing through your signature that you are the registered voter who is listed on the voter rolls okay, now in we have had a lot of trouble in this district with voting machines going down and that's why we had very long lines. So our committee had been discussing whether or not there could be engineers at the polling places so that if a machine does go down there could be an immediate repair. We had a very serious problem. I think it was probably 2016 where there are voting places that ended up with one machine and literally people lined up around the block for hours and hours. Yes, the board of elections now has technicians in roving teams in each of the boroughs who are available to move more quickly out in the field and can be deployed where there's a problem. Okay, that was our task force recommendation. I'm sure that's all right! That was one. That's wonderful! That's great! With all that, my last question with all of the early voting, was any study or anything done. Do you? Does the board of election have any estimate at all as to how many people will actually show up on voting day on election day? Is there any kind of information, so the polling that I have seen actually was somewhat disappointing to me in that, and I think it was a Sienna poll that came out all the days blend during the pandemic, but I think about two weeks ago which showed that a larger percentage of people plan to vote absentee than plan to vote early and how about in person on election day well and it looked like there would be about somewhere between 55 and 60 percent of the people who were planning to vote were still planning to vote on election day. Terrific. Thank you very much very informative, appreciate it my pleasure, thank you. Next Rita Papa member of Community, Board, 8 and also member of our task force, Rita hi, I'm a poll worker and have been several years and I've already received my assignment for this year, and I will just two things: perhaps for the future. First of all, susan, you move fabulous and thank you, but one of the things being a scanner when a ballot is not marked properly. It does not go through the machine. I was going to mention if you over vote and that's one of the advantages of voting in person. If you know so, Sherry was saying: do not vote for the same person on two different lines. You could by mistake. Do that with your absentee ballot, and that will invalidate your application. If you do that in person, the machine kicks it back to you and says you have over voted, fill out a new ballot that that's number one quiz. Then you have to go back to the table and get a new ballot. You can only do that three times before you have to go to get a court order to get the fourth ballot. So if it was possible to make that a red light, you know sort of at the top of any absentee ballots that are not done in person to know that you can only vote on one line, even though that candidate's name appears acrosss, maybe four lines, four places. That's number one number two people check or cross an x in the bubble, instead of filling the bubble in again the machine rejects that. So those are things. Obviously it's too late this year, but things to keep in mind. And last but not least, this was terrific. This vote safe, New York. I almost threw it out. You know, because it came with a lot of other things and it said: here's how you can vote safe and well, I'm not about safe. I'm a poll watcher. I would suggest, if there'd be a burst on a very important envelope, saying in something like if you do not want to say card inside I not only did I but I several people said to me: should I throw this away? I said no look inside, so that's just a recommendation. Well I mean on the flap. It does say you're fast fastpass tag for con contactless check- in nobody knows what that means. Yeah listen. This is so head and shoulders above everything else. I had before yeah this little thing you can take with you great and it really I you know it is to the credit of the governor and his people that they insisted that this level of information be provided to voters for the first time and the New York City. One is a lot more readable, it's the same information, but it's actually well laid out and readable in other counties. People have gotten postcards that are just crammed with unreadable information. Thank you. Thank you, promoted, yeah, she's, a wealth of knowledge. Our next questioner is Barbara who's, member Community, Board aide and also a member of our voting reform task force. Barbara your question both and sherry. You know what my concern is. I do have a democratic with a small d concern. Somebody that is was trying to run for assembly on the independent line. After the absentee ballots came out, he was kicked off, but on my absentee ballot there is still his name. I'm worried about people that will vote for him. I hear that the his name will just be thrown out, which means that people do not have their voters eliminated and I'm very disturbed about it. I feel, and I'm also worried it- will feed into those naysayers that you have fixed elections, because there is something not right about it, and I wonder if you have any concerns or ideas or what can be done or whatever. So you know, one of the problems we have is that there is too much gamesmanship around appearing on our ballots in New York. What do you mean? I do not know what you mean by gaming. Gamesmanship is a concerted effort to push people off the ballot as opposed to actually defeating them at the polling place. Our law is very permissive in that regard, and clearly, whatever battle took place was protracted and as a consequence, the decision was made too close to the deadline for printing and for sending out the absentee ballots. It's unfortunate, I think our system should be a lot simpler. I think fewer people should be thrown off the ballot and I'm not getting involved with that. I was just disappointed. I heard about things that were wrong in Brooklyn and so on. I there's been no article that I've read and I've been conscious of it and no information. That said, if you want to vote for this person, you know write in his name. Do not vote for it. Your vote will not be count. There was no information that came out and it really did disturb me. Well, we have. We are very, it still disturbs me, a very low information state in terms of what's provided to voters. That's why I was so excited about this. Is it's actually usable relevant, timely information? But you know if it were a city office, there would have been the voter guide. So there is no question that I believe that voters should be receiving much more official information about candidates and who is actually on the ballot and more updated information. I hope there's no lawsuits and things like that to do it. I worry about consequences after and things like that. Thank you sure, and let's get a little bit more a little bit more hopeful that something will be done, but thank you. Yeah next questionnaire is Valerie Mason who's, a member of Community Board. Eight! Well, can you on me Valerie, say to Susan. Thank you so much. I actually was a poll watcher in July during the congressional 12 battle, and I can tell your presentation was so thorough and I and it's really heartwarming, to know that a lot of a lot of measures have been instituted to alleviate a lot of the problems that came to pass during those two three weeks that we were at the board of elections. Having had that experience, I agree with you that little red white and blue pamphlet is really amazing and part of the thing that I one of the things that I saw while I was at the board of elections, was that there were a huge number of affidavit ballots that had to be filled out because inexperienced poll co- workers based on information that was given sent to send people to the wrong table. So I think those cards are really important to to make sure that people are properly identified and quickly and you can move through the process very quickly. One thing I just wanted to mention- and I apologize if you, if you did talk about this, how important it is not to make any other markings on the ballot, because in my in my observations of at least 20,000 ballots that I looked at while I was there, many people, just you know, filled in their aded when they saw the empty box and those were kicked out, and so, even though it was not any kind of official or double marking, any markings on the ballot are really to do a disturbance. So you've got to be really careful. We really place too many obstacles too many barriers in the way we make it too hard for people to vote right. It's a real gotcha moment exactly. We have been working hard to try and change that yeah, it's a vestige of the 19th century yeah. Now I mean it was completely eye- opening and I urge anybody who's never done it before. The one thing I would say is: I really think you know having had that experience, there's very little room to have fraud, because everything is double and triple and questions, and you can really have a lot of faith in what is happening down there. So I'm really again, your presentation was excellent and I just urge everyone to remember to sign their ballot. I mean, but even the measure you and you indicated I- and I also wanted to say my we use that tracking device my mom is 90 did not get her ballot. We spoke with the board of elections last week and today she received her absentee ballot again, so they are really working very well the dune experience. While it was a nightmare, I think, has saved us perhaps from how bad it really could be this time around. So thank you very much yeah. Absolutely! You know it defended the board of elections. The decision to expand absentee was made less than eight weeks before the primary, so they were scrambling. They learned a lot and to their credit, they have made improvements. Do I think it's going to be flawless and perfect? It's a human system and these people are not hired because they are experts in election administration, so they're learning on the job, but they are doing a much better job, they're really thorough. I mean the errors that they can are really you think they're not paying. They can't see everything, but they see everything. So it's really a craft operation. Despite you know the arcane- ness of the New York system. So I also want to say that if you have issues on election day or problems that you are seeing, please report them to the election protection hotline, which is the one 866 hour vote national hotline, it's staffed by legal personnel, and they can help problem solve also you're very likely to see nonpartisan election protection monitors at some of your polling places because we're aware of the history of long lines on the east side and we send people to monitor, polling places that have had problems in the past and to assist voters. So look out for election protection monitors and know that there is a national hotline, 1- 866-r vote that you can report problems to and we will do our best to problem solve Susan. As I mentioned, this is a program of the Community Board aid voting reform task force and on behalf of the task force, I'm sure I could say if common cause is working on some of these areas. We would love to partner with you and do what we can to help as one of the things that we're going to look at after the election is just more in- person voting locations which certainly this was we had this conversation before Covid-19, but we certainly feel that we need to have more in in- person voting location, so we do not have the line so hopefully, when we feel comfortable again voting in person that can that can be addressed so again, let me you and I will stay in touch and we'll see how we can partner this together. Let's see next is Barbara Chucky who's. Also, a member community Board aide and on the task force will can you on Newt Barbara ever just confirm it on your screen? Okay, gotcha you're, good Susan! Thank you. This was great. I have one question. I know you said: there's no lines if you want to use a dropbox during early voting right. I listened to so many of the reports from other states. What, if there's a line outside to get into the polling place? Would you have a special line that, if you're going to just use the dropbox I'm expecting that there will be line managers who will be able to direct you in okay? I was concerned about that when I heard the reports from other states yeah well, I we have not seen lengthy lines in early voting, but there's a first time for everything, but we are telling people do not stand online. If you were dropping off your absentee ballot there, the lines for absentee ballot, drop- offs in other states, are places where they had to sign in order to leave their absentee ballot. We have no requirements. Yeah, you fill it out in advance. You walk in you deposit, it, you walk out. That's it another question, a friend of mine who's, not in the city but is voting in I mean she wants to bring ballots absentee ballots when she comes back to the city to vote in early voting. Is there a limit one time that we're talking about you could not bring too many ballots? Is that there is no? There is no legal limit to the number of ballots that you can bring back, and that is something I should have. I should have pointed out. If you want somebody to pick up your absentee ballot for you, that requires a writing. Okay, you can not get somebody else to pick up your absentee ballot casually. You have to fill out an application. You have to name them and sign the request, but wants to give you one it's okay, but if you have filled out your own ballot and you have a family member, a friend a neighbor who wants a drop, they can just drop it off. They are free to do so, and there is no limit. Now we recommend that people take no more than 10 or 15 so that they're not going to be accused of ballot harvesting, but that is simply a convenience. There is no limit well going around gathering ballads and then you harvest them yeah. So anyway, okay next, we have lori Boris who's, a member of Community Board, eight lori. Thank you Susan! Thank you so much. This was incredible information and I hope that we can repeat it and spread it throughout the land. Every day until election day. I have two questions. I am sort of responsible for my ballot and then my two parents who live in westchester and my father who's like unable to walk I've already gotten him an absentee ballot and we mailed it. He filled it out over the weekend and I mailed it in so I so I was thinking okay like I'm done, one down, you know two more to go, but then, when I heard what you were saying about the stamp, I was like only New York City, only New York City only in New York City do not worry all right. Good! That's the right answer. Thank you and then the second thing is that I'm going to go in person early and I'm going to take my mother in westchester early in person, but I'm a little confused and I apologize. If I was not here and you addressed this, but I'm really confused about where to go, because while I know where my real polling place is you know like around the corner, I am not sure where to go. If I want to do it early, there was a whole list on the website that, had you know a bunch of different places you could go, but do I just go to anyone? No, and it's listed in your pamphlet. It will tell you fortunately I'm so sorry, but I have the cards. You know I have the cards and not the pounds and I tossed the pamphlet so just going to the voter just go to the voter. Look up just go to Vote.Nyc. Okay you'll be able there to look to put in your address and it will give it to you later and it tells you where to go. It tells you your early voting location and your election day, location, okay, good, and it will be for my mother's in westchester as well. She will have to look her up on the state. Well, westchester is different. You can go to any early voting location in westchester. Oh okay, it's not a sign. It's okay! Only New York City! That's backwards! That's a sign! Okay! All right! Thank you again. This is great. Okay, a leader. Our chair has a question elita. Thank you! Sherry Susan! That was that's fantastic. You are so full of detail and really informative. So I have one specific question for New York City and one general question about some issues that that I've seen so my question for New York. Is there a way to Reco and if you've already addressed this, my apologies, but is there a way to recover that confirmation number if it's been lost for the absentee ballots? Yes, I believe, if you go on, they told me that if you go on the website and go to the tracker, if you put in your address or your name and address it, will give you the confirmation. Number again, okay, thank you and then, just today I was reading about some incidents around the country. A cop in Florida is under investigation for wearing a trump mask at the polls in California there was a burning of a ballot box in a latino neighborhood, where over 200 ballots might have been destroyed and in California as well. A political party that shall remain nameless has put up ballot boxes, saying that they're official, when they are not, they are not. Yes, so is there anything to protect people? I do not think they may not be issues in Manhattan and I'd like to think that we are not subject to that. But then again the proud boys came last year or was it the year before and so what but more outlying areas in the other boroughs, and so I know that both the boards of elections and the NYPD has been looking at the situation. We're not expecting substantial problems in Manhattan or most parts of Brooklyn, where you know we're concerned about Staten island, we're concerned about parts of southern Brooklyn where you have a hotly contested congressional race. I do not think we're going to see problems in Queens or the Bronx, but I am concerned about some areas outside of New, York City and we're in touch with the attorney general's office, the state attorney general's office and the both the Da's and the county executives in the counties where we think there could be problems. Is that so we're prepared you know and the 866 our vote hotline is alert to these intimidation issues, and you know we have procedures in place to escalate things quickly and to get people out to deal with the situation. What about so there's a law that you can't hand out political information within? I forget 100 feet, but if people are online for a long time- and they are- I mean that was just to the corner- I voted Ps6 and that was to the court, which is between Madison and Park and that's to the corner of park. If the line extends there, then there could be people bothering people at the end of the line, those non- partisan election people that you had referred to will they be going up and down the line to ensure or other lines in other areas to ensure that people are not being harassed by political people? Well, absolutely I mean it. You know people can try and hand you literature outside of the hundred feet, but you know you just say I'm not interested, and I also believe that the board of elections, because they have extra people who have applied to be po- workers, one of the things that they are planning to do with the younger people who have applied, is to train them to be line managers so that there will be poll workers outside the busy polling places, helping maintain the line being sure that people are not being bothered. Thank you, I'm sorry to inflict such a negative tone on this when you've been so positive and all of the other questions, the positive, but frankly that stuff in California is pretty terrifying, so it is very terrifying and in some ways I mean having lived in California they're, it's a it's, a more heated atmosphere and has been for longer, but there are parts of the state that I am concerned about. Okay, thank you very much again. This was really quite excellent and informative. Thank you and thank you Sherry and Anthony B Huh. May I ask a question of our expert sure, of course, as somebody who requested an absentee ballot and plans now to early vote, is there anything that we can do to help the board of elections after we cast our ballot early voting so that they do not need to like worry about us having an absentee. Do not worry, do not return your absentee okay, you do not have to tear it up. You do not have to turn it in. We just do not return it yeah. Okay, all right! Are there any more questions before we close out tonight's meeting? No Susan? This was wonderful. You were exactly what we needed. We needed to fill in the meat on the bones that we had heard before and we really again I extend the assistance of community Board voting reform task force in any way that we can assist and work with common cores. We all have the same goals and we would really be pleased to be able to do that and again. Thank you. So much you have. You were really wonderful. Thank you. Thank you to the community and task force members who were on this call, let's figure out after the election, we'll take a breather and then we'll reconvene and figure out what our priorities, but it was great to hear that they're sending the mechanics out because that was certainly I know, Rita had raised that as one of our priorities, so that's great to hear that they listened or at least heard and craig. Thank you so much for you know getting us to you know, being our fearless leader getting us started with this and now we're on a roll. So it's great everybody. Thank you, make sure you vote early, okay, everybody and good. Seeing you all see you tomorrow night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you good night, good night.
