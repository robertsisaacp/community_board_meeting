We had Assemblyman Dan Court speak to us about the new reforms that have taken place in Albany dealing with voting very informative We're, going to be talking about absentee voting early voting, we're going to give you specifics, we're giving you dates.
It is a really challenging election this year because of the pandemic and the overlap with the presidential election, which is when more people come out to vote in New York City than for any other election, and certainly we saw the impact of the pandemic in June in the primary, where a really significant number of people voted absentee, and you probably heard from assembly member court about the fact that the expansion of availability of absentee voting has now been codified into law.

So early voting is a new reform which, as I said, was passed by the legislature last year, which we've been working very hard to get set up and to inform voters about it.
Early voting takes place for 10 days in New, York state.
There are 80, plus early voting polling places in New, York City.
This time this year, for the first time, people are able to drop off their absentee ballots at early voting locations and at election day polling places, and unlike the situation with early voting, you can drop off your absentee ballot at any early voting, location or election day polling place anywhere in New York City, when you walk in to a polling place, whether it's an early voting location or an election day.
The statue of liberty with the mask And, it's going to say absentee ballot, Attended by the poll workers that you can place your absentee ballot in and know that it's been received by the board of elections.

In the morning until 9:00 pm in the evening and again, the absentee ballot, drop- Off boxes will be in every polling, place.
In order for your vote to count and, as we know often on election day, particularly in presidential years, there can be long lines waiting to go in and be able to vote and that's why we're urging people who want to vote in person to seriously consider voting early?
I think it was voting early answers, a lot of questions that people have about their ballot being received and when it's going to be counted.
We are one of the very few states that if you request an absentee ballot or you request and return your absentee ballot, you still can go and vote in person either voting early or on election day and in every instance.
Your in- person vote will override your absentee vote, but because we provide this backstop to voters, it takes New York longer to get to count its absentee ballots than some other states.
Eight days after the election and the eighth day after the election, the board of elections compares the list of voters who voted in person to the list of people who submitted absentee ballots.
Even if you sent back an absentee ballot, you still have only one vote in New York, and that is the one vote that will be counted and that will be your in- person.
You have flexibility in terms of how you vote all the way through election day, but it slows down the count so, eight days after they compare everybody in New, York City to everybody who sent in an absentee ballot.
They begin to count the absentee ballots and that's one of the reasons why it takes a while here in New York, to get the final answer in terms of the election results.
A large number of ballots is time well, spent, because it means that the count is going to be accurate and the count, and they will be counting only the votes of people who are eligible to have their votes, counted so get ready, be patient and understand that a fast rush job in New, York City with a election night answer for who's ahead, is absolutely not going to reflect the true state of the votes, because we're expecting so many absentee ballots to be counted.
The board of elections has made some changes since June to try and speed up the process of counting the absentee ballots.

Why I'm asking we have 1.6 million absentee ballots that have been requested, And so you know the reason why it's important to have the bar code, showing if your return envelope is that, when it's received by the board of elections, they scan the barcode right away without having to open, and so they are able to track.
