And I do want to say, I mean we are, of course, very fortunate to have such a great public institution here in our community and, as I'm sure most of us know, it's very highly ranked both in terms of the quality of its academics and scholarship, but also.
In fact a portion of it was at the community school CUNY school professional studies was online and most of it was for first generation college students.
So, this field of you know: college education, making opportunity available to our students from all.
And, of course, it's great school of social Work, and I'm, going to mention, as I tend to do some things that are not directly germane.
And, perhaps especially now in this era of Dovid, You know having skills not just in more analytic disciplines, but also in the arena of social work and understanding how we can support our students and our families and our community in having a more healthy environment and looking out for their social and emotional needs is hugely important.
I can to support you know our pre-k, our primary school students, middle school, high school and all the way up to college and beyond.
We on this committee have spent a lot of time since the pandemic hit in the spring, having a lot of conversations about K-12 and early education through twelfth grade needs in the community, So talking to a lot of parents and students and teachers and representatives from the DOE about the realities of remote, learning.
We're, really excited to hear about just hunter updates in general, but really life in this Coba 19 world for hunters, students faculty, you know and administration.
Peter, thanks for shouting out to Taina Tai represents the hunter motto for which we're really proud, which is the care of the future, is mine, and we ask every student when they graduate, whether going on to pre-med or social work, as you said, or work in business, to take a part of their vision and their passion and remember to give back, because this premier, public institution gave them this priceless education at a price they can afford, and certainly Taina and all of her work and certainly on this community board, has done that Peter.
We give one of the finest in the state, but we also think it's important for students to have skills in which they can enter the job.
We started to use these vans to distribute food and technology close to students, homes and we're really proud about how that worked, and then we moved all of the student advising online.
We start to think about what could be taught and what should be taught when we knew the safest thing was to still stay remote, and there were three things that were important to the faculty and to the students to do some.
So every day we open two floors in the library and every day we have at least 100 students who come on campus to just use the library to take remote classes at hunter, because that's a safe space for them.
I, challenged the students and said I'm very nervous about having you know a group of 20 year old students living in the dorms.
We know that's the fun of college, so Maha you can just show it's a very quick little story about how the students responded.
As I, said, I, always ask for silver linings and with all the ups and downs, we were really incredibly like just overjoyed and proud that a few weeks, ago, U.S, News and world came out with their new rankings, and hunter College has moved up six places in the last year to 17 in the regional university north, which is our categories, and we are fifth among the top public schools in our region to do a sixth place jump in a year, as was particularly a crazy year, like this, was pretty emotionally rewarding for us.
One I really wanted to ask all of you to tune in and join us for programming that we're doing on a regular basis that we call hunter at home, You know, While we can't be on campus, we really want to send the wisdom, the knowledge just the pure enjoyment of our faculty out to the community.
We have about seven or eight tasks, subcommittees very busy, Looking at recruitment admission pipeline programs how to enhance our curriculum and also started a really interesting digital program, called speaking of justice, in which we have addressed issues of monuments, of code, switching as pro the issues of protesting, and we engage a lot of our alums and our faculty, and we have breakout rooms after for conversation and again would love the community board to be engaged in these conversations, because we all have so much learning to do.
You know just another challenge late on top of what we're going through with the pandemic, but as I tell our students and faculty.
You would hear these stories about these young men getting into Yale and these three wonderful people being at Schwartzman and alternates, and it just meets know that the hunter motto is moving on that we're caring for the future and that our students are going on to do great things, So I, just I.
Do hope that you will still keep thinking about our students for internships, Even if they're, remote and.
Our school of education is, You know this is a focus of this community of this committee is trains one out of every 10 New York City public school teachers, So we would love to work with you on neighborhood problems, even in the remote context, so.
I spent two years working at Hunter College after graduating from there.
Like I mentioned, President, Rob, I'm, a parent of a daughter who's in the third grade at Hunter, College, Elementary, School and I.
This goal for a year take a leave of absence because we really didn't have a lot of transparency on some of the decision making until like the day before school, opened.
You know I think you all know in this committee, in your average public school in this neighborhood, students that are in the k, through 5 space, have school one day, a week, sometimes two, If they're lucky.
But we would like to our goal is to try to stay open as we can and to continue to educate our students and hope that you and your family will return and consider.
I think you got a thumbs up from our committee member Ramy, who is a high school student.
I did I'm just curious about quarantining in a dorm, though, and how that works when meals are generally taken, at least from when I was in college in a cafeteria I had a question about that, but I also really wanted to thank you for being here.
I know how hard Taina worked on this program and to see someone from a premier academic institution, not just in our neighborhood but in the city and the state spend your evening with us- is really remarkable and so important.
There may be interest on the community board or within the community to look at how we can support hunter in one area in particular, You know finding internships, whether they're, remote or on-site at a particular location, because one of the things that I've got particular attention on is how we improve the bridge say between our great institutions like hunter and help.
I, know, there's a point person hunter who is responsible for those programs, but I just want to open that to anybody in the community who may have thoughts or ideas about where the you know, opportunities like that might be available and to head off the question.
Sorry Alita before everybody's, going to ask it for the last three summers: in a row, we've had the honor in our board office of hosting a hunter college intern through the jfu program.
So we were posting something I, know, Brian Correa among people, a board member was looking for opportunities and had some with someone that he was working.
So I should have that ready in the next few weeks, and then you know, I think that could be working, that living document that we could add on to, but starting with certain local institutions.
You are a teenager, it's an excellent learning, experience and I, and just as a community board that I think that is very important, especially as youth and Ed Committee.
You do need these opportunities in order to a get into schools such as hunter, but as well as get valuable working experience and career interest and what, while the we as a community board, are doing our part, there's, always things that we can be doing more, such as encouraging youth to apply, because many youth don't understand how important internships are and that's part of the school's jobs.
What's happening day to day, but it's really lovely to hear that hunter is, you know, is really centering like student, and you know faculty safety.
Out you know after graduation opportunities or even like, while you're learning I work for a non-profit in the city that works on community development, So I'm.
You, know current students to do internships at my organization, but we're also a member organization that works with 80 plus community groups, grassroots organizations, You know, affordable, housing, non-profit developers, all over the city, who are constantly also looking for interns to help with their work.
But, the wonderful success stories and I know it was just a few but highlighting those students, I had and looking up at what was going on in hunter.
We should concentrate with so many teachers that we have in the community, or they can create some mentoring programs, especially for low-income families, and this is social justice by the way that to work directly with with these two developments that we have in homes and Isis and to see maybe create a mentorship program for those people that actually that educate them to see that the future for them is not to continue to live in those in those developments.
You know, beginning to think about the issue of employment, career, opportunities, mentorships, internships and so on, and then the same thing for adults, continuing education and procedures.
