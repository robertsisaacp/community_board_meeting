And I now can see people because I did not have my computer working prior to now, This is what we're doing tonight is voting on the 2022 expense, budget, our priorities and the priorities of the capital.
2022 is the budget that starts July, 1st 2021 It goes through June, 30th, 2022, and what I want to say is And I discuss this- to do a budget because we do not know what's going to happen.
Even if this we're now in fiscal year, 2021 We know there's going to be city, state and federal cuts, most likely.
With, the Community Board's own budget, which I know, people have been asking for items and making requests.
2021 cuts, because the year that ends June 30th, even if we get even if we get federal funds and even if there's a new administration- And I want to get political , What we're looking they're going to look at tonight is the responses to the 2021 budget, which we're in now, which goes for June 30th, and they you know when they respond, that they always do.
I do not know if I have support from anyone, but I think that's the only realistic way , we're not going to have enormous cuts,, so I think we should start off with looking at the expense budget for 2021, which is the year we're in now.
If, you were able to participate in the last couple of years, you're at least a little bit familiar with the new portal that the Department of City planning has for our district needs in our budget?
It really does not matter if it's 10 or 11 or 12, if the in our priorities, especially when you look at the comments that we got back from the agencies which those of you who have worked with me before know what drives me crazy when they say if there's money, we'll give it to you, we're asking you to put money in the budget.
Members should be familiar seeing this, but it includes the priority that we had and then the agency's response to it now number one, I think, is more important than I.
So, you need to build the schools before you before you fund them Exactly, so this is expense, not capital, So, Okay, so we should put that should be in the capital budget, more schools.
Think that asking having the expense budget items as well as the capital budget is fine.
I think that we should have it in the expense budget, as well as in the capital budget, because you have to have the money to build the new schools, but you also need the expense budget to cover other costs.
I would also think that we have to kind of take a general look as far as which initiatives overall are most important to the district and then drill down to the specifics within those areas or are any of those to be replaced with something else.
We need a high school, a middle school grammar school, whatever the new titles are, but the expense component is that you're looking for seats within existing facilities and they have opened different ones by either renting out or whatever.
So I'd like to see we have one request for seats when we look at the capital budget, make sure I was just going to add to the list that I think that we need some emphasis on affordable housing or housing to supportive house more supportive housing in here.
And then I know that we're going over capital, but I think that it would help everybody to know that in our district needs statement for Fy21 that we said that the three most appreciative, pressing issues facing our community board is one affordable housing to go to Barbara, Rutter's, point parks and schools and specifically to Michelle's point.
So, if that helps the situation, I, know that we're going over these extra these specific budget requests.
We absolutely need this, and even if I know that this is all one list, I know that it does not matter too much, but even if we can bump this up, I would I would love that, because it is very important to us and the next one improve trash removal and cleanliness, that's in the parks and outside of the parks, because it's too different budget items, but we really need that.
Has to be added, because it then different funding, sources, so I would suggest, adding it and either putting it like directly below or directly above And, then the second was about the new traffic or pedestrian signals, because I did notice that they asked for a list of specific locations and I'm sure they're going to say that again, next year.
If anyone here has an idea or if maybe we want to pass this on to craig and chuck and send a letter after transportation, and I think we I mean I would suggest, since we needed another number, we needed to put the trash in the park and outside the park that maybe we should for now should take out the pedestrian signals, because I've seen a number added this year.
This is an essential public health issue and we need to get sanitation to come back and do pickups the mayor reallocated funds to certain other communities and did not think our neighborhood was commercial enough or Covid-19 enough to have garbage pickup.
I'd like to talk about it, another time, but we need to move sanitation, up, and I, make a motion to include right after the removal and cleanliness for the Department of parks and recreation that we put in the sanitation and requests for increased pickups.
So, item number nine is on increased funding for tree pruners and tree climbers, but I think with a lot of the extreme wind conditions that we've had, and I.
Think one of the things the mayor said he was reducing- Was funding for tree pruners that that's something we really need to emphasize.
I think there's a bit of a mismatch between the request and the explanation in terms of improving the trash removal So that means we're going to need two, essentially that the trash removal is two new items right, because it's trash removal in the parks, because that one currently does not cover it and trash removal in the in the on the streets And then the last point, is, I think, the way to to effectuate the point that felice made about the tree pruning is maybe in the explanation we can emphasize the public safety aspect of it and that that's the reason for it.
We need to keep the two trash pieces separate and that's fine and then just wanted to thank felice again for talking about the tree.
Issue, requests increase, funding for the Department of health enforcement for all food vendor rules and regulations.
It's not just about right people on the street overnight If you had language that you wanted to put in just chat it to me, sorry, Russell Felice, so just briefly, because I do agree that the increase in homeless in this neighborhood is, is a real problem, maybe take out the reference to technology equipment because I'm not sure how that benefits, the yeah- You know they had to change it because of certain rules of the of OMB , I.
This is where it's strange: increased funding for the Department of health enforcement of all, for we did that already: food, vendors- 12, other expense, traffic, improvement, requests, increase the number of workers to inspect repair and preserve the Department of Transportation's infrastructure.
Inspection, on the one hand, sounds to me like a service, but repairing and preserving sounds more like capital, and So I'm clear why the latter two would be included in this one or if that needs to be a separate capital, item, and I think you know we may want to just suggest putting the repair and preservation portion of it into the capital.
I think it depends on how much repair is needed if it goes in capital or expense.
He knows how the DOT funds that program, if you want really sure if this would be considered capital or not, but generally with in terms of maintenance, if it's a state of good repair, project, that's just part of typical regular maintenance.
That would be more capital related, which would be considered state of good repair as well, but not just typical general cyclical maintenance, So I, just I want to respond to Michelle's thing, so the esplanade sinkholes.
In previous years we discussed that it was about inspections and the number of workers to inspect and repair, which is the reason why I think it was an expense.
So I think we want to request the repair more So. At some point you will ask I'd like to make a presentation on behalf of the voting rights what to take out, because we can only have we can't have more than 25 items, okay, so you'll.
Maybe just emphasizing the explanation that this is a pedestrian safety, issue, an instant to inspect and repair roadway surface and sidewalks and bridges they're, probably not city funded.
It probably is, it might be city funded, but I'm, not sure it impacts, Pedestrian, Safety, Illegal, conversions and uses of buildings, hire additional department of building inspectors for compliance and code enforcement and hire auditors for application.
Uprise, but we have yet in all my years on the board ever seen, acs come to us to discuss this issue, so I think it's an important piece.
Think the point is just to emphasize that the people The school crossing guards are the part we want.
If we're talking about traffic enforcement officers, we also need to ideally have more more officers for traffic control at high volume, high congestion safety compromised locations within the district like near the 59th Street bridge and near the exits.
We know the issues on second avenue and even coming off the bridge at the Fdr drive in 96th street, where they're already there sometimes they're, really critical in terms of keeping traffic, hopefully moving, which of course has impacts on air quality and air pollution and safety.
The health inspectors who are doing it, But I think we should expand that we want funding for people to be going out to the different restaurants to make sure it's not even just restaurants.
It's July, Okay, no, I'm, not saying no, but I just wanted people to know.
Also on the NYCHA, point- I think that's included them because it says community, centers and senior centers right maintain all current open, space.
I think, item 23, which you guys can look down to is probably where that may want to fall in Too, just provide more health and building inspectors for Natchez, facilities, and I.
I do not know why it says other expense budget request why it's put that way, but fund additional DCA inspectors for sidewalk, cafes and compliance permits, regulation Perhaps that would this is may perhaps a better place to put in my suggestion on the Covid-19 enforcement as opposed to the other, which was the health department.
This is something that we get concerns about all the time with, particularly with the Misuse of park, space with dogs and other things like that, Are the people we call all the time for whatever comes up that needs to be addressed, so I just want to say that our parks and Waterfront Committee get these concerns a lot and Judy My personal opinion is I'd like to see it moved, up.
It's very general statement, because most of the funds will be state or federal, funds, and I do not think we're going to see that , I think that needs to stay in no hands up and 26 is plant new street trees.
If you had more locations, you would have more drop boxes, so I think it goes hand in hand, but it's just a continual issue and it does not seem like it's going to go.
People just do not trust voting by absentee, so I think we need more in- person.
I. Think that's important to send will some new language with the understanding we do not know.
, I think we still need a motion to approve I'd like to make a motion that we approve the expense budget for 2022.
Yes, I think on calling the question or calling or the all in favor of coin, the question: okay, anybody who wants to abstain or vote no.
Everybody is voting, yes on the expense priorities for And I'm, going to read off the names just so it's in the public record and in the video Barbara Chockey Barbara Rutter Billy Freeland Brand, Correa, Craig, Later, Elaine, Walsh, Police, Farber, Gail, Barron, Marco, Tamayo, Michelle, Birnbaum, Rebecca, Dengor, Russell, Squire, Sherry, Weiner, Trisha Mamura, and we can move on to whatever capital.
The next one was okay, so we still want to keep the request services for homeless in right, yes, but it would be moved to number five.
Okay, then call on the people who want to make comments about this, Marco and then Russell and I was talking to one of the reps from the Park department, because how we're going to repair and do all these kind of jobs?
This is a capital investment, and this is what we need to have an a real study of the wall, because at the end of the day, probably will be more likely right to repair.
We have to start thinking to put a new wall parallel to the existence, but I do not want to come with the solutions without even understand what is exactly the condition of the sea wall and what we had to do is obviously to have an emergency repairs.
We can have a separate request for a capital project on the sea wall or we can add it to number three Maybe marco wants to provide the exact wording, since he very clearly understands the situation, but let's make it another.
But I do think that we are being broad enough saying that we need the immediate and urgent funding to repair and fully restore and ensure the structural safety of the entire esplanade.
My impression is probably we can recommend in one of these items, that the Department of parks should have one of these engineers and their team, so that we can have something better opinion about the issues that may raise in the future of the esplanade and in addition to that, it will lead directly not only to the erosion of the Fdr, but also may lead to the floating area and the three parts that specifica specifically happen in our community: low, 60s, mid, 70s, low or 80s, and then in 96 street that basically, it will describe how we're going to repair and how we tackle combine this problem that affect those buildings in that section.
I think this is extremely important and needs to stay in the capital.
, I, again, I think we need to include sidewalks here, but then the DOT does not repair sidewalks.
With the idea of Rebecca, I think that we can do that because the developer we do not know when he's going to build the new buildings, especially the buildings on 79th street.
We're going to see those numbers be being cut, and so I think it'd be important to focus on DOT doing street resurfacing to make sure the streets are maintained in good condition without referencing the year period.
I think that was started in 20 in this year's budget, but I do not know.
One item at the 67Th street: I think that's important to need.
I was just re- looking, and this is important if we're going to vote on it since it was discussed about moving item one down and having the three school requests We have that we ask that this request be given the next necessary funding and highest priority in the five- year.
Yes, I like this, and if it's second there, Briefly, I like to record we've done this in previous years, not recently, but a while back that we recommend, because this we know there's going to be federal, state and city cuts to 2021 budget and certainly to our recommendations for 2022.
I think we really need to look at the number of people.
I know this talk, we do need more money and it has to come from other ways, certainly cuts in the budget and redoing.
And I do think that there would be a lot of people that would want it we'll bring it up at the full board.
So I think we have to do something to plug the budget, hole and fund the needs of the city, and I think.
If we, as a community board, are supposed to be a political, I'm, very uncomfortable with us going down what could be a slippery slope, I think, and we some Obviously we need to talk about revenues and obviously in transportation.
I just want to say that three items that are our top items most important pressing issues facing the community board is affordable, housing parks and schools.
I. Think that became obvious as we did the items on the budget as we reviewed the 2021, budget, I do not know if we can vote on it now or people want to look at the items again and vote on it.
So then we just okay, because I do not think we want to vote on each section.
