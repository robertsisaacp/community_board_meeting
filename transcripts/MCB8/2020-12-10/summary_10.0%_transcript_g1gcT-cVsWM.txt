But, since this text has a city-wide application and the board is being asked to comment on the totality of that text, This presentation might show some building types.
I mean the point of this slide is just to show that the neighborhoods within the flood plain, have very unique challenges to staying safe and this text amendment has to try and accommodate for those varying neighborhoods, and you can see the real extent of the challenge.
The wide range of challenges that come with flood risk adaptation require a strategy that involves multiple lines of defense and the city's work includes coastal defense strategies like the East Coast Eastside coastal resiliency project, which many of you might be familiar.
Being, you know, a small part of that and the zoning resolution being an even smaller part of what can be used to assist with that, but infrastructure and coastal strategies and things fall into a different category within one NYC, and that is all overseen by the mayor's Office of coastal resiliency.
This project, in particular, seeks to reduce zoning impediments to making resiliency improvements in private buildings and campuses like NYCHA, so NYCHA very much is relevant to this NYCHA and HPD have their own programs for how they implement resiliency upgrades.
The zoning I guess streamlining here that is trying to happen is aimed at NYCHA as well being the beneficiary of that and much of the text was developed in consultation with NYCHA, and it is intended to facilitate resiliency improvements in the long term for those communities as well as private property.
The regulations based on FEMA standards for buildings in the flood zone are located in Appendix G of the New York City Building Code, and that's a large basis for which a lot of this text amendment is formulated because buildings are currently if they're, new or being substantially improved, are subject to the building code and they have resiliency requirements in the building code.
What the amendments to the zoning resolution within this project are trying to do is making those a little easier to access for people that want to make their buildings flood resilient according to the building code, or at least take steps to try and get there.
The building code is a very firm requirement on how new buildings need to be built within the flood plain and the zoning resolution, or the changes that are being proposed within this text.
You're looking at, is presumed to be within the flood zone and the building code has I guess an acronym called DFE, which is called design.
Some of these uses below the DFE and dry floodproofing means meeting specific design and material requirements so that water can not enter the building during a flood.
So I mean to summarize that dry flood proofing is permitted within the building code and in the example that you see on your right there, effectively.
What that owner would have to do is build a reverse, fishbowl or of a reverse swimming pool at the ground floor of their building, to make sure that, firstly, The structure was resilient enough to keep the load of water out, that things like glazing and sealing and everything were strong enough to keep water out and that use, could, you know effectively be still safely.
These building code regulations became widely applicable soon after the storm soon after Sandy, but posed conflicts with the zoning resolution in three main areas: rule.
That is a large incentive for why this project is being done at the moment, And if these rules are not made permanent, it could hinder the protection of existing vulnerable buildings and disincentivize resiliency measures in new construction, making our neighborhoods less resilient.
So through several years, we've conducted city-wide research about resiliency strategies of different building types and studied 10 neighborhoods that were severely impacted by the storm.
So I mean now I'll briefly go through what the proposal is to try and summarize it for you to describe how zoning for coastal flood resiliency addresses these issues while encouraging the city's buildings to be more resilient.
After the long process of studying the floodplain and engaging with so many stakeholders and the community on a wide set of issues, we were able to establish four overarching goals that help us move from sandy recovery to a larger, A longer-term resiliency strategy and the first one we'll talk about, and the best way to think about this project is that it's split up into the four columns that you're looking at now.
The first is that the floodplain community wants to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they are not located in what FEMA currently determines to be.
The, second, is that people want the option to raise living spaces higher than the current flood level that FEMA projects, because they have seen higher flood levels already and expects that risk to grow in the future, with sea levels rising and therefore the expected flood level in the event of a storm.
They want options like moving their mechanical equipment to a higher elevation, without necessarily triggering a requirement to raise the fully fl or fully flood proof the structure.
These regulations are optional and they're intended to help buildings undertake resiliency improvements, so zoning for coastal resiliency would expand the applicability of the current text to a broader set of buildings that are also exposed to flooding in the event of coastal storms.
A 0.2 chance floodplain would be allowed to use the proposed special options for resilient building design.
So, firstly, it more streamlined, optional rules for how height is measured in the floodplain would allow buildings building owners to physically elevate habitable spaces and other building support features above expected, flood elevations, so that they're safe in the long term.
Today, building heights under the 2013 flood text can be bumped, up, 9, feet, 10 feet or 12 feet, depending on the building's size in the zoning district, making it a highly complex framework and because its applicability depends upon the elevation level slight to slight topography.
Already, and what the text is trying to do is streamline that, so that in the one percent they can add up to 10 feet, and that means the building would be measured from the reference plane of 10 feet above the ground level, which is where the water would rise.
It's a basis for what you understand the coming slides to highlight also so this would require would also require that the floor level is placed at or above this reference plane to ensure that the additional building height is tied to actual resiliency improvements and to close any loophole for developers that might want to try and get additional height without making the building resilient.
There is a mechanism in there to make sure that resiliency is tied to any claim to the additional up to 10 feet in height, if that's, what's being sought by a developer, so to help promote safer buildings with good, long-term resilient design and good neighborhood streetscapes.
The proposal would allow existing floor area exemption for spaces that are wet floodproofed to apply to both existing and new buildings.
You can see a provision that applies to existing buildings and it applies today which could exempt the entire dry floodproofed space from floor area.
You can see a rule that applies to new and existing buildings, which allowed any space to be exempted from floor area.
This rule was first implemented in 1989, and then it was edited in the 2013 flood text, amendment to be even more flexible and the problem we found with the seller exemption system is that it allowed full floors to be entirely exempted without actually requiring the building to comply with resiliency standards, and that created a loophole, and the current project is trying to fix.
The proposal would modify these regulations to reduce the amount of floor area that can actually be exempted to instead allow only the first 30 feet of a space that is dry flood proofed to be exempted from floor area, provided that the space is used for non-residential uses, complies with certain standards and requirements such as minimum transparency or window requirements, and internal clearance.
This would help encourage active uses close to the sidewalk level to promote a safe and lively pedestrian environment, while making sure that the resulting buildings are not out of scale.
And I mean, as I had alluded to earlier, dry flood proofing is extremely expensive and by allowing a portion of the floor area that has been dry flood proof to be relocated within the lot, as in the floor area would be put somewhere else within the building, because a portion would be exempted from their calculations.
We are incentivizing dry floodproofing, while keeping the streetscape active, so I mean the alternative for buildings that are upgrading within the flood zone is wet flood proofing, and that would result in a use that would be the parking, storage or accesses of access fronting the street, and none of those are active.
In terms of the floor area exemption that the text would allow, So this is proposed and it's limited to 30 percent sorry 30 feet of the street wall, whereas this existing provision, it was allowing up to the full floor of what was being dry flood proofed.
So, in addition, This proposal would mandate a set of streetscape requirements to improve the ground floor, level, design of resilient buildings.
Provisions located within this goal are what we call partial resiliency strategies and they will help building owners to undertake incremental steps towards resiliency without requiring the structure or the sites to fully meet Appendix G, which is cost prohibitive, and everything within goal.
We heard for older buildings, in particular in community board 8, to implement resiliency efforts, so we learned that raising mechanical equipment, often located below grade within sellers, is the first and most cost effective step to making buildings.
You know the recent discussion of mechanical voids on opening up a potential another loophole where this project could potentially grant more mechanical exemption or mechanical space in general for developers.
It limits the height of predominantly mechanical flaws in residential buildings, and I mean to be clear that this project does not change.
Okay, So the proposal would also enable different types of flood protection measures to be implemented, and this would include allowances for flood panels and landscaped berms to be considered permitted obstructions in open areas.
It would also allow spacers used for storage of panels to be exempted from floor area to enable on-site storage and again, This is a cost-effective strategy that older buildings can implement, without necessarily going to the full expense of raising their levels or completely dry floodproofing and those sorts of measures.
And, lastly, When looking at our waterfront sites, Zoning generally does not allow waterfront yards or required visual corridors to be raised to account for flood risk, and this proposal would offer more flexibility for the grading of these sites and would facilitate resiliency measures such as soft shorelines, which is what the example here is showing where the landscaping is actually intended to flood, and you know, provides a level of protection in the process.
The proposal will therefore allow power systems, including generators, solar energy, systems, fuel, batteries, fuel, cells, batteries and other energy storage systems to be considered, permitted obstructions within open spaces across all zoning districts.
Lines, but it effectively means that you know power systems in particular could be placed within yards, and things like that subject to those placement heights and coverage type limitations.
I mean perhaps doesn't look like cb-8 at all, but the concept behind it is very relevant because this applies to vulnerable populations and specifically nursing homes, which I know there's a lot of in your district.
Existing facilities would still be able to conduct enlargements for modest improvements, including those that help with resiliency, so I mean just to get ahead of a question that may come up.
They can even make improvements if they needed to, but they could not do significant expansions and you could not build a new nursing home within the one percent flood plain and that's based upon the sheer vulnerability of this use and the people that occupy this use.
The proposal would include enabling two sets of rules to help support more predictable, long-term recovery efforts and the first one would be to give property owners who hold special permits and authorizations an additional term so that they can complete their original plan of construction on a perhaps a longer timeline.
Second, one would support businesses that do not conform with zoning use regulations by allowing them more than two years, which is the current limit of discontinuance to return to operation.
I. Had a couple of questions, one is and I'll ask them quickly, because I know my time will be limited.
Moving mechanicals, using resilient materials, Making sure that new construction is compliant is incredibly important, trying to help older structures to also become flood proof, looking at all kinds of solutions of pumps and of other solutions and relocating living, space.
And I mean if you feel that those need to be reflected in your resolution, I think that's probably the.
I. Think that that's, if you can make these buildings resilient and there's new construction, then why would there be a problem putting nursing homes into these areas.
You think that you know the flood elevation is actually higher than what this is.
They're not intended to actually themselves keep flood water out only that they can be provided as a means of you know, accessing a building because say, for instance, in this picture here the floor level is obviously raised for reasons of resiliency.
Okay, because I just said, concern that obviously a wheelchair lift, there's, You know mechanicals a part of that, and it's so difficult to get accessibility updates in so many areas of life and throughout the community, so then to have them damaged by a flood or other natural disaster.
I worry about the expediency and would be interested to know if there's any a part of the plan that would address impact on any accessibility options that were affected through this I mean to the extent that I understand your question, there.
A lot of them have their own resiliency, plans, health and hospitals in particular, and New York's mean public health.
I mean the zoning resolution is limited in general as to how it can you know, regulate aesthetics.
Yes, in providing flexibility, it's trying to provide owners options to get mechanicals out of the most vulnerable parts of their site, and if that includes building a structure, you know within certain bounds, such as what you are looking at there or if it involves putting him on the roof, then those are both options that an owner could take up.
You know previous to this, or do they have to follow the current rules, right, I, think I, understand so say, for instance, yes, a developer has a vacant site.
I know that Stanley Isaacs is building I, think it's a generator on their land, rather than.
Hi I just want to expand on one of the answers on why somebody would spend a lot of money in finding resiliency building a wall raising the mechanicals, it's insurance, flood insurance, having owned waterfront property in my life.
My concern is that if I understand this correctly, that building owners, including NYCHA, could opt to put their mechanicals on structures that take up open space and ultimately have their because I think I've been seeing this at our at Isaacs and homes where they have they're taking up open space in order to put their mechanicals there and therefore, ultimately, taking away some of that open space or severely changing it, so that it's not actually open space.
I'm, really struggling to think about voting in favor of something that allows the taking up of open space.
I mean why not you know, do it, for example, through the building code or something along those lines, just say.
So, for example, You know how is an apartment building going to raise its ground floor by 10, feet, I guess, so.
Okay, so a couple of things there so the first one, if I quote the extent of the question, is a new building should know that it's building in the flood plain.
So, you know if, in the instance, the building you're looking at there was being built today, they have to comply with Appendix G, which inquir you know requires them to elevate, habitable spaces, elevate, their ground floor or drive flood proof or wet floodproof.
Amendment here, which I mean, are primarily aimed at trying to get owners who have an existing building within the flood plain to adapt.
Now that you know, there's different flood resiliency requirements, all of a sudden, so I think it's less aimed at the incentives at least are less aimed at circumstances like this, where there is a new building where they can start from scratch and elevate it and more at.
They end up losing the space on their ground floor because now, all of a sudden, it's not habitable, because it's below that blue dotted, line, You, know, I think, would apply to new buildings like this is that it allows things like the access structures that you're looking at here and plant and equipment to be located in other spaces that otherwise might not be allowed.
So certainly there's a lot of residential buildings that would have ground floor apartments, for instance, in the flood plain and according to Penxg.
For you know some instance where that floor area may be allocated somewhere else, because there's an acknowledgement that, via the new requirements of the building code for resiliency, that ground floor is effectively being lost.
So I mean how likely that is in a you, know, a very established, fully residential apartment, building.
In the case of the answer about the 10 feet, elevation increase, it sounds like in the case of an apartment, building as a practical, matter, Yes, I, think that's.
I mean I'm, not sure how else we could be flood-proofing without ground floor apartments.
I mean I would like to know the answer to that myself.
And I know that people may be anxious, but this is a really big deal because it covers the entire city and there is a lot of detail and a lot of different opportunities or different ways in which this change would impact buildings.
I know this personally, So many of you have probably heard me talk about this, but I live at east and 90th street in a large residential building.
And I, recognize that this plan isn't perfect and there are definitely compromises that have to be made like Trisha, I'm, completely in agreement about what you're saying about the open space issue, but I think I side on the support of an imperfect but overall, really well thought out, plan that may result in some, hopefully infrequent very infrequent, negative impacts that are hopefully outweighed by the tremendous good that this plan will achieve in helping people, especially those who live on really vulnerable.
I mean it's trying to provide strategies where we have them to get people out with not living within what is a highly vulnerable flood zone.
Some ask us, you know anything about the process of what landmark buildings would have to go through under the text as in if they were trying to relocate, say equipment or floor area.
So you know, I would have to presume that they're required to adhere to the same conditions that any private owner is where you couldn't actually put mechanicals or electrical in harm's way, without having some offsetting action such as dry floodproofing, but I mean again I.
As we all know, CB8, has among the least park and open space of any community in all of New York City.
If there's anything, we can add to the resolution that expresses our concern about the use of our prized open space for power systems and mechanicals.
You want to consider two resolutions, one for everything, but putting mechanicals or other systems into open space so that we can look at both of those separately.
I think that it's an acknowledgment that the requirements of the building code to become actually resilient are extremely cumbersome and expensive.
So I, wouldn't so much say that it's an effort to make sure that they can't lose money, but more so a circumstance where you know I think we're trying to incentivize owners that may otherwise do nothing and retain a building that is not resilient.
I mean until any you know, substantial upgrade is made that building doesn't have to comply with that part of the building code specifically, and those people at least that are on the lower floors, are going to keep living within a high-risk flood.
You know, trying to change that circumstances that circumstance and acknowledging that the ability to do that is quite cumbersome rather than strictly I mean categorizing it as we don't want earners to lose.
Yes, certainly I mean if the more resiliency provisions they include within their building.
I think we are acknowledging within the text is not sufficient, for you know people to be taking action, so this is trying to provide extra incentive.
Think that issue has been explored a lot with you, know: people making just general upgrades to their building, but.
As far as I know, any like dude, like from federal law, any building in the floodplain has to have flood insurance and I, don't think it's tied directly to resilient building or not, but we can confirm that there may be other types of insurance as well.
It feels as though they're benefiting in some way, maybe not the anticipated way, but that for certain things that the city, because their changes in zoning may be paying a price, I'm, not sure again, I, don't know.
I also have real concerns about putting mechanicals in open space, whether it's open space in a NYCHA campus, or whether it's open, space, someplace else, or whether it's a backyard in a landmark area like around East End Avenue, and that would apply as well for people to put mechanicals in storage spaces in a backyard in a landmark building where there are in a landmark or historic district where there are requirements.
One of you know a very few amount of uses that could actually be used for a space that was in the floodplain previously.
So, you mean I, mean say those apartments that were vulnerable to flooding on the ground floor of a building were relocated, elsewhere, there's a little else that space could actually be used for if it's not parking or storage or access, and that's the.
You know that, because we're looking for a height limit buildings that are very large buildings, that cast shadows, that cut off light in air that affect people in the way they live and yet there's nothing to help those people or businesses that are lost because their building is torn down for another building going up and so not to say that this is wrong because I understand what Craig is saying and what Adam is saying, but that there's not a balanced approach to zoning and helping people that are impacted by what's going on around them and in the same way that coastal flooding is something that's not anticipated or not.
Craig, if you want to you, made the resolution, If you want to have a second resolution on the issue of the open space that were raised by a number of people well in terms of the open, space, I just have one quick question and that is for Scott.
It's really meant to be in used in a situation where it's either, where a building a property owner doesn't really have another option in terms of how they're going to be able to make the changes to harden their property and have to use that as opposed to looking to just put it in the middle of an open, space.
And, if that's the case, then I think we can just vote on the question on the resolution.
Someone wants to put second resolution regarding the specifics of the open space question, Then they can do that and well maybe we I know that there's a flurry of hands that have gone, up.
Someone wants to add on a second resolution, then I think it would be in order to do that.
Putting in an open space and a building that looked like that.
Well, then, Let's see would could you lower the hands, knowing that Anthony had his hand raised just in case and everyone who does not want to vote on this.
On the second floor of an existing excuse me existing building located in a C-19 zoning district.
Is there, a second Anthony Sorry, Anthony, Cohn, Okay, then, Let's move to a vote, so call a question.
Is a c8, I'm, not sure if I said it, but it is a c84 district, which is very liberal with the amount of signage that's permitted, This signage, that's shown right, here, is actually far less than could be placed on the building, but they're not proposing any changes, and this is similar to what was on the plans that were previously proven, but you're, saying under the existing zoning.
That size is permitted, because I'm thinking that this bar here is only allowed like 14 inches out from the building I can't measure it, but it looks.
