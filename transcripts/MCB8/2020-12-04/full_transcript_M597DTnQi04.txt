All right: well, we are up and streaming so you guys can get going whenever sorry to have kept you an extra minute or so it's all right, we'll take it off the end. That's all right! Okay, I, like that good evening, everybody it is 6:32 and we're gonna start right off with our parks and Waterfront Committee meeting. My name is Trisha Shimamura and I'm co-chair of our committee, along with my better half Barry Schneider, and we're going to jump right in. We have two presentations tonight, the first one from Karen, Hori, I, hope, I'm saying your name correctly: Karen and Cecily strong if she's available, but if not Karen, I hope that you're able to carry on the team and represent the team from our neighbors in CB10 to talk about a project that they've been working on with regarding central park and the exonerated five. So with that Karen we'll kick it off to you and welcome from one community board to another. Thank you will I be able to share my screen? Yes, okay, you are good to go. Thank you well I'd like to thank you, everyone for this opportunity this evening to present our statement of objectives and goals to commemorate the exonerated five and their resilience and the need for social justice reform. So we had a very extensive vetting of this issue and we'd like to present that to you this evening. So with that I'd like to start with the presentation and answer questions at the end, so let me see if I can share my screen. Okay, is everyone able to see the screen? Yes, okay, great all right. So this is a as I said. This project is something that we've initiated and actually it started in 2019, where it was voiced at the community that there was a desire to have this commemoration take place. The mission of this exhibit would be to create an exhibition of a permanent parks and recreation educational commemoration inside of central park to honor the exonerated fight and the need for social justice reform. We would like to see this completed by April 2022, which would be the 20th anniversary of the exoneration. It would also be designed to raise awareness and sensitivity to a systemic and institutionalized pattern of racial injustice and the need for reform. Public art has the power over time to transform and uplift social consciousness. We envision a permanent commemoration to the fortitude and resiliency again of the five young men known as the Exonet rated five, formerly known as the central part, five 5 team youth, and to the need for social justice reform. We are proposing a commemorative permanent art piece cited in the northeast section of central park that celebrates the extraordinary diversity and history of our community while pointing to the city's aspirations for the future, and we seek to increase language around the spur of advocacy for social Justice reform, so it would be highly educational. The events surrounding the exonerated five and its impact on the community I believe you have your the resolution. Is that correct, I don't well I, don't think we shared that resolution with the group. Is that correct I don't know I have not Karen, I'm sorry, we I. Can you resend that to us and we can make sure that everybody in the committee has a copy of it? Oh, yes, definitely is it on your website. Could I pull it from there that I'm not sure of, but we can definitely send it over to you so this? Basically, this section coming up is basically our resolution, so I won't go into it in detail, because this is a very lengthy presentation but, as I said, we can forward that on to you, but it the resolution just outlines the events that took place. The details of the or detailing the events and I have Cecily calling she's looking for the dial and infos information, so she's trying to join okay, I'm sorry, so the resolution basically outlines the details of the event, the conviction of four of the youth as youth and one Corey wise as an adult, and it goes on to talk about the exoneration and all of the vetting that the parks and Recreation committee at Community, Board 10, has done so for five young boys who hail from the Harlem central Harlem area adjacent to the northern end of the park near 110th, Street, Central, Park roomed as a rural oasis. In the midst of the urban concrete, their access was limited by the algae dominated near and dilapidated facilities, which was not the norm for the more affluent areas of the park. But nevertheless, these young boys viewed the park as their backyard on April 19 1989. These boys would experience the onset of an unimaginable blight in their young lives that no one should have to ever endure and the high profile case brought to the light, the prevalence of racial profiling, discrimination and inequality in the media and legal system. And again this is our resolution and it goes on to say that the experience of the exonerated five in their families was not exceptional. It fits a historical pattern of unjust arrests and wrongful convictions of black and latino young people in the United States, and we must understand the pattern to be able to channel the recently new found interest in the case into the necessary systemic reforms. Here we have a statement by Mrs Youssef Salam, I'm sorry by Mrs Sharon Salam, who is the mother of Yousef Salam, and she goes on to talk about how the how this whole experience has impacted on all of the families and she speaks as to how the climate took its toll on all of the families, destroying relationships between father and son and mother and son. The many years of stress on our she says on our innocent boys and families caused many family members to be conflict inflicted with disease and driven to death, even in 2003 Matthias Reyes stepped out of the shadows and confessed to raping the jogger Patricia Maylie. His dna supported his confession. Now that the prison experience is over, we are all trying to move forward and towards forgiveness. While we are rebuilding our lives, this story continues to be told through acclaimed storytellers in print film and TV. We have the book the Central Park five by Sarah Burns and which is a riveting, in-depth biographical account of one of this notorious event committed by Matthias Reyes and not by the Central Park, five or exon raider. Five, the filmmaker also Sarah burns, along with her father, Ken, Burns and David Mcmahon, examined the 198K 1989 case of the five teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of raping a woman after they spent six to 13 years in prison. And after this, serial rapist, Mattia Reyes confessed to the crime, and this is the central park, five, which is an award-winning documentary when they see us another award-winning depiction of the story of the exonerated five directed by Eva Duvernay, which is also an award-winning depiction again of the of this, the this crime and which was the victimization of these five young boys and then, when they see us now, which was Oprah Winfrey presentation. So there's been and there's a wealth of documentation on this infamous case. Why, in part commemoration so commemoration to the exonerated five in central park, is to shed light on the prejudice, hatred and ultimately unnecessary incarcerations that occurred due to the inequities inherent in the american Justice system. Also, we would like to inform, engage and activate the public in building a path to healing for black and latino communities, as well as the community at large communities in Harlem, the nation and throughout the world. We would like to see the end Tourette to racist mass incarceration. We would like to see educate education of our youth as opposed to incarceration. We would like to see the eradication of the school to prison pipeline which exists african Americans, make up approximately 13 percent of the american population, but roughly 36 percent of the 2.2 million Americans incarcerated about one in nine black men between the ages of 22 and 34 years old are in prison. New York, City's communities of color are disproportionately impacted by incarceration high imprisonment and youth of color remain far more likely to be incarcerated than white youth between 2003 and 2013. The racial gap between black and white youth in secure commitment, increased by 15 percent high imprisonment rates correlate with other community problems related to poverty, employment, education and health. This inequitable disparity has been made even more evident as a result of the ravages of Covid-19. Improvements were made to the northern end of the park and began in 1989 following the central park jogger case work on the ravine located in the northern part of the park was completed by 1992. The Central Park Conservancy announced a 51 million dollar campaign for upgrades in 1993, resulting in the restoration of bridal trails, the mall, the Harlem mere the north woods and the construction of the Dana Discovery center at the Harlem. Mere an impart commemoration will present a forum to raise conscience awareness around the need for social and criminal justice reform, a gross miscarriage of justice that forever brutally altered the lives of five young boys from the community, who formerly saw them the north end of central park as their backyard. The in-part commemoration would encapsulate a return to the site of origin of this miscarriage of justice and, in a sense, coming full circle. This would be an added component in the promulgation of an iconic healing of systemic wounds on a much broader societal level. The park is the most natural location for commemoration, since its location is burned into the collective memories of New Yorkers and the nation. As a turning a major turning point in our city's history, presenting a new narrative within the confines of the park, the location of the tragic event helps us all to collectively heal change, revisionist history and work towards change together. So in terms of objectives of impart commemoration again honoring the resiliency and experiences of the exonerated five bringing attention to the pervasiveness of racial injustice within the criminal justice system, with special attention to the experiences of young people of color, changing the narrative of who is honored to embrace all corners of our city and sharing the lived experiences of people who are victimized by the criminal justice system and demonstrating that this is not an isolated injustice, but part of a larger system that produces justice. Injustice in daily ways. Four key audience audiences that we would like to reach would be the local area residents, of course, black and brown communities at the northern border of the park that have been generationally impacted by mass incarceration and the economic and social disparages that collectively affect them and the more affluent communities surrounding central park. We would like to reach out to the 42 million visitors who visit central park each year, and our objective is to connect with the diverse local, national and international general public, the media. We would like for them to acknowledge their past mistakes in connection with the case and to reimagine how they would report more equitably incidents and stories as they occur, so that the presumption of innocence in their coverage is not assumed. I'm sorry is the presumption of innocence is not denied in their coverage. We would all particularly like to reach out to the youth engaging the youth community, teaching them about the scourge of wrongful convictions, about how racism defeats the presumption of innocence and help them to be engaged in social change in terms of desired takeaways. We would like visitors to this exhibit to walk away with the reflection on the human cost of systemic racism and explore the roles and responsibilities of individuals, society and government when confronting racism, injustice and institutionalized inequities. We would also like for them to take away the fact that they have been educated or they will be educated about what led to the conviction and subsequent exoneration of the central part, five now known as the Exonet rated five, including the historical context about policing in New, York City at the time and the current status of policing. We would also like to again specifically send a message to media to engage community-based, relevant media like local venues such as the Amsterdam news, the daily challenge, the beacon village, Voice, Kiss, Fm, Wbai and wbals. In addition to the major media channels and networks. These particular media outlets were very responsible in their reporting and did not fuel the fire so to speak in the instance of the exonerated fire. This commemoration is envisioned as physical and permanent and could be encountered at or near a threshold into the northern end of central park or inside of the park itself. It should be inviting and pervade a sense of community ownership, so it's a non anomalous at this point. We don't have anything definitive in terms of what the exhibit will look like, but we do have some ideas and would involve an art selection process. So the presumption of innocence was totally disregarded and the imprisonment ordeal and subsequent family suffering should be designed to be powerful but palatable to the viewing experiences should be incorporated in this exhibit the blatant racism should be graphically exemplified with Donald Trump's, full page ads in the media as part of the exhibition which and the use of color should permanent permeate the graphics throughout and I'm sorry, and we would also discuss what, where the exonerated five are, and what they're doing now as adults so again, education and we're also looking to tie this exhibit into a center. That would deal with criminal justice reform also in terms of education. This exhibit could be linked to the to programs that already exist in central park monuments, as well with the objective of raising awareness and sensitivity again to systemic and institutionalized patterns of racial injustice and need for reform. There is currently a temporary exhibit to the Seneca Village, the historical Seneca Village, and that could be tied in that was a thriving village of predominantly african Americans from 1825 to 1857, which was decimated through imminent domain. People were displaced, and it was just it's just another historical situation of injustice. We could tie this also into the women's suffrage monument which was unveiled on August 26 2020 Ida, B Wells, who was a women's suffragette, was also an anti-lynching advocate during the time of the turn of the century when thousands of people were being lynched and that they were predominantly people of color black people, there's also the Marion J Sims Statue replacement. The statue itself of Marion J Sims was removed, but this is a case of historical injustice through medical apartheid, where enslaved women were used to experiment on, and there was no anesthesia used in the process and again, of course, against their will. This could also be tied into the New York historical society, which has currently has an exhibit and program on the 200 year, history of slavery in New, York, City, and also they have a program on Seneca Village, a lecture series as well. It could also we could tie this in with the Riker's public memory project Corey wise one who was 16 at the time, served a good deal of time at Rikers. Island was originally a colony where captured, slaves were kept, it was purchased in 1664 and as an over 200 year period, I'm engaged in profiteering. The family that owned this island engaged in profiteering from the slave trade. In the New York City area, slavery ended in 1827 in the state of New York City purchased the island in 1884 and the Rikers island jail opened in 1932 and has been a been notorious for overcrowding, violence, abuse, substandard and inhumane conditions, and the Rikers public memory project is advocating for its closure. We have support from many of our elected officials and community-based organizations, and so here we have listed the innocence project, justice for the wrongfully incarcerated, New, York, theological seminary. The NAACP we just spoke with Senator Chuck Schumer, and we will be getting a letter of support from him. We have had monumental support from Gail Brewer and Bill De Blasio. The mayor. We also just received a letter from Inez Dickens and we do have support from Councilman Perkins and Senator Brian Benjamin, and we are still garnering letters of support. So those are just a few. The exhibit would also be used as a form for advocacy and for legislation to end unnecessary jail, detention for people awaiting trial and for low-level offenses to shorten excessive prison sentences and improve release processes, sentence, fewer people to incarceration and make sentences shorter change. The financial incentives that fuel punitive justice system responses, stop probation and parole systems from being from fueling incarceration and keeping juvenile justice, criminal justice and immigration processes separate, giving all communities a voice in how our justice system works and examination of punishment versus rehabilitation as a part of our methodology in vetting the issue and reaching out to the community. We held three public forums over the summer, which were virtual and we've discussed the issue and different components of the issue. Sarah Burns filmmaker was in a part of our was one of our panelists Malik Yoba Dr Youssef Salam Mrs Sharon Salam Jay Larry attorney a corporate attorney Ricardo Barretto, who is an independent cultural community, consultant specializing in public art processes, Cynthia Copeland, president of the Institute for the exploration of Seneca, Village history, Vincent, Sutherland, executive director at Nyu, Center on race, inequality and the law. We also have Rebecca Brown director of policy, the of the for the innocence project. I'm Dr Ademola, look before vice president of international communications in the Harlem Dwyer Cultural Center, Brenda, Berkman, Retire, director of monumental women, board of directors and myself. I was a panelist Isaiah, Jenkins Manhattan borough, director Office of Mayor De Blasio. So, as I stated earlier, this was voiced this. The desire to have this commemoration was voiced by the community at our October, 2nd General board meeting. As a result of that, we had discussions in our parks and Recreation committee meetings in December, January and February March April and may on. In March of this year, we received authorization from the executive committee to form a subcommittee to deal with the project. The subcommittee consists of board members as well as stakeholders from the community and members of the exam and will Yusuf Salam and his family from the exonerated five. We our subcommittee has had meetings. We met on June, 18th and July, and on July, 9th and July 30th of this year on June 3rd of this year, Manhattan community board 10 unanimously passed a resolution in support of the installation of a permanent commemoration of the exonerated side and social justice reform to be located in New, York, City, Central Park and then, as a result of our panel discussions, we garnered opinions and information on policies around policies and projects and how we would go about implement. Having this project implemented in central park, we had a focus group that did a walkthrough. I'm sorry again. Our focus groups were held on July, 9th July 16th and July 23rd. Those were our public outreach virtual panel discussions that we had. So we had a group that a group consisting of subcommittee members who did a walk through. Actually they did two one on August 13th and one on August 15th and they established selection criteria. One was at the route that people would have entered the park in 1989 should be a consideration for site selection. The site selection should be accessible for park, visitors and the site should be at least intrusive to the integrity of central park and its setting and respective of the Central park mission. So as a result of that walk through the group came up with the recommendation for 110th Street and Fifth Avenue, and that would be the entrance where that would meet all of those criteria. So we understand that any proposal for an art installation must first be approved by city agencies that govern the property where the artwork will be cited, and so at this point we have already submitted to the New York City Department of Parks and Central Park Conservancy. So we are here this evening to ask for a letter of support or a resolution from community Board 8 in support of this effort and I. Thank you. So very much for your time. Thank you very much. Karen Trish! You want to pick up yeah sure. Thank you so much Karen for all the work that you've done on this. We'll go to first members of the public who have questions and will. Could you just explain how to raise your hand, okay, yeah, so you'll notice, everybody is muted and oh, I'm gonna close. The screen share for a second because I, don't like seeing myself over there, so you'll notice, everybody is muted right. Now we we'll take questions through using the raise hand, feature which can be found if you open the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. So right now there's a little number 36. Next to the participants button. You click that button. A box will pop up and you'll hit the raise hand button if you're on the phone, it's star 9, to raise your hand and I'd just like to say that Sicily has joined us she should be on. She is yes welcome Cicely, and maybe we can unmute Cecily too just in case she wants to add and add anything to it. Welcome Cicely! Thank you. I apologize for being late, I had another quick meeting that ran over, but thank you elita. You know I, don't know she's on here, but oh yes, hi, good, seeing you very Trisha will thanks for having us and for letting us present this presentation. As you could tell it's been a labor of love for us in CB10, but we are excited about the initiative. The borough president has really embraced it and she saw it not just for CB10, but central park is just so critical and pivotal in the city that she really wanted it to be a resolution and a thought process and a space for all of Manhattan to come and think about the social justice changes and the way that we all can come together to make sure that things like that. Never happen again. So again. Thank you so much for having us tonight, thanks for coming Sicily good to see you Sisley. Thank you great. So we'll start with I see Lloyd Zuckerberg as our first member of the public. Thank you two questions. You referred someone reference a website for this project. Could you tell us what the website is and the second question is there anything as comprehensive on as this anywhere else in central park or another park, meaning I understand? There are monuments and there are statues and there's a museum and things like that. But is there anything similar to this that exists in another city park or in central park? Well, I can't speak to any park outside of New York, but something that might approach this would be the Seneca Village project or exhibit, which is interactive using Barco Barcodes. So you can get information, they're tablets that are spaced around the footprint of the village, so that's interactive and then, as I said, there's also a series that's being offered at the New York historical society. There is the women's suffrage monument which is interactive as well, so you can again using barcodes. You can hear the voices of actors portraying the women portrayed depicted in the monument, so those are two examples of interactive exhibits that I'm aware of- and you said, there's a it's or someone said: there's a website for this project. Is that correct? No, that's something that we would like to that, or that we would be planning to develop in conjunction with the exhibit, so there would be a way to get further information for further details, so it would be definitely educational and the website would come later on. Okay, thank you. You're welcome, I, don't think I see any other members of the public. So then we'll go to committee members, starting with our public committee, better Member, Judy Schneider evening. Thank you for the presentation. I'd like to ask: are you going to be sending this presentation to will or does he already have a copy of it? Well, we can say it's a very large file. We can send an excerpt, which is what we've been doing, highlighting with some of the highlights is for you to be able to review so that you can include the information in your resolution or letter of support. Also, we can send copies of letters that we already have CB11 gave us just. We have some fantastic letters that we could send to you. Everything you can send for the of the presentation would be most helpful to us and doing the minutes and I just want to make sure that I understand what you're talking about some kind of an exhibit that is in the outdoors. Is that correct? It's not inside a building such as the dairy or some place like that correct it would be outdoors. Thank you very much for presenting to us you're, very welcome my pleasure I see Barbara. Then Marco then Rita. Can you hear me my beauty, yeah, okay, great I, think this is fantastic. You did talk about education. Would that be indoors? I can see a space where lectures go on and discussions go on even beyond this. You know the issues generally. Have you thought about that or when you said that it will be educational? Do you mean just like an exhibit or something more than that, but we would like to tie it into a social justice center as well, actually building like a yeah in this in the central park, something close by. We would like to okay. That sounds great good. Thank you. You're welcome Marco! Oh thank you for the presentation, as an introduction, I think it's perfect and I think I like it a lot. My concern is I found without respect, is I find a little bit incomplete. The idea of social justice, for instance, is missing, affordable housing. This is the actually the condition and where they're living are very poor. Indeed. This is why these african, Americans and Latinos died more because exactly of the standard of housing. This is extremely important and the housing is very expensive and then- and the second part, which is complement of the first one- is of equal opportunities of employment to have more opportunities of employment in this exhibition and, above all of that I think is missing. One extremely very important point for me. This presentation I will release this exhibition. It shouldn't start without the verse of marking utility iteration. This is the most important part of the whole process, because this is the heart of the social movement in this country and I. Think it's extremely important to mention him or to honor him as a general terms. I find it that's good. I would like to support, but and I would like to see more in detail. How are you going to impact the inside of the central park? How is going to be the approach if it's sensitive I would like to support too, but with in general terms? Yes, I like the idea, but we need to see exactly how it's going to be the exhibition and how you're going to impact in that part, because this is not only to have good ideas, but also to show the ideas how it's going to be done. How is going to be the accident you mentioned that they accessed very well for those five agility men, they came in and was put it in jail and so I think it's a good start, but my concern is I need to see more, and everything is great and I strongly support that, but before to make any support personally, myself I would like to see more complete details, so we can support completely your application. Thank you. Okay. We would like to invite you to be a part of the selection process. There is there would be we did discuss the fact that we would have to have an art selection process, and you know we would take in information which would inform what that exhibit is going to look like so right now, as I mentioned earlier, it's anomalous at this point, but we are taking in ideas as to inform what this project will look like. So that's something you can certainly be a part of or make recommendations, and thank you so much for the invitation. I'm looking forward to participating a hundred percent very good right, Mr I, see a member of the public assigned to raise their hand. Sure of course go ahead. Nickel and Nicholas. Would you hunt Nicholas, please yeah hi thanks for calling on me. This sounds like a great idea. Just one question suggestion in the educational portion of the exhibit I would hope that there'd be something along the lines of kind of a know, your rights section in teaching, youth and well not only youth, but especially youth in how to confidently assert their rights in police interactions because with the Central Park five you know. Obviously, there are issues with the prosecutors and the jury and the media coverage, but at base what happened was they had false confessions extracted out of them? So I think it's very important that somewhere, along the way, there's clear bullet points teaching youth about you know their right to counsel their. You know their right to remain silent, basic civics education and there's a lot of groups out there that do that kind of work like the Marshall Brennan, Constitutional literacy project, there's also street law I think they do a program through Nyu. That I think could provide a lot of really useful resources for just basic bullet points of here's, how you deal with police interactions, but the project sounds great. So thank you. Yeah I'd just like to say that definitely is a part of what we would like to include with the educational component of the exhibit. So there is advocacy around knowing your rights and this center that we would like to have in conjunction with the exhibit would deal with those issues we also as a result of working with Sarah Burns. She has offered to help us with developing the curriculum for the exhibit and working with Pbs I see we have another member of the public who's raised their hands. If us we can Un mute Suzanne, but if everybody could just please I, we should have mentioned this beforehand, just to identify where you live to when you start to speak. Just for the record. Thank you very much. Can you hear me we can hear you. Okay, great I want to introduce myself. My name is Suzanne Barraza I've been active in my local 79th Street Neighborhood Association, as well as having been an employee of Central Park Conservancy for three and a half years. I live on the Upper East side at 75th and York Avenue. I think this is a wonderful idea and it sounds like the idea of the interactive I think is really great. I have led some of the Seneca Village tours and that's very helpful there, because you don't have anything really concrete to look at when you're going through the South Seneca Village site. So I like the fact that there's interactive things that are included with that I also remember. There was a really wonderful exhibit in the north end of the park done by creative time, and they did a really good job in curating, artists and I love the way that it integrated itself into the landscape, and that was all around the mirror and up above the you know, the rolling hills above the mirror, and so on and I can see that if this is integrated in a way in the park, it would be a really great way to draw people into the park, but also to get them to be thoughtful about what has happened in the park over our history. I, like the idea of also a social justice center nearby and I wonder if the museum of I think it's the museum of african art. That's right! It's about outside the park at the north end there at 110th and 5th Avenue, it's a beautiful museum, but I, don't know if it's open anymore, that might be a nice close-by place to have that and I. Just I'm really excited to see this to continue to evolve and I wonder: will the public be updated on the evolution of it, I really like to follow it? It's I find a very wonderful and a good addition to the north end of the park. Thank you. I think that we can discuss that Sicily how we can make that available on our website to keep everyone informed. I mean I. Think that also, you know I think that's an excellent suggestion to look into the museum african art and see what's happening with that and there's so much technology available today that we can certainly make this a very comprehensive and very meaningful experience. Great. Thank you. You're welcome going to Rita, then Rebecca Dan Gore, then Sharon, Pope, Marshall I thought this was fabulous really and I. My concern was: is that it's at the north end of the park and will enough people see it, but I see you tying in with the city of New York that does get different people looking and I think that they should be aware of this I wish it was bigger. I wish it was more inclusive, but I'll settle for whatever we can get and thank you. It was wonderful. Well, you will not just like I'd just like to say that Central park conservancy, would also once it's in the park. They would also make it a part of their informational series. They would get that they would may put it on the website and that because they're joined with them other exhibits in the park. Great sorry, let's go to Rebecca Dangor hi. Thank you. So much for the presentation. I think we all know, especially after the monumental women's statue and that wasn't a not to use a corny pun again, but it wasn't a walk in the park to get that done, and so I think this will be difficult too, and I would love our board to show support early even before the plans are fully realized, because I think, if we can, if all the community boards can maybe present a unified front, we can hopefully speed up the process, so I would be in support of a resolution or a letter, whatever you guys think, is best and will help your cause. Thank you so very much just for clarity. Karen, are you asking all the neighboring community boards for resolutions is Gail asking for a resolution, or are you looking for letters at this point? What are what is just before we go on? What is what are you looking for exactly or how it? What makes the most sense? Well, we have gotten resolutions. We have letters of support. Whatever your board would deem. What you deal with would be appropriate would be acceptable to us Sicily. Would you like to weigh in on that? Can I also just say if it's going to go before Pdc? Is there a likelihood that if it goes before the Public, Design commission we'd probably be approving it again? No berry? Is that not no I believe the parks has the right to approve this application in total installation of the park is are marshalled by the Parks Department. They don't go to the Pdc. Okay, sorry about that Tesla, you wanted to add. Oh no yeah, that is correct. Most of the I will say: I believe all the community boards have issued resolutions and then once we're able to get around to everyone. This will again come at Burle Board meeting for all the chairs to weigh in on. So in essence, you are giving your chair license to support this at the next parole board or whenever it comes on the agenda and my second question: sorry, as I know, it was mentioned previously at a borough board meeting and I think there might have been hesitation from one chair of the board. I'm not I, don't remember exactly which community board it was, but I would be interested in also sending whether it's a resolution or a letter to all of the other community boards so that the people you haven't met with yet could see. Maybe that there's you know, support from us as well. If that's something that would help. Yes, we had opposition from CB4 at the Borough board meeting. But since then we now have a letter of support. We present I'm going to Sharon Pope Marshall, then Craig, then police. Can you hear me we can hear you you're good. Okay, all right great to our guests, Cicely and Karen. Thank you very much for a very thorough and thoughtful presentation really appreciated and by the way I've had the opportunity to attend your community board meetings because of my employment, and it's always been a pleasure to participate in those meetings. I also want to thank Alita, Barry and Tricia for adding this as an agenda item. I would consider it an honor and a pleasure to say that in some small way that I had a hand in this project, I've been on the board for more than a decade and I can not remember a vote or a letter of support that is so real and so genuine as this is and part of it has I'm sure it has to be because I lived through this period. This very dark period in our city's history and I am fully aware as to what happened and following up the remarks that Suzanne made earlier, which is that something like this would be helpful in bringing people into the park to reflect on what happened and I think that they should. The other aspect of it is that whatever is chosen, I hope that it also inspires hope, because these boys, then grew into men were resilient in the face of horror, and that, for me, is the inspiration and so I would suggest, if I, if it's possible, that it also incorporates that resiliency that these boys had and continued to grasp on through their adulthood and becoming men overall and so I want to echo my Fellow board members to say that I very much support a letter of support or resolution, but I can not think of any other vote. That would be more impactful if you will then voting for a letter of support for this particular project. Thank you, Karen and thank you very much. Cicely thanks you're welcome thanks Sharon we'll go to Craig, then Felice and then Elita, hello. Everyone thank you for that presentation and for all the work that you've done with this initiative. This is very exciting and very much needed and I just want to say a few things and I want to echo what Rina was saying in terms of how it would be really great. If we could find opportunities to recognize this effort and to promote it or to have some signage and even a little bit of history in other locations in the park, I would love for visitors and tourists from outside of New York, who tend to never get above the great lawn to be able to witness this I'd love people from the neighborhoods further south, alongside central park that don't have large black and brown populations to be able to learn that learn about this and be aware that this is there and be inspired to take a trip up to 110th street to it. I just think. It's such an important topic that we need to dream big to see how we can make this a major attraction and top attraction on people's lists when they do go to central Park. One thought that I had I'm guessing. You probably explored it, but when you are approaching the time of completion and premiering this efforts, I didn't know if you have engaged with or considered engaging with the museum of the City of New York. I'm not sure if they've done any exhibits in the past on this, but it would be great if you could partner with them and generate more publicity and to be able to perhaps partner in terms of the educational efforts. It seems like a great synergy and the other question that I had is have you. Has there been any work done or collaboration with the board of education in terms of New, York, City, Public schools, adding social justice to the curriculums to their curriculums or to find ways to encourage field trips? So eventually, students will be able to take organized, have organized experiences at the exhibit and to be able to learn about it in a more formal way. Well, that's something that we discussed with Sarah Burns and she put us in touch with them. In fact, someone from Pbs had a little input into the presentation, so we are hope looking to work with them to develop a priest, a curriculum which we could use in the schools and take to the board of New York City Board of education to incorporate it and in terms of field trips in school study. So that is something that we are looking to do and we can certainly look into developing a partnership with this. The museum of the City of New York as well. Thank you you're, welcome all right thanks. We have Felice Elita and then Barbara, Rutter I think this was really an impressive presentation and I'm thrilled to be able to support this project. Clearly, a lot of work and passion has gone into developing this and it shows- and it's really impressive, the expanse of it. Are you going to need private funding to help support this program and the larger effort? Well, at this point, we don't know what the funding is going to look like. It may be that Central Park Conservancy will assist us in that way. So we don't know at this point. We should be hearing back from central Park conservancy within in about a week and a half, so we would know where to go from there, whether or not it would be city funding or through Central, Park Conservancy, or whether we would have to get funding from private sources. Certainly the parameters are at this point. Well, it's an impressive project and I'm glad to be able to support it. So thank you for all your hard work on this you're welcome, oh and I'd just like to say the melon I believe it's. The Melon Foundation has a grant program which is funding the lions project which is going into central park. So perhaps we could be a recipient of the grant from the Mellon Foundation through Central Park Conservancy great thank you. Can I thanks Trisha! Thank you so much Karen and Sicily for all of your hard work for bringing it to CBA. To look at for your dedication and your exuberance about it, and thank you to Trisha and Barry and all of the committee and board members who have spoken out in support of this I. Don't it sounds too patronizing to say thank you so I don't mean it like that, but it always it's always invigorating to see when there's a topic that expands beyond the boundaries of CBA and people are able to embrace the bigger issues, I believe in collaboration- and this is a great opportunity, even though what we're basically doing is approving it or voting it. If that's what the committee wants, but it's always I think to work together in pursuit of a shared goal, so I support this I think it's important to have all levels and types of New York City history on display to use the park in as many ways as possible and to provide as many different types of information as available to people with inquiring minds. So thank you, you're welcome. Thank you. Trisha. We have a couple repeats or do you want to jump in now, I think Barbara hasn't spoken, so I'm going to let Barbara speak and then we'll and then I'm just going to say very quickly. A few words go ahead. This will take two seconds. I just want to say that are pleased. We should all be going to the northern section of central park, it's one of the most beautiful sections of the park so because there are a couple of comments about some other things and I do think people do go there. If you have young kids, take them fishing at the lake and it's just wonderful. Do you want to make a resolution or you want to talk Tricia? Oh you go ahead. Please I would like resolution to approve this or well. I'm not sure. Do you want a resolution and a letter I prefer, quite frankly, I prefer a letter of surprise at this point, because it's a very anomalous present end game. I. Think we want to support where we're at now, where they're at and I would encourage them to pursue this enthusiastically, but I. Think a letter of support would be appropriate this at this juncture. Okay, can I just ask a question before we get to a second Karen. Can you tell me the other boards that you've received? Let are there letters from or resolutions from, are you referring to five boards around the park? That's right, Trisha yeah! Well, we are still we haven't presented to five or seven as yet so they're pending, but we've been going around CB4 CB11. We have letters from CB4, CB11, CB6, CB2, CB9 and I had a list in front of me. I'm sorry, that's! Okay, that's totally fine and okay and Barbara I just want to make sure that everybody who had a chance to speak so Lowell can we let Lowell speak first before we go to Marco I just want a second, that's great okay, so I just want to before we go on. I mean I. Think that this is super important I am I, really appreciate, Karen. All the work that you put into this and I want to make sure that we're as good of a partner as we can be. That's my only question of the resolution versus the letter. I just I want to make sure I understand, Barry's comments of making sure that we're it's the most appropriate measure to take, but I, don't know if we're gonna have another opportunity or another bite at the apple. So I don't know Karen from you. If you guys are planning on once, it gets a little bit further along once you have a design once you have a plan of action where you're going to be, and if you're planning on then coming back again for resolutions, but I know that I want us to I, want our board to I. Want our board to be on the right side of this. When we look back and look at this and I also I just don't know if we're gonna have another opportunity. So if you could just let us know what your thoughts are on that then that's then I. Would then that would that's my only question in terms of method here? Well, we are going back before the Borough board, I'm not sure exactly when that will be and we are planning once we get information in terms of next steps from Central Park Conservancy in New, York City parks, then we can come back with more information and let you know we will be holding subcommittee meetings at that point as well. You're welcome to attend so and then we will establish something on the website to keep updates, to provide updates as well. The only other thing I'll say and then I think a lot of people have their hands committee. Members have their hands right, so maybe they'll have opinions on this, too. Is that Karen, you weren't here a couple weeks a couple months ago, when we started to talk about just being a little more conscious about equity and justice issues and the intersection of our parks and open space and to our committee members I would just say that I think that this is a really pretty clear-cut example of how we can be better and just on the right side of things when it comes to our parks and how we use our perks and how we use as an education tool and what access means and what welcome being welcoming means and kind of repairing past damages that are done. So this is would I would say that I kind of feel more resolutiony, but I will defer to everybody else and I, but I do think that this is here is our first moment. You know thing so with that I think it was Marco, but actually I'm sorry can we just let Irma talk first, since she hadn't spoken. Yet you muted yourself back. Thank you. Yes, okay, yes, well! I have to leave the meeting early, but I wanted to thank the two presenters I. Think it's a really great idea, and it really brought me back. I was a much younger woman when this happened and I hope that they also incorporate what happened with the media and how these young boys were depicted immediately as guilty. I mean that was flashed all over the headlines and it was just so unfair, so that should definitely be a component of how it was driven that everybody felt they were guilty, including myself, because after we were reading- and so you know was it just so unjust and yeah- we really need something like this in the park. It's so important, it really is so definitely you know I'm in the port of this. Thank you so much great okay, so I think it's Marco I, thank you. I'm gonna be very quick, I think Barry. He suggested I think his idea is great and I would like to support the letter that Barry recommend. Thank you, okay, thank you and then Elita I, I'm actually more in support of having a resolution and but I will certainly defer to the majority of the committee, but my preference is for a resolution, a full resolution, as opposed to a letter of support. Thank you, Elita and then Rebecca Dangor. Thank you. Trisha I would agree with Sharon that a resolution is weightier in this instance and if we could have a large majority or even a unanimous board decision, it should carry a lot of weight. We touch the park, so our vote is mandated as well as speaking out in favor of the issues that the project represents and if we are doing a resolution, though, if we could have the presentation to make available to the rest of the board in advance of the full board meeting in a couple of weeks, that would be really helpful for people who are interested in the vision behind it. Thank you, yeah. Forgive me Rebecca, I'm just going to add to that very quickly. Just that I that was part of it too, is that with a letter we there's no opportunity to speak about this at our full board. Meeting and I know that everybody will read the minutes and I know that everybody will get the presentation, but I would love for us to be able to talk about this in our full board meeting and bring it to a full vote. I. Just also will note that I read the resolution from CB10 and it is I. The Whereases are wonderful. The actual resolution itself is not too prescriptive, and it's not very specific in that, like it doesn't, you know, specify a lot of the finer details that were discussed tonight, so I think that we I think I mean I think that we could pass a resolution or get a resolution pass that wasn't. That was in that same vein, not too prescriptive, not too specific and still give all the entire board an opportunity to support this early, but I will give it to Rebecca and then we'll figure it out. Sorry I think something was weird with my hand it kept being lowered and then re-raised I was also I was going to propose a resolution because of what everyone said, but especially the fact that at the bottom of a resolution it says how many people were in support and I think that carries weight that a letter might not have, and if we can tell anything from this meeting, everyone seems to be very highly supportive, so I'm I will vote in favor of either, but my preference is also for a resolution. I will withdraw my recommendation. A suggestion of a letter and I will support a motion at this time. Okay, then I move that we Rebecca you're out of order. You can't make a resolution after you all right. True I think Barbara had a resolution, though, on the floor, so I think it's a second on that resolution that we need. Oh there's, Judy and there's Sharon and there's Elita and there's Lowell. Oh I, think Lowell also seconded it. So I'm sorry lil. So we are we're all out of order. Okay, oh all, in favor. We will assume that you're in favor, unless you raise your hand, in which case you're a no or an abstention, may interrupt a moment treasure before the vote. Can someone read the resolution the where the resolve Barbara I? Think that's to you unless you resolve that we support CB, 10's resolution and I would include the resolution in with it. Well, we haven't read it: I have and I can I read it I, just I was reading, it came hold on and really we did because we had this wonderful just explained it to us and we just had this wonderful presentation that was really in such detail. The resolution is CB. 10's resolution is that C Cv 10 supports the installation of a permanent exhibit to commemorate the exonerated five to be located in New, York, City, Central Park, and that's it. Fine good I can support that as long as we change 10 to 8. sure Judy. Yes, are there to be any whereases in this resolution. Yes, there are, and I took some notes on that, but oh Barbara, I'm sorry, that's absolutely well. I agree I mean, whereas, as we have this presentation and the importance of it and how our, whereas our community board, wants to do more support for equity in parks, I think that those that's where we can have it, but basically we don't want to rewrite the resolution. We just want to say we want to support CB, 10. well, I said well, let's be clear. We want to support CB 10's resolution. We want to absolutely don't. We want our own resolution that says community board a supports this project in some manner. Cba supports cb10s resolution on right on can I interject here for a second I think I may suggest. Instead, that Manhattan community board 8 joins CB10 in their advocacy for a permanent installation and an air installation excuse me of commemorating the exonerated five I took some notes here, of Sharon's words in particular, but noting the importance of honoring, the resiliency of these men and the need for social justice and for changes and the need for someone. A member of the public talked about civic engagement and an increased awareness of civic engagement in our park and using our parks and using art as a way to connect and heal. I'm happy to send some more language over Sharon I thought that what you were saying was particularly perfect. I would like to add something that it's a mission of CBA to bring more awareness or something like that. Would you? How do you feel about something like that? It's your resolution and I think we all passed it so the whereas clauses I think are, can be up to you and bring it to a full board vote. But Judy would you Trish? Would you send me your notes? Sure of course thanks. Okay ready to rent, though I think we did right good. There are no hands. The resolution will go down unanimously. Would you read all of the names into the public record of the board members who are here? Yes, so I see Barbara and Irma still here, because I know she's leaving soon I see Barbara Rutter I, see Barry Schneider I, see Elita Camp Craig, later Felice Barber Irma, Torres, Jack, Zimmerman, Judy, Schneider, Lowell, Martin, Marco, Tamayo, Rebecca, Dan, Gore, Rita, Popper, Sharon, Pope, Marshall, Takako, Kono and Shimamura. We practically have a forum very good. Thank you very much. Thank you Cecily. Thank you. Karen Mike I had my thanks. Sure agenda. Yes, sir okay. The next item is the update by Stacy Pappas, the executive director of the friends of the East River Esplanade 60th to 120th Street Welcome, Stacy hi. Thank you boy. This is a tough act to follow so I'll do my best and I just want to say this is wonderful and I'm so glad I got to be a part of it and listen to the presentations. So tonight I'm gonna well. I can share my screen right, no problem yep. So I'm going to share my screen and I'm going to present to you the idea of the addition of outdoor all-weather fitness equipment to the Esplanade. All right everybody's got my screen so tonight I'm presenting the addition of outdoor all weather fitness to the fitness equipment to the Esplanade and I'm speaking on behalf of our Fitness Committee Susan Blackwell, Frederica, Miller and Craig Starr. Since gyms have closed people have taken their workouts outside and have taken over playgrounds and parks. This is the East River roundabout. As you can see, this is the climbing rope. These are gymnastics rings, and this is a supporting rope tied on to a chair. Obviously this is dangerous. Without my arrows, you can barely see these hanging and the sculpture is not made to withstand the added weight of humans or the wear and tear of the climbing robes. However, we can see that there is a need for fitness equipment, so our fitness committee went out and spoke with the public. We've got strong support from the community, both in person and online close to 500 signatures on our petition, 80 likes on social media posts and Jaina Alexandra's, a grad student at Columbia, University, School, Journal journalism and approached us after seeing our petition she's writing an article about outdoor fitness during the pandemic and currently she's interviewing people about this concept and with her professor's approval will publish her article on NYC, nycreopens.com, Columbia's, newest publication, dedicated to life in and after the pandemic. We don't see outdoor fitness as a short-term trend until gyms fully reopen. We see this as a long-term activity for three reasons: one geography, some people belong to gyms that are near their office and since they're no longer going into the office may let their memberships lapse. Secondly, financial people may no longer have disposable income for gym. Memberships and thirdly, people like working out in the fresh air- this may be a new concept to some people, but they may never go back to indoor exercise. Fitness committee then researched where this equipment could be placed on the esplanade, we're looking at an architect's rendering of Andrew Haswell Green Park upon completion of phase two. This location has the width to allow pedestrians and bicyclists to pass without interference, while also allowing for landscaping. It's also structurally sound enough to carry the additional weight of the equipment. If people are concerned that they could be losing quiet space rest assured, Sutton Place has five parks for passive enjoyment. The committee then put an RFP out to see what vendors would be interested in designing and installing the equipment they narrowed it down to four different vendors with four unique concepts. Our first vendor is called landscape structures, it's an employee-owned business and they do extensive work in New, York City. The picture you're looking at is of Astoria park and the equipment and setup is pretty straightforward and easily recognized as gym equipment. Our second vendor is called national fitness campaign. They create a one-size-fits-all concrete slab with bodyweight circuit training system for adults of all ages and fitness levels. The square is 38 feet by 38 feet. Our third vendor is called my equilibria and they're. An italian vendor. That's recently been added to the approved vendor list for New York City. They currently have installations in Miami DC and across Europe. Their work looks more like public art at first glance, but upon closer inspection you can see that it is circuit training, equipment, their equipment and layout can be customized to fit any space, and our last vendor is called Compin they're, a dutch firm. They have an extensive Us presence experience in New, York City and one equipment concept, but their layout is completely customizable. Adding fitness equipment to the esplanade will help bring together a fitness-minded community. We already see people walking running and biking now. They can add circuit training for a full, well-rounded outdoor fitness program. The short-term benefits include getting adults out of the playgrounds in public art. Space and long-term benefits include adding a much-desired amenity on the esplanade for all to enjoy, providing safe equipment and a dedicated space for the fitness community. The cost of each concept is roughly the same in the 100 to 120 thousand dollar range and estimate. Friends would lead the fundraising efforts for this and, lastly, since phase two construction has not started, this concept could easily be added to the current design with little modification. I'm happy to take questions and, if I'm not able to fully answer them, Susan, Craig or Frederica can weigh in tonight or I can get answers from them and reply back to you guys. Thank you, Trisha and Alita before we begin with questions. I have an observation to make that this phase, 2 2a 2b phase 3 of annual hazard green all, is part of the 197a plan, for which we have a committee on the community board. This should have been presented to that committee, not just the park Committee, so I suggest we defer this further discussion and the presentation itself until a meeting can be convened, including the people who are on the that 197A committee Trish. Any comment: okay, so I yeah, so I do think Stacy. I'm sorry I think that we should have probably labeled this the right way, but I do see two comments here. Three comments here so I want to give those folks a chance to say their piece and then we'll figure out how to go forward, but thank you, but so we'll go to Judy. Then Jennifer then Elita and see what their thoughts are. Judy, yes, I just want to make a correction. Stacey phase 2B has started. The construction is one of the few parks that is back in construction now so and that this rendering that you presented is not the latest rendering of what phase 2b will look like there's a more recent rendering on the 197a website at the community board site that you could look at and Stacy. Perhaps we can talk offline more about what Barry was talking about. I was co-chair of the 197a committee when we did it so, and the third thing I wanted to say is: although we have no funding for it, we did have a joint 197a parks committee presentation over a year a half ago for the building inside underneath the pavilion which the former sanitation building, and that was meant to have this kind of equipment in it. That was planned. This project is not going forward yet because there is no funding for it at this time. Okay, all right, that's helpful information! Thank you, Judy Jennifer hi, so you know with just we. One thing we didn't really say is just how much respect we have for the schneiders, for you know basically shepherding this for so many years, but I think and I do know that it has started. I've actually seen the trucks but I know the main part hasn't really started construction and it just you know all came together when we were at the CBA meeting a couple of months ago, and the discussion came up about fitness equipment and the need for fitness equipment on the waterfront, and you know, as we said, there's been just overwhelming. Support for this fitness equipment is something that is on waterfronts. You know not just throughout the city, but literally throughout the country and the world, and with the pandemic, as Stacy mentioned, the time seems actually perfect for fitness equipment. It's something. We've looked into a lot in the past and of course we were never planning. You know this is all very preliminary, even though you saw the vendors we looked at and we were never planning just to present it just to parks, but also to the 197a committee as well, but I know I had mentioned it to you Trisha and that's how we came to present it here tonight and so we're just really looking for comments support. We know there's a lot of community support. There I mean we literally got signatures. People enthusiastically signed. We were at a gardening event at Acock and basically everyone who walked by signed. We had almost 400 signatures within a few hours of posting it on social media and one of the signatures. I think Stacy's presentation shows it is the head of design for the New York City Parks Department, who is actually a resident of the area, Nancy Prince and she enthusiastically signed and with her parks email. So it was at her suggestion as well that we're coming to the community board just to you know, talk about it really and say that it's something that we're really working hard on. That's all I had to say thank you thanks, Jennifer Elita, thanks Trisha I, think what Barry says makes sense and if it could be something joint where 197a and parks are together on this, that makes sense. I think it reminds me of the dispute over outdoor fitness equipment at John, Jay, Park and then finally, I think it's a really I think it's a really good and interesting idea and I think this is exactly a right time to be reimagining. New York city in so many areas, outdoor fitness equipment, hadn't, occurred to me, but this makes a lot of sense and if we could just engage the city engage all areas and I'm glad to see Columbia journalism. Student is involved in thinking about how New York could be different and inclusive and touch on other areas. I think it's a great idea! Thank you. If I may jump in I have I would schedule a 197, a committee joint with parks in January, okay, terrific. Thank you I. I'm really grateful that you guys that you're that you came Jennifer and Stacy and Marco will get and Barbara I'll get to you. One second I just wanted to say that I am grateful. I think that there's too much of a tendency sometimes to work in silos or just to be all working for the same overall goal, but not to have as open communication as possible. So I think that it's great and I would just I. Think generally. My operation is to defer to Barry when it comes to 197a, stuff and so I think my I would defer to him on this one. But since you're here and since it's an opportunity for us to have a conversation about this and to start thinking about this, I would say yes to both so I want to give Marco and Barbara a chance eek. Let me jump, I'm sorry cheers before we do that. I want to point out. Unfortunately, this wasn't on the agenda. We didn't know. This is going to be presented this way, so that many people who might have been engaged in this issue are were not aware of it. So they did. They may not have attended this meeting. That's why I think it's imperative that we bring it to a 197a committee and properly notify the public about it. Yeah I think you're, right, I mean I, think you're right on that and if Stacy, if you and Jennifer and the fitness committee are willing to come to the January meeting, then we can post about it and I'll personally put up posters in the area and we'll like we'll. Do it I think that that's very to your point, I think it's great I, just since we're here and since it has I, would love to just get Marco and Barbara's opinion too. All right I'd like to move the agenda at that point. Okay, go ahead, Marco! Oh! Thank you! They are right because we have to comply with the open-minded law, and that means that we have to notify the public and then make a decision. That's absolutely right, so we can not prove anything because of that law. That's everything! The second part is I love. The third idea. Your idea believe me, I will be fighting, for. That is something that makes another sense, beautiful, excellent contribution, good taste, excellent sign. This is one and the other one is. I'm still don't understand why people they prefer to do exercise in the indoor spaces. It's crazy! How you gonna do inside, have passed and received the same, a contaminated area from the other person, this the dust that coming inside and then respirate. Everything like that. It's wrong, there's, nothing better! That we outside and I think that you have the space. You have good ideas and I strongly support the only thing we have to follow regulations. Regrettably, that's as well the way that we work in this community, and that is right, but believe me from now on count with me on the third option that will be fighting for you and be very happy to help you. Thank you. Marco Barbara, well, I am very enthusiastic about it. Just a quick question: did you ever think of John Finley walk as a place? To put it that's very wide, it needs to be fixed up to begin with. It seems to be a lot going on. You know with the park there and everything, and it's quite wide is that something that was thought of that's a great question. Barbara I, don't know the answer to that. Craig or Frederica saw they're both on the call. One of them may have the answer and I don't know if Susan's on the call I didn't see her picture pop up or Jennifer. Do you know if they explored that I? Don't know the answer to that? Who should I be on meeting yeah, Jennifer yeah sure, so if I, they really walked far and wide looking for spots and I, think that this being that it was a new spot, you know and does have even more width than John Finley walk. They looked at the you know, there's a the roller rink and the basketball courts yeah. But you know those are really highly used already by other kind of sports enthusiasts, so that was the only location that really looked tenable on John Finley walk, and you know this just so. You know this is very you know, even though it looks professional and Stacy did a great job with the presentation we're in the very preliminary you know at all right. The seed was planted just at your community board. Eight meeting I think you know just as I said a couple of months ago, but this seemed like because it's new it seemed like the right place and because there's so much space we had you know just started preliminary one of the one of our board. Members on Esplanade friends was reaching out as well to the origin to the architects. We happen to have a meeting about something else with municipal arts society and garnered their support, because you know they were the shepherds of the Aco, Pavilion, repair or restoration. So, yes, we thought of other locations and I will tell you that community board 11 just unrelated to this has been asking for fitness equipment on the waterfront and unfortunately, we would absolutely, as a group love to support that there. However, that whole stretch of Esplanade is falling down and there's nothing even being built there. So this is kind of what's interesting about it. Is it's coming from so many different angles and they've asked you know, can't you find a spot that you would support in community board 11, but right now we just have to like literally support the esplanade there so right. Another suggestion is because I hate the Con Edison site and how ugly that thing is. We could put it maybe in that, dirty on the roof not on the roof, but in the area that isn't fixed up at this point. You know that on the south side, I think it's maybe just a little too small there that okay yeah I'm not picturing it well I thought that it was bigger than this. Okay thanks Jennifer and everybody else, that's great, very exciting. Thank you! Barbara Barry, you have a lot of other hands, but I'm going to defer to you because I know that you're in 197a. So if you want to take the last few questions or comments, it's up to you now, I'm unmuted, you know, let's take the question. Let's see we can get through this in as expeditiously problematic one other thing: Jennifer, the municipality side had nothing to do with the pavilion except I had to repair the Alice, a sculpture. Thank you we'll call on. We see Sharon and Lowell and Craig, and let's see if we can keep this very brief. Please says it's going to be heard again thoroughly in January. So very brief. Wow I love this and I need it also just one I'm not sure if I missed it, but I'm also hoping that there'll be a diversity in the exercise equipment, especially so that older people might be able to use them as well, and that's it great, oh nice, to see you Jennifer by the way and also wanted to mention I, wanted to follow up Trisha's comments about how often times we operate in these silos and open communication is just absolutely fantastic, wonderful, job, Stacy and thank you so much Jennifer. Thank you Sharon, and just so you know this particular campaign national fitness campaign. They do promote their equipment for adults of all ages and all fitness levels right and I believe the other ones do is too, but this one, this they're very particular about that. So and also these suggestions for these vendors or just to give people an idea of what's out there. It's certainly nobody has been approved. Nobody has been vetted other than through the fitness committee. They all have approval to work in New York City, but we just wanted to give you an idea of what we're looking at and the different types of vendors that the different types of equipment that could be out there, so that aesthetically, it may look one way fitness-wise. It may look another way and what they're able to do their capabilities? We're done on you Lowell, please hi am I unmuted, yes, okay, yeah I just wanted to say that if you are going to buy equipment, I would appreciate it to have it bought in America I believe that nationally, fitness also means a fit economy, and if we keep on taking our dollars and shipping to other countries, it hurts our country. That's all right, Dangelo well said Craig. You have the last word great. Thank you. Two quick things. First, I want to echo what Barbara was suggesting in terms of expanding the area potentially or further investigating it. Even if you just had one piece of equipment scattered across the esplanade, I think that would be helpful as well. I know we've seen that in other places where you can have walking and running past with equipment in various locations and the other, just random thought I had is being a witness to much of the activity in Carl Sher's park and on John Finley walk and seeing some of these impromptu classes that have popped up with these group. Organ organized classes, fitness classes, I, want to know how, if you were to build out a site where you have all the equipment centered in a single location, how you could allow the general public to be able to use it where you're not going to have these organized classes and personal trainers, have groups of people there and essentially dominate it so that others can't use it. That's a great question: it's something we brought up when the fir when the fitness community first put everything together and a lot of this fitness equipment is out in other cities. People have seen it. The fitness committee went and explored it. One of our board members lives in Miami has seen it and has yet to see an issue like that. I think the issue right now- and this is just based on my observations- that people are just putting together these classes and kind of pulling together these pop-ups in this state of frenzy desperation because they don't have indoor space, and so it's looking like a more congested thing. I think if we show the public, if we give the community a place to go that it could be a little bit more self-controlled, the people will use it a little more differently. They'll use it like kids, use a playground, you know, they're taking, turns they're running around they're doing what they need to do. So that's what our hope is. We obviously can't control people's behavior. We certainly can't control somebody from running. You know a yoga class next to a circuit training thing, but we do want to avoid having people hanging ropes and monkey bars and stuff from public art. So we think this will be a way to alleviate the pressure of building a fitness class on the park somewhere. Can I just jump in here for one second- and this is not very- this is not about the proposal as much as it is about Alice Aycock, because that's actually, where we work out on the grass over there, not with any of that equipment just doing push-ups on the grass, but I put the photos of the people out so that nobody was to be identifying I promise I don't own any of that stuff, but I. But that's where we you know we sit there and do whatever, but I just I think that it would be worth having some other discussion and maybe not tonight, maybe it's another night, but about Alice, Aycock pavilion. It's I think that during the pandemic, it's obviously been used a lot, but sometimes like the grout. You can even see in the pictures the grass the use the garbage the dogs which is crazy to me, because the dog park's, like literally less than 100 feet away I just, would love to work with you guys on maybe just a way together that we can keep that space as special as it is. There's just a lot. There's a lot of it's really seen better days, I think and we're there every weekend kind of sitting out there and it's certainly you know it's definitely being used a lot. So, just as a side note would love to talk to you about that pavilion at some point and I don't want to cut anyone off so I'll be very generous and say: Craig Starr. Would you speak up please and keep your comments to a minimum, because we're going to hopefully hear them again in January I promise? Thank you. Yeah I couldn't find the raise my hand, button, I apologize for being so technologically incompetent I just wanted to answer a couple. Questions really quickly. I did an extensive walk up and down the esplanade and the rest of the committee. It we looked at this specific place and the north and south portion of Andrew Haswell, Green I, believe it's called I apologize if I have the wrong names, but it this really seems- and someone brought up, John Finley, doesn't make sense, it's not wide enough, and that actually was one of my initial thoughts and in regards to having a piece of equipment kind of like a course per se. It disrupts the sense of community that that's built with having one specific area that's put together so and also to answer I think it was Craig who brought it up about all these groups. That are, you, know, collaborate that are just kind of usurping space. That doesn't, you know, belongs to everyone. You know the park. Rules are that you do need a permit and it's not enforced because, for example, at John, Jay, Park I, don't know if they still have it there's a senior class and they have a permit- and you know I think it's great- that the seniors have that class and it's respected. Their time is dedicated to you, know, seniors again, I don't know if they still have it anymore, but if pep would enforce that which they don't I, see them and regarding all the other issues that I believe Tricia brought up dogs and so on, these issues are not enforced by pep and it just promotes it more. So you know those are difficult things, but that is the rule as I understand it from him talking to pep officers, reading the signs arts department and so on, yep talk to you in January. Thank you Jennifer. You have the last word before we get to Jennifer Stacy. Would you be sure to send this presentation to the community board tomorrow morning? Certainly, thank you. Jennifer I was just gonna address. Trisha's concerns just to tell you Trisha that we would love your support on this issue because actually Esplanade friends has been fielding. I can't even count the number of complaints suggestions beyond what you even mentioned beyond the garbage, and we've been working really closely with west who I saw was on the call earlier and with other members of the Parks Department actually, and that's actually why we've recently been engaged with municipal arts society again trying to just brainstorm on everything from signage to lighting we've offered to buy more garbage cans, our organization, you know all those kind of things to make Alice Acock and to really maintain it in the way that it should be maintained. You know the parks Department obviously does its best and Wes and all of the employees that work for him are really working double triple quadruple pandemic time, but it's really a used space now. So we'd love your support, ideas about how to move forward yeah. Maybe we can just put it on our agenda in January, since you guys are going to come back anyways for a joint 197a and just have it just be about Alice Aycock and talk about any way. We can support you. It's a good thing. People want to go there, but it. Oh. My god, it's just it's overwhelming to see, but one other one thing Trish not to interrupt you that we do have that's in the update category, because I do see it was listed as update is that we are planning a small seasonal decoration at Alice Aycock that people are going to be able to go and selfie themselves at. So it's going to be small, beautiful we're working with parks on it on getting approval for that and it'll be something fun that people can go do on their own pandemic style great to take photos great. Thank you very much. Thank you. All we're going to move the agenda to hear from the Parks District manager, Wes, Hamilton West. It's all yours, hey good evening tonight! Can everyone? Can you hear me? Let me turn down very clearly very good hold on one second how's that good. You hear me: okay, good well, good evening, everyone, I'm Wesley Hamilton the park manager for the district and just have a few brief updates. I, don't have a lot for you tonight, but thank you for coming out. First of all, on behalf of the Parks Department and myself, I hope everyone had a happy thanksgiving and we wish everyone a happy holidays and safe holidays upcoming. So moving forward with that, we hope everyone has a good time but be safe. A few updates, 24 sycamore park is on schedule and still in progress. One big update as well. We have a ribbon cutting planned at Carl's shirts for the playground. That's recently been opened that will be occurring on December. The 17th at 11 am most of our other projects that once they've been going through design phase they're going out to bid but they're waiting to go out to bid waiting on o and b. So we have a lot of projects that are starting to come out of the design phase, but they are waiting to go out to bid, and you know for Covid-19 reasons. Omb is waiting to see. You know what kind of funding we'll have moving forward. So there's been some delays on when it would go out to bid, so that remains the same as far as permits go permits. We're still only doing youth sports, but next week we will be approving adult sports on synthetic turf, not on natural turf, but I think we've only got one location in district, eight that would have applied to that and they do their own permits, which would be asphalt, green, but you'll be seeing that more and more as you go in the parks, you'll probably see in adult sports now, where we're finally allowing that to begin as far as other permits, special events, we're keeping them to small crowds, small groups, all these permits are subject to change based upon any Covid-19 restrictions, the small groups 25 and under. We also have first amendment right and religious reasons that the permits can be approved. For with that being said too we'll be seeing holiday, trees, Christmas trees and menorah lights. Those have been approved and you'll start seeing those be installed in the coming days. Still currently, the park usage is way up, which is causing a lot of increase in litter. Our crews are working diligently. Hopefully, as you see with the limited staff we have, we are still challenged with staff. Our budgets, you know shrinking and when our staff does go out of town or out of state, then they have to quarantine and our staff's been really doing well trying not to, but, as we all know, some things happen that you have to travel out of state. So we've been trying to work through those issues and continue moving forward cleaning the parts, but you know just a combination of more usage in the park and less staff to clean up so I hope everyone's patient with this. But please let us know if you have conditions we're still working on it, we're still cleaning it. Our crews are still out there doing our best and if you see anything that needs our attention, please let me know with that as well, as anybody has any questions for me. I'll try to answer as briefly as possible tonight. Good thinking, Wes oh hold on I got it now. I gotta turn my volume up so I. Look at the echo we've got two people. We've got Judy Schneider and Rita Popper Rita, please. This is just to tell you how great your crew is at Rupert Park. It was after a night of blustery winds that there was not an inch of sidewalk that was visible. It was that thick with leaves which were very slippery, and your crew is right there. They did an amazing job very quickly. It's very appreciated because several people who were going to church cross the street to walk on the other side of Second Avenue so that they would avoid this street because they were scared. So thank you very much and I will pass that, along to our crews, we're very fortunate to have our staff they're, one of our out of all the equipment we have and all the funding we have. Nothing can replace the staff that we have so they're very important to us, and we appreciate you taking notes well said we second Half, Judy and then Trisha and then maybe we'll adjourn go in West. Yes, Wes, though friends of the Esplanade showed us those things that do not belong at the pavilion. Is it possible. Your workers could remove those things that are dangling from the support for the Alice, a sculpture and also that rope that was tied to the chair and any other kind of workout equipment. That is not supposed to be there. Could your people remove that? Yes, I'm definitely I noticed that as well. I haven't seen that, but I will take a look at it and I don't know if it's my guys will be able to do it because I don't think my guys will be able to climb up the rope and cut it off and jump down, but we may those are some of the challenges that we have trying to, but we have staff that can do it. So I may have to call in the staff from a borough, so be patient with me, but we'll address that. Definitely what you didn't know when you weren't aware of this I didn't notice that when I was there and I'll check it out, sometimes you go and it's gone, and sometimes it's there. You know so we'll take a look at it and it shouldn't be there, and you know our regular staff. That does the cleaning removal of the litters, probably not gonna, be qualified to climb up the rope and remove that but I'll reach out to one of our teams that can maybe with the bucket truck or somebody has some equipment that can get there. The only other thing I'll point out is they didn't look like they were very secure and that looks like an accident waiting to happen and that's not something we want to see happen in one of our parks. Yeah no I agree, and you know they're not approved and they're not authorized and we'll remove them as soon as we can great. Thank you very much sure yeah wes I, just wanted to I forgot to mention this to you earlier so I was gonna say that the Carl, the New Capri playground, is incredible. It is incredible. It's my we take teddy there, my son there all every weekend and it's absolutely magical. There's a design issue that I wanted to bring to your attention. The hexagonal pavers that are in the toddler area that then go and lead to the sandbox are made of a material. That's extremely smooth. It's like it's very polished, concrete and I've seen every time we go there and we've been there for the last three weekends. I've seen a child slip because of the sand that goes on it so because the sandbox is at the other end, they drag the sand out and I saw one bloody lip one child who looked like he like completely fell on his weight on his leg and I also slept myself and so did Teddy it's. It feels like a design issue, it's just the material there and I'm wondering if you guys can take a look when I saw the last time and the kid had a bloody lip because he landed on it hard and he bit like bit his lip when he fell down face first, one of the parents was like, oh, like I. I've seen this has happened last time too and like they were kind of just commenting on saying that, like it's a very slick surface and it's that I, and so I'm wondering, if there's anything that you guys can do even to have somebody take a look out there. It's it just feels like it. Everything else is amazing and I love it and even the look of it looks great and I. Don't think that we like we approved the design and I'm and I love and I. Remember this unanimous approval and everything and everybody talking about it. We I mean I, don't think anybody of us were thinking about the interaction of sand with that slit that concrete, but it is an incredibly slick surface that makes for a really a bad slipping hazard, and this is anecdotal, but I've been in there every weekend, I've seen a kid fall, am I making sense. Yes, absolutely we'll take a look at it. I think the big issue and we've had it in other places is sand. So you know sand on top of any surface, can create a slip hazard, whether it's on a sidewalk or whether it's on hex blocks, yeah we'll try to look into it and you know see what we can do to try to address that I mean at John Jay. We have the sandbox too and like we're, also there a lot and it doesn't seem to have that same effect, just because I feel like it's a rougher textured, I'm wondering if there's anything that we can do to like almost scuff it up or something or rough it up that like that, where if, therefore it makes more friction and it doesn't detract from the aesthetic of it, it's still great, but it just there's some there's just somehow like the transition between this young toddler area and then to the sandbox and then the only surface in between is this like very slick surface, it's just, unfortunately like a weird thing that I wanted to flag for you guys. Well, thanks for bringing direct attention like I said, we'll take a look at it, we'll see what we can do, I'll talk with their engineers and our designers and our capital team yeah. We can do I'm if I mean I yeah, I'd love to see you on the 11th or the 17th or whatever date you mentioned, and I can point it out today to you then, but yeah, just let you know. Thank you. West, thank you Trisha. Thank you one and all for joining us this evening. I'm going to click off now with a happy holiday and a better 2021, see you again soon. Thank you.
