If, not Karen, I hope that you're able to carry on the team and represent the team from our neighbors in CB10 to talk about a project that they've been working on with regarding central park and the exonerated five.
Well I'd, like to thank you, everyone for this opportunity this evening to present our statement of objectives and goals to commemorate the exonerated five and their resilience and the need for social justice.
So with that I'd like to start with the presentation and answer questions at the end, So let me see if I can share my screen.
Mission of this exhibit would be to create an exhibition of a permanent parks and recreation educational commemoration inside of central park to honor the exonerated fight and the need for social justice.
We are proposing a commemorative permanent art piece cited in the northeast section of central park that celebrates the extraordinary diversity and history of our community while pointing to the city's aspirations for the future, and we seek to increase language around the spur of advocacy for social Justice reform, So it would be highly educational.
The resolution basically outlines the details of the event, the conviction of four of the youth as youth and one Corey wise as an adult, and it goes on to talk about the exoneration and all of the vetting that the parks and Recreation committee at Community, Board 10, has done so for five young boys who hail from the Harlem central Harlem area adjacent to the northern end of the park near 110th, Street, Central, Park roomed.
It fits a historical pattern of unjust arrests and wrongful convictions of black and latino young people in the United States, and we must understand the pattern to be able to channel the recently new found interest in the case into the necessary systemic reforms.
Mere, an impart commemoration will present a forum to raise conscience awareness around the need for social and criminal justice reform, a gross miscarriage of justice that forever brutally altered the lives of five young boys from the community, who formerly saw them the north end of central park as their backyard.
A turning a major turning point in our city's history, presenting a new narrative within the confines of the park, The location of the tragic event helps us all to collectively heal change, revisionist history and work towards change.
Audiences that we would like to reach would be the local area residents, of course, black and brown communities at the northern border of the park that have been generationally impacted by mass incarceration and the economic and social disparages that collectively affect them.
We would like to reach out to the 42 million visitors who visit central park each year, and our objective is to connect with the diverse local, national and international general public, The media.
We would all particularly like to reach out to the youth, engaging the youth community, teaching them about the scourge of wrongful convictions, about how racism defeats the presumption of innocence and help them to be engaged in social change in terms of desired.
We would also like for them to take away the fact that they have been educated or they will be educated about what led to the conviction and subsequent exoneration of the central part, five now known as the Exonet rated five, including the historical context about policing in New, York City at the time and the current status of policing.
We don't have anything definitive in terms of what the exhibit will look like, but we do have some ideas and would involve an art selection, process.
Also in terms of education, This exhibit could be linked to the to programs that already exist in central park monuments, as well, with the objective of raising awareness and sensitivity again to systemic and institutionalized patterns of racial injustice and need for reform.
We have support from many of our elected officials and community-based organizations, and so here we have listed the innocence, project, justice for the wrongfully incarcerated, New, York, theological, seminary, The NAACP.
On June 3rd of this year, Manhattan community board 10 unanimously passed a resolution in support of the installation of a permanent commemoration of the exonerated side and social justice reform to be located in New, York, City, Central, Park and then, As a result of our panel discussions, we garnered opinions and information on policies around policies and projects and how we would go about implement.
We understand that any proposal for an art installation must first be approved by city agencies that govern the property where the artwork will be cited, and so at this point we have already submitted to the New York City Department of Parks and Central Park Conservancy.
The screen share for a second, because I, don't like seeing myself over there, so you'll notice, everybody is muted, right.
The borough president has really embraced it and she saw it not just for CB10, but central park is just so critical and pivotal in the city that she really wanted it to be a resolution and a thought process and a space for all of Manhattan to come and think about the social justice changes and the way that we all can come together to make sure.
Well, I can't speak to any park outside of New York, but something that might approach this would be the Seneca Village project or exhibit, which is interactive using Barco Barcodes.
Yes, I like the idea, but we need to see exactly how it's going to be the exhibition.
We did discuss the fact that we would have to have an art selection, process, and you know we would take in information which would inform what that exhibit is going to look like so right.
I would hope that there'd be something along the lines of kind of a know, your rights section in teaching, youth and well, not only youth, but especially youth in how to confidently assert their rights in police interactions because with the Central Park five.
Think it's very important that somewhere, along the way, there's clear bullet points teaching youth about you know their right to counsel.
You know their right to remain silent, basic civics education, And. There's a lot of groups out there that do that kind of work like the Marshall, Brennan, Constitutional, literacy, project, There's, also street law.
There is advocacy around knowing your rights and this center that we would like to have in conjunction with the exhibit would deal with those issues we also as a result of working with Sarah Burns.
It sounds like the idea of the interactive I think is really great.
My concern was: Is that it's at the north end of the park and will enough people see it, but I, see you tying in with the city of New York that does get different people looking.
I think we all know, especially after the monumental women's statue, and that wasn't a not to use a corny pun again, but it wasn't a walk in the park to get that done, and.
Too, and I would love our board to show support early even before the plans are fully realized, because I think, if we can, if all the community boards can maybe present a unified front, we can hopefully speed up the process.
We have letters of support, Can I also just say: if it's going to go before Pdc. Is, there a likelihood that if it goes before the Public, Design commission we'd probably be approving it again.
Thank, you very much for a very thorough and thoughtful presentation really appreciated and by the way, I've had the opportunity to attend your community board meetings.
And I am fully aware as to what happened and following up the remarks that Suzanne made earlier, which is that something like this would be helpful in bringing people into the park to reflect on what happened, And I think that they should.
And, so I want to echo my Fellow board members to say that I very much support a letter of support or resolution, but I can not think of any other vote.
There been any work done or collaboration with the board of education in terms of New, York, City, Public schools, adding social justice to the curriculums to their curriculums or to find ways to encourage field.
Look at for your dedication and your exuberance about it, and thank you to Trisha and Barry, and all of the committee and board members who have spoken out in support of this I.
That's what the committee wants, but it's always I, think to work together in pursuit of a shared goal.
I think it's important to have all levels and types of New York City history on display to use the park in as many ways as possible and to provide as many different types of information as available to people with inquiring, minds.
You guys are planning on once, It gets a little bit further along once you have a design once you have a plan of action where you're going to be, and if you're planning on then coming back again for resolutions, but I know that I want us to I, want our board to I.
We are planning once we get information in terms of next steps from Central Park Conservancy in New, York, City parks, Then we can come back with more information and let you know we will be holding subcommittee meetings at that point as well.
I think that this is a really pretty clear-cut example of how we can be better and just on the right side of things when it comes to our parks and how we use our perks and how we use as an education tool and what access means and what welcome being welcoming means and kind of repairing past damages that are done.
We touch the park, so our vote is mandated as well as speaking out in favor of the issues that the project represents and if we are doing a resolution, though, if we could have the presentation to make available to the rest of the board in advance of the full board meeting in a couple of weeks, that would be really helpful for people who are interested in the vision behind it.
And I know that everybody will get the presentation, but I would love for us to be able to talk about this in our full board meeting and bring it to a full vote.
I was also I was going to propose a resolution because of what everyone said, but especially the fact that at the bottom of a resolution it says how many people were in support, And I, think that carries weight, that a letter might not have, and if we can tell anything from this meeting, everyone seems to be very highly supportive.
10's resolution is that C Cv 10 supports the installation of a permanent exhibit to commemorate the exonerated five to be located in New, York, City, Central, Park, and that's it.
I agree I mean, whereas, as we have this presentation and the importance of it and how our, whereas our community board, wants to do more support for equity in parks, I think that those that's where we can have it, but basically we don't want to rewrite the resolution.
We want our own resolution that says community board a supports.
We've got strong support from the community, both in person and online close to 500 signatures on our petition, 80 likes on social media posts and Jaina Alexandra's, a grad student at Columbia, University, School, Journal journalism and approached us after seeing our petition she's writing an article about outdoor fitness during the pandemic and currently she's interviewing people about this concept and with her professor's approval will publish her article on NYC, nycreopens.com, Columbia's, newest publication, dedicated to life in and after the pandemic.
Our first vendor is called landscape structures, it's an employee-owned business and they do extensive work in New, York, City, The picture you're looking at is of Astoria park and the equipment and setup is pretty straightforward and easily recognized as gym equipment.
The construction is one of the few parks that is back in construction now so and that this rendering that you presented is not the latest rendering of what phase 2b will look like there's a more recent rendering on the 197a website at the community board site that you could look at and Stacy.
I was co-chair of the 197a committee when we did it so, and the third thing I wanted to say is: Although we have no funding for it, we did have a joint 197a parks committee presentation over a year a half ago for the building inside underneath the pavilion which the former sanitation building, and that was meant to have this kind of equipment in it.
You know not just throughout the city, but literally throughout the country and the world, and with the pandemic, as Stacy mentioned, The time seems actually perfect for fitness equipment.
I think Stacy's presentation shows it is the head of design for the New York City Parks Department, who is actually a resident of the area, Nancy Prince and.
It was at her suggestion as well that we're coming to the community board just to you know, talk about it really and say that it's something that we're really working hard, on.
I think it reminds me of the dispute over outdoor fitness equipment at John, Jay, Park.
And I think this is exactly a right time to be reimagining, New, York city in so many areas, outdoor fitness, equipment, hadn't, occurred to me, but this makes a lot of sense and if we could just engage the city engage all areas.
You know with the park there and everything, and it's quite wide is that something that was thought of that's a great question.
Looking for spots and I, think that this being that it was a new spot, you know and does have even more width than John Finley walk.
Eight meeting I think you know just as I said a couple of months ago, but this seemed like because it's new it seemed like the right place and because there's so much space, we had.
So, yes, we thought of other locations and I will tell you that community board 11 just unrelated to this, has been asking for fitness equipment on the waterfront and unfortunately, We would absolutely, as a group, love to support that there.
They've asked you know, can't you find a spot that you would support in community board 11, but right now we just have to like literally support the esplanade there.
They all have approval to work in New York City, but we just wanted to give you an idea of what we're looking at and the different types of vendors that the different types of equipment that could be out there, so that aesthetically, it may look one way.
I, want to know how, if you were to build out a site where you have all the equipment centered in a single location, how you could allow the general public to be able to use it where you're not going to have these organized classes and personal trainers, have groups of people there and essentially dominate it so that others can't use it.
I think if we show the public, if we give the community a place to go that it could be a little bit more self-controlled, the people will use it a little more differently, They'll use it like kids, use a playground, you know, they're taking, turns they're running around.
You can even see in the pictures the grass the use the garbage the dogs which is crazy to me, because the dog park's, like literally less than 100 feet away, I just, would love to work with you guys on maybe just a way together that we can keep that space as special as it is.
