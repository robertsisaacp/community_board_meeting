But if it's your first time at one of our community board aid, zoom meetings, we just want to let you know how the meeting works.
Yeah, we would potentially have a sidewalk Do. We have anyone from the public, Just remind everybody who came in late that we will call on you by using the raised hand, feature at the bottom of your hand at the bottom of your screen in the participants menu, so just open , I think I had to make understatement first, that the community will indeed myself.
He has to figure out something, because otherwise the Department of Health will be against this restaurant to demonstrate that actually, the capacity that they established is, according with the co or the letter of no objection, It, probably I, should say this falls from DOV that they should be put the number of our people for that facility.
My point of view is this applicant issued a start working hard or working with somebody, else, work with SBS or any other institution to help them to establish the number of occupants inside of the of the venue, and that is not only the problem for him is for everybody, else.
In that case, I would say it sounds like we have a motion to approve second.
Very nice, restaurant folks in the neighborhood know her no issues with the way she runs her business, but she does have to move.
You know early hours, closing at 10 pm every night same menu, same staff, same people, same name, same everything, it's just same neighborhood, it's just.
That, will be very helpful, even though that DOV, I do not think it's going to allow to do that, but try it because sooner or later, you're going to face the same problem as the other application.
He's, a longtime member of our community And he's opening up another nice restaurant, which he'll tell you about later thanks, Max. Do we have the representative for 1626 restaurant Gda, who's, Jack, Robert?
This is an on- premise: liquor license application for 1626 llc, doing business as who's Jack W we're located 1626, 2nd Avenue between 84th and 85th street , we'll be a full- service, restaurant serving American cuisine.
If you have any questions, I will go to the public, but I actually have one quick question, and can you tell us about the transition from the prior establishment to this application?
We have approval second, so this will go down as a motion to approve, unless someone raise their hand to say no, not voting for cause or abstaining.
I think we are the only restaurant in on second avenue.
Yes, I'd like to ask a question how many people, or how many chairs you are planning to have in that Pacific right.
If you do not know who the people are, who are going to replace that the existing officers they sh that may peruse the actual application they should be listed in the application, even if they are not Yeah, even if they are not present on the call if they are listed on the application?
Okay, I will second it, although even I know Russell raised his hand.
What we have decided to do is that we're going to have a joint session with street life, small business and transportation to take up this issue and identify how we can be supportive of restaurants and figure out a good way to be able to mitigate the issues that were experienced, especially in this time of Covid-19.
Do I have any other hands for emotion to Adjourn or Any. Other motion russell one second, Russell and Elita said to tell you thank you for that.
