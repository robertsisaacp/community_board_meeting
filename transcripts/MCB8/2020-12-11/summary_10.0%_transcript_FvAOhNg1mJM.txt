I want to welcome you to the December meeting of the small Business committee.
Yes, Exactly so, I appreciate everyone joining in, As everyone, knows, small business, is a very hot issue in our community.
Second thing I want to do is introduce my new co-chair, who is Elita, Camp and well known to everyone, as the current president of the community board, soon to be at the end of her term, and she has graciously.
So without further ado, I want to go to tonight's featured speaker, who is Julie, Blenbaum, Mark Beachy and a member of our community who started a an effort, called save our stores.
And I know that this pandemic has, you know, hit New, York, City quite hard and small businesses.
And I was just looking to the left and looking to the right and just empty storefront after empty storefront, and it really broke my heart, and you know one of the things that really made me think twice.
Are people, like me, responsible who have you know, really come to rely on online purchases, especially in a time of pandemic, when we're so averse to actually going into stores, and.
So I said, someone's got to do something about this, and basically, What came out of it was an idea to really start initiative to change, hearts and minds around the neighborhood and to really make people aware of not just the closures but of the fact that we have an obligation as a community and an opportunity to really support our neighbors, especially as the holiday season and all the shopping that comes along with it begins, and so the way this idea manifested itself we've called it shop, Ues, Shop, Upper, East, side save our stores is really in a couple.
It's, both a directory for Upper, East, side, small businesses, and we list everything from jewelry stores to housewares to clothing.
You can imagine, and the idea is both to be a resource both to give people an opportunity to peruse, What's actually here in the neighborhood, to provide phone numbers for them to provide links, because a lot of these stores actually provide online opportunities as well and to really give them the inspiration as they head into the holiday shopping season and the access.
You know providing that resource for people to actually see what's available and see just the tremendous variety of stores in our neighborhood.
You know, inspire our neighbors and give them ideas of holiday shopping opportunities in the neighborhood and places to actually buy their toys and also have them.
You know one of the things that I think people don't realize.
That far sports has closed, and you know the people there are phenomenal and they're happy to work with you via phone text or anything else, So I, texted, Kathy and Mary Arnold, Toys.
So people need to know that not just online are there opportunities, but there are also store owners and staff members who are delighted to help.
One, more thing, I should add, is we'll see how successful this is, but we actually to I, together with some high schoolers at Ramaz, has started distributing decals for stores to put on their doors or windows for the holiday season.
Almost there there's light at the end of the tunnel, but it's going to be a long hard winter and many small businesses like myself.
I just have a question that ties into something this committee has talked about in the past, which is trying to find ways to support women and minority owned businesses in our community.
Look, we, You know and I want to support all small businesses, but I think we recognize.
It's got 40,000 moms, half of whom used to live on the Upper, East side, half of whom still live on the emperor's side, but we found that, in addition to the minority and women-owned businesses that actually have store fronts, which is where we have really focused our efforts over the last month since we've.
Don't know, if you call them local artisans, but people who have businesses that they've started in their homes on the Upper East side, making everything from jewelry to mass change, which masked chains which are all the rage, these days, and so a couple things that I would actually love to do a of course help you, with whatever the committee pursues b.
I, We really welcome your input and help on it as well, because I know it's actually a very small world of local business owners in the neighborhood.
I think the campaign is great, I actually read about it in an east Midtown newsletter and started following you on social media.
Obviously, but I think you know, maybe just adding a some kind of marker would be nice or just dedicating a special social post that says hey in addition to all the great businesses we've already mentioned, you know, did you know these are mom owned or women-owned, or you know something like that, but.
I. Think at this point, small businesses will take all the help and all the extra posts we can get so I really appreciate it.
You know to interact with the New York or Madison Avenue Sales associate means so much so to actually utilize the staff that they have.
Math, That's a very interesting point and we can touch base afterwards, but one of the vendors who actually does those videos or does that 3D Photography reached out to me and was very happy to work with Upper East side stores and give them a very significant discount in doing that.
Other thing, I'm wondering if this was something you might have an interest in for the upcoming holidays for people who don't have children, Maybe the idea of supporting a store buying a toy for a not-for-profit like toys for tots or some of those.
This was a few years, ago, I think when I first became chair before I got really busy with it was working with the hospitals who are willing to give discounts that we were talking.
A lot about food places, but also for things like home, decoration or clothing stores that were up near the hospitals for the staff, the families of patients or faculty members that if and they were willing to promote them in a way so that they give information, to.
Packets, like welcome packets, for people who are going to be patients there and their families, but they also have the doctors, certainly I, think have a healthy income and the staff, And so the idea of providing a discount for places in the neighborhood and promoting them would work for the hospital, because staff would have an easy place and it would bed.
So, the idea of interacting between the businesses and the hospital it's kind of a built-in market, and also it provides a benefit to the stores and to the people.
And, I, said: I love that idea, Even if it's just you know financial contributions to the effort for toys to be purchased from our local stores, so I love.
Also I had started talking to some because it worked up in community board 11, which is just to the north, where some people put money together and were able to get small businesses to provide food to the hospital workers, and so that was something that I was also working on and the smaller businesses I know.
As, the saying goes, so they it was hard to find a hospital that coordinated with the food, but I'm sure that now his numbers are ratcheting up or just opportunities for people who want to do some good and help small businesses at the same time.
Secondly, We encourage people to help spread the word on social media, so whether you're on Facebook or on Instagram, encouraging both your friends and family to help our local businesses that are struggling in the pandemic.
You know, please remember our small businesses and do your best to shop local.
You know these are things we're happy to work with community board eight and the people on this call to try to you know, make happen and I offer myself as a contact person, if there's anything that we could work on together to let the city know that you know it's not just you guys by yourselves, and it's not just us by ourselves.
You know, we've seen a lot of businesses close up here in east Harlem.
That's all the more reason, I think to really think about Julie's program and how we can you know, support these businesses without walking into the stores as best we can, and that goes to even with the restaurants trying to order direct without going through a service that takes more money off the top try to fi when you're looking on the internet.
I mean: Can you tell do those orders come in a different way, or does the restaurant really not have any way of knowing no.
It gets rooted, and then they charge you the tax on the back anyway, but they had a good point as far as sales tax and any other thing and little license renewal that the state could really help small businesses.
I wonder if people are just going to reach for local stores or call Amazon get.
You know more able to pass that along to their customer than these small businesses that are struggling for every dollar.
I'm, happy to and Elita as well any topics that people want to discuss and try to put small businesses.
And I've kind of reached out to other small businesses that I know or that I've been to with my daughter or that serve a like demographic, but I, think networking or sharing ideas or any way, even maybe working.
Now, that Julie's kind of creating a list of sorts I think any way to kind of put people in touch with each other, whether it's that they happen to be on a call like this.
About, you know make it desirable to be a small business on the Upper East side.
A sense of community is really important to that and knowing the people behind the businesses that you spend money at or that you really like.
I mean I, read your newsletter and all of that stuff, but any way that you think of kind of connecting the dots or putting people in touch with each other, Or I, don't know anything along those lines.
And well I mean do you think that should be like.
I mean you know, like you, said, you're, completely stressed out trying to keep your business open and these events that we have at unite.
And we're trying to figure out how to make this useful for the small businesses as well I mean one of the things I was thinking.
But, I mean, as opposed to an evening meeting I, don't know the small Business Committee Valerie.
But if you're looking to make contact with local representation, I think the bids and the block associations would be a good idea to bring them into a meeting.
I, Don't know how an early morning 8:30 meeting would be for businesses.
I, don't think the kinds of local businesses we're talking about necessarily can't make a meeting at say seven o'clock at night, but that's up to you, I.
I can tell you that morning, meetings usually work the best for small business owners before they open their stores, and whenever we had breakfast meetings, we got a much larger turnout.
So, I, think that, Even though most of the community board meetings are at night, particularly under Covid-19 scenarios, where people are working from home.
We all know how important small businesses are.
