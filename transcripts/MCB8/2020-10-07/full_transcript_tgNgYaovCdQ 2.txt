My craig, you can unmute any time, I'm unmuted. How are you will good? Did you have any problem getting on to the meeting? No okay, good? It's just I'm used to a bigger crowd, for I guess everybody wants to set aside their day to watch the debate. Well. That is why the agenda is somewhat limited tonight. I wanted to make sure that we were done well before nine o'clock, that, in the cancellation of the 68th street presentation that we were originally anticipating, yeah, you saw the article today I did sorry I meant to send it to you but felice. Can you tell me what the problem was getting on tonight? Sure it was just. It seemed like it was not connecting to zoom and it was hung up a little and there's a little bit of of a delay. So maybe other people are having some issues, I hope not, but that would make sense. Thank you, though, you're welcome. Well did you. I know you said in an email that you were going to you're, expecting a constituent question that marcus should be prepared to answer correct. That's separate from the one that was asked a few weeks ago regarding house with disabilities, get on a bus, yes, very different from that one. Okay and I relate it to marcus, so he is prepared to discuss it. I do want to flag for you that I, the person who first brought this 75th street item so item two on the agenda emailed me today and said: he's not able to make it. So we may not have somebody to speak on that item. Okay and I'm still trying to confirm whether the embassy has definitely moved or not. I know that I could not find any mention of it on their website. However, when I swung by the building this week, the plaque denoting it as the embassy is still on the building front. I see there's chuck and there's marcus, okay unmuted. Can you hear me? Yes, sir? Okay, so are we ready to start really quickly? I wanna somebody has their hand up, and I want to find out who they are phone number ending with eight to two. You have your hand up. Will you unmute with Star six and just let me know why you have your hand up phone number, eight, two ending with eight two. Is that Betty hi? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, okay? No, I think that was me. I did I'm obsessed and now I should go one star nine two to do what nope you just I just Wanna, make sure you did not need anything before yeah just stay on your you'll star, nine, whenever you're ready to raise your hand for a question after they start. Thank you. Thank you. Of course, are we ready to get started? Yes, okay, I'd like to welcome everyone to the October meeting of the transportation Committee of the Community Board, eight, I'm Chuck Warren co-, chair of the committee and craig later, my other co- chair nice to see nice to see everyone sort of, and our first item on. The agenda is New York, City, Transit, General Updates on bus and subway service, and we should have marcus book here from the MTA New York, City, Transit and marcus. Are you here I am here? Can you hear me? Yes, we can now hear you when you're, okay, so good evening, everybody, how is everybody you're unmuted and you can take it away. Thank you, nice to see you nice to see you too chuck. So I'm just going to give you a general kind of update away on where we stand where the MTA stands right now in this October 2020 the year of Code. So currently right now, the MTA is experiencing about 2 million 200 million in revenue losses every week. So that's 200 million dollars in lost revenue every week and these declines have are compounded by the loss of state and local taxes and subsidies that support the organization and has left the MTA with a 16 billion dollar projected deficit through 2024.. So the bottom line is that the MTA needs about 12 billion dollars in emergency federal aid to make it through 2021, so that 12 billion dollars will sustain us through 2021, and we need that 12 billion dollars, because without that funding, we're going to be forced to reduce service up to 50 percent, lay off about 8 000 workers, and it will cause us to gut our historic 51.5 billion dollar capital plan. These devastating cuts would also cost the region over 350 000 jobs and nearly 100 billion in economic activity in 2021., so in September, September 17th they're about MTA, chairman and CEO Patrick Freud sent a series of letters to the mta's 11 largest suppliers of train parts, bus parts, bus and car and train manufacturers and warned them that without an immediate injection of that 12 billion dollars in federal aid, all current and future contracts with companies, all the way from kentucky California are going to be in jeopardy. So since 2011, the MTA has created about as many as a hundred thousand out of state jobs in nearly all 50 states and the MTA capital expenditures are among the nation's largest drivers of economic activity, generating nearly 50 billion dollars in infrastructure investment nationwide. So that's where we stand pretty dire, pretty critical and we are in need of that. 12 million dollars in in federal aid, which you know as you can all read, is not really forthcoming and we're not sure when and how that's going to transpire. But right now we are operating fully with existing with its existing funds to take us through the end of the year. But that's where that's, where things get critical, so that's an overview of where we stand at the authority right now. I'm also here to prepare to answer questions about anything from Omni to the metrocard, mobile sales, buses and vans, and anything else that you guys would like me to talk about. I just want to just make a plug, because we have been over the last few months doing what we call a mask force, and this is basically getting elected officials. Our staff at the MTA staff, from local elected officials, offices and community organizations to help us assist in handing out mass because we are seeking to get 100 compliance in mass use, mass usage on subways and buses and we're doing rather well we're in the high 90s and just recently following our governor cuomo's announcement that there would be fifty dollar fines for those who refuse to wear a mask in the subway or a bus. Just so you know to date, we've given about 16 summonses for six summonses through Tuesday over 16 days, but of the about 500 100 interactions with people, meaning walking up to a person and asking them to please comply with the mask rule. Most of those people are complying. If you refuse to wear a mask, then you should probably stay home and not use the subway system with a bus system and we've given out thousands and thousands of mass, and if someone does not have a mask and they're in the subway system or bus system, all they need to do is ask for one and they'll be given one. So our position is not to give out fines to people. We hold that as a last resort measure, but we're looking for a hundred percent compliance with mass usage in the system. So those are my opening opening statements. I would say that I can just open it up to questions now. Well, I was going to say hi mark this is Craig. I was going to suggest that maybe we just address a few of the questions that some of our constituents had sent to us that we have already forwarded to you, hopefully addressing some of the questions that may be asked tonight. If that's okay, I know that we had sent you a few questions just regarding Omni and the status of it, and some questions specific to how seniors or those who are using, reduce spare metro cards will be able to use Omni and, if they're able to use omni immediately or if there's going to be a lag in the time until they will be able to use it. If you can just answer, okay, no problem. So, let's just say: if a constituent is concerned about whether or not his or her reduced fair senior car senior metrocard would stop working with the implementation of Omni. I assure you that we will continue to accept reduce fair metro cards until they have all been replaced with a comparable contactless fare card that works with the new army system. So right now we're outfitting the system and all 151 Manhattan subway stations and all 800 plus Manhattan buses are completely outfitted with Omni contactless equipment. So, yes, you will be able to continue to use your reduce fare, Metro card that you are in possession of now until we have a comparable, contactless fare card that works with the new army system. Now the question would come second, when our plans for to have that type of senior metro card that is contactless. We do plan to have that. But we ask that you manage your expectations. It will likely take a couple of years to swap out all of the existing inventory that we have of reduced fare metric cards with compatible reduced fair army cards. So you can continue to use your metro card until all of that is completed. Another question that people ask is: can this a senior metrocard be used until Omni is fully operational, which is currently planned for 2023, and that is correct? Reduced fare Metro cards will continue to be accepted until all reduce fair metric cards have been replaced with a comparable contactless card that works with Omni. So basically the long answer is you can use the card until we've got everything up and running all right. Thank you for that, and anyone who has follow- up questions feel free to ask when we get to the general public's opportunity to ask questions. The other question we received had to do with the role of bus operators and how they are, how they're supposed to assist passengers who need assistance getting on buses such as those in wheelchairs and how Covid-19 plays into that. So please respond to that question. So this one. This one is a bit tricky, but the bottom line is that if a person requests assistance with a wheelchair or walker to board the bus, the driver is obliged to assist them. Assist that person I mean that's just common sense, and if someone needs assistance, we should be providing assistance. That being said, the passenger in a wheelchair or a walker, because we have the drop- down gate that comes down onto the sidewalk. They should first enter the bus, okay, the driver's locked into his compartment into the bus, and then, if they need assistance with securing themselves in the bus, then the driver will come out of his out of his driving position and assist them. Will there be a situation where someone is Trigger shy about assisting someone because of their safety? That's a possibility. I would only ask that if that situation occurs again, I started this out by saying that if assistance is requested, the driver should assist the passenger, but if that driver does not assist the passenger, then just like any other, you know non- compliant misbehavior. I would just ask you to just you know, note the date time and the bus number and we can find out what the problem was with that driver and why they chose not to assist the passenger all right and then the other final question. I had before we pass it along to the public is in regards to one of the items that we were going to have today that had to be postponed, and that is the 68th Street subway station, the ADA access and I received some questions and there was an article that was in the city today about the providing a little bit of an update. Can you just briefly provide a little update as to when a presentation could be expected and where we stand right now, all right, so we were going like the gentleman just said. We were going to present this to community board this evening, but there is still some open issues that need to be worked out and we have to do some final submittals to the fta before we can go to the public with this, but essentially, as the article outlined it's about taking the elevator. When we presented this to you guys in the past, the elevator was underneath the underneath, the inside the property line of the hunter college entrance on the South East corner. So, to avoid a lot of complications associated with installing an elevator there, we're proposing to move that elevator across the street to the northeast corner and that will solve a lot of problems and there would be a potentially a bump out to get it away from the building and a reconfiguring of the stairwell in that corner. But, like I said, those details will be outlined in a presentation which we anticipate to be able to give to you guys before the end of the year, all right great, and we look forward to that before we before we turn to the public. I just want to recognize. We have a new person, that's joined the staff of our board office and it's Max Vanderfleet and we there's Max waving and we want to welcome Max, helping us in the committee and helping will in general, so welcome Max. Thank you very much. Welcome our tradition. Is we recognize members of the public first and if there are any members of the public who would like to speak, please raise your hand. You have the raise hand if you're on zoom, you have the raise hand icon there, and you should to show that and well. I do not know. Sometimes I have a list, but it does not get everybody here, so maybe you can see any and if you're on the phone, it's star nine, to raise your hand- and I see Betty Cooper Wallerstein has raised her hand- okay, well Betty. Why do not you unmute Betty and let's hear from Betty hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Thank you so much marcus for your being here and giving us so much information. I do want to tell you that I have noticed on the first Avenue 72nd and 79th and the 31. The drivers have been unusually assisted and very nice about assisting people who needed to have a little help with wheelchairs, or they really have been wonderful and even before everyone was allowed to go in the front. Those people who were in wheelchairs were allowed to come in through the front door, so they really have been excellent about that. However, I was concerned because at first I was very happy that not the not the bus, but the truck was starting last month and the one that comes to 79th on wednesdays is was usually in. The past was here from 11 30 to 1 30, and then I think it goes to 72nd street. Last week there was a line all the way around the block. They came a little bit. I think it's a different time now. I think it's 10 o'clock, but they were there only an hour but and- and I actually was in line- but it was by the time it was. I was coming up- they had left, but- but I did not know until this morning that, because you did say that the reduced fear cards are good until such time as the other plan is in effect, but they did not. People were waiting to put money on their cards. The seniors were told by the person in the truck that they had to go to the subway stations in order to get money put onto the cards, so they had their senior cards. They just over the course of time did not have the funds on them. So is that- and that was again said today, so what happens with that? Because, obviously they ca not do the stairs to go to this to the desk. You know the information booth in the subway stations, hello. I do not know muted if we could unmute marcus. Oh of course craig did I get my did you hear me? Yes, we heard you, oh okay, hi Betty. How are you I'm good, I'm so happy to hear your voice and hear what you have to say: okay, so betty right now with the Metrocard mobile sales vans, we are sort of continuing with covert protocols as such until further notice. Those vans will not be handling any cash or credit or debit card transactions. They will, however, be able to transfer value from one card to another, which was a big ask of a lot of folks prior to us, bringing it back. So what I anticipate is that, slowly but surely, depending of course on how things go with the city, and you know the pandemic, we have to sort of change protocols. We've got a lot of unions, lots of different people, we lost over a hundred, some are people to covert 19, so there's a lot of safety protocols in place, so that prevents us from currently as a policy handling any cash or credit card transactions. So that means that if you go to the van they wo not be able to, you know, take money and put value on the card right now. The way that you can do that is, and they said to go to the subway station, because there are vending machines there that a person can do that at that at those locations there are some station booths in the subway that are also making reduced fare, Metro car transactions. They are not making cash trans transactions, however, and those are very limited and they were just announced like this week. So this is a this is a work in progress. This is a difficult thing for our staff to be involved in a pandemic situation operating in small quarters in a van and dealing with transactions face to face. So this is developing so in small stages. The only thing that I can really say about this- and I do not know about internet access, but we have a page on our website that has the latest information things change you know week to week. So if you can stay in touch with our metrocard, reduce fare transaction portion in the website, that'll keep you up to date as to where we are, but as of right now, those vans are not accepting, can not make the transaction that you mentioned. Well marcus and it's really important. There are two people in the truck and- and it really is a truck but they're- two people they're two people, instead of telling the seniors that they ca not put, and there were some who were not seniors that they ca not put funds any money on the cards. They should certainly tell them that they, however, can apply to get the new you know to so that they can. You know, be on the list when things are changed. Nothing was said to that effect, so that's number one that if they're there, they should be able to also take people who want to make a change of card, and they should tell them that not just to say that we ca not add any funding to the to your cards. And secondly, the other thing is that that, as far as going to subway stations, the ones that do have it they ca not do that. Now we have the seniors are terribly dependent upon the buses, and so we have to try to figure out some way for them to be able to use the bus service in the meantime. So what do you suggest that we can do because now there's going to be another month's, wait another two weeks wait until they come. I mean if the next time that they're coming, which is going to be you know in about two or three weeks. If they are prepared to take, you know people's registration to change their card, then that would accomplish something. It still does not help them using the card. Now you know being able to use now when the when the and I'm not familiar with the Omni plan. So well, then, when that new card comes by 2023, will that now continue to be a reduced fare for seniors? Or will it not be? No, it would be. It would continue to be reducing yeah. Well, we have to figure out a way that people will be able to get to use the buses which they need to go back and forth for their medical appointments and for other needs as they go out, so that that's an issue understood- and I just want you to know that they are currently working really hard to try to figure out how to make that happen, so that we can both ensure that seniors can use the bus and, at the same time ensure that our employees are safe. Okay, so what I will do is I will take back your feedback about how the attendants in the vans are communicating with the public and let them know that it's possible that they need to get some more training on how to share information so that people are leave that experience with some knowledge, that's useful to them, and we also have to get that information that the time has changed too, because we did not know that Betty. I wish I wish that we can get to get that information out sooner, but I think you know we're in a situation we're fortunate to have them out there at all. Really to be honest with you, okay now the last question I have has to do with people not wanting to wear masks, and I just wanted to know. I heard what you were saying. I have not noticed any I'm not traveling that much, but the one I have been on. I've noticed that most people have masks, but if someone does not have a mask- and you say that masks are available to be given and they do not want to, then they should not be able to enter the bus. So is that the way it's working, because it was not working that way before, because nobody wants to start a fight and have a problem. But someone who says I do not want to wear a mask was able to get on a bus that I was on and everybody on the bus spoke to that person about the fact that he should wear a mask or walk but but anyway. So where does that stand? The person does not have a mask he's offered one you said by the driver and he does not want it. So what happens? Well, I mean you know again, so this is a situation where the driver would make a judgment call. He would either not move that bus and leave it and try to alert a police officer to have the person removed from the bus. That driver can not and should not act as a policeman, and you know attempt to force in any way that person to use the mask. So I mean again, you know this is one of the things there are thousands of buses in the subways in the system and it's impossible to have an eagle team member on every bus. It's impossible to have. You know police officers on every train, but if they are and someone can alert a law enforcement personnel, of course, that person can be asked to either go on the mask or leave the bus now. Is there a sign, I'm Sorry Marcus? Is there a sign, because sometimes that helps there are a lot of signs on the buses? Now, but is there a? Is there a sign that said, you must wear a mask so at least there's something that people see before they even get on or see it when they get on. I do not know. Are there signs? Yes, not only that the buses should be, and I do not know if you've heard it, we had to temporarily suspend it because at one point the message was being voiced over by Rosie, Perez and believe it or not. People had something to say about that. So in the days coming, you're going to hear messages again on the buses. That say, you know essentially keep your fellow passengers safe and please make ensure that you're wearing a mask while you're on our system, so there'll be in addition to the signings there'll, also be announcements made on the bus. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Anyone else from the public will do you see anybody else, no, not from the public. You have two board members who have their hands up Laurie right, we've got, I see Laurie and Michelle. So why do not we end you laurie? She was first so lori Boris or you just have to confirm on muting, okay, perfect. We can hear you. Thank you. Thank you, marcus for the update, which was very useful, and I appreciate it and I'm totally puzzled by anyone would be offended by Rosie, Perez and I'd love to hear that story. But that's not my question. My question is just picking up on what the last speaker said is on the the issue of purchasing on the buses. Why is not it possible for for to have one of those machines, but even to have like a laptop like? Would not it be a possible for someone to even stand outside of the bus? Maybe the second person or whatever could stand outside with a laptop and just take credit cards. I mean because most people have a credit card and if they wear gloves you know I do not see what the problem is. I mean many businesses have done that they've adapted this. You know like touchless, you know they do not even have to touch the credit card. They, just you know, put the laptop in front of people and they do it. You know like it's. Essentially it's a touchless system without you know a lot of a lot of effort. Why ca? Not that be done? Okay, so the truth. Is that sure that can be done, that the infrastructure for that just does not exist, and so I know exactly what you're talking about it's a compact handheld. It's a tablet right and what would you do? I mean I think that they're working through all those kinks and they have not gotten there yet? Okay, so would you do that for the m15, but you'd have to do that everywhere? Okay, you ca, not provide a service. No I'm sorry! You misunderstand what I'm saying: I'm not talking about an individual buses, I'm talking about the fair collection buses. You know the buses that Betty was talking about that come around once a month and she's saying that they ca not get. They ca, not refill their half price they're working they're working through that they have not gotten there. Yet. Those are great suggestions and I think those are applicable if they can be applied within the context of our system and our unions and all that and all that stuff we're working through all of that yeah able to get to the point where it's possible, for you guys to be able to make these transactions okay. I know that it's that that seniors and other half- price riders are not necessarily at the top of the list. However, they are a great number of people who use the system, and I really think that an extra push should be made to make it possible for them to continue to use the system. Okay, all right! Thank you. Thank you. Laurie next is Michelle Bernie Mom again. Thank you thanks, marcus, very much for being here. Am I misinformed to think that there is a prepaid way to load your card, that, if you can do this by mail by sending in your credit card and whatever form necessary to the MTA and they automatically keep it replenished, is not that this is that a system that is a system I would I have not. I do not have the website up in front of me, but I think that might be an option. I would certainly check the website and look into that. I ca not well I've been doing that for years and to me that's the most efficient thing to do. You set a certain limit on the card and there's an automatic refill so that your card, your is never empty and you can put as little as 20 on it or 50. You know whatever you want, but to me and that to me has been a convenience all the years, but certainly during these times that takes any transaction out of the realm of the public. There's zero contact with anybody for that. So, if you're feeling that information is not widely spread, maybe that could be part of your. You know public announcements or your signs in the bus to say, go to this website and put your credit card on and get automatic renewals. You know whatever the department thinks is correct as a way of pushing that. But to me that's that makes the most sense. You do not need additional devices. You do not need a new program, it's in place, you just have to advertise it, so people use it understood, that's a fantastic suggestion, Michelle and as part of my feedback tomorrow, when I, when I talk about what we discussed tonight, I'm going to add that to some of the ways that some of these agents and the vans and the buses can educate people who are. Thank you thanks with respect to the buses, you actually could put a sign on the outside of the bus. I do not. I do not mean the traveling buses, I mean the the card buses. You know that come there could be because, as Betty is reporting that there are, you know people lining up well, rather than line up if they saw signs on the buses that said go to this website fill out the form put your credit card on it and you'll be getting a pre- filled, Metro card, so that certainly could be one way to handle this part of it anyway understood. Thank you, okay. Terrific! Thank you. Thank you. Michelle. Next we have Rebecca's Iphone. Now I see Rebecca Dangor. Is this Rebecca Lamorte yeah? I do not know so. It's Rebecca, Mort, sorry I'll change, my name, my bad. I just wanted to similarly to Laurie's comments around finding new technologies to be used just because I'm very concerned that the MTA is telling people to go into subway stations, since cash and coins are not being accepted to refill and to get reduced, fair metro cards for people with disabilities, that's a real barrier because less than 25 of the transit system is accessible and in our community. Yes, there's the q train, but if you live closer to the Lexington avenue line, you're, not so lucky to have accessibility to get there. If you have mobility impairments, so just really would like the MTA to get creative and be sure we're not. You know further disenfranchising people with disabilities from using the system, especially during Covid-19 when there's so many other. You know stresses and issues that we're all facing point taken. Thank you. Thank you rebecca. I see costs a spanish. So can we unmute costs wherever you are because yeah two, I think with Michelle's point: it's easy payment card, DOT easy pay! Easypaymetrocard.Com! It's been there for ever since they started it, and when I got mine on the bus they told me you could do either way. So you know it is available and it should be on the statement. A couple of points for marcus, so you're saying that if somebody does not wear a mask in the subway, they can get a fine correct. Does that include the police department? Okay, the other one. As far as the touchless, I think this came up five ten years ago and at that stage I ca not remember who was on the MTA. Then they said yeah they're working on it. I mean where we are now with technology and where the rest of the world is with these touchless buses and subways they've had it for 20 30 40 years. So I'm confused with you know, with the MTA being in the 21st century, why we are so far behind in technology and in ease of use for the common person. Cars appreciate that and, unfortunately I do not make those decisions and when they decided to begin the transition to Touchless fare payment. That was made way above my pay grade, and I ca not answer. I ca not answer that question. I think we can all surmise. You know just how things go. We've all been using the transit system, I've been using it for my entire life, you know close to 60 years and it's been what it is, and we've transitioned and now we're moving ahead. Okay, it's an old system. It's an old system, and I ca not I ca, not answer I wish I could. I could did not. You have the touchless many years ago at 77Th Street, and I think at that stage it was just citibank the credit card yeah. I think there might have been a pilot. They might have been a pilot way back when, but I do not know whatever became of that. I do not know whether or not that technology is even being used right now it, but it probably informed you know when we began to go full STEAM ahead with this transition. Okay, thanks, I did not see anyone else is there? Did you see anyone else? Will no that's everybody. Well, Betty has her hand back up now for another question: okay and Mute Betty Eddie Star, six, okay, hi there. I just you, know I'm really in shock that we would be going all the way back. Sorry, Michelle, first time in all these years. I hear what you're saying, but you must understand that did not work and that many people did not have the ability to use email or to go on the web, but more than that you have to send it in and then it could take anywhere from two to three weeks until they send the card back now. What Laurie said is very accurate too I mean it's. You know it's really unacceptable to say that the you know seniors will just have to wait a few weeks until we see what we can do with that. No, the reason that we started to have the vans coming out was precisely so people could go and get the money put on their cards, so we certainly are not going to go backwards now, and I think that it's, I really find it. You know extremely shocking to hear that. Well, we ca not do anything about the people now, so what Laurie said was very good. You have two people in the in the truck and they're both telling everybody that they ca not get their money, so one of them could certainly be there to be able to get. You know to do the funding, so I hope, but we're not going to go back to asking people again to send cards back and forth. We went through that and we came. We came with something better and that was the whole purpose for the reason starting this. So I think that I really think it's unacceptable to say that the seniors are going to have to wait and it is not just seniors other people too, who, for one reason or another either are not close to a subway or ca. Not do the stairs twice to go down and get your card and then come back up because you ca not use the train. I think we have to do a little better than that. Thank you for giving me a chance to respond to that. Thank you. Thank you, Betty. Okay. I think why do not we I see Michelle, why do not? We just call a halt to this I'd like to move well actually before you do that. Can I actually ask a few questions, of course, no, that's! Okay, because I want me being a planner. I ca not not think about planning type of issues, so I guess my question for marcus is understanding the environment we're in and the budgetary limitations that we have and the potential cuts taking place. Where do we stand in terms of the planning process for 96th Street Select Bus service? I know it was part of the better bus action plan which is in question in terms of its funding and potential implementation, but is that something that operations planning has been working on and is it something that New York City Transit is still looking to implement if funding is available to do it? Yes, an answer to your question is yes, you know all the behind scene behind the scenes work on all that stuff is continues to go on when allowable, but you know everything is on hold right now, so all right. Well, let's get on the other side of this, and we can talk about that all right, and that was one of my questions, just thinking about future meetings, whether we want to begin thinking about this even before it may be implemented. So we could have those preliminary discussions or whether it's worth waiting, and alongside of that, I know that Kobe put a lot of initiatives and updates on hold. But I know that one of the updates that we've been eagerly awaiting was the status of 79Th Street, Select, Bus, service post implementation. Is that something that, in at some point in the not too distant future, you would be able to or staff would be able to provide an update on understanding, of course, that everything changed as of March and we'd have to ign? Essentially not look at the data for the last six months to understand how it's been working from comparing at least before implementation, to the time from implementation through early through February 2020. yeah, that you know it's reasonable. It's a reasonable ask I'll inquire about it. Alongside of that, I know that I do not remember exactly when it was put in, but the Lexington avenue bus lane. I know we were also looking forward to an update on how that had impacted bus operations and again I do not know if we had a full year of its implementation before cobit. I actually think we probably did not hit a year. If I recall, I think it was implemented in late summer 2019, but again, that's something else that we were looking at and then finally just another follow- up two years ago, we had sent a letter requesting a lot of data regarding bus ridership within community district 8., and I just want to follow up on that and remind you that we're still looking for that and see I've never seen that. I remember seeing that. I do not know. I think after it reached got ta understand craig, that that coincided with a lot of transitional stuff within the Lindy Authority. We changed presidents, you know midstream and I do not know if it's the letters on the president's desk or what, but I know we received it and I remember seeing it move through, but I'll ask about the status of that all right and just following up looking at where we are now. I think one of the things that we as a community are interested in is understanding just how our community has been impacted by Covid-19 and that extends to the transportation network. So it would be really great if we were able to access some information to be able to see on a community level how ridership on buses and within our subway stations, has changed, pre and post covered and how the recovery has taken place just to understand how many people are re- entering the system in our community buses versus subways just top- line figures comparing comparing things from before Kobe to current. Currently I think that would be very informative for us. So do me a favor. You asked three questions that you know are in the realm of possibility, but I have to follow up on it. So if you can shoot me an email with the 79 SBS question, let's bustling question and that question sure I will try to get you a phone all right. I appreciate that and I think that's all I have for now. Okay, I do not know if Michelle still wants to say something on that, but she says yes, so hopefully short and sweet, because I'd like to just I'm sorry, I just wanted to clarify something for Betty. I'm hoping she did not misunderstand something: to use that metro card that has prepayment on it. You do not have to go online to do it and you do not have to do that repeatedly. It's a one- time thing. The forms may even be available on the truck. You fill it out once and you never ever have to go anywhere or do anything to fill it again. Your card stays with you. It just automatically gets filled. So I just wanted to clarify that because it sounded like you misunderstood, like you had to go online or you have to go and refill it every month. No, you do nothing, you get this form for all. I know the post office has the form or maybe marcus could tell us where the form is. I believe that form is on that on that bus or it's on that vehicle. It's on the bus, so that's even better, so I just wanted to clarify, and in the interim time, if you're concerned that you're waiting three weeks for your initial card at that at that time, you can go to the bus and you can refill until this becomes activated, but there's no repeat action. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle, that's true. I do the same thing. Okay, marcus! Thank you. We appreciate your report and we look forward to seeing you back again when we're talking about the 68th, Street, subway and other things, and so hopefully that you stay well and we'll see you soon. Thank you. It's good to see. All of you. Thank you. Okay item number two. This is a request to change parking regulations near 412, 414, East 75th street. Do we have anybody? Is there anybody here for? Is there an applicant here? I know we had a request for this. Is there anyone here on this request right will was saying right before you signed on that the person who had contacted us may not be able to be present? Okay, what maybe we'll just put this often until the next our usual procedure is, if there's not, you know, if somebody makes the request and they they're not here to present on it, we usually do not go forward with it. So why do not we put that off until the next meeting and hopefully that person can make it number three 72nd street between York Avenue East? I mean Sorry East of York Avenue, and this is a request for to change the parking regulations to address illegal parking, and I do not know is colleen here. Yes yeah. I do see Colleen right and why do not? We is there anyone here who wants to speak on that request? Oh man, I believe I'm sorry chuck there have been two people who'd emailed our office about it. Sandy has her hand up to talk about it, yeah good. Why do not we unmute Sandy? You just need to hit Star six hello. Yes, all right! We can hear you, I can hear you, yes, that you know. First of all, I want to thank you for how quickly you put this on the agenda, because I sent my letter in on the 29th of last month. This street has become unbearable, it is dangerous. People are getting injured. Things can not get through the street like ambulances and fire trucks, and it's appalling that we have had nothing come through to help us, except one day this week we did see a police car come through and shoo everybody away. This has nothing to do with parking. This has to do with deliveries, tons of deliveries. Would you like to ask me something about the street? Well, you say: what's the what's, what is the? What are the parking regulations on the street? There's and well? There is parking and I do not have a car. So I have not read the sign. There's some parking. They have eliminated some parking so that there's a Cross street now so there's a safety area where people can cross, but what we have are giant trucks. I mean enormous delivering furniture supplies to the hospitals that are here. Suddenly we have two new hospitals on the street and since Covid-19 everybody orders online. So we have deliveries coming in, but I have seen fire trucks fighting to get to the end of the street when we've had minor fires and this street has to be uncongested, it is beyond belief and the part and the honking starts at eight A.M and does not end until 5 P.M this all day. So you have seniors, you have people working at home, you have children, etc. It is unbearable. I do not know how this can end. There has to be more signage as you enter the street besides dead end, you know something that you will be fined if you start honking your car. I I'm really throwing this back at you because I did contact D.O.T. They said no, they could not help me go to the police. The police could not help me go to 3- 1- 1 this, so I finally contacted you guys. Well, let me ask you- and here we is go- is that where Sotheby's is also oh boy, yes and they're enormous trucks in and out, yeah tie up the street yeah. Maybe we can ask Colleen Chatter goon who's, our representative from D.O.T? What you know Colleen can are you here? Can we mute colleen? Yes, it's colleen from DOT. How are you hi? Hey, I'm sorry about what you're experiencing, but changing the sign is not going to deal. You should have deal with the issue of the dog parking because I did not mean to I'm sorry. I do not mean changing the sign. I mean this is a teeny, tiny sign that says dead end. No one even pays attention to it. You know what I was saying: they just come in and jam up the street yeah. I mean I'll, be honest with you. It's really it's something that should be handled by the local precinct. They do not want to touch it will. Can we can we reach out to the precinct and see what they can do, I'm happy to? They did yeah. That would be fabulous. They did send a patrol car beca. I had contacted Kayla's office and a patrol car showed up a couple of days ago and got rid of the traffic in the middle of the street, but they would have to do this five six times a day. That's not going to happen! Really, no yeah right. It's not going to happen. Given the circumstances you know, you've got high rises here on this street. Really big high rise, double parking. Is that what the issue is triple parking triple and quadruple it's a very wide street. It's almost five lanes. Every inch is covered by a vehicle, I'm not joking. I have photos of it and my doorman is lit. They lose their minds downstairs because they hear the honking all day, long yeah, it's pretty awful yeah. I was just going to say this is craig that it looks like these parking regulations on the street have truck parking for most of the block and then once you get closer to the end to the dead end, it becomes no standard. So if we received an initial email back in late July, I believe from someone else. Oh really, and they were just essentially mirroring what you were saying sandy in terms of people parking in the Cul- de- sac, and they say they were saying that it was also from people waiting for those who are coming out of the hospitals. Yeah they're Hss has a facility on the street with doctors offices, so you have cabs and vehicles waiting for patients. Yeah. Yes, and even if you look at the Google Street view, you can see a truck park perpendicular to the roadway at the end of the street. So I think we all recognize the issues that exist but Colleen, I guess now again. Maybe you can help us determine what our options are if they're, just if it's just solely an enforcement issue or if we need to if there are any other signs within the DOT inventory that we could put on to help with the situation or even if we need to eliminate parking entirely, probably would not solve the issue. Motorists would still park there. I mean we do not have a s. You know you know a sign that would deter this and it really is an enforcement issue. It really is yeah. I hear you yes and I was hoping to have you know the police department patrol they no longer come up the street put in giving tickets to trucks. That's ended that ended almost a year ago. They were very vigilant about that and that's over yeah. I suggest this is chuck. Let me suggest hi that we have a further hearing on this and then we call in Sotheby's, and we call in the hospital for special surgery, and else is on that block that we can call in because it's as we know from experience in the committee, relying on enforcement is not a solution because you may get it but you're not going to get it on a regular basis. There's just not! Oh no, of course not. You know. No, I think that's a wonderful idea. Let's see that's one way of attacking it. You know why do not we? Why do not we try to do that Sandy and we'll? Why do not we get a couple of other comments and we'll see what we can do? Great Betty, Wallerstein Betty, Cooper Wallerstein is would like to comment on this. So can we meet Betty Chuck? I was going to say that you may remember it's already 10 years ago that we did have a meeting with the hospitals and with Sotheby's with regard to the problems at 72nd street, because even now that that's Cul- de- sac and it's very crowded, but even now it's once you are on the 70 once you're on the 31. When you get to 73rd street, you do not move for 15 minutes, because the bus is making a turn on 72nd street. Making a right turn gets stuck in the middle and all the traffic north of it is sitting and waiting. So what we did 10 years ago after that meeting was that special surgery agreed that they did not have anything on 72nd street in the Cul- de- sac then, but they agreed that they would get a traffic agent that would be at 71st street you'll. Remember because of the traffic coming off the drive. That was also going against the lights and was crowded, but for 72nd Street. The city did put in a traffic enforcement officer and that worked for a while, but once in a while they're there, but they're not there all the time, but we did have a meeting with each of the hospitals and with Mary manning to make sure, and certainly with the you know, with all the people sitting having their cars waiting for them to come out of the of the of the different programs and shows that were at the corner. I've forgotten the name now so that we that was all taken away and people were not able to sit in front with their cars as chauffeurs and waiting. They had to come back, but we did. We were able to empty that. But it's gotten worse and worse, and I do not know if the person, if the special surgery still has 71st street anybody there. But there is hardly ever anyone from traffic that was assigned to do 72nd street okay. Well, we'll, as I said, we'll. I think we should bring them in and see what we can work out and hopefully get something done. Why do not we go to Trisha Shimamura next? Can we unmute Trisha wanting to say something on this yeah? I live right there too, I'm on 425 east 72Nd street, and I just I just want to say that Sandy's 100 right I'm. I was going to bring this up to you, guys anyways, it's! It is she's, absolutely right. People are triple booked there and I have to say that I do not. I think that it's great the plan to bring in Sotheby's and hospitals for special surgery, but I honestly being there every day and seeing this intersection every day. I think that it's more so the hospital than anything else there's a lot of idling a lot of people who just sit in their cars and they're just waiting for people, but it is triple parked to the point where I do not even send. I do not even like my husband walking over there, because you ca not I'm afraid that somebody's going to get hit it's very crowded. I will just say that I'm glad that you're pushing that you're going to have this as another agenda item, because I wish that valerie from East 72Nd, Street, Neighborhood Association, is here, and I just wish that we could flag this for her too, because the neighborhood association may have other things to say about this and make it and could add to it. I did Sandy. If you saw, I think it was yesterday. I saw I saw a traffic cop out there yesterday and it was making some difference, but truly it's I mean it. The end of the Cul- de- sac. There is awful, but the entire corridor is just so bad with the double parking and it's really turned into a one- lane street in the middle of Monday, through Friday to the point of where people are pausing and letting one car go in one direction, then they stop and they let another car go in the other direction. It's turned into a one- way street like a one- path bridge. Basically, in some of these areas, so really I think, bringing all the key players together, but also including East 72Nd Street Neighborhood Association is a great plan. Thank you, Trisha Michelle Birnbaum, I think, is next, and can we unmute Michelle yeah hi? I think that's the only way to handle it chuck. I think there are two different problems. The intersection is one issue, no question that it's impacted by the heavy traffic, that's actually on 72Nd East of York, but the intersection is a separate issue that we've been talking about for a hundred years with respect to the street East of York. It's as we all know, it's a cul- de- sac, most people who, in automobiles or trucks or whatever vehicle that go down that street, are fully aware that it's a dead end and they're going down there purposefully, there's nobody, that's just happens to be driving down there, so there's a reason for them to be there. So the question is: what's the most efficient way of handling those people who have a need to be there? The Sotheby's freight entrance is on the south corner, just East of York Avenue. That poses one set of problems, but they actually have a drive- in freight entrance, so that could be mitigated if they would time their pickups and deliveries or whatever they're doing as you go further down the south side of the street, you have the back entrance of the or of the one of the hospital one of a special surgery, ambulatory care buildings. They can they it's a back entrance. The main entrance is on 71st, where there usually is an attendant at the stop sign that comes off the drive at 71st. That Attendant has been there routinely. It was also a request of ours. It seems to have helped that street. But again those people that are coming out on 72nd are exiting there, because it's closer to the bus, stop exiting there, because a car is picking them up and then, of course, you have the medical building on the north side of the street. That houses, you know a ton of offices and imaging centers and all kinds of things. You have two buildings there and then you have high- rise residential, so without question. There's going to be loading and unloading and Amazon and fresh direct and about 40 000 other things. So I think it's not only a good idea to bring like special surgery and Sotheby's in, but also to bring representatives from each of those buildings, because we can ask those doormans doormen to monitor the Amazon, the fresh direct. You know those kind of personal deliveries, because, just as we did on Madison Avenue for the Morton Williams, when that you know that those trucks were blocking the bus lane and causing havoc every morning, Morton Williams getting involved to monitor the traffic ended up being very helpful. So I think it's a great idea to bring everybody in, but I would just like to add to that list to bring in representatives whether it be a superintendent or whoever each building thinks they could send, and a representative from the institutions as well. Thank you Michelle thanks. That's helpful. I agree. Next up is Elita camp. Our board chair always glad to see her. Would you unmute a leader? Well yeah? I think you're unmuted, I am thank you so much chuck, that's nice! I just I'm wondering if Sotheby's trucks have one of those you pay a certain amount per year and then the tickets do not really count so much, which would raise the question of talking about that throughout the district, and if not, the timing as Michelle suggested that if Sotheby's could time delivery, so they did not clock traffic, which also would reverberate throughout the district. If it's something that I know, we've talked about it before, with respect to stores on the avenues and delivery times. So those are. These are specific examples which obviously have a an impact on the traffic there, but may just be part of a bigger question that maybe the transportation committee might want to look at. Thank you. Thank you. Elita Craig. I know craig. You wanted to say some things here. Yes, so I actually have a question for colleen regarding this and just for everyone's information, one of the we know that we need to come back to parking placard and we anticipate that may very well be a discussion in November, but this sort of relates as well to the situation here in terms of what is are there? I know you said there are no signs in the inventory that can address this situation, but one of the fundamental issues that clearly is in play is the fact that people do not necessarily respect no standing signs or no standing signs are really no standing signs for those who do not get special benefits. So what can be done to, or has there ever been discussion of, having something stricter than no standing or to make it clear that no standing really means no standing, no exceptions? No it's! No stopping it would be. No stopping signage would mean, listen, do not even pull up there. Do not even use this curb or do not even stop here for pick up and drop off. No stopping is the most stringent sign right. So wait a second colleen. We had someone write in that said: they approached a traffic con, you know agent and the agent said no, you know somebody had a placard. I do not know whether it was of some kind, whether it was a you know, Hannah, Capp or whatever, and they said no, they can park there. That's not true. Is it it? I have to confirm that, but there are certain places that placards are permitted to park and they're not permitted to park, but I do not believe they're not permitted to park in a no-, stopping area they're not, and that's, and that's where it's going with this yeah and I can share those guidelines with will. But the thing is that I ca not speak on behalf of the traffic enforcement agent, because I do not know what really goes on with the ticketing issue aspects. I know the no stopping is more of a stringent regulation in terms of do not even pull up at this curb to use it for pick up or drop off right, and my question was really whether we should consider installing those in the Cul- de- sac area to keep the turnaround area free to allow emergency vehicles to be able to make those turnarounds. I mean look we'd, be more than happy to look at that and see whether we can install it or not, but you know again the bottom line. It comes back to enforcement because I guarantee you may have vehicles that will still pull up at that corner of the Cul- de- sac and still use the space there. You know it all comes back to enforcement. Yeah, okay! Well, we'll have that we're going to we're going to try to get these people to come in and we'll see what else we can do yeah. I think I think, having a conversation with all the stakeholders is a good start and then we can take it from there good. Thank you. Why do not we? Thank you while you're here Colleen? Do you have any things you want to update us on we've just been busy with outdoor dining outdoor learning for the schools, helping a lot of the schools get back with the social distancing with restaurants. As you know, the outdoor dining has been extended throughout the year, so we've been answering lots of questions about. You know, materials that are going to be used out there. You know for heating, of course, the heating those fall under the fdny or DOB if it comes to whatever their the restaurants might be using. But so far it's been relatively good. The complaints have been very minimal. They've died down, we've have lots of restaurant owners that are complying because they want to do the good thing, and you know we see that the compliance rate is it's really good. I mean a lot of the restaurant owners, they have been through such difficult times and they want to get back on their feet and you know they're trying their best with the compliance. So those are like two things that we've been really busy with, of course, we've been busy trying to get back to normal with our milling and paving schedules. You know issuing permits for work to be done on the roadway so that that's pretty much it that I can tell you you know the city is going through severe budget cuts, it's going to impact our agency. It's also going to impact a lot of other city agencies as well, and I do not know where we stand right now. I really do not know given the circumstances. Okay. Thank you colleen. I think we have a couple of questions. Elita cam. Can we thanks chuck hi Colleen? I have a couple of questions. One is about the sidewalk. Is there any we've asked about this use of the sidewalks for retail? I do not know if there's any other answer and also I'm wondering if you're working on the streets and repaving, if it's possible, to use a paint, I know, there's a paint that exists and the board member with familiarity told me that is much more reflective in the rain than what we currently have, which seems to just disappear in the rain. So, if you're delineating lines to have something that is really reflective, when it rains out, I think would increase the safety they're already so congested that anything that helps, I think, would be useful. Thank you. Yes, you know elita. It would be helpful if you can send me an email with the name of the paint I can find out. Oh terrific, yeah, okay. I can definitely check with our geometric design if this is something that we would use and if you know, if it's something that's on the list, I can I can get more details about it. Okay, I'm going to send an email right now and ask the person who told me thank you and I'm sorry what was the sidewalk issue, just if retail, if retail, wants to? If they're able to use the sidewalk in front of their shops, I've seen it in other cities. I know the D.O.T has said no so far, but I'm not sure what the difference is between the restaurants and the retail. I mean there is a difference, but if restaurants could, if there could be rules or regulations that the stores could comply with, it may help them at least while the weather is still warm enough for people to be walking around. It's a very good question. I know we've worked with the retail to accommodate curbside pickup, but not putting out their materials out there or their items to sell. No, we would. I do not think we would be in the position to allow that not at the moment. Can you tell me why? Well, I mean, I think, if it extends beyond the frontage of their sidewalk, that would be considered a sidewalk obstruction and then, given that a lot of the sidewalks in the city are very narrow, you're creating you want to create space for pedestrians and then keep in mind that you know we want to also create that whole social distancing, for you, know pedestrians using the sidewalk too so by having retail out there and having people congregate, it's just going to create more of a not the social distancing, but that's, but that's why you would have regulations, because those are the same issues that come up with restaurants, where they have fixed tables and chairs that take up a lot of sidewalks I mean I will I can take it back. I mean it's an interesting concept. I can take it back and get thoughts on that, but it's yeah. Thank you. Colleen! It's coming up that borough board and other boards have the same response that it could be really useful, but I wo not take up any more time, and I appreciate your looking into that's interesting yeah. I will I'll find out. Okay, thank you. Next, we have costs. Can we unmute costs yeah with the permanent outdoor, dining and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's supposed to be extended indefinite, not so much indefinitely, but 12 months after the pandemic is supposed to have ended. So we could have the outdoor dining for the next three four years. Is it possible to allow restaurants to build more of a permanent, stable structure? I mean some time ago. I know if you have the tents up and a lot of them were basically blown over with a high winds so with the fact that it's going to be there for quite a while. Can restaurant owners build more of a permanent, not much enclosed, but more of a permanent, stable structure? You know cause that's a really great question and I want to say I mean if we get there and when we get there, that's going to be something that's going to have to be looked at in terms of whether this is going to be something permanent that we want to do and how it will change the whole streetscape and you're. Absolutely right that you know if we do decide to allow this and make this a permanent thing, then it will change the whole dynamic of how we of the of the you know the structure, that's that will be out there yeah, but we're not there yet cause we're not there yet tomorrow. I wish one other point: is not it legal for anybody to extend 18 inches from their boundary line to display their wares? Yes, there is a rule of that. Whatever you're selling, what you're selling in your store, you should be selling the same items outside right, so this could really help the establishments they could use the 18 inches. But nobody, you know nobody enforces it so that really they could go three four feet out. Well, it's complaint driven, so it's not like nobody really enforces it. It's complain driven. So you know that's one point for you a leader. You know legally, they can go 18 inches, so that could be a big help right. Okay, so I think I think next I think we have catherine corkery. Oh catherine, captain you may just have to thank you hey there. So this is Kate Corkery and I was the one that worked with Colleen and Cv-8 in July, June or July to change the parking on Cherokee place to add the two spots on both sides for no standings for the radius turns I'm just going to do a quick, little follow- up which I've emailed will and Craig and Charles both know the information with lots of pictures. The parking rules are not being followed by the drivers of the cars with placards. It is full on one end to the other end with cars parked with placards beginning. It's like two weeks, two and a half weeks now, since the signs were installed, it took almost 65 70 days to have that done. Tickets are not being given. It is just one end to the other and there's absolutely no enforcement with any ticketing being done whatsoever. So I just wanted to follow up with that. It's a little aggravating that all the work went to no resolution whatsoever to having anything done for the safety of us on this block with a large moving trucks, fire trucks, moving vans, etc. In order to make those turns the fire truck got stuck I'd, say two weeks ago as well: I'm trying to get around 77Th Street 78Th Street through Cherokee Place. Thank you Kate, I think we'll well, I think we need to get to traffic enforcement and they need to make a sweep over there just to let people know that there's new regulations- and you know they're not going to be able to do that anymore- see that may work. You know because it's new- and maybe if somebody if somebody starts that they'll get the hint yeah okay, I thought I think billy had his hand up first actually before so billy Freeland. Why do not we unmute billy hi, everybody colleen, I'm curious, whether you have an update on the temporary bike lanes that were installed at 61st and 62nd. My understanding is that there were some complaints in the neighborhood. There were some adjustments made the borough president recently said she looked at it and was pleased with whatever tweaks DOT made. Can you just tell us sort of what's happened in the last month or so what the changes are and what it? What the status is right now, colleen there hey billy, you know what my computer just went down hold on. I have to get back into it. My remote sign in sign up usually shuts down very frequently, which it should not. So we did make some tweaks and adjustments to the to the 61st and 62nd Street bike lane, which is bike lanes which are temporary at the moment, and we did receive complaints about it. Yes and we've been responding to the residents and addressing those complaints and as what we mentioned to the residents, we are and will continue to monitor the the implementation of the bike lane and bike lanes, and we will come back to the Community Board and we will give a presentation about them, I'm just trying to get back into my computer, so I can share with you what the modifications we made. If you want to come back to me after this a few other questions would that be helpful. We can come back to you. That's fine, great yeah, okay, why do not we have? I see another member of the public Timor Solomon? Why do not we unmute Timor hi? How are you thank you? Actually, my question is also for Colleen. This is basically a follow- up, so if you want to come back again to me as well afterwards in regard to 61st street and 62nd streets bike lanes, I have gone over 61st and 62nd from river to fifth many times, because it's on my regular path on a daily basis and I've seen the changes that have been made predominantly from second Avenue East on both well, mostly on 62nd street, with the narrowing of the bike lane and allowing two lanes of traffic to come down, and those have made very big improvements without question. But if there is one thing that I know in the last community board, eight meeting we had brought up- or I had brought up, was in regard to which I'm sure you've heard resident complaints about accessing our homes. If there's anything that you would put into your proposal or into your presentation later, I do not want to waste the committee's time, but it is has become a very difficult situation for us, because I live on 61st between second and third, and there is a I have two children. I have two car seats in my car. If I want to actually try and get the my children out of my car, I ca not even do it with legally within a thousand feet of my house. The bike lane on our block is 10 feet wide, including the buffer. Maybe if something or consideration could be made to make it a little smaller so as to allow us to maybe stop in the buffer as an access point, is that something that the DOT is looking at? Is that what you're, considering or have all the moves have already been done? That you're? Considering you know I, my computer is back up and running so I mean, as many of you know, the mayor announced as part of the city's response to Covid-19 that nine new miles of temporary bike lanes, which including 61st and 62nd streets from fifth to York, to be installed, 61st and 62nd streets were chosen. So, following the implementation, we did make some changes to the markings and signs as what you just mentioned on 62nd street is to the bridge to alleviate the traffic congestions that we've been getting complaints about and billy. As I mentioned, we will continue to monitor those conditions and both you know to see what modifications we can make with the design as needed, and we have been working very closely with the local precinct to deal with the with the congestion complaints that we've been receiving and what we did. We also added we to alleviate. We added, as you mentioned the second full- time, travel lane on 62nd street between First and York Avenue, and altered the placement of the delineators between the travel and bike lanes. So we feel that, with the changes that we've made, it's been working out, you know fairly well and we'll continue to monitor the traffic flow to see how that has been improved or if there are more modifications that we need to make. We did get quite a few complaints about the access accessing the curb and believe it or not. We were keeping you know. You know a good list of all of those complaints so that when we do come before the community board, we're ready to address those to see how we can you know make improvements to you know allow for the access to residents along the corridor. I mean you know, I ca not tell you that you know we're going to remove the bike lane, because that's not going to happen at the moment. It's not because it's not my decision and I ca not make that decision. But what I can tell you is that if there are any issues that need immediate attention, that you would like us to address we're more than happy to come out there and do so and take a look at it to see what can be done. You know in the in the meantime, if I could just ask one quick question: I'm a full supporter of the bike lanes, I'm a cyclist. I have no problems with it. It's just about safe access for our elderly and our children to be able to come to and from the curb, without crossing a street of heavy traffic with cars and then looking both ways in the bike lane, because people do use the bike lane in both directions, though they should not be. My one question is before the next meeting: when the DOT presents: are you actively collecting data or metrics as to how much those bike lanes are actually being used because to be Frank? I do not see them being heavily used. There are times of the day where there are more uses, but, to be completely frank, the majority of those lanes sit idle and empty for most of the day, and even when they're active, there are not a lot of cyclists using them. I'll give it to the fact that, maybe not everybody knows they're there, but is the DOT actively trying to get that data to be able to present that? And yes, we are. We are collecting data like with many of our projects. It's data- driven when we come to the community board. We have to show x amount of cyclists are using this path. These are the days the hours that they're using it and whether it's an increase- and we come with data to show that hey this really has been a safety project. It has decreased in crashes and so forth. So a lot of our projects are data driven, and we do have to show that when we make changes to the streetscape. Yes, thank you. You're welcome, Judy schneider from the public. Can we unmute Judy thanks thanks Chuck, I'm now speaking on behalf of the East 60s Neighborhood association? Ever since these bike lanes have been put in, it seems like I'm spending all my time on them, fielding either emails or are hotline phone calls at least 10 of the buildings that belong to the association, and I do not know how many people have complaints about these bike lanes and many of them have written to the commissioner colleen and will continue. I got one from Park Avenue yesterday, a building I was not even familiar with, but they tracked us down to make complaints. The biggest complaint from a practical point of view is that the traffic stops on 2Nd Avenue, going down when the traffic gets backed up due to the reduced size of the street, so the traffic is out into the avenue and it does not flow freely on. Second, we have a problem getting to the bridge before the bike lanes were put in now. This is compounded and it's worse. The same happens on first avenue coming up 10 when they get to the bike. Lane Street going eastbound 62nd street. It blocks up the traffic because the street is narrowed and same on York and third. So what we really need- and if you could take this back to your people- is we need traffic agents on 61st and 62nd on your first second and third avenue at a very minimum on those two blocks to direct the traffic, because otherwise the north and south traffic does not move. In addition with this traffic being backed up clean, the other big complaint we're getting. Is the noise complaint from the horn honking when the traffic is not moving, so this is this complaint is coming into the association from every place from everyone from buildings from individuals from board presidents. I've advised them all to write to D.O.T. Thank you, Judy I'll. Take that back. Thank you. We have another member of the Public Evel and David Kenyon you evelyn David, please Evelyn! You may have to hit Star six to unmute. Try hitting Star six evelyn is that there you go. Is that good? Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much for letting me speak and I'm not going to read this little speech that I have about the bike lanes. There's one thing nobody's mentioning, and that is the parking for commercial people is reduced by 50, and it's not just so now the trucks and ups and a whole bunch of other people park when they have to make a delivery. They just stop in the middle of the street. They ca, not pull in on the side, there's no place for them to park the doormen that have shifts that okay, so, let's just take care of that, so they park in the middle of the street they go in, they make their deliveries. We sit behind the trucks and some people go in the bike lanes or go on the sidewalk or just so that you know they hang with it. I'm going around this thing because it sits there for a while. What are you going to do when there's an emergency? There is an ambulance. There is a fire truck. That's got to get by something that's parked in the middle of the street you're just going to rip through the bike lanes. The answer is yes: if it's an emergency vehicle they'll do what they have to do. Okay, I do not understand whatever the gentleman that spoke before this, the 60Th Street Association person did say what did he say? Oh I ca not remember any anyway. Traffic 62nd street is a oh, it's basically they're through streets that go to the Fdr, Northbound and southbound. You have huge during normal times. I do not even take the 62nd street exit to the Fdr to get northbound. It's a complete mess and there's always been a police person there right a traffic person, because traffic comes off the 59th, Street Bridge and either goes down 62nd street or goes across and goes into Manhattan it it's a complete mess. Why would you put a bike lane in the middle of this crazy busy area in Midtown? Okay, that's the first thing that totally shocked me it. What really shocked me was coming home one day and seeing the bike lanes and there had never been a meeting. Also you changed. The signage to 7 am parking at no alt, stop okay, so residents or anybody parking on 62nd street now has to get their car moved by 7 am in the morning. It used to be 8 am to 7 P.M no parking except for commercial. Well, half the commercial is gone now, so I do not know where they're going to go. They do not have a place to go, and then you change the signage which makes it more stressful for anybody. That's got to park there overnight and get out like 7 15 load up your car and get out. If you have to go where you have to go, I'm a teacher. I have to go places. I ca not do that anymore. I ca not do that anymore. I ca not leave at seven in the morning, because my schools do not open that. So I mean you're just causing undue stress, and this is Covid-19. This is the worst time in the century to pull this off on us. Okay, 61st street has a very large a large restaurant. It has a large it has between Lexington park, there's a very large space taken up on the south side of the street by restaurant. That's fine, that's great! For them. Where do the commercial parkers park during the day? Nowhere they do not park anywhere. I do not know what they're doing the other thing that's brought up to me is by doormen on Park Avenue, where we're always trying to find a parking space and they're so nice about it. Okay, their shifts end at seven in the morning. They ca not if they've parked there at night, they ca not get back to their cars seven in the morning before they get a ticket. I mean it's just more stress on them. It's just become this incredibly stressful situation. This is not little houses with driveways and you're putting in nice bikeway. No, it is residential buildings in the middle of Midtown, with access to the Fdr and access off the fdr you're, now backing up the fdr that goes northbound and gets off at 61st street. That's getting backed up. I do not understand it. I do not. I please think about this. I know you thought during Covid-19 the traffic's much less traffic is rebuilding back up again, it's becoming jammed okay and there's no place you're, just stressing everybody out, and so thank you very much for letting me speak, and I hope you will really think about this. In terms of employ commercial vehicles, I mean Lexington avenue has now taken up a lot. The commercial parkings is gone from there because of the restaurants and now you've taken it away from the streets. You have to start thinking about this. Are you incur? What exactly is your plan to shut down this area completely? Have the whole place go out of business? You know just think about that. Okay, thank you very much. I think we're going to have further hearings just so you know they're going to make they want to make the crosstown bike lanes permanent at some point, but this is a this is now the period demonstration period and they're going to come back with proposals and there'll be a chance to have everyone be heard about what the problems are and what the issues are, but we thank you for coming in your comments, yeah, why do not I go? Let's go ahead. I'm sorry, Colin! You want to add something. No, I said no, thank you all for the comments. I really do appreciate them and I will take it back definitely and believe it or not, Judy's. Absolutely right. We we've she's been directing a lot of the constituents to reach out to us. Okay, why do not we go to Michelle Birnbaum and can we unmute Michelle? Oh you muted yourself back by accident, okay, yeah thanks very much. Okay. Let me just say I have two comments, but one about the bike lanes, one of the big issues colleen- and I know unfortunately you're here so you take the fire. I know it's not your fault and you're very accommodating to us and we're grateful that you come to the meetings, but the big issue with the bike lane, in addition to the inconvenience, is that it mysteriously appeared. There was no notice. There was no presentation to the community board. There was no outreach to the community in any way. It was an announcement. It was not even an announcement, the bike lane just appeared and then people would say: oh did you notice? There are bike lanes on 61st and 62nd. That is really not an appropriate thing to do and the truth of the matter is had the D.O.T come to the board and the community we probably could have helped to plan them in such a way to alleviate some of the problems that everybody's having. Maybe they would not have been so wide. Maybe there would have been a way to put a break in them. Maybe there'd be discussion that they should not be there at all, because maybe some of the concerns about drive entry and egress and the community's entries into their building, maybe that would have outweighed the need of the cyclist. But you do not know that because nobody came to us and now unfortunately, you're going to be in the position of backpedaling and readjusting they started off temporary, but in within the very first announcement of temporary there was a little power. There was a little phrase that said with an eye towards making them permanent. Now you should not, if you're, really doing a study, you should not have an eye towards anything, because that is a predisposition. You should just listen to all of the comments and make the decision based on what you hear and use and everything you see on the ground. So if you would take that back, I would appreciate it. The other thing I just wanted to mention in response to comments about outside retail having retail outside, is not in the same need that the restaurants have when people go to a restaurant they'll sit for two hours. A restaurant can not have business if they have one couple sitting inside for two hours, depending on what spacing they can arrange. Retail is different. Hoards do not go into a retail store, it's very easy to go to monitor, who comes in and out of a retail store, and I would argue that probably most of the time they're one or two people, and actually those stores would be grateful for that. So I do not see any need to put more activity on the streets narrowing the pedestrian way, adding to the visual blight when in fact it wo not help a retail clothing business. One bit the restaurants are in a different category. So those are my comments and I thank you for listening. Thank you, Michelle well, taken. I do not know. Maybe craig can correct me, but I thought we did have a presentation we did. You did have a presentation and plus we also created a what's happening, flyer that we shared with the Community Board yeah. I mean we had a big. We had a big presentation about this michelle, maybe you had, you know, had missed it at some point, but we did anyhow. Why do not we trisha shimamura? Why do not we unnutritia thanks? I just want to get some clarity on on when DOT is planning on coming back to present on some of these, on the in on the on the feedback that they've received and what and any sort of changes or additional changes that they're planning on making is this for next meeting? Or is this no we're? We are not coming back anytime soon. The changes that we've made we've emailed all of the constituents we've informed them of it. We've been responding to everyone. We do not plan on coming back anytime soon on. Maybe I can find out. I can get more timeline specific timeline as to when we will come back and present our findings to the Community board. Okay, so this is so. This is where I have a just to go back to Timor Solomon's point about what he had said. This is something that I I'm very sensitive towards the fact that these residents, our neighbors people in our community board, are having a problem accessing their building is something that I do not think can wait until the next time. D.O.T comes back with with their findings, so I'm wondering if there's a way that we can pass a resolution tonight or ask DOT to respond to this. What he's asking for seems completely reasonable to me he's not asking for the elimination of a bike lane he's asking for the narrowing of it and creating a way for that. Our neighbors can have access to their own building, which I think is really reasonable and as somebody who also deals with a car seat and dealing with a young child, the idea of having to hear neighbors having to go through this in the winter time before as the winter sets in and dealing with. All that just seems like a nightmare. So I'm wondering if we should not be passing a resolution tonight asking for DOT to immediately make adjustments to this specific area so that these neighbors can have access to their building all right. Well, that's something! Maybe we can talk about after we have a little bit more discussion on this craig. I know craig is next, patricia we'll get we'll come back to you on that, though. Okay all right! Well, I was just going to add this past weekend I took a little walk and was actually observing 61st street for a little while and what was fascinating to me as someone who's actually used it on in a car as well as well. I have not used it on a on a bike yet, but you still with the second through lane there. You now have the same throughput that you did before the bike. Lane was installed, putting the access issues aside and I'm going to get to that in a second. So when I was walking southbound things looked like they were operating well and smoothly, and everything was quiet. When I was returning heading North, I noticed all this hubbub going on and it turns out a single double parked vehicle between the bridge exit on 62nd street and First Avenue created a large traffic jam going up the exit ramp on the bridge and vehicles that were continuing up to 63rd street to make the left they were able to move through the intersection, whereas the vehicles that were making the right turn onto 62nd street were getting backed up as two lanes had to go into one. So my point is that we need to as we're moving forward with this and looking at the at possibilities to modify it. We need to address part some of the parking issues perhaps and address ways to ensure that we have those two through lanes always operating and working, or else we do get that congestion and the air quality impacts and the noise impacts, and no one wants that. But that brings me also to a larger point that we need to come back to, and this is more systemic than just here on 61st and 62nd street, and that is, we have to really come up with the strategy and the city absolutely needs to do to take the lead on this, but how to deal with all the double parking and the access issues, whether they be because of bike lanes or open restaurants or anything else where, as soon as a car stops, it creates all the congestion and problems that go along with it and we may need to have some more serious discussions. I brought this up before about drop off lanes and spaces and delivery spaces that are that are reserved for prompt drop- offs that do not block lanes. That may be placed some of the parking to be able to allow traffic to flow freely and provide people with safe access to be able to do expeditious, pickups and drop- offs of people and goods. So that's something that we're going to have to revisit as we go forward, but I think we need to keep our eye on the bowl and make sure that we're thinking about that, because this issue is going to just continue to explode with more deliveries, taking place and more trucks taking doing deliveries and the amazons doing their massive curbside deliveries and bike lanes and everything else- and everyone knows I'm a supporter of bike lanes, but we need to protect access and that's something that needs to be part of the of the equation in each and every case. Thanks Craig Billy Freeland, I know wanted to have his hand up billy. Can we unmute billy yeah good, okay, you're on you know? I agree with what craig just said. I think we need to look at this in a more systematic way, and I you know I thank our neighbors who have you know, come to speak to us and share their concerns. You know I just wish we had sort of. Typically when we discussed these proposals. We have an image of the lane and we know what the width of the bike lane is, and my understanding is that it was a certain width and I'd like to know from colleen sort of what that was, and then it was just narrowed and I'm curious what the current with the bike lane is. You know, of course, if we can increase the buffer, that would be terrific, while not compromising the lane, but if we end up, you know proposing a resolution that essentially would make the lane unusable. I'd have a problem with that. I do not think that's at all what tricia is suggesting, but I just want to make sure through DOT that it is possible to improve the safety for all involved without compromising the lane, and I think if we do a resolution, it would be nice for us as a board to comment on asking DOT and the city to think more comprehensively about when you do these types of designs. What are you going to do about drop off and commercial unloading and you know to Craig's point. You know we should be, I think, advocating for designated loading zones, particularly in these areas that are prone to congestion and thinking more broadly about how, as I think it was maybe evelyn. It may have been two more, but you know the connection to the Queensborough one of the historically most congested areas in New, York City, that's got to be part of, I think our thinking as a city. So I just that's all a long way of saying. If we're going to do a resolution, I hope we would also sort of voice some support for the bike lane for the goal of it, because you are connecting to the queensborough. You are serving a lot of essential workers in New, York City, who have you know it's very unsafe, getting from Queens to Manhattan and back in that area, and I think we should also voice support for larger, more of strategic thinking and planning about what to do about the issues that have been raised so that that's all I wanted to say for now. Thank you, billy Peter Borack is next Peter. We unmute him thanks so much craig. I think you really did a really good job that was really articulate. I think we've reimagined the way that our streets work and I'm a big proponent of bike lanes as well, but the way that we've done it now is such that when there is a double parked car or a double parked truck, it really screws everything up and there can be. I mean, I think, your experience with 61st and 2nd is just one of a long list of examples, and I think we do have to reimagine where yeah ubers and lists actually have designated drop- off zones. I've seen that a little bit we discussed this, I think two or three years ago. I do not recall when I was a proponent of it, then I think it's something we should definitely revisit and just your point is until there's a real vaccine here, people are going to be doing continue to be doing a lot more online shopping, and so the amount of deliveries is only going to increase and we have to. Maybe we do not love that, but we think we have to accept that and try and work with that and set up. You know we talked once about someone from this community came and said: maybe we should have all deliveries done at night so to alleviate traffic. That was, I do not think. Maybe that's the way to go, but we really have to think systematically about how we handle this so craig. I think we should. We should maybe put that on the agenda and really think through that. Thank you trisha. I know you wanted to. I do not know if you want to offer an amendment. I mean a motion on something or not an amendment, so you have to unmute yourself, sorry yeah, so I still. I still think that we should do a resolution I 100 agree. I want to give credit to Peter, because I feel like the first month that we like went through this pandemic. Peter was saying then that we need to be talking about reimagining our streets, and I remember thinking like yeah. That makes sense and craig I agree with you like. I think I still think that makes sense. I think that we need to talk about it, but I like just tonight because we have a community member here because they're talking to us about a very real problem. I appreciate- and I agree, I'm not I'm not saying eliminate the bike lane, I'm really just if there's and I and I wish that there was a visual here. Maybe Colleen can speak a little bit more to the specifics, but if there's as Mr Solomon is saying a way to use some of that buffer to allow access for those residents, I think we need to do something tonight on this. So maybe colleen can speak a little bit about the specifics of that spot, and then we can I'm happy to put forth a resolution. I mean you know what I'm happy to see what we can do for that building and I'll take it back. You know to see else what we can do in terms of the buffer, and you know I want to go back to what craig said: Craig you're, absolutely right when we come to present these projects. I think it's great that the community board want to think about these projects holistically and think about the impacts with terms with you know, in terms of parking laws or commercial trucks and curbside access and so forth, and it's a lot. It really is a lot to take, and you know we're more than happy to work with. You know the buildings and see what we can do and how we can accommodate these requests. So let me let me have a conversation with my colleagues tomorrow and we will see what we can do. Okay, that makes that makes sense. I just do not want it. I mean I want then us to have some way to like follow up on this, because I do not. I do not want it to go away. The individual is more than happy to can reach out to will and myself and I can work with his build with him and his building. Okay, I'm happy to do that. Okay, do you want to? Well? How did you want to proceed? Do you want to let it see if they can work something out? First yeah. I guess I mean I guess that makes sense, provided I if that all makes sense, and that's fine, but it I guess my only favorite is that if it does not work out, if we can put this on our agenda for next month, I just do not want to let it go absolutely Timor Salomon. Why do not we unmute timor? Thank you. Thank you trisha. I just want to say thank you very much for the support in that and Colleen. I know that you have been in contact with I'm part of Treadwell Farm, Historic district and I know you've been in and actually yes and we've been working with julianne exactly yeah. Yes, we've had conversations with julianne and we are looking at the parking regulations to see what we can do to make the changes and again I I'll be I'll share with you. My email address in the chat feel free to reach out to me and we'll see what we can do to accommodate your request. Okay, thank you. So much you're welcome. Thank you. Okay, why do not we go? Why do not we go to old business, and this is an issue. That's come up that there are streets with no street cleaning regulations and Colleen. I do not while you're while you're still here. I know that. Obviously you work with sanitation, even though it's D.O.T that does the signage, and I guess the question is, you know: are there: how does that work? Does it? Is it the department of sanitation that says they want street cleaning regulations on certain streets, and then you look at them and then you put them in or how do? How does how does this? How does that system work then sure so the department of sanitation with street cleaning rule regulations, if they're looking to have those implemented, they would work with the DOT and they would let us know the hours or the days that their cleaners would be out there and again it would have to be in coordination with their schedules in the surrounding area, and they would ask us to look at it and you know, create the signs and install it for them. But please keep in mind street cleaning rule regulations also our requests that can that a resident can make through the community board where they feel like hey my street's, not being clean. I would like to see street cleaning rule regulations install and, if that's the case, then they would come before the Community Board and they would request that and of course the community board would send us a resolution and we would work with department of sanitation on the days and the hours as what's recommended, to install the signage for this Click street cleaning world regulations, we did have a email or will that talked about a particular. You know street and problem, but I do not know if there was requests specifically for this right. That would I do not think that was a request necessarily, but it also ties into the letter that we had written requesting that the Department of sanitation provide us with a list of any street within our district. That does not have street cleaning regulations currently in place, and I think what we needed was that list as a starting point to be able to go back to DOT to try to move the issue forward. Well, we have not received an answer from them. I think right. No, why do not we follow up and see? Why do not? You follow up and see if we can get something out of them, because I actually I thought they told us that all streets were cleaned and it was something like pretty laughable like that. Yes, but that that's a that's a nice goal, but I guess the question is: do they have street cleaning if they do not have street cleaning regulations and people are not going to move their cars? All right, we'll have to maybe we'll have to with the environment sanitation committee we'll have to put our heads together and see if we can get them to be a little more forthcoming, and I and I Rita had emailed me before, and I we're talking about old business, and I do not know if there's any read it. I know you wanted to raise something in old business. So why do not you go ahead and then Michelle? I know you want to make a comment too, but why does not? Why do not you go ahead and why do not we go ahead and unmute Rita popper? You know about the dangerous situation that exists on 91st Street and I wrote to you and craig after talking to management, that they really just need the street leveled where they papers have come up, and we understand that the city wo not put back the papers. Management was willing to put back the papers or there is now an insurance problem. There is somebody attending this meeting, Joel Boris, which I'd like to follow me. Please he is the president of the Condo Association and he has all the information about the problem now with insurance, yeah joel, I know he's been here before so yeah. Why do not we? Why do not? We ask Joel to comment? I'm mute Joel, I'm mutual! Please am I unmuted. Yes, I we had an issue because several people have fallen on the street, been injured and brought lawsuits. Frankly against the condominium and our insurance company as of a week ago said they were terminating the insurance for the street. Now we do not own the street and we ca not maintain the street but we're the ones who are getting sued for a community problem. If the. If the D.O.T could take their street and level it, maybe it would be possible for us to put back in the papers. Even some are missing, but we ca not leave it. This way, I'm amazed that D.O.T has not been sued yet and the city has not been sued, although they may have been, but the insurance kind of is the last straw, because now we're exposed without insurance, which, frankly, we do not have any liability in the insurance, but we do have defense costs so without insurance we have to defend I'm at my wit's end. I do not really know what the answer is colleen. Maybe you can tell me a little bit about what dot's position is and why they do not want to fix the street. Is it the street or is it the sidewalk did not? Is this? Is this the issue rita the long- standing issue with the pavers and with the undermining issue in the road street? Not the sidewalk, it's in the road bro, the sidewalk is fine in fact, but we've been through. This is not you know. I've had DEP go out there. Take a look at the structure, they did not find anything. Con Edison went out there and looked at the structure. They did not find anything as well. I think you've hired Sam Schwartz as well. Is that correct? It is, but you have to understand number one I do understand, but the city is not responsible. D.O.T is not responsible for that. So maybe it's the Ep and I've been trying. I've been trying. My best we've had site visits and I've communicated that to to the board and I to Rita and I've actually had DEP, go back out there again to take a look at the site and they're under structure, and they say: there's no undermining issue. It's not DOT is not responsible for what's going on under you know the structure there, the roadway, there's nothing under the structure anymore. There was a sewer leak and they help us if we got the work order for the sewer that was above it on third Avenue and how long was that sewer leaking? And what, if I can correct you, it was a storm drain sewer. So not the sewers. I think the DEP is there is the appropriate agency that has jurisdiction over that. It's not D.O.T, but even if the Ep has jurisdiction does DEP, are they the agency responsible for restoring the streets they're the agency responsible for fixing their structure? We are not going to restore your problems, we're not going to do that has to be done by you. No, but the question is: look let's not. We could talk about this all night, but I've talked I've talked to Ed about this and what Ed's basically said was yeah D.O.T ca not do anything with the pavers. The question is: could D.O.T just come in and repair the street period and if they and that's, I think something that we need to pursue and that's one of the alternatives. Rita presented a few alternatives, so I think we need to just follow up with this. That's terrific, if you can, if we can have either DEP or Daot, I do not really care who level the street we could go and we could hire somebody to replace the to put the pavers back down, but that ca not be done with a street that has sinkholes in it. Well, we'll Joel, we'll let we'll see if what can be done and it's a Diana bosniak whose hand is raised is also part of our wine management. Would you mind on unmuting her all right, but I mean we. I do not want to belabor this point, because why do not we unmute Diane? I just wanted to say that the last time that DEP was out that colleen had arranged for them to come out. Mike Farnand did indicate that storm drain was repaired somewhere along the way we're just trying to find out. Now, when was that storm drain repaired, and then the timeline as to you know when water was then stopped gushing into the Con Edison, because that seems to be what undermined the area up at the top there at where the con headlines are running and everything else, and if we can put a timeline on that, then everything else will fall into play. But, as we say, you know, there are sinkholes there as Joel said who's the president of the Condo Association, I'm not going to talk over him. We're willing to restore the papers we'll take them, we'll put them on the side, but we just need a flat street. How? Why would we so you're saying there's sinkholes there if you do not or if and the responsible agency does not find out what is causing the sinkhole and D.O.T comes out there and fix the roadway you're still going to have that sinkhole condition come back again about the timeline for the sewer when it was repaired, you have to ask the Ep they're the ones who would have that information. Well, I would I've asked several times: I'm not getting any response and no, I do not know where else to turn and that's why I guess we're turning here. If you're not getting, I'm surprised, I mean that you're not getting the information. If you're not getting the information I mean, maybe the board can help you with getting that information. The community board we can do but look we're not going to chase the bureaucratic tale. We want to get this done and that's why we're going to we're going to go back and see what we can get out of D.O.T, but we're not going to wait forever and then we're going to talk to D o I mean D E p, then we're going to talk to D.O.T and see what they can do, not what they ca, not wo, not do, but what they can do and that's what we want to try to get it done. Okay, thanks Rita! So let's see we Michelle's had her hand up, but why do not we unmute Michelle? Thank you. I just want to say when we're talking about sanitation signs, the alternate side of the street parking signs that used to indicate sanitation. You know either Tuesday Friday the Monday Thursday, whatever now those signs they are remaining in place, but the public has been directed to just remove their cars on the last day of that sign. So if a sign says Monday and Thursday for street cleaning, it now means that it's only Thursday and if it says Tuesday and Friday, it now means it's only Friday. So the driving public sort of knows that about the signs that are on the alternate sides of the street, so they do not need separate signage as far as the other streets. That said, either no parking, seven to seven or six to eight or whatever it said. What was the program before was that those streets could be cleaned at any time. In other words, if there's no parking there from 6 am to 8 or 7 to 7 it's during that time period, that cleaning can be done. So I'm not sure what has happened now that we are calling for new sanitation signs everywhere. What has changed in this protocol that I'm not understanding? Oh, I think, go ahead Craig. I think the issue is that there are certain streets where there are no restrictions in place and at no time is the curbside is curbside parking prohibited in one form or another. I've never seen I've never seen I mean. Maybe there are, but I've never seen a street like that. There are. There are parking regulations on every single street in the city. Now you could argue that, where there's a truck loading zone and there's a certain amount of time that- let's say it's from 7 00 A.M to 10 A.M, that cleaning can be done after 10 A.M, because the trucks are gone. If it's no parking for truck loading, seven to seven, then cleaning has to be done before 7 A.M or after 7 P.M. But every street has some kind of a parking regulation and the assumption is that the cleaning is done either before or after those regulations expire. But as soon as those regulations expire, anyone can park there legally. So the point is that at no point is there: no vehicles are no vehicles. Barred from parking over there, whether it's commercial parking transitioning into so then so then the extension that you're looking for, let's say a street says no parking from 6, am to 8 pm. A sign can then say: street cleaning from 8 P.M to 9 P.M. Is that what you're looking for right? And this is similar to what we saw on 63rd, Street and 64Th Street back? I do not know sometime earlier this year or at the end of last year, when we had a few months with consecutive issues in play where curbs were not being were not being cleaned because of a lack of signage and we put in signage on those blocks. So what had been the plan? If you know of the department of sanitation before this issue is being addressed, I mean it's. You know 50 years, this has been the circumstance. What was the protocol with the Department of Sanitation? I do not have the answer chuck. I do not know if you know if there's any history there, but that's why we're trying to get department of sanitation to provide us with a list of any blocks that do not have those street cleaning regulations in place where they essentially have no time frame where they can consistently access the curbside. It's just unusual. Okay, if we can get the answer to that, it's just unusual to me that this is now a brand new problem. I mean this. Is this? You know 50 years this has been the situation. I imagine the department of sanitation had been able to work that out, but I look forward to hearing more about it. Thank you. Thank you. Michelle Billy Freeland. Can we unmute billy thanks I'll, be quick Chuck. Thank you for pushing on this James Cagney Place issue. I think it's really important. I was just going to ask: is there anything any of us can do to help whether it's to push this forward? Establishing any sort of you know working groups to help the community navigate this because I know you've been doing a lot, but I just want to see us stay on top of it and get some sort of resolution here. Yeah. Well, let's see if, let's see what happens when we talk to D.O.T, let's see where we are. If not, we may have to form a group in March on city hall, some way, I'm always available to March. You ca not go inside these days easily Jordan woke Luke, I'm the person who put this quest. This issue in I was walking on Lexington avenue, between 77th and 78th and on the east side the sign says, because I took a photograph three- hour, commercial vehicle, Monday to Friday 7, to 10 a.m and then there's some hours when it's only two hour parking. But there is no time when there is no parking and I swear. I saw a street sweeper coming down and obviously you could not get to the curb, but I think that you'll find from 79th street down quite far several blocks that on both the East and the West side, there is no time set apart, specifically for street cleaning. Thank you Jordan. It's helpful Elita camp. Our board chair. Thank you thanks. So I'm just saying this in my private life as a well partly both but as a mediator, I'd be willing to sit down with DEP and D.O.T and the condo and see what we could work out with everyone in the same room. If that helps at all, which is not to take away from all the fine work that you've done on this chuck and craig, but to just sort it out, maybe with the papers out of the question, it makes it a whole lot easier for D.O.T, but there's a lot of finger- pointing going on and and before the snows come. If they come this year, it would be really useful to get this done. So I'm offering my services if they can be of any help at all. Thank you. Thank you. Elita, that's very nice. We can certainly look at that. Do we have any other business since I think a lot of us would like to see the debate coming up shortly? Okay, I thank you everyone for attending and we are adjourned until our meeting the first Wednesday in November. Thank you thank you chuck and craig and thank you. Everyone.
