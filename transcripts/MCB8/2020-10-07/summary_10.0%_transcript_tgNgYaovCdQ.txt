Our staff at the MTA staff, from local elected officials, offices and community organizations to help us assist in handing out mass because we are seeking to get 100 compliance in mass use, mass usage on subways and buses and we're doing Just recently following our governor cuomo's announcement that there would be fifty dollar fines for those who refuse to wear a mask in the subway or a bus.
So you know to date, we've given about 16 summonses for six summonses through Tuesday over 16 days, but of the about 500,100 interactions with people, meaning walking up to a person and asking them to please comply with the mask rule.
If, that's okay, I know that we had sent you a few questions just regarding Omni and the status of it, and some questions specific to how seniors or those who are using, reduce spare metro cards will be able to use Omni and, if they're able to use omni immediately or if there's going to be a lag in the time until they will be able to use it.
All right I had before we pass it along to the public In regards to one of the items that we were going to have today, that had to be postponed, and that is the 68th Street subway station, the ADA access and I Received some questions, and there was an article that was in the city today about the providing a little bit of an update.
We were going to present this to community board this evening, but there is still some open issues that need to be worked out and we have to do some final submittals to the fta before we can go to the public with this, but When.
However, I was concerned because at first I was very happy that not the not the bus, but the truck was starting last month And The past was here from 11:30 to 1:30, and then I think it goes to 72nd street.
For their medical appointments and for other needs, as they go out, so that that's an issue understood- And I just want you to know that they are currently working really hard to try to figure out how to make that happen, so that we can both ensure that seniors can use the bus and, at the same time ensure that our employees are safe.
So what I will do is I will take back your feedback about how the attendants in the vans are communicating with the public and let them know that it's possible that they need to get some more training on how to share information so that people are leave.
I wish I wish that we can get to get that information out sooner, but I think you know we're in a situation Okay now the last question I have has to do with people not wanting to wear masks, I've noticed that most people have masks, but if someone does not have a mask- Then they should not be able to enter the bus.
You know police officers on every train, but if they are and someone can alert a law enforcement personnel, of course, that person can be asked to either go on the mask or leave the bus now.
You know people lining up well, rather than line up if they saw signs on the buses that said go to this website fill out the form put your credit card on it.
I just wanted to similarly to Laurie's comments around finding new technologies to be used just because I'm very concerned that the MTA is telling people to go into subway stations, since cash and coins are not being accepted to refill and to get reduced,, fair metro cards for people with disabilities, that's a real barrier, because less than 25 of the transit system is accessible and in our community.
I hear what you're saying, but you must understand that did not work and that many people did not have the ability to use email or to go on the web, but more than that It's really unacceptable to say that the you know seniors will just have to wait a few weeks until we see what we can do with that.
You have two people in the in the truck And they're, both telling everybody that they can't get their money, You know to do the funding, so I hope, but we're not going to go back to asking people again to send cards back and forth.
I know it was part of the better bus action plan which is in question in terms of its funding and potential implementation, but is that something that operations planning has been working on and is it something that New York City Transit is still looking to implement?
Two years ago, we had sent a letter requesting a lot of data regarding bus ridership within community district 8., And I do not know if it's the letters on the president's desk or what, I.
I mean Sorry East of York Avenue, and this is a request for to change the parking regulations to address illegal, parking, and I do not know, is colleen here.
Things can not get through the street like ambulances and fire trucks, and it's appalling that we have had nothing come through to help us, except one day this week, We did see a police car come through and shoo everybody away.
You should have deal with the issue of the dog parking because I did not mean to You know what I was saying: They just come in and jam up the street Really it's something that should be handled by the local precinct.
I had contacted Kayla's office and a patrol car showed up a couple of days ago and got rid of the traffic in the middle of the street, but they would have to do this five six times a day.
This is craig that it looks like these parking regulations on the street have truck parking for most of the block If we received an initial email back in late, July, I believe from someone else.
The city did put in a traffic enforcement officer and that worked for a while, but once in a while they're there, but they're, not there all the time, but we did have a meeting with each of the hospitals and with Mary manning to make sure, and certainly with the you know, with all the people sitting.
I think that it's more so the hospital than anything else There's a lot of idling a lot of people who just sit in their cars, And they're, just waiting for people, but I will just say that I'm glad that you're pushing that you're going to have this as another agenda item, because I wish that valerie from East 72Nd, Street, Neighborhood Association, is here, and I just wish that we could flag this for her too, because the neighborhood association may have other things to say about this and make it and could add to it.
Yesterday There is awful, but the entire corridor is just so bad with the double parking It's really turned into a one- lane street in the middle of Monday, through Friday to the point of where people are pausing and letting one car go in one direction, then they stop and they let another car go in.
That street, are fully aware that it's a dead end, there's nobody, that's just happens to be driving down there, So the question is: what's the most efficient way of handling those people who have a need to be there?
When that you know that those trucks were blocking the bus lane and causing havoc every morning, Morton Williams, getting involved to monitor the traffic ended up being very helpful.
We know that we need to come back to parking placard We anticipate that may very well be a discussion in November, but This sort of relates as well to the situation here in terms of what is are there?
I have to confirm that, but there are certain places that placards are permitted to park and they're not permitted to park, But I do not believe they're not permitted to park in a no, stopping area, they're, not, and that's, and that's where it's going with this The thing is that I can't speak on behalf of the traffic enforcement agent, because I do not know what really goes on with the ticketing issue.
I know the no stopping is more of a stringent regulation in terms of do not even pull up at this curb to use it for pick up or drop off right, and my question was really whether we should consider installing those in the Cul- de- sac area to keep the turnaround area free to allow emergency vehicles to be able to make those turnarounds.
I do not know if there's any other answer and also I'm wondering if you're working on the streets and repaving, When it rains, out, I think would increase the safety they're already so congested that anything that helps, I think, would be useful.
It's just going to create more of a not the social distancing, but that's, That's why you would have regulations, because those are the same issues that come up with restaurants, where they have fixed tables and chairs that take up a lot of sidewalks It's coming up that borough board and other boards have the same response that it could be really useful, but I won't take up any more time.
And I was the one that worked with Colleen and Cv-8 in July, June or July to change the parking on Cherokee place to add the two spots on both sides for no standings for the radius turns I'm just going to do a quick, little follow- up, which I've emailed will and The parking rules are not being followed by the drivers of the cars with placards.
Just to let people know that there's new regulations- See that may work.
If there is one thing that I know in the last community board, eight meeting we had brought Or I had brought up, was in regard to which I'm sure you've heard resident complaints about accessing our homes.
As many of you know, the mayor, announced as part of the city's response to Covid-19 that nine new miles of temporary bike lanes, which including 61st and 62nd streets from fifth to York, to be installed, 61st and 62nd streets were chosen.
We will continue to monitor those conditions and both you know to see what modifications we can make with the design as needed, We have been working very closely with the local precinct to deal with the with the congestion complaints that we've been receiving and what we did.
It's just about safe access for our elderly and our children to be able to come to and from the curb, without crossing a street of heavy traffic with cars and then looking both ways in the bike lane, because people do use the bike lane in both directions, though they should not be.
Since these bike lanes have been put in, it seems like I'm spending all my time on them, fielding either emails or are hotline phone calls at least 10 of the buildings that belong to the association, and I do not know how many people have complaints about these bike lanes and many of them have written to the commissioner colleen and will continue.
We sit behind the trucks and some people go in the bike lanes or go on the sidewalk or just so that you know they hang with it.
That's got to get by something that's parked in the middle of the street You're just going to rip through the bike.
Just so you know they're going to make they want to make the crosstown bike lanes permanent at some point.
We need to address part some of the parking issues perhaps and address ways to ensure that we have those two through lanes, always operating and working, or else we do get that congestion and the air quality impacts and the noise impacts, and no one wants that.
That brings me also to a larger point that we need to come back to, and this is more systemic than just here on 61st and 62nd street, and that is, we have to really come up with the strategy and The city absolutely needs to do to take the lead on this, but how to deal with all the double parking and the access issues, whether they be because of bike lanes or open restaurants or anything else where, as soon as a car stops.
I. Think we've reimagined the way that our streets work, And, I'm, a big proponent of bike lanes as well, The way that we've done it now is such that when there is a double parked car or a double parked truck, it really screws everything up and there can be.
I'm, not saying eliminate the bike, lane, I'm, really just if there's But if there's as Mr Solomon is saying a way to use some of that buffer to allow access for those residents, I think we need to do something tonight on this.
I think it's great that the community board want to think about these projects holistically and think about the impacts with terms with you, know, in terms of parking laws or commercial trucks and curbside access and so forth, and it's a lot.
Does that system work Then sure, so the department of sanitation with street cleaning rule regulations?
Of course, the community board would send us a resolution and we would work with department of sanitation on the days and the hours as what's recommended, to install the signage for this Click street cleaning world regulations, we did have a email, or will that talked about a particular.
Think what we needed was that list as a starting point to be able to go back to DOT, to try to move the issue.
But I guess the question is: do they have street cleaning if they do not have Street cleaning regulations and people are not going to move their cars?
You know about the dangerous situation that exists on 91st Street, And I wrote to you and craig after talking to management, that they really just need the street leveled where they papers have come up, and we understand that the city won't put back the papers.
I. Think the issue is that there are certain streets where there are no restrictions in place and at no time is the curbside is curbside parking prohibited in one form or another.
