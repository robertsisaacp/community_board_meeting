So, thank you. Well. Are you keeping whoops? Sorry? Are you keeping track of how many board members we have? I am not Rebecca and Gore. You have your hand up. I am I added a formula so far we're at 24. right, I'll keep working on it. This is why we just making your case right now. I always do it it's important to know we have a quorum, it is I think we do, but I'm not counting Blue tell me: when will we have it one more moment? I just want to get a couple other things in order and please don't forget to text when you see any elected officials that are here, I will and I'm actually about to send you. Oh the public speakers exactly because that's important that was actually the thing I was asking you to wait on. Ah, okay c, so I'm texting you the first list and if there's anything, that's added afterwards know that I'll update you, okay, there, it is I, see it. Did you hear that little ding-a-ling or whatever sound? That is no. What's that lettuce? Oh a lot of people! Okay, are we ready? We are okay, then, let's begin hi everyone good evening welcome to the November meeting of Community board, eight, I'm Elita Camp and I'm chair of Community board eight. So welcome as I mentioned. Our program this evening involves public speakers. Each public speaker will have two minutes to address the board and everyone else who's here and after that we will have reports from the elected officials or their reps and then move into executive session in the executive session. Anyone who would like to speak from the public will not be able to unless you can get a board member to make your comment for you. I know it works very differently when we're in a public meeting live, but we're not we're on zoom, which has its benefits and it's I guess failures would be a way to put it, but it's not really a failure anyway, we're glad to have zoom and able to see each other, which is much more effective than a 50 person and more conference call, but that's neither here nor there so welcome to to our meeting, and we should begin if you'd like to speak in the public session. Please make sure that you've signed up by 6:45 will text me. Your names, I'll read you in numbers of three: when I read your name, please raise your hand your virtual hand. It's under the participants menu. If you go to the bottom of your screen, you'll see as we like to describe it. Two little figures shoulders up that says: participants if you click on that you'll see the people who are actually in the meeting and at the bottom of that are a number of little circles in colors and there's a hat says Ray's hand if you click on that your hand will be raised you're the top of the screen, so that will can see you and I can see. You will unmute. You and you'll have an opportunity to speak. So please don't forget to raise your hand, it makes the process easier, we'll get to the procedures for the full board votes when we get there in time. So thank you. Okay at this point, why don't we begin with the public session and let me just check the names so again, when you hear your name, please raise your hand. We'll begin with bond and if I mispronounce your name, I'm terrible at this, so please forgive me: Wonderlaya Fall, Betty, Cooper, Wallerstein and Adam Grumbach. If you could raise your hands, will unmute you one at a time and you'll have a two minute limit, as I mentioned, and if you're on the phone, it's star, nine to raise your hand, bundle a fall, Betty, Cooper, Wallerstein and Adam Grumbach I, don't see any hands raised. Okay, while they're doing that. Why don't we just go to the next couple of people and we'll come back to you so that we can keep this moving Martin, Bell and Susan Peters? Are you here? Okay, there? Okay! So let's start with Marty Belden All right Marty, whenever you mute you'll have two minutes hi. How are you I'm here because I want to just express my disappointment and actually my outrage at the Zoning committee's failure to take an appropriate action last night with respect to the proposed tower on the blood bank site, it's a 334 foot, mid block commercial building in a residential, neighborhood I. Think the blood bank played the committee like a fiddle and was a Trojan horse talking about how great the blood bank is, which we all agree but never getting to the commercial tower, which is a pure profit maker for a Boston developer. The committee website says it's supposed to address issues related to height, bulk and size, and it should have been pretty simple, because this is a 334 foot tower mid block in a commercial residence. That's zoned for 75 feet and the committee members were it was like I was in a bizarre world, someone said well, they should engage with Julia Richmond. First, they could buy every kid a lollipop. It's still going to be a 330-foot floor for commercial building. Someone said they should talk about. Well, maybe they could have deliveries at night and stagger work hours. I mean what world is that person living in? That's just not how commercial buildings are going to work. There were hundreds and hundreds of people who were unanimously opposed. I have screenshots I can share with you that show the only people of Fort were those there for the developer, and yet the committee at the end wants a wishy-washy letter, not saying that they were opposed but saying that people in the community had concern. I just asked you to look at one thing. Thankfully, you posted the trip, the video at 36 minutes and 35 seconds to show a just give me. Let me finish the one thought they show a picture of a 45 square block area with this 18 tallest buildings mark and they say. Oh look at our building, we're at the lower end of the range Marty I would like you to leave your contact information. Please email it to will. The chairs of the Zoning committee will be in touch with you. I was at that meeting last night. I'm writing the letter, which will not be a wishy-washy letter, which is a better result than having, as we described it last night, a split vote on a resolution. You may have heard that there were people there on from the board at the committee meeting, who would not have voted in support of the resolution and rather than have a split resolution which would not have the impact of a letter and having them come back and having a resolution one way or the other at the right time. We're very well aware of the community opposition, the community outrage and the number of members of the community who were there last night. Please do not fear the community board not taking appropriate action. We will at it at a in a way that will have the most impact on the decision makers on the city council, members on the borough president's office and hopefully on the blood center. We understand there are a lot of issues and we will be moving in an appropriate way in an appropriate time. Please leave your contact information so that as I mentioned, so that the chairs of the zoning and Development committee could be in touch and talk about it, we will have a timeline. We will have the information on our website. We know and understand completely that community is very distressed and opposes this building and you're right. We didn't take a full count. We did a straw vote. The vast majority were opposed to it. We are well aware of concerns and objections and opposition. Again, I'm very I'm sorry that you were disappointed. Okay, let's move on to to do. We have bundle of fall, Betty, Cooper, Wallistein or Adam Grumbach or Susan Peters. Here I see Susan Peters, I'm going to start with her everybody else. Please raise your hand through the participants, menu Susan, Peters unmute yourself at the bottom of your screen. Thank you. I am a long time resident of New York City and a member of a local group NYC for wired tech, I wish to say a few words to alert all community members to a health danger in our neighborhood. The city of New York has approved all in one shot: the installation of 11,500 wireless antennas on utility poles. You can see one on almost every corner, it's a rectangular box and it has an antenna coming out of it. I, don't know if you can see the antenna, but that's what's on the corners, you can look for them. They're there, these house, radio frequency antennas for wireless communication, but what is not informed to the public is the high levels of radio frequency radiation coming from the antennas. These levels are already causing residents of our city to move from their apartments, where antennas have been stalled on corners near their apartments, they are too sick to live where they are instead of New York City testing the power coming from the antenna, the Fcc in Washington allows the telecom corporations to self-report the actual power. They are. The fox in charge of the Hen house and I just want to say that recently, the state of new Hampshire, the government of new Hampshire, issued a report saying these antennas have come into question because of the thousands of peer-reviewed studies documenting deleterious health effects associated with cell phone radiation exposure. This is the state of new Hampshire saying stop. We have to study this city. Thank you very much. Please contact me. If you want more information, please make sure that you send your contact information to the office. We have both an environment and sanitation committee and a health seniors and Social Services Committee who'll be able to talk to you and review what you have and possibly put it on the agendas to look at okay. Great! Thank you. Okay, unless bundle of fall, Betty, Cooper, Wallerstein, Adam, Grumbach, Bill, Angelos, Tara, Wilson, Anthony Barrett. If any of you are here I see, Adam is here: okay, let's go to Adam, then Adam. You have two minutes good evening. My name is Adam Grumbach, I'm with the Julia Richmond education complex, which is located directly across the street from the blood center. Our concerns with the blood centers proposed expansion are mainly around the shadow that was cast Josh Satin, who was the building manager, spoke last night. They asked me to come tonight because I work with the building council, the shadows that the building will cast over Saint Catherine's park and our building in general, which we think are significant, but looking at the artists rendering last night, the thing that struck me was that was the rendering of 67th street. It looked as though it was a three-lane boulevard that had all this room for traffic every day at Julia, Richmond, there's a traffic backup when the school buses arrive in the morning to drop off the district 75 students on the autism spectrum, with significant cognitive delays and the buses have to jockey for position, because there's parked cars on both sides of the street. The blood center will bring in you know with this expansion would bring tremendous amounts of increased traffic and would cause real safety problems for the buses attempting to drop off students with significant needs. In addition, just the construction for four years and the air quality problems would pose problems for some of our students, many of whom have asthma, and you know four years in the life of a student going to school is roughly the time they will spend in our school. So major construction is always a problem. Those are our main concerns and that's why we are opposed to the blood centers expansion at this time. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you very much. There's no vote on the blood center this evening, but I'm happy to hear from all of the residents and entities that have a position and invite you to come back when we will post when there is a meeting and with respect to the air quality, we will noted for the the scoping and environmental impact statement. So thank you. Please make sure. I know that you're with J wreck, that you leave your name with will or email. Thank you. Okay I see that Tara Wilson and Anthony Barrett have their hands raised. So, let's start with them before we go back. Tara hi I represent 333 e 66Th street. I'm a resident there I attended the meeting last night and I just wanted to mention that we're definitely concerned that tower will impact the light of our building's common rooftop a place that was essential to the mental and physical health of our residents throughout Covid-19. Our rooftop was used as a place for children to do schoolwork, adults to exercise and work from home seniors, get access to sunlight and fresh air safely and for families to share a meal having a 33-storey tower loom over our common rooftop block or sunlight. It will be incredibly detrimental to the mental and the physical health of the residents of our building. We don't understand whether our existing infrastructure can support the addition of several thousand more people on our block. We're concerned that the added stress that the building will add to our overall traffic streets and as a responsible member of the community, the Nybc should consider the impact that the proposed tower will have on the streets that are being used to transport critically ill residents of this neighborhood to the hospitals that the Nybc serves streets that are already too congested because of cross park and 59Th street bridge traffic. We have concerns about the noise and the air pollution, the debris, the disruption of our daily lives during the construction period, as our block will function as a service entrance for the building. We have concerns about the large amount of dangerous wastes that will leave the blood center and, finally, there's a reason why the existing zoning laws are in place. It's meant to keep the integrity of the residential neighborhood compromising by allowing a huge Midwalk tower is going to set a bad president for the rest of the neighborhood. Thank you for everyone who is speaking or about the blood center or for any other reason. If you make sure that will has your email address, you'll be on our mailing list and you'll get notifications of our meetings so that you can come back or make statements as appropriate. Thank you. Okay I see Anthony Barrett Anthony hi good evening. Unfortunately, I couldn't speak last night and so I'll just say. A few comments on the existing blood bank proposal I serve as a board member 301 e 66th street 200 units, 17-story condo building that lies directly adjacent to the proposed development, not just an immediate impact of this colossal structure, right on our property line, our strenum of issues with respect to the proposal, including related to the mid-block zoning, which was established over 30 years ago by the arrest, the residential neighborhood, to prevent this type of abuse of our zoning laws. Its establishment was to maintain the context of our residential neighborhood and allow sun and light to penetrate the street in agreement for that zoning change. At the time huge bulky buildings were allowed to be built at the block ends and that's where we've been so far now we're going to disrupt that whole process. Specifically to this development on 66th street, there will be a four foot setback for the entire length of 66th street. Imagine a sheer street wall going up mid block 330 feet nearly 33 stories 200 feet along a full width of a narrow street. Existing mid block allows a maximum street ball of 65 foot and an additional 10 foot after the required setback. The blood bank fails to even meet this requirement. You've got to remember the size of the site. It's 200 by 225 feet, that's larger than the empire state Building right now. The excessive height and impact will have on the contextual layout of this predominantly resonant residential neighborhood can not be disregarded and then getting back to the sunlight and Saint Catherine's park and JREC. The presentation last night was I believe misrepresented that they focus solely on the park. They did not include the playground for the kids, they did not include JREC and those two areas will be much more severely. Impacted than the park itself as the park is further east than the rest of the school and are happy to submit my further comments to the board. Thank you and again we invite everyone to come back when we will be taking a vote on the matter of the blood center. Thank you. Oh please, Anthony. Please make sure that your contact information is with the board office. Okay, trying again Bundalia Fall Betty, Cooper Wallerstein we now have are looking at Bill, Angelos and Matthew David I see Matthew is up. There. I hope that I'm getting the name in the right order and Wendy Mccaber. If you could raise your hands, please. Thank you. Okay, we'll yeah Matthew of two minutes. Okay, thank you guys. Thank you, Anthony. Thank you. Community members I have a couple of quick comments. First and foremost, what struck me about the zoning request yesterday was that if you looked at the height requirements for the blood bank and the space, they would occupy themselves. It was four floors. 20 foot, 216 foot and a 24 foot floor. Their building requirements would fit in the existing zone space right now. The additional nine floors and the entire added height above that would be for profit rented out to partners. It would not be used by the blood bank. Second, the project claims to be further community improvement all around by bringing jobs. However, it would negatively impact everyone in the community who uses that park. The children during the summer when it's most used would have the greatest impact up to four hours a day of shadow and reduced sunlight. This would destroy the community area for all who use the park and adjacent areas and, most importantly, if the blood bank is moving for four years during this planned construction to a facility that will meet their needs, why then do they need to move back to a facility with that much greater added space again solely for the profit of this developer? In an adjunct facility, where the blood bank itself, our community neighbor, is not using utilizing any of the space. Those were my points. Thank you guys for listening. I really hope we all do the right thing for the community and our neighbors. Thank you again for everyone to make sure we have your contact information, okay, Wendy and then Andrew Rabisquiere and Domenico Aiello I s I, see that will others the June Soto June. Are you here in place of someone who's signed up? Maybe they have a wrong name on their zoom? Maybe someone else? Okay! Would you could you identify yourself here on muted June person named June Soto nope, they muted themselves, so going on to Wendy I? Think you're unmuted go ahead, two minutes: okay, Elita. We want to thank you for your leadership and advocacy on behalf of the people living in and doing business in community board. Eight. We very much appreciate your service, as New York tries to establish a new normal and going forth. Despite pandemic life, voters are seeing a renewal in applications for new building construction. We welcome sensible new construction. It is only it is not only not sensible but harmful when developers attempt a race to the sky and building monster tall buildings. Construction above the 210 foot level is responsible for an exponential increase in climate change. Pollution has shown in data-driven studies, tall buildings in New, York City are responsible for 67 to 75 percent of all of our climate change pollution. This horrific increase in greenhouse gases causes a rise in asthma rates, cardiac disease and flooding, and these are only a few of the effects that we're already seeing. Please note that climate change pollution disproportionately affects black New Yorkers. For decades, New Yorkers have been given the false promise. The tall real estate contr construction would provide better medical facilities, upgraded transportation, affordable housing, lower homeless rates, new senior centers schools and the like look around this model of supposed developer. Incentives of trading height for citizen amenities has not and does not work as we adjust to pandemic life. These false promises are again surfacing whether in the context of upzoning as of right, manipulation or unbridled variances. Meanwhile, affordable housing units are destroyed and not replaced. Neighborhood amenities are not being built. Permanent jobs are not created, but burdens on our city services on our firefighters, our peacekeepers, our hospital beds are, and our infrastructure increase at an escalating cost to working in middle class. Cba voters with every building built above the 210 foot height cap, even with remediation or Leed certification, the additional height creates climate change pollution that stays in our atmosphere for three hundred to one thousand years. The interaction between tall buildings creates an exacerbation of our heat island index just last night. Oh, please can I just finish the one sentence. Just last night at the Zoning committee meeting two applicants for new construction. Well above the two ten foot height cap, let alone the lower mid blocks limits. Had projects considered. It's ironic that these applicants are providers of medical care research and yet, if their projects were to go forward with the heights proposed, they would cause irreparable harm to our well-being. Thank you Wendy for those who thank you well for those who may be new here. You understand I, hope that you understand that CBA is working hard to get the area rezoned those avenues- east of third and east, to a 210 foot height limit where we're working hard on that, okay, Andrew and then Nico, oh and June still has her hand raised. Let's go to Andrew and Nico and then see will so I see. Bill Angelos also is here and he has his like button I'll get to him afterwards. Then, let's go to bill because he was higher up on the list. You know he signed up. First, okay, sorry Andrew, we know Angie's got patience, he's listening to me, mispronounce his name, hello! Yes bill! Can you hear me? Yes, thank you all right. Thank you. Well, like I discussed regarding the follow-up, yesterday's meeting regarding the blank the blood bank. The bloodbath scale it is the building is out of scale for the community. It's 334 foot in my building, I'm located on 301 east 66th street between the second between 66 67th street and second Avenue, is overlooking the blood bank. The scale of the building will block our sunlight and our views and that we need to address the mental illness. Wait they'll, wait! One second, we'll wait! Stop the timer I have to reconnect to my phone and I. Don't want to miss what bill is saying. My internet connection is horrible right now, so let all in please and then we could get started again and thank you, everyone for your patience. I just don't want to miss any member of the public. Hey! Okay in the meeting. This meeting is. Thank you. Okay, just restart your two minutes, go ahead and go okay. The bloodbath proposed building is a massive scale. It's a 300,334 foot, building directly behind my building, which I'm located on 301 east 66th street between 67th street, on 2Nd Avenue, overlooking the back entrance of the block bank can build the building as of right. The square footage as of right, will be much more than the proposed development with the private developer and they have not provided any impact analysis to my building as well enabling buildings but I also like to address the the variance of the requesting is not the blood bank. If the private developer is a question of a variance with respect to the traffic on 66 67th street, it's a major thoroughfare. There's a crosstown street into what, on the west side is also used by the Coast Sun Bus and on 67th street, of course, still street from the blood bank. The school bus school was heavily trafficked used by school buses. Well, I mean the whole purpose of the R8 R8B is to preserve the integrity of the community and is contrary to the mid-block proposed development through the blood bank, the other life science buildings salon catering had a low rise, a building on 64 on 68th street seven story, building between first and second avenue. They have another medical laboratory on 64th street between first and second Avenue. The blood bank can comply with it with the zoning, along with your Sloan Kettering. Thank you. We will be looking at all of these issues that you and other residents in the neighborhood would have raised. Thank you, Andrew and then Nico hi. Thank you for letting me speak and Elita. As long as you. Let me speak. You can pronounce my name. However, you want thank you for letting me come to your meetings and speaking about the need for a 210 foot height cap on all new devices immediately and I am speaking about this goal with renewed urgency for the following two reasons. First of all, as many of us felt today and as any game of thrones fans know, winter is coming today was really cold and that is going to limit the amount of customers that restaurants, who have been struggling during this pandemic can have to bring in revenue. The second development is that New York City public schools are going to be closed tomorrow, because the Covid-19 positivity rate is above 3 city wide, and these two ingredients of change provide the perfect recipe for mom and pop shops, particularly restaurants, to lose customers and go out of business and for luxury real estate developers to swoop in buy a block of buildings at a time in order to gather air rights and race towards the sky, not including sufficient, if any housing that is affordable and ruining our environment for many years to come by contributing the climate change which I know Wendy just spoke about. In addition, many people will be displaced from their homes, further, exacerbating our homelessness crisis, which will worsen our city spread of cover 19, because shelters are a particular hot spot for Covid-19 transmission. This year has made clear that we need to make big bold changes in the way that we structure our city and this 210 foot height cap is an absolutely essential start. I urge CBA to continue pushing forth on this height limit I, look forward to helping out in any way that I'll come in. Thank you. We are, as I mentioned, really working hard to try and get that height limit. Thank you, Niko. You just unmute yourself, hi, sorry about that. So this is my first meeting. So, first of all, thank you for your attention. I, don't want to believe the point too much since I know. We've heard a lot of great points on this already today, but I just wanted to formally register my concern also for the Neuric Blood Center construction project and to be clear it it's not opposing the blood center. You know they do amazing work and we fully support them wanting to renovate the building that they have. But I just want to reiterate some of the points that I think have already been made specifically around this commercial rezoning, mid-block this extra four hours of shadow on the park nearby and in particular the developer greed that is very clearly present in the construction project. You know, as was mentioned, it was actually mentioned yesterday in the meeting that you know they did their best to keep the size of the building as small as could be, but that really feels demonstrably false. Considering the actual requirements needed by the blood bank- and you know, as was mentioned earlier, you know the rest of that is meant for profit rental. So you know thank you for your attention. Just wanted to reiterate those points. Alita are you there hi I am a technological mess tonight. Let me put my headphones in and see if I can get this to work. Let me put my headphones in and see. If I can get this to work, I'm just a bundle of I, don't know what can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you okay, good, thank you and I could hear you much better too. I'm sorry about that. Honestly. The public session sign up lasts until 6:45 for our full board meetings. So if you did not sign up before that time, it is at the discretion of our chair. I do see that Adam K, who is his hand, raised right now, did sign up just before seven o'clock Elita. Would you like to go to him Adam? If are you here on the blood center? Yes is it? Do you have something different to say, given that we're not voting tonight than any of the other speakers have said I. If you can hear me, I know I again, it's more just the perspective of a resident at 301 e66, which is the building directly adjacent in my apartment. An entire balcony looks out over that and more they're, just okay opposition I think we're really aware of the opposition, but still I like to be well, let's just say, fair and inclusive. So if we give you one minute, could you speak fast? I will be fast. I've, my family and I've lived here for 10 years. We purchased the apartment that we're in after extensively researching what the far was and always worried that the blood bank would need to be renovated and never in a million years believe that a 33-story tower could be all of 20 feet from my apartment, staring at a wall windows beyond looking at that and eliminating all the light for literally an entire block, but an entire building, ruining half the building, I'm most worried about the park, which is the only park in the city in the neighborhood and basically eliminating all the light from the park for four hours a day. Just seems inconceivable that we'd ever permit such a thing like that. I obviously support the blood bank, but I just want to reiterate the pain and suffering it would put this entire building through. Thank you very much and thank you. Everyone for your patience with my trials and tribulations of technology I think we're that's it then right will for the public session. No, we had one more that got in right before the wire and it's one of our board members Valerie Mason, oh Valerie, right Valerie, please go ahead! Thank you. Hi I want to step away from my board position and I want to talk a little bit about the blood center for a second and to thank all the community members. Who've come out tonight to speak about it. Frankly, I live in Bedpen Alley too. This project is very disturbing. I'm not going to wait for the next community board Mem meeting on this subject, and neither should anybody else who is against this project and to that end, I just want to announce that the Department of city planning is having their scoping meeting regarding the project it's going to be held on December 15th and you can send in written objections. You can see what the plan looks like and you can- and you don't have to wait to put in your objections, because the community, if we are all against this, should let the city know and if you go to hold on one second I, just Www.Nyc.Gov, slash, site, slash, planning, slash, applicants, slash scoping, hyphen documents, DOT page, you will get all the information. Do not wait for the blood center to come back to the community board. Let the city of New York know that you believe in the zoning requirements we have and that you and what all of your individual comments are and start organizing in your buildings. If you feel that strongly, thank you, Valerie will posted the the web with the website for the information or to send in your statements for the scoping meeting and whether or not the blood center comes back. We will be still looking at this I realize that we have a schedule and a time frame in meetings, but we will be looking into it whether or not we have the cooperation and the transparency that we expect from the blood center. Thank you for bringing that up. Valerie. Okay, all right, then, let's move back to the agenda. Is there a motion to adopt the agenda? Thank you, Valerie. Is there a second? That's our reader, okay and I, see Rebecca handed up: okay, great okay, all in favor. Well, any objections raise your hand. I forget we're, not live any objections. Don't see any will. Do you see any okay? Then the agenda is adopted. Is there? Are there any objections to the minutes? If you, if there are, please raise your hand if you need a correction I, don't see any of that motion to adopt the minutes. Rebecca Dangor raised her hand up. Okay, Elizabeth seconded any objections, raise your hand okay, so the minutes are adopted as well. Okay, then we move on to the elected official reports. Excuse me: do we have Isabel here or potentially borough President Gail Brewer, any elected officials will I thought. I saw Rebecca C right. Yes, our assemblywoman is here so I'm going to unmute her okay, we'll begin with Assemblymember State Assembly member Rebecca, C Wright Welcome Assemblymember good evening. It's great to join you all tonight for this very important board meeting and it's an honor and a privilege to be sent back to Albany to keep up the fight for our community and for the budgetary resources that we need to maintain and enhance the quality of life on the Upper, East side, Yorkville and Roosevelt Island. During early voting recently we saw long lines that wrapped around the Wagner Middle School three times and people were waiting to vote for up to six hours. A hundred and eighteen thousand people were sent to vote at Wagner, Middle School, the largest, not only in New York City, but in New York state I called on the State Board of Elections Commissioner Doug Kellner, to meet me at Wagner, Middle School, where we held a press conference and prepared litigation papers against the New York City Board of elections to correct this immediately. We worked out an agreement with the president of Marymount Manhattan college, who was ready, willing and able to offer her campus. We secured from the commissioners of the board of elections immediately and suspended our litigation for Marymount to be opened for the final weekend of early voting. There were no lines and voting was as easy as it should be. You may have seen the situation covered in us quoted in the Washington Post, as this was simply a matter of voter suppression of senior citizens, voter suppression of people with disabilities and voter suppression of working men and women. It was totally unacceptable. One of the things that I'm calling on now that the election has passed is for hearings to be held around the state. To put in more reforms and make more corrections of our voting process, this week is transgender awareness week, I'm a proud ally, standing up for the rights and visibility of the Lgbtq plus Community and fighting bigotry of any kind on November 7th. When major news outlets called the election for Joe Biden, the transgender community watched as the President-Elect specifically mentioned them in his victory speech, the first U.S President-Elect in history to do so. The mention in his acceptance speech was a symbolic shift from a presidential administration that has spent the past four years repeatedly erasing protections for transgender people in health care, federal employment, federal prisons, homeless, shelters and other housing services receiving federal funds on the state level. We continue to advocate for the rights of Trans people in the wake of discrimination in all aspects of life. We are a lead sponsor of the transgender curriculum bill, along with Senator Brad Hoyleman in the state Senate. Unfortunately, we continue to see an upward trend of Covid-19 cases and it's a stark reminder that we must all continue to be vigilant with social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing governor Cuomo announced new restrictions on bars and gyms and restaurants with a new close time of 10 pm. Just today, the New York City Department of Education announced a fully remote learning with cases surging and holidays approaching. New Yorkers are strongly encouraged to follow the precautions outlined in the Department of Health's holiday guide, including hosting virtual gatherings celebrating outdoors and not traveling or quarantining and getting tested. If travel is unavoidable. In honor of veterans day, we had the privilege of honoring women veterans who worked to help the United States efforts in World War, one at a ceremony held in central park just inside at 69th street. This was the second annual tribute that Howard teach in our office co-founded in 1925, a memorial grove of 24 trees and a flagstaff were installed to pay tribute to the women who were most eager to serve their country, but the least celebrated for their contributions. We were proud to also recognize veterans during town hall Tuesday with the New York City Department of Veterans services, commissioner other experts and veterans from right here on the Upper East side. Last evening we held a town hall Tuesday, with a special focus on Roosevelt Island, as of September 25th Roosevelt Island has lost its only banking institution. The amalgamated bank, with the bank closing this leaves two atms that accept only withdrawals to fill the banking needs of the residential business and academic communities. This is simply unacceptable. I was on Roosevelt Island today for the dedication and ribbon cutting of the Blackwell Historical House and talked to voters and residents on the island. Who've been impacted and affected by the fact that there is no bank on the island. We call on the New York State Department of Financial services, superintendent, Linda Lacewell, to bring banking to Roosevelt Island, immediately it's home to many elderly and disabled individuals, and now more than ever they will need access to community banking. In addition to calling on banking regulators, I am a member of the Assembly Banking committee and work with chairman Avenatti to find solutions for Roosevelt Island. As we are seeing a second wave, we will also be monitoring the conditions at Kohler Hospital with the color task force. I want to thank Elita your chairwoman for joining us at the meeting last night and for serving on the Kohler Task Force New York state is providing 328 million dollars for the home energy assistance program heap, which helps income eligible families, pay heating costs. Please contact our office for more information on how to apply or if you know, someone in Need 212-288-4607. Please continue to consider us as a resource. We have a no-cost housing clinic on Tuesdays at 4 pm. The next one will take place on Tuesday November 24th. It does book out so reserve your spot early tomorrow and every Thursday between 12 and 2 P.M. Our office holds a no-cost PPE giveaway at 1485 York Avenue between 78th and 79th street. This weekend on Sunday November 22nd from 9 am to 2 pm. We will be hosting a shred-a-thon at the 92nd street green market at First, Avenue and just to wrap up I have a very special citation to present tonight on behalf of the New York State Assembly for Elita Camp as she concludes her service to you as Manhattan community. This is a surprise. I have one month left. Well we're going to do it tonight, because I know you have your election later this year, she's chair of the City Aids Committee, on Kohler, Hospital and co-chair of the CBA congestion pricing task force am I being timed. We have been so proud to have her and stand with us in advocacy. She's participated in a number of press conferences that our office has conducted and she's truly made her mark as a collaborator and community advocate. We thank her for her outstanding dedication and let me see if this will show. We thank you for your leadership on behalf of the New York State Assembly, for your dedication to the Upper, East side, Yorkville and Roosevelt Island. Here we go and this will be sent to you Elita here we go, I'm so touched I, don't know what to say. I hope that I fulfilled all of the hopes given to me, but I'm I will save that for the next month. I just am glad. I have a little bit more time left to continue to work for the community, but before you go assembly, member I would like to say, and my computer, oh goodness- and frozen. Thank you. Oh that's beautiful! Thank you! Oh I, don't know what to say. I do want to thank you, though, for all of your service on behalf of the Manhattan communities, including Roosevelt Island of the women in the state of New York of people who don't have as strong a voice as some other communities and wish you much luck in the challenges and trials of the coming year. We know how difficult the budget cuts and some polarization and just overall issues there are in Albany. So we wish you good speed and thank you for continuing your enthusiastic and effective representation of us. Thank you. Okay, so I know that some other elected officials are planning to attend, but in the meantime everyone is here on behalf of an elected official. If you could raise your hand, it makes it much easier for will to find you and be able to call on you, so so will, if you could call in them in order in which they've raised their hands, we're happy to hear from all of them. Thank you all right, we'll start with Alan from the Da's office and again just like what we had earlier you'll see a two minute: timer I will try to not cut you off, but just know that we're timing, you guys so Alan as soon as you unmute at the bottom of your screen. I'll start the timer okay hi good evening, Community Board aid. My name is Alan Valeri, I'm with the Manhattan district attorney's office. The Office of Cyrus fans have a brief announcement about a recent event that we had last month at Bethel, Gospel Assembly, alongside with the NYPD within community board 11, our office hosted a gun buyback which took off 48 guns off of the streets. We're continuing to engage in community events all across Manhattan, be it at zoom, of course, virtually to maintain safety and make sure everybody stays safe during Covid-19, I'm the liaison to Community Board, 8 and Community board. 7 and I'll leave my contact information with the board. If anybody has any questions later for the district attorney's office, and that's all thank you very much Alan, it's a pleasure to meet you and thank you for the update and I'm glad that gun buyback program was a success. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Will next we have Mike Simpson from the comptroller's office. This is the earliest I've won. I've tried clicking right hand as fast as possible for the past few meetings, the fastest I got. So. Thank you just two quick updates from controller Stringer's office. Last week, the comptroller announced his support for a breakthrough proposal released by the New York Taxi workers alliance to address the taxi medallion crisis that has led to widespread financial devastation among drivers whose medallion values have plummeted. Their plan calls on lenders to write down outstanding loans to a maximum of 125,000, allowing medallion owners to repay loans. On terms they can afford with current earnings and under this agreement, the city would act as a backstop for medallion loans held by individual owners. After reviewing the proposal, our office has concluded that it offers a comprehensive risk management approach that could reduce future liability and costs for taxpayers and then today, I know it's been a heck of a day in news, but the comptroller took court action to force the city to comply with the subpoena issued pursuant to his investigation into the city's preparedness for in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, following months of stalling and refusals to fulfill, to fully comply with the subpoena issued in June. The comptroller today filed a petition in the New York County Supreme Court, seeking a court order to compel the city to promptly and completely comply with the subpoena. The petition details how the city has consistently stymied the production of documents repeatedly missed production deadlines, several of which the city set for itself and recently declared it would not be able to provide all requested documents until April at the earliest. Nearly a year after the comptroller launched the investigation, so I'll drop. Some of that stuff into the chat, and thank you again for allowing me to speak. Thank you very much Michael. It's always a pleasure to see you and you can bring your baby pictures will sorry. Next up, we have Jenna Klaus from council member Keith, Powers Office, hello, everyone, I'm Jenna from council member Keith Power's office on the legislative front council member powers held a hearing a few weeks ago about housing and re-entry looking at the obstacles that formerly incarcerated people face in finding and keeping affordable housing. The council member also sponsored a resolution to bring ballot drop-off box to the city, which will be super valuable moving forward, and he also introduced a bill to remove the issuance and administration of press credentials from the NYPD to an independent city agency. As I've mentioned previously, our office is contracting with an organization called Ace this year for extra cleaning in the district. So far, they've already helped out in a lot of areas of the district include, including a community cleanup on East 86Th street. They also helped to keep our poll sites clean during early voting and they went to Wagner Middle School a few times to pick up trash in the area and then I just want to remind everybody to please. Let me know if you see any spots that need extra cleaning or extra attention and we are happy to send our team over there. Thank you, Jenna. Okay, it looks like we have Rebecca Griega hi good evening, everyone. This is Rebecca from Assemblymember, Dan, Cordsoff office, I, hope you're all doing well. For my report tonight, I have a few notes. Some of you may have heard about the Mta's proposed budget cut where they say that they will have an at least 40 cut in subway services and 9,000 plus layoffs and in response to this proposal. The assembly member you know, finds these proposals unsettling and urges the legislature to find new ways of raising revenue recommending an ultra billionaire's tax so that we do not see these layoffs happen and all of these cuts happen in the MTA, because it's the backbone of our city, so we're trying our absolute best to keep tabs on the situation as well, as you know, find ways that we could raise more revenue for the MTA to fully function, and you know just get back to as normal as they possibly can, and also some of you may be aware of the increasing percentage percentages of Covid-19 in the community, and we are seeing a high percentage in the one, zero, seven, five zip code, and we are just asking people to continue practicing social distancing, mask wearing and all of those necessary protocols. If you need help with finding a testing location or if you have any requests for PPE, please reach out to our office. We do have some masks and hand sanitizers if you know of yourself or community group or whomever needs any of them. Please give us a call I'll throw my email into the chat box. If you are in need of those, we can absolutely figure something out to help you there and, as always, if anyone needs help with anything like unemployment, tenant resources, please reach out to our office again. I will drop all of my contact info in the chat. That's all have a great night. Thank you Rebecca, and it would really be a shame, is, as the infection rate is rising, the trains get more crowded through service cuts. So thank you so much for working on that and assembly member court Mike then Italy from state Senator, Liz Krueger's office, hi Mike good evening. Thank you, everyone for coming, and everyone first off I'd like to relay the sentiment that Senator Krueger is honored to be serving the CBA area for another two years in the state Senate. She takes the responsibility very seriously, especially in these trying times, and while she can't be here tonight, she'll address the board in December to express her gratitude personally and discuss her priorities as the legislative season ramps up again soon among these priorities is simply improving. Our democratic process and towards that end, she'll be working towards some sweeping reforms of the board of election, which has unfortunately proven itself again and again to be in need of a complete overhaul to more adequately administer our elections and, as others have mentioned, as infections have ticked up recently, Senator Krueger will be holding a virtual town hall on the state of the pandemic, with top city Department of Health and H officials in charge of the city's response, and that's next Monday 3:30 to 4:30 info can be found on our website and our social media outlets or by contacting our office along with that event, we're going to be putting out a comprehensive Covid-19 research resource guide, working off the model of our senior resource guide, which is a compendium of all state city and non-profit Covid-19 related resources that our office commonly refers. People to and those are on, topics from unemployment to health, insurance, to small business resources, to guidance on housing laws, and so that's all for me. Thank you and I'd like to wish everyone a happy and Covid-19 safe. Thank you, Thanksgiving. Thank you and same to you for the thanksgiving and to all of our elected officials. Thank you for working hard to represent the community, and the city will I understand that President Gail, Brewer and City Council member Ben Kayla's are coming but they're, not here, so we'll just stop where we are when they come. Yes, if they're yeah, if their staff members are still here, please just chat me whenever they do show up. Are there any other elected official reps that we missed, raise your hand quickly or send me a chat, I, don't think so? Okay! Well, when they come we'll welcome them. Thank you. So I just want to say that I sent you as an email today that Brian Correa has started or has sent us information on the postal Services Operation Santa. So anyone who would like to sign up we're going to have a CBA team, so that will be great. I know that Hunter College, President, Jennifer Rob will be participating and speaking at the youth, Education and Libraries committee meeting on Monday so sign up and go to that. She is a great speaker, and that should be very interesting before election day. We had two I know I mentioned one, but we had a second one. A voting booth or information booth at the Isaac center at Holmes, Isaac's properties and people were interested. We were able to give people registration information for next year and borough. President Gail Brewer had sent someone to work with me and the Isaac's folks up there. So I think that went well. I'd like to do before the end of December and implicit bias, training for everyone. So I'm working on that I'd like to thank with respect to Northwell and the blood center, both Anthony Cohn and Marco Tamayo for working hard on putting together views and gathering up information as architects that they know how to interpret and put it in a form that the public can easily understand. I ask everyone, as all of the elected official reps have done to please follow all of the health guidelines: wear a mask social distance, wash your hands and stay safe as we're seeing numbers go up and even when they weren't going up with respect to the banks on the bank or loss of bank on Roosevelt Island, we have sent out our resolution and letter and I know that borough President, Gail Brewer is working on that as well. Along with assembly member Rebecca Searight and the other elected officials, I did speak to someone at Cornell tech. They don't have their own bank or credit union that I thought might be able to share with the Roosevelt Island resident, so they're still stuck, but we are working hard on that. I know how effective the whole community board was at the last meeting by the absence of a bank on Roosevelt Island. Thank you very much. Will I will pause before my report to let Philip Ellison from the public advocates office speak and then I'll come back to my report. Philip you're unmuted. You have two minutes oh great year. I, luckily, would not take up that amount of time good evening, CB8 good to be with you. It's been a little bit, and so it's always a pleasure. So a couple things I just want to mention around the public advocate in the office of the public advocate and I didn't I did said in CB8 our kind of update, email in the fall, but a number of things, and so most recently, as we've seen homelessness, be an issue around Manhattan, etc. We had really thinking of the public advocacy money, Williams humanizing, this experience and the tensions of homelessness in Manhattan and in our city. We've done a three-part series that we've received really good praise for looking at everything from the kind of foundation of homelessness. What what's the context in our city for why this is happening? Looking at children and the experience of children in homelessness, and when you think about the digital divide and remote learning, we've understood that some shelters around the city. That has been a major issue and then the last part is the business behind homelessness. So as we reconcile these tensions, we think a holistic perspective and view on this is necessary and I'll make sure. I'll share some of those links in the chat for folks, who'd love to engage or think it's necessary to engage. Also, the mayor released a pilot around you could argue redefining public safety, which we think in our office. We, the conversations, aren't really defining public safety as a city as a nation are really important and we think that's a step in the right direction. The public advocate has said, but based on the report past report from the mayor's office, though there's certain good things coming out of there about alternatives for policing for mental health, there's also areas that fall short and we've outlined those concerns and questions for this pilot around mental health supports versus traditional policing responses. And, lastly, you know as we're entering a second wave. The public advocate has been very much on top of this and we did a report and we released a report yesterday or in the event of a second wave, looking at the recommendations at all levels and what happened on the first response right, and so there are information. I think other people would like to know so. I'll make sure I leave some of this information in the chat. If you would like to receive my update, email I'll also give you my information, please reach out to me and from the public advocates office, please be safe and we wish you well. Thank you for your time tonight. Thank you for coming. So I'll quickly give a report. I know we have a long agenda in front of us or whatever. Next Thursday is Thanksgiving as you've already heard. It also means that our board office is going to be closed that day. It also means that the next week is the end of November. So any committee chair who is having a meeting in December, please give me your agenda sometime before next week and we do have a very busy agenda next month. Unlike some of our other months, we do have a land use committee meeting on the 9th I just want to flag that, for everybody board, members make sure that's on your calendar and then I just want to quickly congratulate the electeds who were recently reelected. I want to call attention to our CB8 speaks, has relaunched Will Sanchez and Monica Sanchez who's, one of our public members have been restarting CB8, speaks on their rooftop and have done some really great on the road. Cb8 speaks, but also right before that our board chair, interviewed Manhattan borough. President Gail Brewer in what was a really delightful video I, do encourage everybody to go to our website check that out. They work very hard on CB8 speaks and it's something to be very proud of, and then you know, staff continues to be working very hard on constituent cases and if you guys ever see anything that you need us to follow up on I know, we've worked with a lot of the board members and a lot of the folks in the public who've reached out to us about issues in the neighborhood. So just don't hesitate to reach out about those things and then just a really quick personal note for a lot of the board members who have been very kind and reached out to me over the last a couple of months. I did lose two grandparents, one of them to Covid-19 over the last two months and it felt so nice to have a community that cared and reached out to me in such a sincere way. So a bunch of you board members were just so kind, so I wanted to say thank you in a very public way to each of you guys who were so kind to me. Thank you. Oh that's, nice! Well, and you deserve it, we're sorry. We are sorry to hear of your losses and and how difficult this must have been, and my bad I also want to congratulate all of the elected officials for your on your reelection and your desire to serve the public. So thank you very much. Okay with that we're going to turn to the election, so each candidate for Chair, Russell and then Sherry. It's alphabetical, we'll have four minutes to speak and then for each of them, you'll have an opportunity. The board will have an opportunity to ask questions and and have the candidates answer your questions after the chairs will hear from Trisha and then and will vote on each office after the the candidates or candidates have an opportunity to speak and have their questions. Gail Barron will be chairing this portion of the meeting because she was the chair of the nominating committee. I hope everything goes smoothly. I've no doubt I know that we have a very active and interested and engaged board with a lot of questions. So this is your opportunity to not only ask your questions but ask questions that you think other board members might be interested in hearing. So thank you very much and we'll be doing a roll call for each vote by name instead of the we'll assume that it's a yes, unless it's in a raised hand we'll be doing it by name individually and then, after that we just have two other agenda items. So having said that, Gail, thank you we'll. Have you a muted Gail? Thank you, I guess you have thank you. Actually, Elita and I have had numerous requests, especially from new board members to be able to answer, ask and then see answers to questions from our candidates and, frankly, I think this is in large part due to zoom, because people haven't been able to really get to talk to one another in person to know each other and sometimes frankly, even to recognize other board members. So I think this is an opportunity to get to know your future leadership each. As Elita said each chair candidate will get to speak for up to four minutes. Then there will be the opportunity to ask questions. I'm really asking all of you to be as concise as possible and wherever possible. Let's have a question and an answer and try to have only a total of two minutes with both the question and the response so and if it takes a little longer than that because of a complexity we understand, but let's try to not be long-winded and yet still be able to get answers. Then each of the other candidates for first vice chair, second vice chair and the secretaries, will get to speak for a minute and what they will be doing is basically introducing themselves. So those of you that don't know them will have just a short bio from them, but you'll be able to ask them questions as well, and one further thing before we begin a lot of questions that come to Elita and myself and I just want you to know that if you are committed to a candidate, you can still change your mind to vote on another candidate based on what you hear tonight. So I just want people to understand that that's also a strong possibility, if indeed that's a direction that somebody chooses to go with. That said, we're going to begin with Russell Squire, who is the first of two candidates for board care Russell Good evening as a lifelong resident of this community district I am deeply committed to this community. I love the things that give it its character and make it what it is: the beautiful historic buildings, the restaurants and other small businesses and most of all, the residents of this district I volunteer through the synagogue that I belong to here and I've been active in the community in other ways as well. I was here through the Covid-19 lockdown I experienced what the community experienced during that time. I helped deliver meals to those who needed them and I helped make calls through Keith Power's office to seniors to make sure they were doing okay and on the board. I'm co-chair of environment and sanitation, and also serve on street life. I see service on the community board as a way to give back to this community that I care. So much about, and I've found my service on the board to be very rewarding. I want to be the board chair because I see that as a way to serve the Upper, East, Side and Roosevelt Island, even more and I, have the skills and experience from my work, both on and off the board to be effective. In that role. On my vision for the chair role in running the meetings, the chair has to create an atmosphere where people feel comfortable contributing where we can have a robust debate, but always in an atmosphere of civility. The chair should not use their power to try to steer things in a particular direction, but rather should ensure a fair process like a moderator and respect the other board members and allow them to discuss and persuade one another, and the chair has to keep the meetings on track and keep the agenda moving with respect to committees. I think the chair should let them do their thing generate the resolutions that they generate organically. The chair can suggest, subject matters for the committees, but should not tell the committees what resolutions to pass or try to steer things to one committee over another. Of course, if there's a problem with a committee, the chair should step in to address that and if committees have not met in a long time, the chair should address that as well. Finally, the chair should be zealous advocate for the board and do everything they can to ensure that when we take a position it is being listened to and taken into account. That means that the chair has to advance the position that the board has taken, regardless of how the chair voted during the meeting. Often, we are most successful at getting agencies to listen to us when we work through our elected officials, whom I know and can work well with, and the chair also has to liaise with the agencies, the public and the media, and all of these aspects of the chair role are ones that I would be effective at some of the things that I would want to focus on next year. Covid-19 is a big one. I was part of the group that organized our programming about contact, tracing and I helped lead some of those meetings. I'm very proud of all the work that the board has done in response to Covid-19, not just on contact tracing, but also with regard to small businesses with regard to schools and in other areas, I think we're uniquely positioned to have an impact here, because we can bring different segments of the community together and be a liaison between the community and the government. I also want us to do more outreach to let the community know about the positive role that we play in particular. I want us to present to schools, to let students know about us and also to engage and reach out with the residents of Holmes and Isaacs to get them more engaged in the work of the board. I think it's critical next year to get the Social Justice Committee that we talked about off the ground. That's a priority of mine. I also think we're going to have a lot of work to do to ensure that the voice of the community is heard with respect to the blood center internally. The top priority is making the meeting shorter. It's a big issue for everybody. I have a lot of views on this, but the shorter version is. We have got to I think there are aspects of the meetings that we can cut down or even cut out and I think we need to focus on getting comments to be concise, to not be repetitive and I. Think it's possible to do that, while still retaining an atmosphere. That's receptive to everybody's input, I've demonstrated an ability to run meetings effectively and efficiently and to come up with solutions that allow us to move the agenda. I want us to do more, also to integrate new members. We are fortunate to have a mix of members with decades of experience, as well as newer members with new perspectives and I. Think we need to make sure that new members feel comfortable sharing those perspectives and make it clear. Every board member has an equal void voice and an equal vote before closing I want to let everyone know. I am not running for reelection to be the president of the Lexington democratic club for next year, so I won't be the president after January I know. This has been a concern for a number of you, so I just wanted to make sure everybody knows that in closing whether it is in leading and participating in meetings or working with other board members outside of meetings, I have shown the ability to work, collaboratively, build consensus and listen to effectively address and resolve issues and to run things efficiently. I promise to be a chair for the whole board next year will present great challenges, but also great opportunities and I am the right person to lead community board 8 into the future and I ask for your vote for chair. Thank you, Russell. Are there any questions? Mr, C, hi, Russell I have a a kind of specific question that, in a way relates to a lot of what we've been talking about the last few days. I'd really like to know your position on the 210 foot height limit for the eastern Avenues, third, second and first, and also your position on the New York Blood Center and Northwell Lennox Hill hospital projects, which will both consume much of this board's attention over the next year. Sure so my position on the 210 height limit is that I'm in favor of it the board has spoken on that issue. Also, that's the position of the board, so the other thing just to be aware of is that, irrespective of my personal views, that's the position that the chair has to advance on that issue, but I'm also in favor of it with regard to Northwell I, think the current I mean I'm glad that the residential tower isn't part of the project anymore. I think the current iteration of the proposal is still too bulky. I think it is not contextual, and so I'm glad that we're continuing to address that and you know, try and get that, hopefully either changed or otherwise, certainly not go forward. The way it's been presented and with the blood center. As I said in the meeting last night, I think there are a lot of valid concerns that the community has raised, and if you were to ask me, you know I'm asking you yeah sorry, I'm asking you yeah I want to know what you think right. I understand, I'm answering the question. So if the question is given what we have now the presentation that was presented us yesterday, yay or nay up and down, we have to vote now. My answer would be no and that's what I said in the meeting yesterday and that's what I think. I'm hopeful that, based on the concerns that were expressed yesterday, that you know that the developer will come back to us and hopefully work with the community to try and address those concerns. I think the concerns that were expressed with regard to shade are very significant and are very valid. I think height concerns are valid, so all of that is to say, I am very hopeful that they'll be willing to make changes, and if they don't, then that will be you know then we'll probably have to oppose it. Based on how it's going. Let me just add one more point here actually on this, so I'm happy to answer questions about you know my substantive views on things and I think that I like talking about that stuff, but I do want to just emphasize the point that the you know the chair is elected to lead. The committee sorry, the community board, rather than represent us and, as I said in my speech, I, think. Ultimately, the chair's views on a particular substantive issue, I think are ancillary because it really shouldn't matter. Ultimately, at the end of the day, the chair gets a vote just like everybody else in the meeting, but the community board, as a board, is going to make its decision as a board on the whole and whatever that decision is that's. The decision that the board chair has to advance and the board share has a responsibility to advance that to push that again to advocate zealously and make sure that we're being listened to and respected in what we've done and I just think. It's important to draw a distinction between a role like the community Board chair and a role like, for example, state senator. You know when community members are electing a state, senator I as an individual voter I, don't get a vote in the state Senate. I'm electing somebody to represent me when they go to that body and cast a vote, and that's why it's very important that you know I want to know what their particular positions are for the community board chair. That's not really it's not quite the same I mean yes, there's the borough board. The Community Board chair goes to the Borough board and represents the board there. But for the most part the community board share is not representing the board or in terms of voting, but is leading the board, and so it's the board itself. It's the board as a whole. It's all of you that are going to decide what the positions are that we take as a board. It's not me as the chair, and it shouldn't be me as the chair. Who does that so again, happy to answer these questions. I think you know I like talking about the stuff, but I do want to emphasize that. Ultimately, you need a chair who's going to be committed to going with what the board decides and I am okay, Barbara Rutter I was actually going to ask Russell. Does he think it's an appropriate question and, as a chair is that a necessary question? I will say that I am looking forward to a chair that is neutral and will support chair people, particularly active ones. My of course my love is the health seniors and I love the parks and I hope it is, and Russell I assume from your previous answer. You would agree with me I guess that is my question that you do you agree that your job would be to work with the chairs of the different community committees and not make it just a land use community board. Yes, I agree with you and so I think and I think we're very lucky. We have a lot of great committees and great chairs who really know their stuff when it comes to their particular subject, areas and so I. Think as the chair should let the committees again do their work as I said and respect them to do the work that they're going to do and what they want to do. I think it's perfectly appropriate for the chair to suggest areas that a committee might want to look at, but by and large let the committees do what they're going to do, and you know step in if there's a problem Stephen if something needs to be fixed, but you know just let the committees do their work as they're capable of thank you, okay. Marco. Can you hear me now? Yes, thank you also I think I had to congratulate that you're running for the as a chair for the chair position of the community board, but I I'm a little bit confused because as well as I just hear today that you said you describe moral less. What is your role and what other role you say you are as a moderator. I want to be very clear. Are you have your own way to vote, or are you planning to use the rover rules? Sorry am I planning to am I planning to use Robert's rules. Is that the question yes basically I hear but I, don't know it's too long to describe the rover rules, and probably you describe part or is your style, that you're going to impl that you wanna impose in the community board or you really wanna use the rover rules. I will use Robert's rules, I, don't think Robert's rules are inconsistent with what I described but yeah the community Board uses Robert's rules, I'm very familiar with Robert's rules, and we would continue to use Robert's rules if I'm elected, so it will be fair, always to call you, according with the royal rules, everything if you are selected as a chair of the community yeah, just as it is. Thank you sure. Okay Craig go ahead and unmute good evening. Everyone I only think it would be fair to ask Sherry to respond to the same line of questions that were asked to wrestle regarding the northwell and the blood center and also whether she agrees with Russell in terms of the role of the chair and his response. I think this is an important question and consideration and could and it should be fleshed out. So we have the same perspective from both I think. With any question that's asked, it should be a question that we should have parity on, so we both know. So we all know what both are thinking. That's fine. We can do that. I've got your point Greg anything else. No I'd just love to hear Sherry's response, okay, cause, yeah, I, think what we should have done is heard from both sides first and then some people that ask the question it should be asked to both of them. Rather than have one person go, ask the question. Another person go and ask the question: I'm just wondering if these questions are going to be asked by you know for both applicants. My question to Russell is I've heard from different people being called and classifying some members in one camp or another camp, and my name has been mentioned by some people. I'm not going to mention names, but you know I take offense to it. Have you yourself or anybody? You know called anybody spoken to them and mentioned other people's name, that you know that what their views are and it's against what your views are and I will ask the same question to share it, so she can write it down now. Well, I have heard the same accusations being leveled during the campaign and I think there were some accusations leveled at me in that regard, and I also was disappointed to hear that and frankly, kind of surprised. That was part of this part of this process, but so, first of all, I guess to the extent that that's a concern, I'm not a part of any kind of faction or group I, never have been on the board. That's not really how I approach, what I do on the board. I look at every resolution and every application as it comes I look at it independently. I make up my own mind. I. Think folks, who have seen me on the board over the years and heard me speak on issues. I would hope. It's pretty clear that when I speak, you know those are my views and my views are my own. My words are, my own I would think that would come through so so the so that's the answer on the question of factions I, I'm not part of anything like that in terms of the question of talking about other people. So again, I was surprised to hear when I was calling people that you know that people were saying things about me and leveling accuracy, accusations about me in the course of this process that I just didn't expect that to be part of this. So sometimes when people have raised concerns with me, there are times where I've responded just to point out that the same concerns are also applicable to my opponent, so nothing really negative, just factual information so, for example, I know people that asked me if I would have time or I guess as I understand it. Some people raised the issue. People who were opposed to my candidacy raised the issue of whether I would have adequate time to devote to the role of board chair and in responding to that. I have pointed out to various things that you know Sherry's involved in. She has a lot of demands on her time as well, various other professional obligations and other places and so on, and so the only point there is just to say: it's not just a concern for me and I'll. Just also add that, to the extent that is a concern, I've heard it quite a bit. You know there's an old saying that if you want something done, give it to a busy person, I think, there's a lot of truth to that. So I've shown in my time on the board I'm able to devote the time it takes to do this. I've made it a priority. I've made myself very well organized and you know been able to make it to the meetings. My attendance has been very good. I'm very active, I'm very engaged I put the time in this is something that's very important to me. I'm again, a lifelong member of this community I wouldn't put myself forward for this. If it weren't, you know if I weren't, confident that I can do it well, which means devoting the time to it that it's going to require. So I'm very confident I can do that. Last thing, I would say on that is: we've had other lawyers in the past who have been board chair. It's been pretty common and, of course, you know most of our board chairs have jobs. So it's not a new thing, so hopefully that lays any concerns in that regard. Thanks, Russell, Michelle, yeah I just wanted to express a different point of view than what Craig has expressed. I. Think each candidate addresses what he or she would like to address and is, and each of them is going to welcome questions from all of us. I, don't think that they by an exterior acclimation should be required to answer each of the questions that might have been addressed to the other. They are listening to this and if each of them feels that they do want to address what has been expressed, it's within their right to do so, I, don't think that there should be any mandatory or mandates on them that they have to address this. So I have to address that these are two competent adults. They are listening to the discussion and they should address it, how they like and I, wouldn't want either one of them to be held to the requirement of what another one had suggested. So I just wanted to put that out there that you know I disagree with a formal making of them each to answer a question that went to the other I think we should leave that up to these very competent candidates, thanks Michelle Elaine Walsh, one I will agree with Michelle. This is not a forum or a debate like we've seen in the presidential. The question I had Russell was understanding your position in the law. Firm I have heard not from you from others that you have said that most of the work of the community board chair is after five o'clock. In my experience, that's not always true and wanted to know what your time availability is to attend, Borough, board meetings, etc during the day sure so, I know that the additional time commitments are not only after five o'clock. Very cognizant of that I will be able to attend the Bureau Board meetings. That's a critical part of what the Community Board chair does so I will be doing that I will be able to do that. Thank you for that question. Thank you, Wilma! Well, my star. Six time mute there you go am I on yeah you're right. Yes, you are. Oh, yes, that's hi! I was what causes saying about us hearing what each candidate had to say and then ask the questions. I think would be I feel that would be a better way because it's getting to be a lot of information. A lot being said whether you know when it went into asking about the building and other things that I don't think it has anything to do with this kind of introduction to meeting the people that are going to the chair, I would be interested to hear what sherry has to say and then ask questions according, but not to just deal with the subject. The with will I mean with Russell for two hours and then cherry goes and then people ask maybe not between questions, but it's just a little bit. Much and I think Carl's at a point where he said that maybe we should do one candidate at the time. Although I know this, it already started, and you may not want to just change anything but I thought he had a good suggestion. Thank you. Wilma Ed hi thanks I'll be very quick. This is more for Russell and Sherry I, I'm sorry to say, I have to have a hard stop for me. I have to get my son in hockey. Practice I spoke to both of you I. This pains me I'm going to try to sign in on my phone. If we take this vote, if you don't hear me on the phone, my apologies to both of you for not being able to vote, but I thought not to take up everybody's time on a personal matter, but I felt I owed it to both of them. I spoke to both of you. I can only see Russell now but Sherry. It's also to you. Sorry to the rest of the board, I'm going to try to participate, I'm going to scoot, not waste any more time, but I wanted to. Let all of you know why, if you call my name, you don't hear me: I will be back, it's just picking them up so I'll catch you on the back end of the meeting. Okay thanks, Sandra, okay, hello, Greetings, Mr Russell as a resident of public housing. How would you, as a chair of Cbh, see to it that the residents are made aware that the community board serves their community too majority of the time they we have felt left out, for example, the Learning Bridges site being placed right on our grounds and as a leader in my community and beyond, we were not aware I for one have adult children, but I would have liked to inform residents in the beginning stage rather than when the selection process was already taking place. I found out myself on October 1st at one of our community board meetings and for those who is not aware. Learning Bridges is a new program that provides free child care options for children from 3-K to 8th grade on days when they are scheduled for remote learning. So that's my question to you sure so, I think you know it involves doing the work, so I think the first step is going and trying to speak to members of Holmes and Isaacs at meetings or in other contexts. If we can organize them basically and I would want to do this as the chair go there and make sure folks are aware of the community board tell them. You know what it is that we do what our role is in the community and really work to listen to their concerns and I think the way to really bridge the divide is getting the word out about the community board, letting folks know what it is. We do and hopefully getting more people from homes and Isaacs to come to our meetings and to be part of the meetings. Both the committee meetings and the full board meetings. I think that's! You know once that happens, I think it gets its own momentum and when people from those communities are more involved in the community board, then I think we're hearing more about them and their concerns are coming more to the fore and there's just much more back and forth and much more ability to address those concerns, and the fact is that Owms and Isaacs obviously are part of this community district part of this community I think it's not always clear. When you look at our community board meetings and the issues that we talk about and who's there, that that's the case and I would like that to change so I think the answer is it's really about doing the work, doing the outreach talking to folks listening to folks and just really encouraging them to be more involved? Thank you. Okay, I, don't see any other questions, Alita did you have a question I do thank you and thank you very much Russell for being so upfront about everything. I just would like to say that I did not receive these calls, but I've heard that there was negativity on both sides and I did speak to both candidates about it. I know that any negative comments did not come from either candidate directly. I would like to ask you Russell. If you don't mind, if you were interested in running for office, is that something that you would share as part of your campaign right now? Well, so I think everybody I mean I'm not running for public office in 2021. Beyond that, I don't really know it's. You know, I, don't know what the future would hold. I guess, but I don't have any plans on that or anything okay and there's a last question from Peter Patch Peter yeah, I'm just wondering frankly, I was resisting asking this, but I have heard you know that Dan Court seat might be coming up. Would you if you had an interest in that seat, I.e, that's what 80 the second you're out. Would you would you share that at this point, yeah I mean I, don't know, that's you know talking about stuff in the future, so I just don't know. Okay, now we're going to go to Sherry one Second Elita. Did you have a further comment? I? Do I'm just a little confused? I'm sorry Russell about your answer because- and please forgive me- I'm not really clear on today. Politics and timelines or anything I, understand. Peter asked you about Dan Quartzy, but the district attorney election is this year right along with the other city elections, and so he would have to if he won the primary and run. Isn't that something that you would have to be considering because to see it would be vacant in a year from now is and I honestly, don't know, I follow some but I, don't know how the whole process works. Well, so I guess in terms of the timing. There wouldn't be a vacancy until next year, when the new, the district attorney, whoever gets all the people who get elected this year take office January 1st of 2022, so there wouldn't be a vacancy at that. Until that point and there's no vacancy now so I guess I, just I, don't know the answer. I mean I, don't know it's in the future: okay, Sarah, Chu, hi I just want to I hope. We can be a little more careful about our questions. Moving forward, we're asking candidates about their plans, long beyond the term that they're running for and and I, don't think that we should be stifling anyone's ambitions to serve our community so and there may not be parallel questions for the other candidates. So I appreciate that Russell you've taken the time to answer these questions. I personally feel like it's venturing into an inappropriate area, and so I'm expressing this others may disagree with me, but I hope that we can end this line of questioning. Please, okay, we have two other questions and then we're going to go to Sherry, Rebecca Dangore, all right. This isn't a question. I just want to remind everyone, especially newer board members, that these terms are for one year, so we can always re-elect new people, no matter what the circumstances are. I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page. You can serve three consecutive years, but we're only electing someone today for one year. Thank you. Okay, Taina hi, everyone I just wanted to. Second, what Sarah Chu said: I just think we, you know I, think Gail. We started this line of questioning the way we did, and we did you know through one after the other, but I think unless we're going to be asking both candidates about their three to five year. Plans. I think this line of questioning is incredibly inappropriate and I think, frankly, completely irrelevant to the candidacy of the chair. Thank you, chyna Elita. We can't hear you Carolina Tahoe, I'm muted I just wanted to say in response to Sarah and I think it was Taina. I'm sorry if I got that wrong, that I asked the question, because there are differences of opinion in how political the board should be so I just wanted to ask, and I'm perfectly happy to ask Shari the same question. I, don't feel that it was inappropriate. We could take that up another time, but I know that there are people who are concerned about that, and so I thought I would ask not about Russell in particular, but just about the politics and the board and the intersection so I. So I am sorry if I offended anyone by taking this down a different track, but it seemed to be appropriate. So having said that, I'm muting so I just want to address that concern. I guess so. I mean I mentioned that I'm not going to be the president of the Lexington democratic club next year, as I know that had been a concern, so I wanted to make sure folks know that the other thing is you know: I have always treated my board service to be 100 non-partisan. It's always how I've conducted myself with respect to the board. It's you know it's what we should be doing it's what I've done consistently in my time on the board. That would certainly continue for me, as chair and I, really stand on my record in that regard. I've been completely nonpartisan in everything I've ever done related to the board. Thank you. Russell all right, you know, we've time is starting to creep by so we're going to give sherry an opportunity to speak now. Okay, so you'd like me to clear all the hands right now and please line up Sherry, okay, clearing, hands, sherry. Give me one second to meet you. Your name is at the bottom of the list. Jerry just unmute I sent you a it. Didn't nope you're there you're good. We hear you, I'm good hi, all right! Well before my I begin. My formal remarks I want to make it clear that I am not running for elected office. When I describe my background, you'll see I've already been there and done that, so I'm not running for office for anybody who might have been concerned, and secondly, you'll see when I go through my my remarks that I'm really very in tune to the board, because I've answered a lot of your questions in my prepared remarks. So hopefully we won't have to go through them again so good evening, members of Community Board 8. First, let me say at the onset how honored I am to be working with all of you and your efforts on behalf of the community and the work we've done together for the community and that's why I'm running for chair I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I was born and raised in New, York City and then moved to New Jersey to raise my children I then moved back to the Upper East side as a full-time resident eight years ago. So I've been here for eight years. I first became aware of the community board when I was at a street. Fair I saw the CBA table and went and talked to the CBA members and when I learned, the purpose of the community board I knew that was an organization. I wanted to join. I was first appointed a public member of the zoning and Development Committee, so I could contribute my knowledge of zoning and, as I am a land use. Attorney and I have since been appointed twice as a regular member of the board. So, in addition to continuing to serve on zoning and development, I served on the charter change task force and I'm currently co-chair of the voting reform task force. I was also the former elected mayor of Livingston New Jersey, a community of 28,000 people, from which I have learned many transferable managerial and supervising skills and I now serve as the township attorney in Livingston and to answer Russell's concern about my commitment. I am retiring in December as township attorney, which will give me the flexibility and time to attend meetings during the day, such as Borough Board city planning, meeting with applicants, because I know that being chair of community Board 8 requires much a much greater time commitment than just running a board meeting which I am able and prepared to give. So, since I'm asking for your vote, you should know the kind of chair I'm going to be. I will work hard to make sure everyone is heard and recognized, and their views represented. I know how to run an effective meeting and the following are my plans to streamline and show it in our board meetings. A major concern raised by many of you when we spoke I will use my knowledge of Robert's rules of order to run a meeting efficiently effectively and productively. I will be allocating a segment time for each item on our agenda and unless it's a very sign time, sensitive matter, I will require that each topic be brought to the appropriate committee before it's brought to the board. I do not believe an initial discussion on a new matter should be conducted at the end of a long board meeting and when a committee passes a resolution or sends a letter on a substantive topic that should only be the first step. I will ask each committee to appoint a person to follow through by contacting the elected official or the agency, which received the correspondence to make sure they act upon it appropriately and I have reached out to each community board member and have spoken to most of you, including committee chairs, and co-chairs and I assure them that I will support their priorities and initiatives, and you have shared with me a great many ideas that I would join in promoting, including increasing CBA social media presence on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. Another great idea was joining with neighborhood groups to promote composting and advocating for more green space. Another was making Kohler Hospital a technical campus for people with disabilities in collaboration with Cornell tech, be assured, I, listen, I absorb and I respond. I'm a person of action I will also use my skills. Learn from supervising staff to manage the community Board office. I will make sure the lines of communications are open, working with will and the staff not to micromanage, but to motivate our employees so that they know their contributions are valued and appreciated and to ensure that their workload is appropriately distributed to serve the needs of the board, especially the committee chairs. So what are my priorities for community boarding? My overriding priority is preserving and better yet increasing the quality of life on the Upper, East, Side and Roosevelt Island. This would encompass addressing development, outreach diversity, affordable housing, senior services, child care, education parks, amongst other essential, prior essential amenities for life in the city. As my time on this, you could do that. Let me just go a little bit more, then I'm saying that my I'm going to ask that I'd be asked a question about my priorities. So I could speak about, so I could speak about that I. Just I'll, okay, I'm moving a community board with our public partition page is not a community board. We need to know what our community wants related to. This is the need for more diversity on the community board to appropriately address the community at large. Such diversity will make the community board stronger. I will strive, you excuse me, you have to begin to wrap up because Russell confined his remarks to four minutes, so you need to do the same. Okay. When I read it at home, it seemed to be four okay, so I will strive to make Cp-8 and its public participants more diverse. I have a list of items please. Somebody asked me about that. These are some of my thoughts and your ideas and how to make community board aid a more efficient, dynamic, inclusive, supportive force for the Upper, East Side and Roosevelt Island, and I'm asking for before your vote, to give me the opportunity to implement them and, as I said, I hope you will ask some of the questions on my priorities and how I want to increase public participation in the question section. So I can address those. Thank you. Okay. Let's start with the first question from Barbara Rutter Barbara I, did it too fast? Sorry I have a several part and I don't mean to be contentious, but you, but to answer in terms of Russell, you will. Are you still going to be a real estate agent and I know that, because, from the first day, you're on the board, I've gotten your monthly newsletters, which I think are wonderful and praised you for them. But you are a tri-state real estate agent and you have told me you spend a lot of time with your spouse in Boston. So will you have time if you're a tri-state and that's question number one that in response to the same question that was asked of Russell? Oh okay, you want me to answer that. Well, luckily, yes, I do have my real estate license in New York, and it gives me the opportunity to tell people how wonderful the Upper East side is. As we know, the real estate market in three states you're, a three state I know and I'm licensed as an attorney in three states too. That doesn't mean yes, but I do most of my I. Do some real estate in New, Jersey I, do not do anything in Massachusetts, but this is. This was meant to be a retirement job, but if I get lucky enough to be elected chair that will be in the back burner, I'm actually, as I said, retiring and cutting back on my law practice. So real estate is certainly not a major time commitment for me. Okay and a second question again because of what was asked Russell, it was about your politics. I just have to say that it amazes me that people will criticize any of us for wanting political ambition or involvement. We are here because that's in our genes that we want to be involved a lot of my friends play bridge or their dozens of museums. You know I have complimented you for being mayor and so on. You are an executive at the New Jersey, some women's caucus. You invited me to something for an Lgbt national, where you're some executive, or vice president, there and you're very close to Rebecca C Wright I, like Rebecca C Wright and worked with her I felt. There was some conflict, as you know, and as we've discussed with some issue with the community board. So is it fair and I? Don't want to criticize you for it? I think this is what we are beings that are interested in community work and politics comes out of it, but I just want to point out that it's unfair to criticize one and I: don't I'm not criticizing you for it and I, don't know if you have a response to that. Hey as Michelle Obama says, when people go low, we go high, I'm not going to respond. Okay, so I have one that may be low too, but it's a very sensitive subject. For me. It came up again with dirty talk. The first time I talked to you, maybe in July as to say that you're definitely what you talked about the groups and who is a somebody person and it went on and on it's something I find so distasteful and demeaning that anybody would think that a person could call me up. You have just the other day said that new people will vote for Russell because this person called them when I said you did say that and I just hope. I would like your promise that if you become chair that you will not put us in groups I just found it, the most demeaning and I unfortunately lost my temper with one of your surrogates that went through the list of another 10 people that were part of this clique. I will say that I do not belong to a clique and nobody I know belongs to a click. You know there is a click, but not ones that we belong to and I hope that if you become chair, you would treat us as individuals and not click people, and just because of about where we belong. Do you have an answer to that? No okay, so I assume the answers. Okay, thank you. I mean obviously I mean you. We've had this personal conversation. You were the one of the people who encouraged me to run for office. Of course I was impressed with your political career, okay and then, when I said this was a good idea and I would run, and then you decided not to support me so and right now, I think, okay, so I, don't Barbara I, don't we've had this conversation in person. I, don't think it's appropriate to do this as well, of course I'll either, but it did come up for Russell, so I thought well. I didn't bring it up once again we're trying to get information as far as how these people will behave in running the board. So let's try if there any other questions. I will certainly call on people, but let's try to ask supplementative questions rather than dealing with character, accusations on either side Russell. You had a question your hand. Yep I just wanted to point out. I've spoken to most of you in most cases multiple times I've talked you know in much more depth about various things that I want to do and my priorities and I was able to do during my speech. I kept myself to four minutes in part by speaking quickly. The speaking quickly, I want to reassure you is not part of my plan to make the meeting shorter. I have other things that I spoke in some depth with many of you about so I just wanted to point that out that Russell. Thank you very much now, it's time to let people question sherry. All right, yeah I will ask the same question to Sherry. Have you or any of your subordinates, been calling people and basically claiming they're in one group or another group, and which group am I in that's question number one I have not and your subordinates I don't I assume when people are calling they're talking about my attributes, my positive attributes. Why would we need to go negative when I have so much to offer the board? Okay? Well, that's a matter of opinion we're going to move on Carolina! Thank you! Cars hi there Elena! Can you hear me? Yes, I can okay, so Sherry had a lot of buzzwords with inclusion and diversity, and I'd like to address the fact that- and this is a conversation I've had with you- know some of the younger members or the less seasoned members of the board, where I personally who've been on the board now for four years, have absolutely 100 felt very siloed, and if there is anyone that would like to say that there are not clicks amongst the members, who've been part of the board for longer, then I would have to wholeheartedly disagree and the fact that sherry was asked some of the same questions along the same lines. That Russell was the fact that you did not want to respond to the questions and were very combative, is actually showing the character of a chair more so than a prepared speech. And so my question to you is and like I said, this is not supposed to be kind of a character assassination, which I would disagree on either side. But I feel like a lot of these questions that are being asked of either sherry and or Russell are veiled. Attempts to get other information that actually has very little to do with the job that we're really kind of looking for so there's no particular question, except that I do feel like there's a lot of preparation where even in the speech was like and asked me about this particular thing, where I feel that this was prepared amongst board members. It's the same board members over and to Taino's point as a new member I feel like there is an inclusion and there isn't diversity and I'm not talking about race or color. I'm talking about just the ranks amongst the board where I know, there's been folks, who've been on the board for 30 years and to be quite frank when you're putting people in place and saying: oh, maybe they have political aspirations, that's fine! We currently have people who are running for secretary and vice chair and so on, who are running for city, council and all sorts of other positions within the government if we're not scaring them so I think that's an unfair assessment that we're making across the board and it's quite honestly, making I think a lot of people uncomfortable at least it's making me uncomfortable because we're not sticking to the actual role which is chair, and this conversation has actually I think more than so showed me exactly where the divide is where it's the Us versus them and I. Think it's incredibly disappointing, because we talk about diversity and inclusion of the community, but within our own ranks we fall incredibly short. Carolina I'd like to address that I wish you I had tried I've reached out to you several times and I'm sorry. We didn't have the opportunity to speak, but I'm going to take your question on diversity and and address how I see that it needs to address more diversity, not only in community board eight, but also in the public participants. I. Think one thing that we really need to and do is increase our posting of our meetings through our neighborhoods, especially important for people who are not commuter, sad computer savvy, and we need to encourage residents to join our mailing list and increase our social social media outreach. We need to reach out to neighborhood and tenants associations to encourage their members to become involved at community board. Eight. We need to encourage people to become public members. As a chair, I have the I make a point would be making appointments as to asking people to become becoming public public members and I would do that with consideration of more diversity on the community board I believe once people become public members, they get a comfort level, so they would apply to be regular. Members I mean many of us. You know that wasn't an issue for many of us, but many people are intimidated and another thing I think we could we should be doing- is reaching out to the members of the community as resource when member chairs and committee members have a level of knowledge on many topics, but when something needs more a greater knowledge and more sophistication, then we should reach out to the community as a resource. We have them there. It's a way to reach out and it's way for us to benefit and get the knowledge that they have so I hope that answers your question. Thank you, Sherry Michelle yeah. Thank you. A couple of things. First, I have great admiration for sherry and all she's achieved in her career. As for people's points of view, you know some of us have lived a very long time. We don't come to the board as a blank slate. We have things that we've done in the past. We have careers, we have family, we have all kinds of different experiences. We have to trust that when candidates put themselves forward that they have the intent to have the time to do the job, sherry is quite an impressive woman. If you listen to her speak, if you look at her resume, she certainly has the qualifications to do this job. As for the cliques, this sounds people complaining it. It's almost like I've been left out. I'm left out well, some of it is. You know. Each individual person has to take the responsibility to try as much as they want some people. Don't really want to be all that social or all that communicative I mean some people don't, and that's that to me is perfectly acceptable. Many of us function as loners in our private life and in our community board life, so I see no particular problem with that, but for anybody who, who of that, if that's a concern, I really would ask everybody at the board tonight to please reach out to whomever you'd like to reach out to. If you feel that you want to be included in more things, I think it is true that people approach other people and do try to persuade them of their opinion. I think that's part of the process. It's not something that I particularly have participated in, but that's part of it when you're running for office, so I just want to put it out. I want to say that, rather than complaining about the process or offering our own personal views, because we somehow each of us might be feeling wronged, I would like to hear from the candidates and to that end, I would like to ask Shari to tell us anything else about herself that she feels is important to this end, that she didn't have an opportunity to convey well I, I'm very I'm very interested in preserving our neighborhoods. I'm a member of friends of the Upper East side, historic districts, I'm a member of New, York, Landmark Conservancy, and that's then that's very that's very important to me. I am I, don't know, I! Think that I think with the point I. My life experience has made me well qualified to be chair of this community. Having served as a mayor of the large community overseeing multi-million dollar budget running meetings, I mean this is the kind of skills that you need. We've had problems with our office, I've had experience in overseeing staff and I just think. It's just something I feel so strongly about. As I said as soon as I saw this as a CBA table, I knew that it was something I wanted to get involved in and frankly, to addresses. I've been saying to people. This process has become more political than the presidential, and it's really sad I mean I'm so glad that so many people feel so strongly about it. But this has not been the way I had envisioned. You know a campaign for Chair Community Board aide. Thank you, sherry I'd like to ask that the rest of the questions and I'll call on everyone, but please, let's try to separate criticism from substantive questions where we can really find out more about the priorities with that said, Elaine. Sorry, it took me a second following often that is what I was going to ask her. She mentioned some priorities, but what other priorities does she have as in her position as chair? So thank you and that'll address some of the questions that was asked of Russell. Again, my main priority is would be to maintain and to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Upper East side of Roseville dialing. The city charter gives the community board a special role in the area of land use, and that would make that my top priority is to address development in the Upper East side I support development, but it must be appropriate to our neighborhoods and to meet the needs of our community board. Members have a responsibility to ask developers, tough questions that you know what we would have done. You know with the we do with the the blood bank, because they're asking for our support and we need to ask them those questions we'll be continuing to address the expansion of the Lenox Hill Hospital in the bud. Blank I am full support of the 210 limit on York. First and third avenues: I see no basis for the city to allow unlimited heights to the detriments of our neighborhoods I. Do a lot of walking around the Upper East side and you can't find any sunlight and it shouldn't be that way. So I definitely support that and then the three president. We have three pressing issues that were set forth in the 20 21 statement of district needs. These are affordable, housing, quotable housing parks and schools, and these are my priorities under fit: affordable housing I look forward to sharing my considerable knowledge of affordable housing issues with the housing committee to promote housing in our community, and this has become even more acute when, according to the 2000 census, 6.5 percent of our residents live under the poverty line, and that's so. This is a strong priority. For me, for parks is the next under Covid-19. We certainly need more public spaces and eliminate privatization of public spaces. I support the efforts of the parks and Waterfront Committee to advocate for more public spaces and addressing repairing the aging East, River Esplanade and then schools in education. My goodness, we just the schools were just closed again, so I'm very concerned that our students have the computers and equipment that we need, and luckily we have so many of our committees on work or working on this area. The school and education Committee is advocating for more schools and child care, as well as for of child care. First responders has to be a priority. The health and seeing services is talking about the lack of computers for underprivileged children, and then we've learned that children in homeless shelters may have gotten computers, but they don't have internet. So these are certainly areas that I think the community board can have an impact and I look forward to working with members of our committees on these areas that we have prioritized for the community board. I will work with everybody. I guess: I, never really addressed that I, don't believe in clicks, I'm not a member of a clique, I'm doing this for the good of the community board and the community and I am certainly willing and able to work with everyone on the community board. Harrison Aye. Yes, thank you, sherry for taking this time to answer some questions. So my question: is you discussed in depth how you're very into the notion of expanding public participation and ensuring that the community is really involved? Well, I, guess. My question has to be that many of you, the the sometimes exceedingly lengthy meetings that this board happened happens to have as a hindrance to public participation and the ability for members of the public to be truly involved throughout the whole meeting by standing by and spectating, and you know waiting through the public session. So my question to you has to be: what would your approach to helping to kind of I guess consolidate some of the stuff that happens in the meetings and shortening it in order to ensure that more members of the public are able to stay engaged? Well, as I pointed out, I think the meetings have to be, you know, have to be run more efficiently. Some of the things I said was you know that we would have taught. We would have specific times that we could speak on a topic. I want at all points of view to be heard, but certainly there's no need to have people talk. You know, talk I, think every board. Members obvious should have an opportunity to speak and they should take their first shot at the first time that they have to speak I, don't know we would told we I was I, attended the you know, zoning development meeting and the question was raised. You know we had several hundred members of the public and many of them had questions, and we didn't have time for, but we I mean it has to be realistic. I think the way that Elaine and Elizabeth handle it was made sense. I mean we heard the first dozen or so people who spoke really presented the issues that the community had. Everybody else was basically just repeating it, but the fact that we had them send their comments to the board office. What we have them is I thought was a very a good way to handle that I. You know, and then you know the question was we I talked today about well, what happens if we're allowed to have meetings back in person? What would we do? Should we have hybrid meetings and maybe that's a good idea for people who can attend meetings that we should do, but then I think we have so much greater participation by the public by the Zoom meeting, so I think my position would be it. You know we take it case by case, but a hybrid situation I think, would be a way to get more people following. You know what we're going on and that's really what we need to do. We need people to think that the community board is the place they need to go and and unless they know that we're here and what we can do, we don't get that from them. So that's how I would hopefully, that answered your question. Ellie hello, hi, sherry, I'm going to I just want to first preface this with I. Think both cherry and Russell are excellent and I think either would be great chairs with the committee and so I think. A lot of the negativity strikes me as a little silly and I do want to say I. Think Elita leaves some big shoes to Phil I. Think she's been terrific as chair in my opinion, so just trying to bring a little bit more positivity. My question is the following: sherry. You know: I've had a lot of phenomenal discussions with some of our newer board members, particularly around issues of equity and I. Think any one of them I can think of. Numerous of them would be phenomenal chairs or co-chairs of our new equity or racial justice task force. So my question is: would you consider appointing someone who's a first or second year, board member to be a co-chair or chair of that new task force which, as I understand it, is still somewhat in flux? This is Billy, I, wasn't sure who's Billy is this you who I didn't hear who yeah hi? Well, let me tell you about my plan. I I've mentioned this to the or the other people running tonight. I want to set up a cabinet. Our executive committee is too big under the bylaws. It Inc includes all the vice chairs and the secretaries, but it also includes all the committee chairs so we're talking, maybe 25 30 people. That's not a working situation, I'm going to set up a cabinet of the electeds. So it'll, be me the two vice chairs and the secretaries and they're going to be my sounding board and we're going to come up with ideas because they are different. They're I mean they're younger than I am I, mean I, know you think, I'm you know I'm 21, but I'm really not. They are, though, so we'll get their ideas going forward and the first thing we're going to do. I'm going to charge the wind is to look at all our committees, we're going to look. We have. We have 19 committees and three task forces and there's only 50 of us. So let's look at our committees and see how they're set up. Then we have to look at the committee chairs. Some of our committee chairs have been there forever, so maybe what we need to do is maybe in some cases where our committee chairs are well knowledged. Maybe we need to have three: have a new person come in to learn the ropes so to answer your question? I have no problem with a new person. I'd like the person to be part of that committee. For a year, though I know with diversity that would be issued. But if somebody's been in the committee we're all doers, we all have. We all know how to run meetings. We know how to do things so to have some to say no, you can't be a committee chair unless you've been in. You know unless you've been on the community board for I, don't know three four years. That makes no sense I'm so we have so many I've had the opportunity to speak to our new members. They are terrific. They have so many ideas that they want to contribute and if one of them has a particular interest in a committee and the committee chairs may be ready, some of you have told me they're ready to move on. So to answer your question. No I would not have any problem about appointing somebody who's a first or second year. Member of the community board to a committee, but I would want them to have served on that committee before I would appoint them as a co-chair. Thank you and I. Don't know if it's fair to give Russell a chance to answer as well, but I'll leave that to you Gail well what we can do if there are any questions at the end, if we can just move this forward, but if there are any questions at the end, where board members feel that they want to ask that same question of Russell, that's fine, but once again, if everybody will try to keep their questions, succinct and different from whatever has already been asked, because we really are trying to keep within some type of a reasonable time frame. Greg hi. Thank you before asking my question. I just need to express my frustration with how this discussion has been handled tonight. This is my third time voting for the board chair position. Since I've been on the board and neither of the prior votes that I participated in. Did our discussion devolve into personal attacks and pointed questions that, when occurring in a public domain, only serve to divide our board and create this perception that people are going to have now. Both candidates have had the opportunity to call each other each and every member and I suspect these discussions have taken place and allowed everyone voting tonight to come to a decision, as we have in the past decisions that had generally been made before we arrived at the meeting or in this case entered the zoom meeting that should have been sufficient, but it's too late now and I'm really concerned that. How are we going to move forward from this and now that this has turned into something that I'd expect to see in a political election? I mean we we're past that, and now it's like I'm having flashbacks, because if I were a public, a member of the public attending tonight's meeting, it would seem as if the personal priorities, policy, priorities and viewpoints are now front and center and that's never been what this vote was about or should be about. We should be- and we are above this and I hope. Whoever ascends to the chair position is well versed in healing and uniting people given how this is just seem to divide everyone tonight. So then my two questions that I have are and I'd love to hear. Russell respond as well, if possible, since Joey said we can ask those questions of Russell is what will each candidate do if the board takes the position that the chair doesn't support and how will you help heal the sport if it's made frankly off the rails discussion? I'm sorry, I'm just I got a sport number Craig Leslie. We can ask that at the very end of both candidates, but let's just get the other questions that are still open-ended and there were enough people who called and requested being able to hear from the candidates and ask questions because of zoom. It's very different from some of the past elections and I understand the frustration, but you know we all have agreed that. Perhaps this has gone in a certain direction that nobody expected. On the other hand, if we can just ask substantive questions, we can get back to the question that you've just raised and asked it of both candidates. But I would particularly like to see if there are any other questions that will deal with how they will perform as chairs and separate. And apart from addressing the criticisms and the healing and all the rest we'll get there. But please, let's just see, if there's anything else regarding their skill sets that people have. If anybody has a question that has to do more with what Craig has just raised, would they please lower their hand, because we will go ahead and address that at the very end? But are there any other questions from anybody whose hand is raised? That will indeed give us more information about the approach that sherry will take and, if necessary, we'll go back and ask that question of Russell as well. Okay, Carolina I saw you just got up from your screen, so maybe we come right back to you after Laurie yeah. Let's do Lori, then Laurie. Oh, wait, there's Carolina, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what happened. Go ahead, go no! It's you had it! No I put my hand down sorry about that. Okay, thank you! Lori, okay, just a quick question! Sherry I, I, really respect your experience and I am very impressed with the things that you have done in your life and I know that there was a time that you know that people raised their kids in the in the suburbs, because the schools were, you know there wasn't a a reliable option for people to put their kids in public school in the city and I am fully in support of everybody doing the very best that they can for their children. That being said, do you think the fact that you have not put your kids through any school situation in the city will have an impact on or like? Can you put yourself in the position of you know a young set of parents who are having an issue with the public schools? Well, I was a PTA president, so I certainly was familiar with public schools. I, don't think that having it having a child who went to public school in New, Jersey is different than having a child in public school in New York I mean you want your best for your child. My grandkids live in the Upper East side and they go to school. You know they go to school here and I'm certainly familiar with what my son and daughter-in-law talk about that. So no I, you know there are many things as chair that we have in it. You know that we would not have experienced, but I've been a parent, and that certainly would give me sensitivity to how people are raising their children. So no I, don't think it. It's really relevant that my kids did not go to public school. In Manhattan, okay, thank you Sharon hi. Can you hear me? Yes, oh okay, thank you. Let me do this as oh, okay, so I just wanted to echo Billy Friedman's remarks about how the board will be well served by either Russell or Sherry. Having said that, I also wanted to follow up comments regarding the board having clicks they do and they exist in school. They exist in work. They exist in communities, we have them and we navigate them and we navigate them successfully on the board. I don't belong to a clique, I. Consider myself one of the cool girls by the way. Having said that, I'd like to ask you a question. Sherry and also I would like for Russell to answer the question as well. At the end, and so sherry I think both you and Russell have focused on diversity and I. Do apologize, Russell I didn't have a chance to ask you this question as well: I didn't think of it until after I thought about Shari's remarks and your remarks this evening, but both of you focused on diversity in two different ways. One was outreach board, outreach to various communities and including Isaacs and Holmes, which I think is fantastic and also outreach to the new board members, which I think is fantastic, and my question is there is there appears to be to me a lack of diversity among the committee co-chairs and sherry. You alluded to that as a matter of fact, and so I am interested in in whether or not you can include in your thinking in terms of diversity, racial diversity towards who becomes co-chairs of various committees. And let me emphasize that your comments regarding many co-chairs having surged for a long time very much resonated with me, because my thinking is that by serving for a long period of time and I mean, in some cases in excess of five six seven years, there's a lack of diversity in thought. There is a lack of embracement of people who hold opposing views that, in that is what is the worst part of not having a diverse committee co-chairs across the board, so not just including new people who have arrived, but also including people of color, as co-chairs and other individuals who in fact may hold differing views. I appreciate your patience with my question. Sherry, but I wanted you to dwell a little bit more into that and also Russell. If you could answer that question at the end as well, I really do appreciate it and just to be clear. The question is: would you include in your diversity initiatives making sure that there's age diversity, because I am 21 years old, making sure there's racial diversity as well? And and that's it? Thank you and another diversity that I think we need to address is economic diversity. You know we have all those that you know we talk about, but I don't look in anybody's pocketbook, but I think if you're, on whatever end of the spectrum income spectrum, you are I, think you do have a different perspective on it and that's one of the as I said: I'm going to be putting this cabinet together. I, don't I as chair, do not have all the answers and that's why I would get the benefit of our group. We're talking about seven different people who are diverse themselves and certainly I, would consider I mean you know we took. This is now we're talking about a quota system, so I can't say that you know because you're I would consider you to be a co-chair because you're, a talented person and what you can contribute I would have a hard time saying that I would need to make you a co-chair because you're a black woman. That wouldn't be why I would choose you, but that wouldn't be the reason. I wouldn't choose you I guess is the point we have it. I've spoken to, we meant, as I said, the board members. We have many. The easiest thing is racial diversity. We have many talented african-american people on the board, who I think should be serving as as chair and so I guess and go some grants, but going round and round yes, I certainly would consider diversity is one of the criteria for chair as I would consider age and gender and, as I said and economics, you know that we need to represent our community. We can't we all. You know it's. It's like we talk in Washington I mean all those white white-haired men. We we're not that our group is much more diverse and our chairs and our board members and our public participation should reflect our community so that you know I. That's how I feel about that I, I'd like to go to Elizabeth, Rose and then to Lorraine Brown, because neither of them has asked a question yet so Elizabeth. Thank you very much. This is a question for both candidates and I. Think it is a very different tone and tenor from the questions we've had so far. I would like to know from each of Russell and Shari. What is the thing and, by the word thing, I am deliberately being very broad and inclusive in what the answer could be, that you are most proud of your experience on the community board and what was your contribution to whatever that thing was: okay, sherry, okay, I, think I. Think most recently, you know that being co-chair of the voting reform task force, I think we served a major public benefit by having the two meetings that we had on the ways to vote. I mean voting. This November was a challenge, and yet we reached out to our public and our board members frankly to tell them how they could vote early. We I did did a public service announcement on how to fill your absentee ballot, and then we worked on getting people to you know. We were aware of the situation on the difficulty and early voting and we reached out to our elected officials to do that and I think that was a major public service that we did. I mean on I was very active in the charter change. When we were, we I worked on the charter change Committee I loved the way that a leader got all the community boards together to work on a topic, and that would be another thing that I would be advancing if there's something that all the community boards in Manhattan can work on. We should do that because the more support we can show for a topic. We would do that and then my participation in zoning and development, as you said, I am a language's attorney, so I have a knowledge of the subject and I, hopefully have been able to contribute to that. But I think the most important thing I've done is as a member of the community board is this last year, in my role in bringing together both the in court to talk about the new legislation on voting and then the wonderful speaker, Susan Lerner, from common cause, to talk to us about how we can vote and answer all our questions. So I think that of my community board experience that I would say would be my high point. Thank you, Russell I think we'll. Let Russell answer that at the end there are two or three other questions. If you don't mind, because actually Gail I think it would be extremely helpful to have them answer the same question back-to-back all right thanks. So my answer to that question is the work that we did on contact tracing earlier this year. So we had a number of meetings on that issue and on different facets of that issue, there were a number of people who were involved in putting that together. It was a group of folks. Sometimes you know in our discussions, we had multiple meetings to talk about how those programs should go, what the key issues were, how best to present those to the community in a way that would be helpful for people and informative and balanced, because sometimes there were issues that you know. People had different sides on and where there was a public debate going, and we just wanted to make sure that we were informing the community in an even handed way so that people can make up their own minds and make their own informed decisions. So, in the course of preparing for those meetings, we had a number of meetings. I think we didn't always agree on how things were going to go, but I think I played a very constructive role in kind of bridging the gaps and bringing people together and again forming consensus in terms of how these meetings should go and how they should be run and I think the results really speak for themselves. I'm very proud of how all of those multiple meetings that we did on these subjects came out. Some of those were meetings that I ran or helped run, and you know I would put those forward as examples of the kind of leadership that I display in meetings like that, and you know, and again just an ability to master the subject matter and understand what it is that we were discussing and then also run a very productive and and good meeting where folks were able to ask their questions, get their viewpoints out. We were able to hear in a balanced way from the two sides and ultimately were able to come up with resolutions that got widespread support, both in the committee and in the full board and so I think those are exemplars both of how I work with members on the board and with how I lead meetings and lead efforts like that, and I'm very proud of what the result was. Thank you and thank you again, Lorraine I'm going to ask that Lorraine. Who is the only person who is not asked a question, ask her question. Then we will go back and ask the a couple of the questions to Russell that were asked to Sherry that board members requested that we do so Lorraine. Yes, this is Mrs. Brown I have to forgive my voice, because I've had major surgery and my throat is still healing from the tubes that were placed down my throat while I was under anesthesia each and every board member had the responsibility to perform due diligence, for example, Will, Sanchez and Monica Mccain provided each and every board member and the public interviews on Cbh speaks. Everyone should have watched those interviews two. If you had questions or concerns you should have reached out to the candidates. I didn't expect this board meeting to go in this under this current setting by character assassination bullying that doesn't work. For me, the chair is to serve as a traffic cop and I'm asking what is our goal as a community board or as a board? Is it to be fair and balanced, which would be unrealistic because we have so many personalities? My previous participation in voting for chairs the candidate's name, was presented at the board meeting and it was either yes. Why are we going through this now? Why are we taking that precious time? It's been two and a half hours again, and this is the first item on the agenda. Emily come on folks come on. Please, let's be respectful. Let's do the vote. If you have confused, you should have done your homework and that's all I wanted to say, and thank you everybody for allowing me to express my thoughts. Thank you. Anybody who, if everybody would just put their hands down that their hands, are up right now and a board member who has specifically asked a question of sherry will take two other questions of Russell and then we will proceed. Lolita, Elita, you're, muted, on your phone I know, I'm sorry I. This is to Shari, because I asked Russell a tough question before so. It's Shari's turn when he were mayor of that town in New Jersey. What was the diversity of that town in which he served as mayor the ver? It was primarily white. We very had a large asian community and we had a smaller african-american community, but there was economic. There was certainly economic diversity in the community that had to be addressed well other than economic diversity. How could you use that experience in a particularly heavily represented or heavily dominated town to maximize or improve diversity here, with represent with the community board's involvement with other diverse other groups that may be fully represented, not fully represented, but where it's just all a part of the community by demographic, because I have the skills to outreach to people and to bring people together, the I don't see the I don't see, I mean what I did in Livingston was having to have diverse, diverse opinions that bring people together. I work with the diverse communities in town, but what I presented was my approach to increasing our participation, not as I said, not only on the community board, but in public participation and I. That would be how I would continue to do that and I mean I. I'm not really sure. I'm not really sure the point that you're trying to make, because there was not a large black population in Livingston. That means I can't address it in here. I'm really not sure the point I have the skills to bring people together. I've always done that I've always been looked upon as a leader, because I do that. I know how to reconcile different point of points of view and I would just use. That's that skill here and I, really I'm at a loss to figure out what the point that you were trying to make I, don't think it's apropos to how I could handle diversity in our neighborhood. So sorry, that's the best answer. I can give you okay, I, actually think with respect to the time. Is there any question that somebody has already asked sherry that you feel still has to be asked of Russell, not a new question, but something that's already been asked: okay, because yeah I move that I suggest that we move the meeting get to the vote. This is getting on and on I do want to respond to the questions. I can have dinner. I can have a glass of wine and I can have my espresso okay. So we're now going to go on to hear from Trisha one Minute Trisha, just telling people who you are and thank you no sorry I want to respond to the questions that were asked of me directly. There were questions that were asked for both candidates. I think the answer. My answer was deferred until the end, because I was supposed to get a chance to answer those, and so one of the questions I want to address is Craig's question about bringing the board together, but in doing that, I mean I also want to just address what Craig and Maureen and others have said about the way that this meeting has gone. So this is a departure from the procedures we've used in other recent elections. We don't usually take questions like this and I think the reason for that we don't that we typically haven't done. That is it's predictable, that a meeting with questions like this could devolve into negativity. I, think it's unfortunate that happened. I actually made that point and made the exact same points that Lorraine made to Elita about. You know the fact that we've been making calls and reaching out to folks for an extended period now. People who have questions for sherry and me have had ample opportunity to ask them and so doing a question period in the board meeting is just likely to devolve into negativity and probably isn't going to be that informative for folks, let alone the timing, concern I, know we're all very concerned about time. So again, I think it was predictable that this was going to go. That way, I would just point out if you look at the bulk of the questions, I think the idea that this was done because of some brown swell by new members is a little bit difficult to believe so. I think what we have is a situation where rules change and we did a departure from what we've done in the past, because some people wanted to do it. That way, and I'm happy to answer questions as I've shown, I answered every single question that was posed to me, but I do think. I echo what folks have said that this meeting is a far cry, I. Think from what most members really wanted to see in a meeting like this, so I think in terms of how to bring the board together. I think the answer is to have a chair who's going to be committed to fairness and uniformity, not changing the rules to get a certain outcome and I hope that this meeting exemplifies for people on the board, who want that which side is more likely to do that and again, I'm very committed to doing that and I think I've demonstrated that throughout my time on the board. With regard to the question about I, think the other question for me was about diversity. This is something that I mentioned in my CB8 speaks interview. There was a question about diversity on the board and what can be done about that and what I pointed out is that, even though the chair and the members don't appoint the other members, that's done by the elected officials. What the chair can have an impact on is the appointment of committee chairs and I committed to the fact that was something that I would keep in mind in appointing committee chairs. It's something that's very important to me. I think it's something that we have to do and I think in terms of diversity and the concern for diversity on the board. One of the things that I heard from a number of people- and it's a concern that I share very strongly- is the concern that the Social Justice Committee, that we created, which was a big priority. We had a long meeting about this, has not done anything in the time since it's been created, it's been several months. I. Think a lot of folks are very concerned about that I. Think part of the problem was that is the you know. The leadership of that committee and I think the reluctance to appoint diverse leadership to that committee because of arbitrary restrictions on new members or other kinds of considerations that, frankly, I'm not privy to but I think that's been a black spot on the board and I just want to point out that I'm very committed to getting that committee off the ground and appointing diverse leadership. For that. I'm sorry I need to say something here, because that was an unfair attack on me that it was a reluctance to appoint people and a reluctance to get this committee off the ground, and you and I have not talked about it. Shari and I haven't talked about it either. Had anyone come and talked to me, I would have been happy and I've always tried to be open and honest about what the situation was so to say that there is a reluctance to appoint people or there's a reluctance to do something and to get it off. The ground is just not it's. Just not accurate I understand that you want to do this and want to get off the ground and I support you and support everyone who has an interest in many people back in July expressed a lot of interest in it. So I have no reluctance to do that. It's been. There are other issues that have been involved and if I've made mistakes, I always own up to and take ownership and say I could do better and try to do better. So to suggest that I just had to say, even though it's not part of the meeting the board members are all here. A lot of people from the public are here and I just I. I'm sorry if this was considered inappropriate, but I just felt that I had to say something because I thought it was an unfair characterization. So my apologies to all and thank you what I think we should do now before we have the other candidate speak. Let's just go ahead and take the vote and we'll close out this first part of the meeting. So will do you have the the vote sheets ready, yeah Billy is going to continue. Philly yeah Billy is going to take the first vote and then the other secretaries will cycle through. Don't worry, they will not be counting the votes for themselves. I mean I, lower everyone's hands and Billy. You should be unmuted at this point. Yeah you hear me. Yes, we can okay, great okay. So the way that we're going to do this is we're going to ask people we're going to go in alphabetical order. We're going to ask that you either say Russell Squire. If that's you're, voting for or Sherry Weiner or you can have stain or stay, not voting for cause. I'm going to go slowly here, because I know Rebecca filling out the Excel sheet. It may take a little more time than simple yes or no's. So let's get started and I'm going to unmute about five or ten people ahead, so just be prepared to mute yourself. So we can move quickly. Great, are you all set with the first ten will on music? Yes, thanks: okay Aaronson Russell, Squire Ashby, Pass, Baron, Jerry, Weiner, Russell, Squire, Guerrero, Russell, Squire, Brown, Gary, Weiner, Camp, muted, Sherry, Weiner, Coleman, Russell, Squire, Correa, Russell, Squire, Gengar, Russell, flyer, Barber, I think both would make great candidates but I vote for Russell Squire.

Oh sorry, I was on mute at the time, so I didn't actually get to vocalize. It I. Don't think! Did you catch my vote. I think we heard Russell Squire. Did we get that he just heard my mouth yeah, okay, I, wanted to say it out loud Russell. Squire. Sorry about that, before we move on I'm sorry Billy do you have a I didn't know if it would take time to tabulate the voters? Do you want me to give the tally now? If you have it, because we actually, we have borough President, Gail Brewer, who has been waiting patiently and I, guess fascinated with what's going on, because we still have a lot of public members of the public who are here listening to this, so I wanted to not take up her whole evening and see if she would like to speak at this point. But if you'd like to give the results and you have them, then we should do that. Yeah I have the results, so there are 48 votes cast. The results are for Russell, Squire, 31, Sherry, Weiner, 15 and two abstentions. Thank you, Billy Russell, where are you Russell make a sound, so we could see you I could see you on the screen. He is muted. Just give me one. Second, thank you. Will congratulations, I guess! Thank you. Where are you I, don't see him there? You go congratulations! Russell! Now you could loosen your tie and take off your jacket and that's right. It's exciting to have so I wanted to say thank you and we'll be able I, don't like to use the word transition in this froth time in Washington, but we'll be able to work together in this period and congratulations. Thank you. I'm looking forward to that. Thank you very much and I as I said, I will be president of the whole board. So so, thank you. All you're, welcome to and for participating, I know that this has been long and a difficult process, probably mostly for the candidates and for the people on the board, who are getting frustrated, Russell called and asked why we're doing this? Other people called and asked why we're doing this and I wanted to do it this way, because Zoom is not it's a replacement, but it is not or it's a substitute, but not a replacement for in-person meetings. Where we see what people are like, we see what they do, how they respond to things at the board. We have a chance to chat with them coming in and leaving or during pauses and meetings, and we didn't have that and for new members, both the current new members and even those who have been on the board for a year and a half. We lost nine months because of Covid-19 of seeing each other in person, and so it felt that the questions were right to give people more of an opportunity to hear from each other and see each other that they went a little sideways. I will take responsibility for but I just thought as I always do that more information is better than less information. So I really am full of gratitude for the candidates for taking this in good stride and for the board members in and asking the questions and listening to the answers. So thank you all very much okay. So why don't we have borrow excuse me and also for my questions. I know that a lot of you had questions about my questions and I'm happy to talk to any of you is as a group in an email or individually on the phone if you'd like so in the meantime, let's get borough president Brewer and welcome. Thank you very much. I will be very quick. Congratulations Russell! Very thank you for running, but my real hero is a leader so but congratulations to everyone. So a couple quick things. First of all, just a piece of information is positive. So I was I'm a member of the National League of cities, and this is the week when they're meeting virtually and the census person then brought up a map. It was very interesting. It had blue for cities that have done well and red for everybody else. It was interesting the cities in the United States, despite all of the challenges that board faced and we faced, and you are out constantly trying to get people to sign up for the Census New York was very blue and the rural areas in this country were absolutely 100 red, meaning that they had put no effort into it and all I can think of is all the times they're at the table, hanging out, putting things in stores etc. So you know you should be proud of the fact that you know God knows what the numbers are going to look like, and but you should be very proud that you had a big contribution, because the area that was most challenged was yours, so I just want to say: congratulations, I'll, get you a copy of the map because you'll be very proud of it. Second issue: just positive I want to thank Elita and all of you, and certainly Isabel from our office on Kohler. You know it's. Quite there are people there, who've got Covid-19 just like there are people back over everywhere in terms of staffing, but the fact that you have put together this support mechanism and the work that you've been doing with the Cornell Tech and Cola. It's kind of it's very unique and I just want to say, congratulations. I know it's only going to be enhanced as time goes on and the residents will certainly be continuing to be very pleased and learning and so on and so forth. Then, of course who will get the most out of it will be the students at Cornell, Tech, so big plus to you in terms of Roosevelt, Island I know you spoke to the assembly member who is on the banking committee. I am very focused. We're going to be sending letters to every bank we can find under every hospice from the community banks to the credit unions to the big banks. I actually talked to quite a few of the big banks today and they are interested so I think this is one of these possibilities. That's going to work out and goodness knows, there's plenty of space and opportunities for location in on Roosevelt Island, we're all talking about Linux Hill hospital, I'm going to work as closely as I can with the community and the council member and the community board. I. Don't need to talk more because you're up on it as much as I am we have no resolution. Blood center is the same thing. I was quite shocked that the way in which the park would be in the shadows when I saw the map and what are they going to do to be able to mitigate that I have no idea so, but I think it's a learning process and we're all working, and that shows the reason for the work that you do the schools. We know that there's no school tomorrow, but the focus of technology is ongoing. We are sitting with I'm pretty upset about this deployment model. They're sitting here with about I, don't know 15 million dollars in the bank can't spend it for devices. That's your money! It's the money that we allocated a year ago. We've been fussing about it for months and finally got a sign off from OMB and Board of Department of Education, but guess what there's like three other hoops to go through in terms of spending for individual devices, because the board of a department of education is so used to having those carts that they can't figure out how to actually purchase a device for students so we're working on it. But I can say it's beyond frustrating to have that money sitting there and so many devices not in the hands of young people. I'm going to keep focusing on this public realm idea. Every time I talk to sanitation issues, business issues, street issues, bus issues, bicycle issues and so on. We've got to find somebody who can look at all these street issues. We have had so many not in your area, but other places in the bar over open streets over the street close the street. Oh close, the street. Oh, my goodness, you shouldn't have closed the street, but there was nothing happening on the street, but there could have been something happening on the street, and so we have to figure this out and it's not done correctly. We have on the you know, we're continually working on this housing task force. We will very soon have some suggestions. It's a ongoing issue: how to build affordable housing. That's certainly one of your priorities. We've been talking from the Furman Center to experts around the country and in New York and I promise you very soon we'll have something to say about it. In terms of tenants on November 23rd at six o'clock, it'll be on our website and in the newsletters there will be a zoom discussion online of all the tenant possibilities, because when the moratorium is over, it's going to be a real challenge. As you know, community board applications are coming up, they'll soon be able to be accessed and then they'll be due sometime in February. So you've got lots of time for new members and those who want to reapply and I hope. It's a great board and I hope you do reapply and thank you very much I think you go barely well. Can you hear? Okay, sorry, I just want to say I want to give credit I think I already did to the people on the census, since that was the first thing that Gail referred to, which would be will Sanchez Lorraine, Brown and Andrea Coleman for working really hard, not just in this district, but around Manhattan, focusing on communities that might not have otherwise have responded to the census and reaching out to people who are away and just trying to get the numbers up. So you really deserve a big round of applause, and thank you. Okay. Let's move on okay, let's hear from Trisha. Can you give us a one minute overview of who you are so everybody will know everybody, so I'm I had remarks, but I'm going to I'm changing them. I think that tonight has shown us that we have a lot of work to do on our board and I've been serving on this board or working with the sport since 2013 and between my years of service on the board and calls to all of you. I think that you know a little bit about my background. So, instead of telling you more about who I am I'm going to make a promise to you, and that promise is that in the next year, I promise that I will work on building community amongst ourselves. I promise that I'm going to find new ways to engage our members and to create avenues for new leadership and I promise that I'm going to work with the rest of the chairs at the chair and the rest of the executive committee and all of you to be more efficient and effective in our meetings and in our efforts to engage with our community and advocate on behalf of it. It's really been a tremendous honor to be working with you and to be your second vice chair for the last three years and I'm extremely honored to be working as the first vice chair. So I'm an open book, I'm here to talk to you at any point and thank you again. Thank you so much unless there are any questions for Trisha, let's go on to Valerie who's our candidate for second vice chair first I want to say congratulations to Russell and I. Think he's going to make a great chair and I want to say thank you to the nominating committee for reporting. My name out. I haven't been a member of the community board that long, but I have been attending community board meetings for a very long time. I think, as I mentioned, when I met with the nominating committee, I do a lot of things, I'm on the board of something called the women's prison association at home, and we work with women. Who've been involved in the criminal justice system and I've done that for over 20 years. I also am a trustee of my church on the Upper East side. The brick Presbyterian church and I run a neighborhood association, the East 72Nd Street Neighborhood Association I, am really involved in community affairs and I thought that this was a good way to get involved more with the board. I think tonight has shown that we all need to know each other a lot better. One of the things I recommended is not only seeing the CBS of the new members, but everybody's cv coming around. So we can get to know who we are at the very beginning of each year, find out what we're doing. We all have a lot of talents and I have an open, email and phone number, and you can all call me whenever you have an idea and I'm really honored to try to do this on behalf of the community. Thank you Valerie. Any questions for Valerie, if not we'll go on to Anthony Cohen, who is one of the candidates for Secretary Anthony, the unmuted. Now thank you. Why am I here tonight? I'm tired! We all are tired of Covid-19 tired of meeting electronically, tired of having misplaced our very sense of community as an architect and Upper East side resident for 40 years, though my feeling of exhaustion at the current moral horror runs deeper within our district with the wealthiest and the poorest New Yorkers. Yet heartless development rules, our neighborhood and our city west of Lexington Avenue lies the largely protected sub-district of Fifth, Madison and park. Avenues to the east lies increasing hospital expansion and luxury residential construction driving out, affordable housing, encroaching on our light and air and further overloading our fragile infrastructure. Through it all we make our best efforts to represent with our small voices those who have no voice at all. What hurts the most powerless of us hurts us all. That's why I'm here thanks! Thank you. Now we're going to hear from Rebecca Dan Gore, who is another candidate for Secretary Rebecca I, would like to thank I would like to thank the nominating committee for their continued support and I promise to continue to strive to make sure all of your hard work is accurately accounted for in both the minutes and the vote counts. I would be honored to have your vote thanks, Rebecca any questions for Rebecca. If not we'll, move on to Billy Friedland, who is our third candidate for Secretary, you have one question: nevermind sorry Doc's hand was up, but it went down. Okay, Billy yeah, just one more chuck, sorry, so, hey everybody, Billy, Freeland, I, think I've gotten to know most, if not all of you over these last several years, but I first just want to thank the nominating committee for their continued confidence in me. For those who know a little less about me, I'm an attorney. I've been on the community board for several years now, including two years where I was co-chair of the charter revision task force, getting to work with Elita, and so many others on that really important issue, and I've been a secretary for the last two years and running for a third and final term, and I'm also you know, I love our community and one thing that I'd love to see more people if you're interested to get involved in is I serve on the junior Board with the Isaac center, and we could always use you know some more hands. But you know I just want to cut to the chase and say a little bit about. You know why I want to be a secretary again, I think, as tonight has shown somewhat. You know, there's more work to be done to bring our board together. I tend to be an optimist, I think. There's a lot of you know positive energy and great relationships on this board, but a few things I'd like to see us do more of and as Secretary I'd like to take a leadership role in is outreach particularly to communities that don't often hear from us or maybe don't always get to attend our meetings, particularly on Roosevelt Island and Holmes and Isaacs as well. I also want to see our racial justice task force really get off the ground and I have some ideas in particular about outreach. We can do to bring in more public members potentially to give that committee, some real energy leadership and then finally I think, there's a lot more. We can do on mentorship. I'd like to excuse, build deeper and more sustained relationships from more experienced members to newer members, but I also think particularly with Community board term limits that there's more. That can be done to try to take some of the deeper specialized knowledge that some of our members have, whether it's on issues of zoning or landmarks or housing, and to try to impart some of that wisdom to our newer members to make sure that the board's expertise remains throughout the years. So there's just some thoughts to have again grateful for the confidence you all have expressed to me in the past and look forward to working with you all in 2021. Thank you, Billy any questions for Billy Chuck. No, it's not a question for Billy I. Just wanted to suggest Gail that we have five unanimous people that we take one vote on all the five. You know: I mean no opposition candidates that we take one vote for all five that we don't have to take five votes. We've done that in the past before that sounds very okay to me. But let's just hear what Elaine Walsh had one question Elaine's hand is up yes, Elaine! Well, they may only be candidates for each position, but there may not be a total support or those- and I'm not sure- and maybe Bob Rochaki's better at this- that we voted for each candidate and did not take them as a group. So I'd like other input Michelle. Yes, when I headed up the nominating committee a couple of years ago or last year, whenever it was I, suggested the same action I was told that that's not possible that the role according to the bylaws has to be called on each nominee and that's what we did that night all right. Well, then, let's just take a vote on each candidate, but let's do it in the way. We do a lot of our votes where we'll call out the candidate and then, if anybody abstains or does not vote for cause or has any other reason, they can raise their hand. So we'll start with Trisha. If you'd like to abstain or you're not voting for cause. Please raise your hand now going once going twice seeing no hands, everyone will be recorded as a yes vote for Trisha. Thank you, okay, Valerie's! Next up, if you would like to vote no abstain or not vote for cause, please raise your hand going one going twice: okay, wait! Well, it's unanimous! Oh nope, something! No! I'm sorry! Who are we at I thought we just did Trisha and I wasn't registered as a no okay, we'll change that for you, okay, so who's the second one you're doing Salary Valerie Mason! Oh I'm sorry get rid of that. Okay! Next up! Anthony Cohen! Okay, if you are voting, no I'm standing and not voting for calls on Anthony. Please raise your hand going once going twice sold genetics all righty, Rebecca, Dan Gore. If you'd like to abstain or you're not voting for cause, please use your hand going once going twice seeing none everyone will be recorded as a yes vote for Rebecca, thank you and last, but certainly not least, Billy Friedland. If you would like to vote no, yes, if you'd like to vote, no abstain or not vote for cause, please raise your hand Elaine Walsh. It's a no thank you. Anyone else all right! Thank you! We'll have those voters ready for you guys in a Sec while you're doing that can I just can I. Can you hear me? Yes? Okay, thank you. Yes, we can hear you. We heard you. Okay, thank you. I just want to say in response to Michelle that I just checked with the bylaws, and they say that all votes shall be by role call, except that we have made exceptions because of the nature of zoom, and we would be here as late as we are another hour or two if we did everything by role, so we've always had the so we've always had that exception and it seemed that other than the contested chair positions. It made sense for these. Okay, we're ready. I can read them all for you for Brisha, it's 47, yes, one! No for Valerie, it's 48, yeses zero, knows zero abstentions, Anthony 48 to zero me Rebecca, singer, 48, 0-0 and Billy Freeland 47-1-0! Congratulations! Everyone! Thank you! Congratulations! I'd, say too. I know that you have all done a fantastic job, the ones that I have been working with over the last few years and and for the new people. I have absolute confidence in Valerie and I know that Russell will be excellent. I know he is attentive. We have had a lot of conversations in the last couple of weeks and he was responsive when I talked to him about the negative voting, and we had a lengthy conversation about that. So I know that he will be an excellent chair. This is a board with contentious opinionated passionate engaged people, we're known for that. So it will be. You will do a great job and that's all I can say is congratulations, so thank you for listening and now we could move on. Are we ready we're ready right for the next agenda? Item landmarks, David and Jane will? Yes, there was just one application that we heard on Monday night at the Landmarks Committee meeting 107 East 64th street. This was for a pen, an extension on the roof of the elevator bulkhead and the stair bulkhead with a connecting vestibule. The committee voted to approve because it set approximately 29 feet back from the front elevation and I think 15 feet from the rear elevation. It is visible from certain points or the cladding. The extended chimney required by DOB is visible, a bit from Park Avenue going south, so I don't know there were some people who voted on the other side. David Halpern was one of them. David did you want to speak to on the application? I think that it was sufficiently there are enough people in favor that I'm not going to speak at this time. Okay, thank you. Does anybody else want to speak? Michelle has your hand up Michelle. Do you, okay, yeah, just a comment that in the Whereases one of the, whereas has said, whereas there was no glazing in the vestibule, my recollection is the vestibule does have windows. Yes, it does have making that correction. Okay, there is glazing on both sides of the vestibule. Thank you. Michelle I'll take a look at the resolution and make sure that gets corrected. Thank you any other. So is there a move to approve Marco's hand is up. Oh Marco has his hand up. Ah. Thank you. I would like to call the question. Thank you Marco, all in favor, any opposed I guess we can do our usual vote. Will okay, so right now one of our secretaries will take over okay. Thank you. You'd, like to oh sorry, to cut you off if you'd like to vote, no abstain or you're not voting for cause. Please raise your hand now May, Malik and David may voting now. Thank you, Elita Camp! No! Thank you! Sarah Chu! No thank you got David Hilperin! No! Thank you. Anyone else, all others will be recorded as a yes vote. Thank you for taking the vote too. Oh I see we have two more hands: Mrs Brown. Okay! No, please! She said sorry. Could you repeat that okay Valerie went to the wrong corner to unmute myself, I just I mean I'm abstain from this one. Okay, the vote tally for landmarks item. One are 42 in favor, five opposed and one abstention. Thank you. That's the only yeah, that's the end of our committee report. Thank you thanks, Shane Elite, are you muted? I'm sorry need it again. Okay, let's have the I'm just going to read it from the agenda: the zoning and Development Committee, where we will be talking about the request that was made last night at the zoning meeting, so I think Gail will be taking. That on. Is that Right Gail Sorry about that the community board 8 issued a request for proposal the beginning of October to hire a consultant who would continue the work that had already been begun, which dealt with zoning changes, which would create the 210 foot height limit, along with the creation of special districts, the RFP was drafted by Elaine Elizabeth, Elita will and myself with a lot of help from Adele at the borough president's office, which we appreciate it was then issued to 35 individuals as well as firms. We received one response: we interviewed the architect who did respond, who happened to be tuck Edelson? Who did the original study and project work for us once again? Elita myself, Elaine and Elizabeth interviewed Tuck. We spoke with him for probably an hour and 20 minutes. Ask him very detailed questions. He was extremely thoughtful and responsive and we felt that he would do a good job for us and where we were very pleased is that city planning, which has been rejecting so many proposals, looked at our pre-applications and said that they would like some changes made. But they didn't discard them. Where there's another not-for-profit that actually also put in a proposal dealing with height limits, and that was rejected. So we think that tuck actually did very good work for us initially and we're hopeful that work can continue. So we have a resolution that has been included in your board packet, which I will quickly read, whereas in order for community board 8 to submit zoning change, application for the approved project of setting a 210 foot height, limit on avenues, east of Lexington Avenue and create special districts, and whereas the consultant will provide planning services and support to community board, eight Manhattan zoning and Development Committee and report to the zoning and Development Committee and the CBA chairperson, whereas per the office of the Manhattan borough. President. A solicitation was prepared and sent to over 30 randomly generated people and firms, and the solicitation was developed and conducted pursuant to the requirements governing small purchases under the New York City, Procurement policy board rules and whereas the response to the solicitation had only one applicant Tuck Edelstein of Edelstein, Architecture, Pc and whereas Tuck Edelstein was interviewed by the co-chairs of zoning and development and the chair and first vice chair of the board. The interview confirming that Mr Edelstein met all the criteria set out in the RFP. Whereas the consultant will build on the pre-application, revise and prepare a formal application for submittal to the New York City Department of city planning, work with and respond to appropriate city agencies, collaborate and formulate a strategy to gain wide support for the application and conduct inter divisional meetings and whereas upon acceptance of the application by the New York City Department of City planning. There will be an additional scope of work to perform an Eas, Ceqr and ultimately Euler and whereas compensation for the contract year, July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021. As funding for this specific purpose from City Council discretionary funds, the fifteen thousand dollars in CBA budget, ten thousand dollars, totaling twenty five thousand and therefore the zoning and Development Committee approves the hiring of Chuck Edelstein. For the work to be done for the 210 height limit on the avenues East of Lexington Avenue and the special districts therefore be it resolved at CBA. Hereby ratifies the decision of the committee to award the position of consultant to tuck Edelstein with a written contractual agreement and authorizes the district manager to execute such contract on behalf of CB8. Pursuant to the terms of the solicitation and be it further resolve that the term of the contract will be for the New York City fiscal year, 2021 from the period July 1 2020 to June 30th 2021 for 12 months, and they may be renewed for one additional 12-month period by mutual consent of CB8 and the consultant and be it further resolved that the maximum compensation to be paid for this contract is 25,000 per year. The zoning and Development Committee approved this contract by vote of 14 voted. Yes, zero voted no and five abstained. Are there any questions? Barbara Rutter has her hand up: hey, Barbara, okay, I, just I'm uncomfortable with this, and I'm ready to hear the argument back, because I may be wrong. My assumption, in all my years on, the community board I never heard that the community board spent this type of money on a and consultant we've had consultants from the borough president's office or interns. There's been many, the zoning committee had it the Parks Committee had it other committees may, but ten thousand dollars from the community board. Do we have that type of money? I know we often have money left over. It's used to give some bonuses to our hard-working staff. It's you know, will you tell me I'm wrong? It's used to buy like microphones or things like that or the tablets. I have never heard that this money was being used for us to pay for consultants am I wrong bill. Do you want to answer the question about money for consultants in the board? Would Barbara chalky like to I would think if we call on Barbara jockey as the chair of the finance committee, that would be appropriate, yeah I would just say it is not allowable by city rules to give a bonus out of your budget may not be a bonus, but we or maybe it was a raise, but we've done. Okay, Barbara Chucky, you can it's the budget committee we've, given we've done consulting context before we're actually only voting on our monies that we don't vote on discretionary monies, and we have done this in the past. We have done. We can't we because of the virus we really have. We haven't spent all our money, and this is money that we had in the budget for quite a while. It's a project that we support fully and we really have to get it done. It's really, you know some people were concerned that it's going to take us so long. They wanted to be done sooner. You heard all the people who spoke last night at the Zoning committee meeting, so this is very important. Money excuse me and we're lucky that we have discretionary money from the city council on the borough president's office. To get it done is my opinion on it. It's not unique jack I want to confirm what Barbara said we have in the past hired outside consultants and used the board's money. Whatever was available to pay for him, and here is Barbara. Who knows the finances? We obviously have some money available, we've got and the council members also got us some other money. So I think this is makes sense. Thank you, Chuck Rita, Popper and after Rita, David Halpern has his hand up I, make a motion to approve on the floor already what it's on the floor already? You don't have to make a motion to approve okay, there are some thumbs up for seconds. Okay, David, you had your hand up. Do you still want to do? You need you're, muted, still, David, helper and you're muted? Still, two things number one. You can't do this without proper assistance. This is very sophisticated stuff. It needs a professional to help. You can't do it within what we have, despite the fact that you have three registered architects. I, don't think we have the time to do this, so you really need to retain somebody who has the sophistication and the knowledge to do it number. One number two, since my electronic hand, isn't working I'm going to tell you now that I'm not voting for cause and that's because Chuck Edelstein is a former employee of my firm, but I'm sure he's very capable of doing what we're going to be asking him to do. Thank you, Elaine call the question, I think that's what Rita wanted to do, but I'll do it. Michelle has thumbs up a second okay. Then let's call the question and do it the same way? Where will anyone who is not in favor raise their hand if they're voting no or abstaining, which secretary is do this yep? Okay? So raise your hand if you are voting, no abstaining or not voting for cause, we'll start with Hope Marshall, I'm abstaining. Okay later I'm abstaining. Thank you. Anyone else, okay, Barrero Dan Okay, is any I, don't see any other hands. Anyone else want to vote, no abstain or not vote for cause may has Sir. Billy may has her hand up yep, just called her. I'm explaining thank you Marco. The baby Herman is rising the hand I think he has some problems. Thank you. Okay, David he'll, bring on Mute David just reiterating that I'm not voting for cause as tuck was a former employee. Thank you, rudder I just want to say thank you for the explanation and I'm happily voting. Yes, I feel much better hearing the explanation. Alrighty. Anyone else want to vote, no abstain or not vote for cause. Okay, seeing no hands we'll tell you the votes. Thank you, and it looks like on that vote. It's 42 in favor for abstaining, one, not voting for cause. Okay, thank you. Okay, then I think we're all done. I guess: Ben Kaylos never showed up. Oh well, it would be a little late. Well, you guys have had coming okay, oh, he did. Okay, you guys have had a lot of stamina and a lot of tough questions and a really varied approach to the whole election. But I do appreciate how patient you were, how thoughtful you were, how you concerned. Actually the underlying message of all of your comments were: how concerned you were for the fairness and integrity of the voting process and I couldn't agree with that more so so everyone should give yourselves a pat on the back for caring about honesty and integrity and responsibility. Having said that, is there a motion to adjourn? Oh wait: I forgot in the old business, any old business I see Rebecca took her hand down really fast, any new business. Okay, then there's is there a motion to adjourn I'm guessing Rebecca. That would be you and Billy you, second, any objection to return. Thank you, Rebecca Billy. You second any objections. A second okay, then we'll see you and at land use. If not at a committee meeting in the meantime, listen it's thanksgiving next week, please be careful, be safe, enjoy your holiday and and see you soon.
