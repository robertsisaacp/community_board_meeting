And yet the committee at the end, wants a wishy-washy letter, not saying that they were opposed but saying that people in the community had concern.
You may have heard that there were people there on from the board at the committee meeting, who would not have voted in support of the resolution and rather than have a split resolution which would not have the impact of a letter and having them come back and having a resolution one way or the other at the right.
Please leave your contact information so that as I mentioned, so that the chairs of the zoning and Development committee could be in touch and talk about it, we will have a timeline.
I am a long time resident of New York City and a member of a local group NYC for wired tech, I wish to say a few words to alert all community members to a health danger in our neighborhood.
And I just want to say that recently, the state of new Hampshire, the government of new Hampshire, issued a report saying these antennas have come into question because of the thousands of peer-reviewed studies documenting deleterious health effects associated with cell phone radiation.
They asked me to come tonight because I work with the building council, the shadows that the building will cast over Saint Catherine's park and our building in general, which we think are significant.
We're concerned that the added stress that the building will add to our overall traffic streets and as a responsible member of the community, the Nybc should consider the impact that the proposed tower will have on the streets that are being used to transport critically ill residents of this neighborhood to the hospitals that the Nybc serves streets that are already too congested because of cross park and 59Th street bridge.
A few comments on the existing blood bank proposal I serve as a board member 301 e 66th street 200 units, 17-story condo building that lies directly adjacent to the proposed development, not just an immediate impact of this colossal structure, right on our property line, our strenum of issues with respect to the proposal, including related to the mid-block zoning, which was established over 30 years ago by the arrest, the residential neighborhood, to prevent this type of abuse of our zoning laws.
Contr construction would provide better medical, facilities, upgraded transportation, affordable housing, lower homeless rates, new senior centers schools and the like look around this model of supposed developer.
Second, development is that New York City public schools are going to be closed tomorrow, because the Covid-19 positivity rate is above 3, city wide, and these two ingredients of change provide the perfect recipe for mom and pop shops, particularly restaurants, to lose customers and go out of business and for luxury real estate developers to swoop in buy a block of buildings at a time in order to gather air rights and race towards the sky, not including sufficient, if any housing that is affordable and ruining our environment for many years to come by contributing the climate change which I know Wendy just spoke, about.
We've heard a lot of great points on this already today, but I just wanted to formally register my concern also for the Neuric Blood Center construction project and to be clear.
But I just want to reiterate some of the points that I think have already been made specifically around this commercial rezoning, mid-block, this extra four hours of shadow on the park nearby and.
And I want to talk a little bit about the blood center for a second and to thank all the community.
I'm, not going to wait for the next community board Mem meeting on this subject, and neither should anybody else who is against this project and to that end, I just want to announce that the Department of city planning is having their scoping meeting regarding the project it's going to be held on December, 15th.
The city of New York know that you believe in the zoning requirements we have and that you and what all of your individual comments are and start organizing in your buildings.
I want to thank Elita your chairwoman for joining us at the meeting last night and for serving on the Kohler Task Force New York state is providing 328 million dollars for the home energy assistance program, heap, which helps income eligible families, pay, heating, costs.
I have a little bit more time left to continue to work for the community, but before you go assembly, member I would like to say, and my computer, oh goodness- and frozen.
I do want to thank you, though, for all of your service on behalf of the Manhattan communities, including Roosevelt Island of the women in the state of New York of people who don't have as strong a voice as some other communities and wish you much luck in the challenges and trials of the coming.
Thank, you all right, we'll start with Alan from the Da's office and again just like what we had earlier you'll see a two minute: timer I will try to not cut you off, but just know that we're timing.
You know, finds these proposals unsettling and urges the legislature to find new ways of raising revenue recommending an ultra billionaire's tax so that we do not see these layoffs happen and all of these cuts happen in the MTA, because it's the backbone of our city, so we're trying our absolute best to keep tabs on the situation as well, as you know, find ways that we could raise more revenue for the MTA to fully function, and you know just get back to as normal as they possibly can, and also some of you may be aware of the increasing percentage percentages of Covid-19 in the community, and we are seeing a high percentage in the one, zero, seven, five zip code, and we are just asking people to continue practicing social distancing, mask wearing and all of those necessary protocols.
She takes the responsibility very seriously, especially in these trying times, and while she can't be here, tonight, she'll address the board in December to express her gratitude personally and discuss her priorities as the legislative season ramps up again.
Thank you for working hard to represent the community, and the city will I understand that President Gail, Brewer and City Council member Ben Kayla's are coming.
I know that Hunter College, President, Jennifer Rob will be participating and speaking at the youth, Education and Libraries committee meeting on Monday, so sign up and go to that.
That I'd like to thank with respect to Northwell and the blood center, both Anthony Cohn and Marco Tamayo, for working hard on putting together views and gathering up information as architects that they know how to interpret and put it in a form that the public can easily understand.
I ask everyone, as all of the elected official reps have done to please follow all of the health guidelines: wear a mask social distance, wash your hands and stay safe as we're seeing numbers go up and even when they weren't going up with respect to the banks on the bank or loss of bank on Roosevelt Island, we have sent out our resolution and letter.
I know how effective the whole community board was at the last meeting by the absence of a bank on Roosevelt Island.
I, think other people would like to know.
Of, and then you know, staff continues to be working very hard on constituent cases and if you guys ever see anything that you need us to follow up on I know, we've worked with a lot of the board members and a lot of the folks in the public who've reached out to us about issues in the neighborhood.
The board will have an opportunity to ask questions and and have the candidates answer your questions after the chairs will hear from Trisha and then and will vote on each office after the the candidates or candidates have an opportunity to speak and have their questions.
I know that we have a very active and interested and engaged board with a lot of questions.
Actually, Elita and I have had numerous requests, especially from new board members, to be able to answer, ask and then see answers to questions from our candidates.
I think this is in large part due to zoom, because people haven't been able to really get to talk to one another in person to know each other.
Just want you to know that if you are committed to a candidate, you can still change your mind to vote on another candidate.
That said, we're going to begin with Russell Squire, who is the first of two candidates for board care.
I want to be the board chair because I see that as a way to serve the Upper, East, Side and Roosevelt Island, even more and I, have the skills and experience from my work, both on and off the board to be effective.
Chair should not use their power to try to steer things in a particular direction, but rather should ensure a fair process like a moderator and respect the other board members and allow them to discuss and persuade one another, and the chair has to keep the meetings on track and keep the agenda moving with respect to committees.
We are most successful at getting agencies to listen to us when we work through our elected officials, whom I know and can work well with, and the chair also has to liaise with the agencies, the public and the media, and all of these aspects of the chair role are ones that I would be effective at some of the things that I would want to focus on next.
I'm very proud of all the work that the board has done in response to Covid-19, not just on contact tracing, but also with regard to small businesses with regard to schools and in other areas.
I also want us to do more outreach to let the community know about the positive role that we play in particular.
I want us to present to schools, to let students know about us and also to engage and reach out with the residents of Holmes and Isaacs to get them more engaged in the work of the board.
I also think we're going to have a lot of work to do to ensure that the voice of the community is heard with respect to the blood center internally.
This has been a concern for a number of you, so I just wanted to make sure everybody knows that in closing whether it is in leading and participating in meetings or working with other board members outside of meetings, I have shown the ability to work, collaboratively, build consensus and listen to effectively address and resolve issues and to run things.
Second and first, and also your position on the New York Blood Center and Northwell Lennox Hill hospital projects, which will both consume much of this board's attention over the next year.
As I, said in the meeting last night, I think there are a lot of valid concerns that the community has raised, and if you were to ask me, you know: I'm asking you.
I want to know what you think: right.
I'm hopeful that, based on the concerns that were expressed, yesterday, that you know that the developer will come back to us and hopefully work with the community to try and address those concerns.
Let me just add one more point here: actually on this, so I'm happy to answer questions about you know my substantive views on things.
Think that I, like talking about that stuff, but I, do want to just emphasize the point that the you know the chair is elected to lead.
The committee sorry, the community board, rather than represent us and, as I said in my speech, I, think.
The chair gets a vote just like everybody else in the meeting, but the community board, as a board, is going to make its decision as a board on the whole and whatever that decision is that's.
You know when community members are electing a state, senator I as an individual voter.
I think you know I like talking about the stuff, but I do want to emphasize that.
You agree that your job would be to work with the chairs of the different community committees and not make it just a land use.
As the chair should let the committees again do their work as I said and respect them to do the work that they're going to do and what they want to do.
I think it's perfectly appropriate for the chair to suggest areas that a committee might want to look at, but by and large let the committees do what they're going to do.
But you know just let the committees do their work as they're capable of thank you, okay.
I. Think I had to congratulate that you're running for the as a chair for the chair position of the community board, but I.
Everyone I only think it would be fair to ask Sherry to respond to the same line of questions that were asked to wrestle regarding the northwell and the blood center and also whether she agrees with Russell in terms of the role of the chair and his response.
People, who were opposed to my candidacy raised the issue of whether I would have adequate time to devote to the role of board chair and in responding to that.
You know if I weren't, confident that I can do it well, which means devoting the time to it that it's going to require.
I. Think each candidate addresses what he or she would like to address and is, and each of them is going to welcome questions from all of us.
So I just wanted to put that out there that you know I disagree with a formal making of them each to answer a question that went to the other.
Firm I have heard not from you from others that you have said that most of the work of the community board chair is after five o'clock.
A lot being said, whether you know when it went into asking about the building and other things that I don't think it has anything to do with this kind of introduction to meeting the people that are going to the chair, I would be interested to hear what sherry has to say and then ask questions according, but not to just deal with the subject.
Sorry to the rest of the board, I'm, going to try to participate, I'm, going to scoot, not waste any more time, but I wanted to.
How would you, as a chair of Cbh, see to it that the residents are made aware that the community board serves their community too majority of the time they we have felt left out, for example, the Learning Bridges site being placed right on our grounds and as a leader in my community and beyond, we were not aware I for one have adult children, but I would have liked to inform residents in the beginning stage rather than when the selection process was already taking.
So, I think you know it involves doing the work, so I think the first step is going and trying to speak to members of Holmes and Isaacs at meetings or in other contexts.
We can organize them basically and I would want to do this as the chair go there and make sure folks are aware of the community board.
You know what it is that we do what our role is in the community and really work to listen to their concerns.
You know once that happens, I think it gets its own momentum and when people from those communities are more involved in the community, board, then I think we're hearing more about them and their concerns are coming more to the fore.
We're asking candidates about their plans, long beyond the term that they're running for and and I, don't think that we should be stifling anyone's ambitions to serve our community.
I just want to remind everyone, especially newer, board, members, that these terms are for one year, so we can always re-elect new people, no matter what the circumstances are.
We started this line of questioning the way we did, and we did you know through one after the other, but I think unless we're going to be asking both candidates about their three to five year.
So I'm not running for office for anybody who might have been concerned, and secondly, you'll, see when I go through my my remarks that I'm really very in tune to the board, because I've answered a lot of your questions in my prepared remarks.
I am retiring in December as township attorney, which will give me the flexibility and time to attend meetings during the day, such as Borough Board city, planning, meeting with applicants, because I know that being chair of community Board 8 requires much a much greater time commitment than just running a board meeting which I am able and prepared to give.
Since I'm asking for your vote, you should know the kind of chair I'm going to be.
I know how to run an effective meeting and the following are my plans to streamline and show it in our board.
I do not believe an initial discussion on a new matter should be conducted at the end of a long board meeting and when a committee passes a resolution or sends a letter on a substantive topic that should only be the first step.
And I have reached out to each community board member and have spoken to most of you, including committee chairs, and co-chairs.
I will make sure the lines of communications are open, working with will and the staff not to micromanage, but to motivate our employees so that they know their contributions are valued and appreciated and to ensure that their workload is appropriately distributed to serve the needs of the board, especially the committee chairs.
These are some of my thoughts and your ideas and how to make community board aid a more efficient, dynamic, inclusive, supportive force for the Upper, East Side and Roosevelt Island, and I'm, asking for before your vote.
There was some conflict, as you know, and as we've discussed with some issue with the community board.
I think this is what we are beings that are interested in community work and politics comes out of it, but I just want to point out that it's unfair to criticize one and I.
The other day said that new people will vote for Russell because this person called them.
Multiple times, I've talked you know in much more depth about various things that I want to do and my priorities.
Now, for four years, have absolutely 100 felt very siloed, and if there is anyone that would like to say that there are not clicks amongst the members, who've been part of the board for longer, then I would have to wholeheartedly disagree and the fact that sherry was asked some of the same questions along the same lines.
But I feel like a lot of these questions that are being asked of either sherry and or Russell are veiled.
So, there's no particular question, except that I do feel like there's a lot of preparation where, even in the speech was like and asked me about this particular thing, where I feel that this was prepared amongst board members.
We didn't have the opportunity to speak, but I'm, going to take your question on diversity and and address how I see that it needs to address more diversity, not only in community board eight, but also in the public participants.
We need to reach out to neighborhood and tenants associations to encourage their members to become involved at community board.
You know that wasn't an issue for many of us, but many people are intimidated and another thing I think we could.
I want to say that, rather than complaining about the process or offering our own personal views, because we somehow each of us might be feeling wronged, I would like to hear from the candidates and to that end.
Having served as a mayor of the large community overseeing multi-million dollar budget running meetings, I mean this is the kind of skills that you need.
The city charter gives the community board a special role in the area of land use, and that would make that my top priority is to address development in the Upper East side.
These are certainly areas that I think the community board can have an impact.
And I, look forward to working with members of our committees on these areas that we have prioritized for the community.
I want at all points of view to be heard, but certainly there's no need to have people talk.
You, know, talk, I, think every board.
The you know, zoning development meeting and the question was raised.
You know: I've had a lot of phenomenal discussions with some of our newer board members, particularly around issues of.
So my question is: Would you consider appointing someone who's, a first or second year, board member to be a co-chair or chair of that new task.
Member of the community board to a committee, but.
We're, past that, and now it's like I'm having flashbacks, because if I were a public, a member of the public attending tonight's meeting, it would seem as if the personal, priorities, policy, priorities and viewpoints are now front and center and that's never been what this vote was about or should be about.
If possible, since Joey said we can ask those questions of Russell is what will each candidate do if the board takes the position that the chair doesn't support and how will you help heal the sport if it's made frankly off the rails, discussion.
Okay, so I just wanted to echo Billy Friedman's remarks about how the board will be well served by either Russell or Sherry.
One, was outreach, board, outreach to various communities and including Isaacs and Holmes, which I think is fantastic and also outreach to the new board members, which I think is fantastic, and my question is there is there appears to be to me a lack of diversity among the committee co-chairs and sherry.
We're talking about seven different people who are diverse themselves and certainly I, would consider I mean you know we took.
We have many talented african-american people on the board, who I think should be serving as as chair.
We, we're not that our group is much more diverse and our chairs and our board members and our public participation.
You know that being co-chair of the voting reform task, force, I think we served a major public benefit by having the two meetings that we had on the ways to vote.
This November was a challenge, and yet we reached out to our public and our board members frankly to tell them how they could vote early.
Think the most important thing I've done is as a member of the community board is this last year.
So I think that of my community board experience that I would say would be my high point.
If, you don't mind, because actually Gail I think it would be extremely helpful to have them answer the same question back-to-back all right, thanks.
People had different sides on and where there was a public debate going, and we just wanted to make sure that we were informing the community in an even handed way so that people can make up their own minds and make their own informed.
So I think those are exemplars both of how I work with members on the board and with how I lead meetings and lead efforts like that, and I'm very proud of what the result was.
My previous participation in voting for chairs, the candidate's name, was presented at the board meeting and it was either yes.
If you look at the bulk of the questions, I think the idea that this was done because of some brown swell by new members is a little bit difficult to believe.
Think from what most members really wanted to see in a meeting like this, so I think in terms of how to bring the board together.
And I hope that this meeting exemplifies for people on the board, who want that which side is more likely to do that and again, I'm very committed to doing that.
I. Think the reluctance to appoint diverse leadership to that committee because of arbitrary restrictions on new members or other kinds of considerations- that, frankly, I'm, not privy to.
Welcome to and for participating, I know that this has been long and a difficult process, probably mostly for the candidates and for the people on the board, who are getting frustrated, Russell called and asked why we're doing this.
So I really am full of gratitude for the candidates for taking this in good stride and for the board members in and asking the questions and listening to the answers.
You've got lots of time for new members and those who want to reapply and I hope.
I think that tonight has shown us that we have a lot of work to do on our board.
I'm going to make a promise to you, and that promise is that in the next year, I promise that I will work on building community amongst ourselves.
I promise that I'm going to find new ways to engage our members and to create avenues for new leadership and I promise that I'm going to work with the rest of the chairs at the chair and the rest of the executive committee and all of you to be more efficient and effective in our meetings and in our efforts to engage with our community and advocate on behalf of it.
I think, as I mentioned, when I met with the nominating committee, I, do a lot of things, I'm on the board of something called the women's prison association at home, and we work with women.
I've, been on the community board for several years now, including two years where I was co-chair of the charter revision task, force, getting to work with Elita, and so many others on that.
You know why I want to be a secretary, again, I think, as tonight has shown somewhat.
You know, there's more work to be done to bring our board together.
I'd like to excuse, build deeper and more sustained relationships from more experienced members to newer members, but I also think, particularly with Community board term limits that there's more.
I know that you have all done a fantastic job, the ones that I have been working with over the last few years and and for the new people.
I think that it was sufficiently there are enough people in favor that I'm not going to speak at this time.
I'm just going to read it from the agenda, the zoning and Development Committee, where we will be talking about the request that was made last night at the zoning meeting, so I think Gail will be taking.
The community board 8 issued a request for proposal the beginning of October to hire a consultant who would continue the work that had already been begun, which dealt with zoning changes, which would create the 210 foot height limit, along with the creation of special districts, the RFP was drafted by Elaine Elizabeth, Elita will and myself with a lot of help from Adele at the borough president's office, which we appreciate.
You want to answer the question about money for consultants in the board.
You heard all the people who spoke last night at the Zoning committee meeting.
