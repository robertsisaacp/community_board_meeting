You know the open restaurants, program, there's an executive order, number 126, which was signed on June, 18, 2020 And, then there's a recent executive order, which is for the newest one, the stores and that was executive, order.
157, signed on October, 28, 2020, And I know that in some one of our previous meetings there had been some issues as to how zoning was affected by these programs in the executive order and the one thing that both of these executive orders do.
It suspends a number of things under city law and it also suspends parts of the zoning resolution and that's why they're allowed to have restaurants and places where they you know in the street in places where they cafes, where they would not normally have them and that's the same thing with the stores.
Last week the mayor announced the open storefronts program, which is a city initiative and Covid-19 recovery program that allows for ground floor storefront businesses to temporarily conduct retail activity on sidewalks that are directly in front of their businesses or on roadways that are participating in the open, streets.
So businesses are allowed to self- certify that they need these program requirements in order for them to participate and the DOT team, emily, and I were happy.
You know to help answer any questions that folks may have about program criteria or outdoor setups, and thank you again to Community Board 8, for the invitation and for having a fun.
And I understand that you're looking to expand the bike lanes, I, find them very dangerous hold on one second susan, we're not going to discuss those This is this is about the restaurants program or if you want to talk about well, I'm, very supportive of the restaurant program.
You know small businesses in particular that are able to self- certify that they meet program requirements for this new open, storefronts program, And you know just to reiterate a kind of where exactly they're able to set up these businesses will be able to set up on the sidewalk that is directly outside of their business or in the road bed and on the street of you, know the streets where we have open streets, restaurants, corridors.
So I would think that, if a restaurant, that is, it has done that and gone to the expense of having the new filtration system that they should be allowed to have more than 25 percent of occupancy within the restaurant as well, because they've gone out of their way to try and consider what's necessary and the city needs to meet them halfway.
We know many of our restaurants in order to find the space to open up outside on the street kind of go off from in front of their stores.
Because I would think that yeah, the people living in the neighborhood may have a problem with stores and restaurants.
This is a bit of a touchy subject, but from my perspective, street vendors, you know play an important role in the fabric of New York City and we've got a lot of people who have been suffering.
Guess what sort of considerations DOT given to expanding this program to street vendors and one consideration that came to mind, because I know we want to certainly support.
Think your questions about potentially pairing vendors with open storefronts is sounds like a very creative idea and something again maybe to coordinate with and talk to the department of small business services, who has and does a lot of outreach and contact with property owners and retailers and may be able to provide thoughts and guidance on that anything else.
It has been announced that it will be a permanent program and multiple city agencies are, you know, currently kind of looking and in discussions about what that will mean what the process will be all of those things, so there's kind of little to report yet because we're still at the very beginning, stages.
Certainly, there will be a lot of things to reconsider for a permanent program and that will certainly include the design of the spaces that are on the street.
I know that a lot of small business owners, especially on the east side, are having trouble actually sourcing, the heat lamps that are clearly needed, now, as we go into winter.
I, do not know if the city has put any thought into trying to help restaurants and now retail stores acquire either it's actually.
Now that some of the rules have been changed, and hopefully that question was clear: A great question, all sidewalk cafe, rules, Kind of pre- pandemic were suspended as part of the executive order for open restaurants.
Are our colleagues at the Economic Development Corporation have started a series of resources both to connect designers to restaurant or store owners to kind of help, build out some of the these things.
I've noticed with a lot of the restaurants, and perhaps the storefronts will be doing this as well- are building structures that they're now pretty much enclosing on three sides, almost creating an indoor environment, So I think it's important to note that New York City is really following the state's lead on all of the health guidance related to to restaurants, and so we've been working very closely with our colleagues at the Department of Health.
The open, storefront program allows for people to actually have a transaction on the street, so you could call up.
Out, and I think it is very fair to say that those you know the considerations for a permanent non, coveted program are very different from the considerations that created the open restaurant program.
What is why are we creating this permanent program when it was created for a specific reason, and now that reason won't will be eliminated And yet we're encouraging the program to continue, because, after all, there's a lot of repercussions to having such a program permanently on the street, not to mention the visual blight, the structure, the traffic they're in bike lanes they're in you Know there could be a bike lane on the other side of the restaurant, You, all know, But what's the rationale for doing this and breaching the zoning So they should not be in bike.
The first about zoning is that zoning will need to be reassessed, and All all associated processes that come along with rethinking zoning The city did have a sidewalk cafe program and two DOT did have did have a a street seat program.
I do not want to gloss over the fact that a permanent program really needs some serious thinking about process and design and how all of these spaces interact both with the street.
I. Think what we're seeing and what we're hearing is just that having people out on the street enlivening our sidewalks and our streetscapes has been not only in terms of covered times where it feels you know like a breath of fresh air and to see like life and our neighbors on our streets, but that it really does have you know a quality of life kind of public space benefit to to our streets, and So I.
Think it's taking a program which was envisioned to kind of bring the parisian sidewalk cafe, environment, to New York City through the through the zoning The ability to work with restaurants, to bring public seating and restaurants, heating onto the.
You should come to the community and the locations should be discussed and decided in conjunction with the community and not just making a statement that this whole restaurant thing is going to be permanent and so that everybody who's self- certified who's on the street now can just be assumed to stay there.
Yet, given you know the pandemic and recovery, And things like that, but I do just want to be very clear that a permanent program will look different than what you see on the street now I'll direct this to you too, as the deputy borough, commissioner, that obviously you'll come back to the board and talk about any kind of a permanent, program, and I assume that's what Emily was referring to before we currently permanent program implemented and check.
We know that restaurants, who are in front of bus stops or bike lanes, do not have the same ability to expand as other better located.
If you want to give a little bit more detail in that for our new open store french program, I think we can expect kind of similar type requirements, as neighborhood cases may go up.
It's a tricky situation, You know with the building department and see if we can come up with some kind of rationale when they get a permit to do scaffolding, maybe it has to be renewed at a you know on a certain basis and it has to be looked at and in some kind of process, but I think that some, that is, an issue in our area, clearly agreed and colleen, and I can take that back because we do know it has been.
Have a hard time thinking that far back but empty storefronts were not an unheard of phenomenon before the pandemic, and so a lot of businesses were going out and Until.
And, you know, city agencies, feel that there is a possibility to extend , I think you know we'll cross that bridge when we get there, but open storefronts right now is looking to run just from now until the end of the year and then outdoor dining program.
The, open restaurants program that was announced by the mayor last month that we are looking for a way to create a permanent program for outdoor dining and that's what we'll be returning to the board with updates.
You know, restaurants, have to self- certify and guarantee that they need certain requirements to set up their outdoor dining on the sidewalk or road bed directly in front of their establishment.
We've talked about zoning: We have a number of streets and avenues in our community that have restrictions regarding outdoor dining.
We as a community need to ask the question: Is this sun setting, or are we going to give away all zoning and forget that we have any in the city?
So I'd like a response from the city agencies on what's going on here Other communities are raising zoning issues.
Sure so maybe just quickly say that the Department of City planning was a strong partner in developing the open restaurant program.
The mayor can not just wave the magic wand, and you know if you live in the community you're getting asked the questions, And, so I'm asking what's going on with the zoning.
You know the program guidelines for making open restaurants permanent is still under development, and so I'm sure I can coordinate with will craig and chuck on when we can return.
We had to, as you know, implement the open restaurants program very quickly and we had to create.
Unfortunately, but you know, as of today, there's over ten thousand participating restaurants in our outdoor dining program.
D.O.T was trying to kind of think through and come up with creative ways to make it livable and safe for all seat street and sidewalk users.
If you actually want to send us that location and we can contact that business directly and do some follow- up to make sure that those elements are removed, all right, great and then just looking forward, I know.
If you know for the open, streets, restaurants program, we need a minimum of three restaurants to apply on that block or along that corridor.
Is it going to go into the crosswalk so that people can not cross So, regarding your second question, so No, you can't throw snow that you shovel back into the street.
One question to the DSNY: they said that when there's a snow emergency that they would expect the restaurants to take in their outdoor tables and chairs and that what happens to the permanent structure that stays there, I assume.
We welcome an opportunity to work with the city to provide our advice and to have input into these decisions that affect not just the immediate ones like the restaurants or the stores, but the people who live around them.
I. Think you got to ask yourself: Why would you put a lane on the street that has the exit for the FDR all the bridge, traffic, thousands upon thousands of cars every day, Now I know it could inconvenience the bikers, and, I, believe in bike.
They do not want a bike lane on their street, and you know I think it's important to have bike.
Chuck, I'm, going to first have my husband speak because he's a regular biker and a resident of the neighborhood I think Bike bicycle lanes make a lot of sense.
For all intents and purposes, and so you know, now, we've basically got as people talked about access to the FDR and 62nd street with one lane, people have no curb out access and traffic is backing up.
We know: you've all spent a lot of time on this, but there was no study that was shared with the community that people who live here on a daily basis know what traffic was before and is now, and I really think you need to hear it in full spectrum on just a discussion over 62nd and 61st, street, These tweaks are helping a little bit, but the impact is just so huge that even a little change is not at all benefiting our neighborhood.
I'm, the vice president of the board at 200, E, 62Nd street I've also worked with Juliana in connection with the Treadwell Farms Association, putting my law firm behind some zoning issues that we've had over time as well, And I just want to say that I appreciate we're a complex, city.
I do not think you would find a single person in our community who's in support of these bike lanes and the traffic and noise that they're engendering in the in the area.
It is absolutely true that I do not know if the members from the department of transportation live in our neighborhood, but if you, if you're in our neighborhood any time after four o'clock, particularly right now during the pandemic, when everyone's driving, you would see what it's like, and it is not.
I also had this notion that when it first went, in- And I have to confess that when I first went- You know full open discussion about it Basically you roll out of bed one day and see these bike lanes out in front of you and see the traffic start piling up, and I just made the assumption that it was done because peop the administration figured that during Covid-19 we'd have people coming back to work in Manhattan and that people would not be wanting to take the subways, and so therefore they would be getting on their bikes and going to work.
When it comes to the installation of these bike lanes and Yes, it goes without saying we're feeding into and out of the FDR drive and the 59th Street bridge, and It's, really just not working out, and I.
I understand why Bike lanes are important, but guess what so is parking for people who live in the neighborhood?
I mean there is a permanent bike lane already on 60th street.
I mean we've heard all the comments and we've been getting emails about the bike lane and, And I know that the I know that D.O.T is going to come back with any proposals for making anything permanent.
