I think that we're just going to jump right into the first The first presentation is that right, barry absolutely go ahead, I just actually well so in over the summer time, I'm sure you might have heard we have a lot of articles about it right at 70, 74th street six Thank, you all right, 76th street we had a major collapse of the waterfront It was about the size of a king-sized bed of a hole, we're very grateful to the parks department for acting quickly to rope it off.
If you hear any loud noises from my end, my wife is currently working on putting my 18 month old to bed, so hopefully he's a little quiet but glad to see that it is a family affair We did want to provide a update on that sinkhole and the seawall collapse over at east 76th street That was that it was occurred on july 20th Obviously, the collapse was beyond what we had originally anticipated, as you can see with that fallen fence in there and then barricades were put up beyond that, and actually we've, unfortunately had to close through passage to the north and south He did mobilize on august 20th and the first activities that he performed were excavating, that area to get out the debris and things like that.
This is looking north, and so we performed that field excavation and then also they put in security measures to stop any further loss of backfill, and that was important because, if that erosion continued to the west, that would also have risk to the fdr, which is right, Besides, the esplanade, this location and also we've been able to utilize our design consultants to perform underwater inspections during this time on the water side to identify some of the field conditions as related to the foundation there, and you can kind of see that a little bit on the left-hand picture.
You'll see that that's important here is simply is that, while we feel that we can open a 17-foot path before the end of the year as we priorly committed, we do not feel that we're going to be able to open that full 22-foot pathway and I'll scroll up for a second and that's this portion in green and then put up a new fence and then basically pave over this area.
We are in the final stages of design for east esplanade contracts, phase two and three and that's performing work up at 114 to 117th, I, believe 92nd and 94th and 62nd to 63rd We were going to now include this section in that contract and since that is a full estimate contract that is, we can perform that work on the water side, so we'll be able to mainly do this restoration without impact of the thoroughfare here We do hope to minimize any impact there.
You know we have been granted a certain amount of funding for the esplanade as a whole, and we felt that the best use of that was to try to make these larger site-specific contracts, because we do have those ongoing inspections in coordination with EDC, to try to identify these ahead of time.
So we are able to bring some trucks and station them there when we're doing the work without impacting the fdr too much, then I just have a third quick question and then a comment, I, don't believe, am I right, trish and barry that this was not next on the list that I know 104th street This is the second emergency in really just a few years that we've had I would not lean against the espionage.
You know right now we are trying to do those five years in inspections in order to identify these critical areas ahead of time.
All right, I am have been concerned for a number of years about the condition of the esplanade really above 96th street, particularly in the area leading up to the footbridge at 103rd street, and you know if you've walked over there.
That's also going to happen somewhere during that, along that stretch, leading up to the 103rd street footbridge and terence, that kind of dropped a little bit you're asking for around the 100th to 103rd street north of 96th street, which has been in pretty bad shape for quite a long time and now is kind of semi fenced off, so that most of us are now walking on the grass So I believe I do have gabrielle chernik on the line as well, whom, if you could unmute in case she's, our project manager here, unfortunately over at 1023rd We, do have those specific areas fenced off that we have concerns about.
We are trying to prioritize from the inspections as best we can those areas that are labeled as serious or critical that we have the largest concern about failure, okay, and why is it not working over here, and somebody told me that when real estate developers developed on the west side that they contributed money to the riverside drive, whatever that is called?
We are basically utilizing our own fund, the parts funding that we've been allocated in order to address as much of it as possible, but, That is not proactive should be when body it looks like is a cyclical state All. The reports should be available when the community were eight.
This may be the trigger, but we have to move beyond this We have to deal exactly with this application But the point is if we don't open for future conversations to on, to request the parks to come in with a plan Yes, let's go talk about just only the this failure and, from my point of view and she's, a member of the public So. If you'd like to speak barry, you certainly can, or we don't know let the member of the public speak.
I think that there's both a local problem and that there's a larger problem of understanding how impacted the under pilings are and the structural integrity underneath the esplanade fixing this portion of the esplanade without understanding what's happening to the north and the south and in fact, on the fdr drive, is going to be a waste of repair money which, as a taxpayer, I incredibly resent and also as a person who walks and who loves my neighbors We, really need to look very much at the environmental impact.
Can you repeat that yes, certainly time and cost so currently, we are committing to opening this up prior to the end of 2020, we're expediting design, and things like that, and obviously there are concerns about any other field conditions that we may encounter So. That's why we're indicating, currently by the end of 2020, in relation to cost.
So, in this case, one of the things that was noted in the poor identification on the 2018 report was that it was missing the fascia stone, so it's quite possible that the facial stone was actually helping hold back some of that sea wall and then, additionally and you're not going to see this was a section view just north of this area.
That's when we closed down that area and obviously, very soon after that, the failure occurred, and you said that the money that came that came to fix this project came out of an exhibit that a contract that was about seawall repair, that was that was just going through.
I don't have the list right in front of me, but it's throughout the city, Bronx Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, staten, island, okay, great and my concern is with the full repairs going interface to phase three of the esplanade.
We obviously spoke with our elected officials, including congresswoman carolyn maloney, who indicated that her conversations with hunt with commissioner silver and with the end with engineers at the site had indicated that they didn't know the structural integrity of the fdr in some of the areas along the along the that were right up against the esplanade If you can speak to it, all any sort of safety concerns any sort of weakening of the ground beneath the fdr When we were when this failed, we immediately also talked to city and state dot, for this location inform them of our repair plan We have been in contact with them regarding it.
One is performing an inspection along this section going north to about the triboro bridge there and take a look at that to make sure that they feel comfortable or if they want to try to identify any possible undermining there.
This is obviously a very important piece of open space for my for our community, but it's personally our park It's the park that we go to all the time in the open space that we visit to see the state that it's going to be in for I'm guessing I have a million comments about how it looks and how it feels and how in safety have both perceived safety and actual safety of that area.
We're getting pictures from sent to our board office of 96th street and that area with major crevices in the in the esplanade and I know that you guys are working very fast, but the fact that you're going to be opening this area by the by christmas is fine, but that's also going to be past the time when everybody's using it right Now, we have thousands of people who are using the waterfront all the time, they're relying on it to as their only way of commuting, mostly because of this pandemic.
