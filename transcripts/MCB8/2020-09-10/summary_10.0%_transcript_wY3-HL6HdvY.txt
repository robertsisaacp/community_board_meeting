And elizabeth rose and brian, and I think that's all the new members, but if any of you are interested in being in kind of being permanent official members of our committee, And I would really appreciate some new voices on the committee, some additional park users and open space, lovers.
The esplanade, this location and also we've been able to utilize our design consultants to perform underwater inspections during this time on the water side to identify some of the field conditions as related to the foundation there, and you can kind of see that a little bit on the left-hand picture you'll see that.
We are in the final stages of design for east esplanade, contracts, phase two and three, and that's performing work up at 114 to 117th, I, believe, 92nd and 94th and 62nd to 63rd.
This is that asphalt, and actually what we're also going to plan to do is pave all the way to the barrier against the fdr to really try to give pedestrians as much access as possible for that thoroughfare.
So once we excavated further and identified the existing field conditions, we kind of we realized that we weren't going to able to do everything that, on that land side, which is what that retaining wall contract supplies for and that we need to do more work on the water, side.
You know we have been granted a certain amount of funding for the esplanade as a whole, and we felt that the best use of that was to try to make these larger site-specific contracts, because we do have those ongoing inspections in coordination with EDC, to try to identify these ahead of time.
So I'm going to go to police and then lowell and then barbara Currently parks is anticipated, anticipating managing the partial path reopening, as well as the full restoration at this site through our phase Two slash three contracts and do you have funding for the phase two phase, three contracts for the retaining wall so phase two slash: Three: are not those city-wide retaining wall contracts, those are the site, specific easter egg, contracts, and yes.
The fdr is a is a bit of a limiting factor due to bridge heights, and things like that, so I don't, at my fingertips, have the exact plan, but we do have to get a d.o.t permit in order to bring in the trucks over here, so we have very quickly and immediately reached out to them.
I would obviously, as I'm sure many people would prefer to issue contracts in order to address any sort of item that has been identified.
You know right now we are trying to do those five years in inspections in order to identify these critical areas ahead of time.
That is an option that we could possibly look into, but right now we are trying, with that site specific in order to utilize that funding as widely as possible in order to bring this up to.
I want to know that the parts of the esplanade that remain open aren't going to be in danger of imminent collapse.
The bottom line is what I'm trying to get at, and how are we going to feel confident that we can address not only the 76th street situation now, but others that are that we can possibly anticipate and deal with it sooner rather than waiting for a full collapse to take place.
I am have been concerned for a number of years about the condition of the esplanade really above 96th street, particularly in the area leading up to the footbridge at 103rd street, and you know if you've walked over there.
Due to funding you know, we do have to try to prioritize what we are currently identifying as the worst areas.
We are trying to prioritize from the inspections as best we can, those areas that are labeled as serious or critical that we have the largest concern about failure: okay, rita.
I, think that there's both a local problem and that there's a larger problem of understanding how impacted the under pilings are, and the structural integrity underneath the esplanade fixing this portion of the esplanade without understanding what's happening to the north and the south and in fact, on the fdr drive, is going to be a waste of repair money which, as a taxpayer, I, incredibly resent, and also as a person who walks and who loves my neighbors.
We are committing to opening this up prior to the end of 2020, we're expediting design, and Things like that, and obviously there are concerns about any other field conditions that we may encounter.
This fence line is where we will have basically precast concrete blocks to creating our new seawall, and then we are basically backfilling beyond that, and this is kind of this cross section talks about a little bit about very it's, It's a very basic color coded item, but basically that green portion is that new wall, the from the precast blocks and then backfilling beyond that We have notified them regarding this work and we do our acting within the general permit for the city , What is what is the state of repair for that utter wonder for that underwater portion of the sea wall.
We not putting people at risk walking on the esplanade when it's not going to be an actual full repair?.
So it's quite possible that the facial stone was actually helping hold back some of that sea wall and then, additionally and you're not going to see this was a section view just north of this area.
That's when we closed down that area and obviously, very soon after that, the failure occurred, and you said that the money that came that came to fix this project came out of an exhibit that a contract that was about seawall repair, that was that was just going through.
Unfortunately, again since I have this up, I don't have the list right in front of me, but it's throughout the city, Bronx Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, staten, island, okay, great and My concern is with the full repairs going interface to phase three of the esplanade.
We obviously spoke with our elected officials, including congresswoman carolyn maloney, who indicated that her conversations with hunt with commissioner silver and with the end with engineers at the site had indicated that they didn't know the structural integrity of the fdr in some of the areas along the along the that were right up against the esplanade.
If you can speak to it, all any sort of safety concerns any sort of weakening of the ground beneath the fdr When we were when this failed, we immediately also talked to city and state d.o.t, for this location inform them of our repair, plan.
Furthermore, I am not able to speak specifically to state or city d.o.t inspections, and things like that.
One is performing an inspection along this section going north to about the triboro bridge there and take a look at that to make sure that they feel comfortable or if they want to try to identify any possible undermining there.
This is obviously a very important piece of open space for my for our community, but it's personally, our park.
It's the park that we go to all the time in the open space that we visit to see the state that it's going to be in, for I'm guessing I have a million comments about how it looks and how it feels and how in safety have both perceived safety and actual safety of that area.
It is truly terrifying, and I know that you guys are working very fast, but the fact that you're going to be opening this area by the by christmas is fine, but that's also going to be past the time when everybody's, using it right.
We, see them there all the time and so to know that they're not going to have this open until christmas.
We are working within the budget that you know has been allocated to us and trying to use it as efficiently as possible in order to maintain the s bond.
I would typically say: If it's a you know, the parks department would open them, but in with the conservancy, I, really don't want to give you a misinform.
So I can look into it and get back to, but central park is a whole other area.
Because then we know we can't clean a certain area at a certain place at a certain time.
What I'm, stating is the tools when we do like it's my park day and several large scale projects when we're talking.
