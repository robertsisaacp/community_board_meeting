Many, thanks to the Parks Department for their fast action on this and work, has already restarted started on the repairs, but I think I'm.
Besides, the esplanade, this location and also we've been able to utilize our design consultants to perform underwater inspections during this time on the water side to identify some of the field conditions as related to the foundation there, and you can kind of see that a little bit on the left- hand, picture you'll, see that.
What we're going to be able to do is offset a sea wall That's this portion in green and then put up a new fence and then basically pave over this area.
This will not be the full 22 feet and then, additionally, in order to use the items that we have we're, anticipating leaving this as asphalt currently, instead of those hex box pavers and obviously there will be no fascia stone because we're going to offset on this wall We are in the final stages of design for East, Esplanade, contracts, phase, two and three, and that's performing work up at 114 to 117Th, I, believe, 92nd and 94th and 62nd to 63rd.
We do hope to minimize any impact there This is again looking south This is that asphalt, and actually what we're also going to plan to do is pave all the way to the barrier against the Fdr to really try to give pedestrians as much access as possible for that thoroughfare.
Waterside work that we're not able to do in this contract and making this stable Actually, we had a couple people asking if you would not mind making this a full screen of the pdf by going to view in full screen.
Once we excavated further and identified the existing field conditions, we kind of we realized that we were not going to able to do everything that, on that land side, which is what that retaining wall contract supplies for and that we need to do more work on the water side.
We have requirements, contracts for waterside repairs, because it does sound like you're going to have to go through a procurement for site, specific.
I understand that we can't put that in place now in a way that's going to impact this particular project, but for the long term, rather than have to bid everything You know is not this the kind of work where we should just have a requirements contract so that we can very quickly address it.
Rather than have to do Right now, you know we have been granted a certain amount of funding for the esplanade as a whole, and we felt that the best use of that was to try to make these larger site- specific contracts, because we do have those ongoing inspections in coordination with EDC, to try to identify these ahead of time.
Is that and the retaining wall repair would that be managed by parks or by Ddc or is EDC getting involved in for this location?
Currently parks is anticipated, anticipating managing the partial path reopening, as well as the full restoration at this site through our phase Two slash three contracts and do you have funding for the phase two phase, three contracts for the retaining wall so phase two slash: three:?
If that was utilized specifically for this sort of work, I would have to look into it a little bit more and have to get back to.
This is delaney who retaining wall Contract, First of all, how I wanted to walk south on the esplanade If I go over the 81St Street footbridge going south Can I can I only go for a couple of steps and then walk back again, so in other words, we really do not have access to the espionage from 81st street down to what's the lower about 68th street, or something like that.
I would obviously, as I'm sure many people would prefer to issue contracts in order to address any sort of item that has been identified.
We are trying to do those five years in inspections in order to identify these critical areas ahead of time.
I want to know that the parts of the esplanade that remain open are not going to be in danger of imminent collapse.
The bottom line is what I'm trying to get at, and how are we going to feel confident that we can address not only the 76th street situation now, but others that are that we can possibly anticipate and deal with it sooner rather than waiting for a full collapse to take place.
That is something that you know, we've noted and we're trying to quickly proceed with a contract in order to put that in place and be able to install more permanent fencing where we are not able to mobilize a contractor as quickly as we'd, like.
I am have been concerned for a number of years about the condition of the esplanade really above 96th street, particularly in the area leading up to the footbridge at 103Rd Street, and you know if you've walked over there.
You, see that it's kind of half fenced off so that most people are now pretty much walking on the grass there, and I wanted to find out what the timing is for that repair, because there's clearly a tremendous amount of weakness in that area.
If you could unmute in case she's, our project manager here, unfortunately over at 1023Rd. We are keeping an eye on and have asked our parks employees in the area to notify us if they notice any expansion of that, and so we can possibly include that into phase two three.
We are trying to utilize what we do have available to us to make safe the areas that we can and trying to put more substantial fencing in kind of like the one you see here, so that they do not blow over or not as easily removed, and so it's So I would hate to say that you know I do not want to prioritize anything.
Edc is trying to do some work at various locations, so you know.
We are basically utilizing our own fund, the parts funding that we've been allocated in order to address as much of it as possible, but, like I, said there are some special separate, I should say projects that are occurring throughout the esplanade, as well.
The East River Task force was formed by Councilwoman Maloney and at that time our state, our city, Council member And they've, been on a regular and they meet quarterly, with the department of parks to address the esplanade in Cba. I'd like to confine ourselves to this issue.
I, think that there's both a local problem and that there's a larger problem of understanding how impacted the under pilings are, and the structural integrity underneath the esplanade fixing this portion of the esplanade without understanding what's happening to the north and the south and in fact, on the Fdr drive, is going to be a waste of repair money which, as a taxpayer, I, incredibly resent, and also as a person who walks and who loves my neighbors.
Can you repeat that yes, certainly time and cost We are committing to opening this up prior to the end of 2020, we're expediting design, and things like that, and obviously there are concerns about any other field conditions that we may encounter.
This asphalt area, but we still have to coordinate that And honestly, I'm, not sure if I would feel comfortable performing work in this location until we do our final repair.
What are you filling in the esplanade with when you fill it back in so there is going to be kind of along This fence line is where we will have basically precast concrete blocks to creating our new seawall, and then we are basically backfilling beyond that, and this is kind of this cross section talks about a little bit about very it's, It's a very basic color coded item, but basically that green portion is that new wall, the from the precast blocks and then backfilling beyond that.
We not putting people at risk walking on the esplanade when it's not going to be an actual full repair?
One of the things that was noted in the poor identification on the 2018 report was that it was missing the Fascia stone, so it's quite possible that the facial stone was actually helping hold back some of that sea wall and then, additionally and you're not going to see this was a section view just north of this area.
Condition here was a little atypical than what we'd expect in the sense of It, looks kind of like a concrete plug that was not necessarily properly joined to the rest of the wall and that might have exacerbated the situation here, which is unfortunate, and I.
That's when we closed down that area and obviously, very soon after that, the failure occurred, and you said that the money that came that came to fix this project came out of an exhibit that a contract that was about seawall repair, that was that was just going through.
Unfortunately, again since I have this up, I do not have the list right in front of me, but it's throughout the city, Bronx Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, staten, island, okay, great and My concern is with the full repairs going interface to phase three of the esplanade.
In immediately after this happened, we obviously spoke with our elected officials, including Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who indicated that her conversations with hunt with commissioner silver and with the end with engineers at the site had indicated that they did not know the structural integrity of the Fdr in some of the areas along the along the that were right up against the esplanade.
If you can speak to it, all any sort of safety concerns any sort of weakening of the ground beneath the Fdr When we were when this failed, we immediately also talked to city and state D.O.T, for this location inform them of our repair plan.
So we have been in contact with them regarding it Furthermore, I am not able to speak specifically to state or city D.O.T inspections, and things like that.
One is performing an inspection along this section going north to about the Triboro bridge there and take a look at that to make sure that they feel comfortable or if they want to try to identify any possible undermining there.
But again, I can not speak for state or city D.O.T. This is obviously a very important piece of open space for my for our community, but it's personally, our park.
It's the park that we go to all the time in the open space that we visit to see the state that it's going to be in for I'm.
It is truly terrifying, and I know that you guys are working very fast, but the fact that you're going to be opening this area by the by Christmas is fine, but that's also going to be past the time when everybody's, using it right.
Then I personally think that we should be looking at the entire esplanade again to see if there are other weakened areas because of ferry use, we're seeing that increase.
We are working within the budget that you know has been allocated to us and trying to use it as efficiently as possible in order to maintain the S bond.
I understand that we are working on trying to overcome these issues and, as I say, we're kind of learning the problems as we go , it's just it's just working out the arrangements for Just following up on your comment a second ago About we typically do not have volunteers, do pro projects that require tools, given our fiscal constraints that I expect are going to last for a very long time.
