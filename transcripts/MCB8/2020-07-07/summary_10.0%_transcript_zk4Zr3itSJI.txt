Yeah, because I was thinking that, where a lot of these applications, where always be supportive of the community zone, that there's a strong objection, I, would make a motion seconded to take them all together, as approvals I, see a hand up, maybe and one for my board member and one from a guest too from board members.
So the community will come, learn more about the situations under which they are living, and this is why I believe the first thing : is: we have to walk location by application and learn each of them.
I'm, just wondering the Upper East Side has been notorious during the latter part of this crisis for having restaurants and bars that are serving liquor to people on the street There have been any complaints, please about serving drinks who are not seated at tables or where there are issues of people just milling around and congregating.
1A, the new applications, the liquor, wine, beer and cider for Ivy Lane I do not know if you were part of the transportation committee meeting, Wednesday night, but a lot.
Asking, whether what type of prevention mechanisms they are taking to prevent individuals drinking on the street right because that's what's happening, I understand in the 80s and 90s And 70s people are walking around with open containers of alcohol.
We have I've written the policy to make sure that we do not ask people to stick around if they've gotten something to go They do not congregate in groups that would exceed any of the regulations, and we were also very attentive to the governor's executive order regarding a hundred feet within your premises, you're responsible for the individual opening that container or violating a liquor, laws.
So, I, think I'm, comfortable and saying, as in- house counsel, that we've addressed the alcohol issue, given the current standards that were there, The community might have thank you.
With that I will are there any hands up or members of the public Judy Schneider they've been a good neighbor since they've moved in I recommend their food Highly would hope that the board members would support this application.
Know: people with open containers and taking the drinks away from the bars I reluctant to really press people too much on this I think you know there are some places that have been operating that have not even been allowing people to congregate or have not even really made spaces for people to congregate and I.
You know we're in this sort of weird situation: now, where we're a lot of the old rules, obviously have been sort of temporarily put aside And we're allowing people to basically purchase alcohol without actually setting foot inside of an establishment, which is a new thing.
You know inherent that if somebody's going to be getting a drink from a bar, that's got basically like a counter set up and their door to gainers, outside, and The establishments.
The issue of open containers outside I would like to see something, and they are in the approval that the applicant are needed to avoid this kind of trouble, because the whole mess that we cover here is the virus, and we have to have the eight feet: A situation interested and that I think, is the only issue that I'd like to raise important that the articles all of them, the reception, do not chopped the a part of the pedestrians which is eighty twice.
And I just wanted to share my comment with you: tonight, because it's relevant to every applicant and just for everything going forward, and it's just a personal experience that was relayed to me by my daughter that happened a week ago, this past Friday night, when she made an attempt to go down second Avenue and have something at one of the outdoor cafes.
Do not know if a new business, maybe you want to come up with some guidelines, to offer them some signage to offer.
Yes, I just wanted to say that the printed page that I have from the website telling all of the applicants for this evening, most of them, ratio of food to liquor or the numbers of tables and chairs, or anything like that.
If each applicant can tell us that would be helpful, thanks, Michelle, Abraham, you're, muted, right now, but I heard a lot of noise coming from your background, so I'm just going to go to the next board.
What I wanted to do is to amend Michelle's request in addition to that, I would like each applicant to state if there is outdoor space.
Thank you unless there's any other hands seconding the approval by Russell and let's take the whole hands up for a negative works and just raise your hand if you are voting against abstaining, because I do not see any hands up Abraham.
We will we're operating at a seventy percent to thirty percent food drink which already a lot of coffee and things like that and alcohol.
We took the motion to make sure that we got rid of it as soon as possible, anything under 13 days to get that you know, would have done it as quickly as we could and at which time we also had the proposal for what we wanted to do after which was open, seating, floor plan, which was approved by thankfully, by a community board and by the city as well.
So I did not see on the application what the hours were and what the food and drink you know.
