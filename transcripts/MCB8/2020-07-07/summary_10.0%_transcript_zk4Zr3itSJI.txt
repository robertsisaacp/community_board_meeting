Yeah, because I was thinking that, where a lot of these applications, where always be supportive of the community zone, that there's a strong objection, I would make a motion seconded to take them all together, as approvals I, see a hand up, maybe and one for my board member and one from a guest too from board members.
I'm just wondering the Upper East Side has been notorious during the latter part of this crisis for having restaurants and bars that are serving liquor to people on the street There have been any complaints, please about serving drinks who are not seated at tables or where there are issues of people just milling around and congregating It's, just a serious issue with respect to the health crisis and one that, unfortunately, its way around the Upper East Side, Yes I, don't know you do it because we I mean places like the green kitchen.
We have I've written the policy to make sure that we don't ask people to stick around if they've gotten something to go and they don't congregate in groups that would exceed any of the regulations, and we were also very attentive to the governor's executive order regarding a hundred feet within your premises, you're responsible for the individual opening that container or violating a liquor laws So we had hired security guards actually and not a lot.
So I think I'm comfortable and saying as in-house counsel that we've addressed the alcohol issue, given the current standards that were there The community might have thank you and to the application We had initially filed in July of last year for our liquor license and we appeared before the community board in the street life committee and got our approval and resolution from the community board to the SLA, and we recently got our permanent on-premises liquor license and curing the deficiencies for our permanent illicit liquor license and we weren't open on Mondays, so I think our last tables were at 11:30 and we closed by midnight.
That's now approved that you know that wouldn't be okay, but it just seems to me that if we're gonna allow, you know we're in this sort of weird situation now, where we're a lot of the old rules, obviously have been sort of temporarily put aside and we're allowing people to basically purchase alcohol without actually setting foot inside of an establishment, which is a new thing and we're allowing people to sit outside and eat and drink without the full You know inherent that, if somebody's going to be getting a drink from a bar, that's got basically like a counter set up and their door to gainers outside and I.
The issue of open containers outside I would like to see something and they are in the approval that the applicant are needed to avoid this kind of trouble, because the whole mess that we cover here is the virus, and we have to have the eight feet wide A situation interested and that I think, is the only issue that I'd like to raise important that the articles all of them the reception, do not chopped the a part of the pedestrians which is eighty twice This is the only concern that I cast and thank you and I will support this application Three.
There was signage actually offered in the Transportation Committee, but it would not have to just be posted in one place, but it would be have to have to be posted in many places, so people who can see them and just some way to help disperse this crowd So. Maybe a new business I think this could be a good thing that we're working on we'll may be behind the scenes and kind of come up with some documentation to be able to share out to the establishment.
it's only about my application, Is this a different application because we'll get to it on the agenda, so please lower your hand and I'm curious if there's any type of outdoor dining or sidewalk Now. Considering that phase three of restaurant reopening has been pushed back by the governor hi Brian, we currently don't have any outdoor seating So right now , we're not doing it may happen in the future It's kind of a business decision at this point.
It's been a pleasure to serve the community there for a number of years, and you know, hopefully they walk those back with open arms Thank you 84 percent food and 16 percent alcohol, As filed for 132 outdoor Given the current situation, we will not be opening with 132 outdoor seats, but adhering to their codes and regulations provided by local estate CDC guidelines for outdoor dining, so that would be amended depending on the regulations, but it was initially drawn and filed it for 132 patio seats.
