Yeah, because I was thinking that, where a lot of these applications, where always be supportive of the community zone, that there's a strong objection, I, would make a motion seconded to take them all together, as approvals I, see a hand up, maybe, and one for my board member and one from a guest too from board members.
So the community will come, learn more about the situations under which they are living, and this is why I believe the first thing : is: we have to walk location by application and learn each of them.
I'm, just wondering the Upper East Side has been notorious during the latter part of this crisis for having restaurants and bars that are serving liquor to people on the street There have been any complaints, please about serving drinks who are not seated at tables or where there are issues of people just milling around and congregating.
So you're asking whether what type of prevention mechanisms they are taking to prevent individuals drinking on the street right, And 70s people are walking around with open containers of alcohol.
We have I've written the policy to make sure that we don't ask people to stick around if they've gotten something to go They don't congregate in groups that would exceed any of the regulations, and we were also very attentive to the governor's executive order regarding a hundred feet within your premises, you're responsible for the individual opening that container or violating a liquor, laws.
As many of you brought up So, it has been a give-and-take working with the community on that So I, think I'm, comfortable and saying as in-house counsel, that we've addressed the alcohol issue, given the current standards that were there The community might have thank you And to the application.
With that I will are there any hands up or members of the public Judy Schneider they've been a good neighbor since they've moved in I recommend their food Highly would hope that the board members would support this application.
Know: people with open containers and taking the drinks away from the bars I reluctant to really press people too much on this I think you know there are some places that have been operating, that haven't even been allowing people to congregate or haven't even really made spaces for people to congregate and I.
Now, where we're a lot of the old rules, obviously have been sort of temporarily put aside and we're allowing people to basically purchase alcohol without actually setting foot inside of an establishment, which is a new thing.
It's sort of built into this whole situation that we have Or I , guess it wouldn't be estimated in this case, but what your food percentages and your drink percentages in terms of your you know your sales Yeah, the rough percentages I have on-hand a debt, rejected accounting to be specific at this point, but is a 75 to 25 percent, seventy five being through twenty five percent.
The issue of open containers outside I would like to see something, and they are in the approval that the applicant are needed to avoid this kind of trouble, because the whole mess that we cover here is the virus, and we have to have the eight feet: A situation interested and that I think, is the only issue that I'd like to raise important that the articles all of them, the reception, do not chopped the a part of the pedestrians which is eighty twice.
And I just wanted to share my comment with you tonight, because it's relevant to every applicant and just for everything going forward, and it's just a personal experience that was relayed to me by my daughter that happened a week ago, this past Friday night, when she made an attempt to go down second Avenue and have something at one of the outdoor cafes.
If you want to have a further rather than hold up each applicant tonight with this discussion, although I think they should be a part of it, because they're going to be the enforces, as well as the sellers, I think, maybe a new business.
If each applicant can tell us that would be helpful, thanks, Michelle, Abraham, you're, muted, right now, but I heard a lot of noise coming from your background, so I'm just gonna, go to the next board.
What I wanted to do is to amend Michelle's request in addition to that, I would like each applicant to state if there is outdoor space.
Thank you unless there's any other hands seconding the approval by Russell and let's take the whole hands up for a negative works and just raise your hand if you are voting against abstaining because I don't see any hands up Abraham.
We will we're operating at a seventy percent to thirty percent food drink which already a lot of coffee and things like that and alcohol.
We took the motion to make sure that we got rid of it as soon as possible, anything under 13 days to get that you know, would have done it as quickly as we could and at which time we also had the proposal for what we wanted to do after which was open, seating, floor plan, which was approved by thankfully, by a community board and by the city as well.
Think this crisis I live doing something else, So I didn't see on the application what the hours were and what the food and drink you know.
