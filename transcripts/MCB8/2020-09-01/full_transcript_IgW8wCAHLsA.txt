Hmm, so, okay, the time being, 6 30, we'll start in a minute, also, and just a brief explanation for anybody who this is their first time at one of our virtual meetings. Everyone is muted other than the chair and he will recognize folks to be called on. You will not be able to unmute yourself the way you can get the chair's attention whenever that time comes up. Please use the participants menu and the raised hand feature. So you can find the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. It looks like two little people standing next to each other with the number 15 next to it right now, 16 and that number will keep going up. You open that it pops open a box that will appear on your screen and you'll, find the raised hand feature in that box. So once you use that you will see you on our participants list and cause will recognize you. If anybody has any questions, you can always chat me during the meeting, and I will be able to help. I see jordan has raised his hand. We haven't started the meeting yet jordan, but whenever cars is ready, we'll recognize yeah, who's, pt and who's zoom user, don't I don't know who those are they will they can? They can rename themselves or they'll identify themselves if we need to talk to them, okay, the time being 6 30 on tuesday, the 1st of september, I think we can get started abraham. The chair is not here, I am in his dead. So let's get the ball rolling. The committee recommends to the full board which meets the third wednesday of the month. Should we go to the 30-day waiver? Is roma celebrated here, but do you wanna? Jordan has a question before we get started. You wanna sorry he's waving too. Yes, jordan, cars hi! It's! It is jordan. Looking down the list of requirements, one of them says item number two: the applicant will not use electric bytes or contract with third-party delivery providers who provide electric bikes. The last half of that is absolutely nonsense. Yeah, the electric bike has been an issue for some time and we've talked to third-party people at this stage. They sign a contract and they really have no say in what the contract is. I think the board is getting more information on third party bike and we're trying to get this thing straightened out, but the to a certain extent the establishment can govern. Who does pick up. So that's what we're encouraging them to do, but third-party electric bike, it's very difficult. I think that's an understatement. It's just not happening, I'm unaware of any third party who picks up without an electric bike. I could be wrong, so I would assume that everybody who's going for renewal who's already been in business who has used. The third party is in violation of that and they will be after the meeting when the whoever it is approves it. So this is an unreasonable requirement and how can a person? How can an applicant agree to well the applicant agrees that they will not use electric bikes? I understand that, but that's not what it says. No, I know it's a bit ambiguous, but there's no excuse, there's no, there's no ambiguity cause, it says or contract with third parties. That's not ambiguous, or maybe it is. What are the two interpretations? Okay. Can we discuss? Can we put that on the agenda for another meeting, specifically that I mean we could be here all night debating this one item, so you know we'd like to move on. I absolutely agree with you. This point has been raised for years in the plural, but if it's going to be taken up at a meeting great, I won't take any more of your time. Thank you so much for engaging with me on this. Okay, thanks, jordan. I know it's a very serious issue and a lot of people are not happy. Okay, so can we go to the 30-day waiver one which should be roma? Saladna corp is the applicant here. I believe I see vera okay, so any changes to the establishment or you just forgot- the you forgot to apply to notify us no changes at all, so you just forgot to notify cb. Yes, I apologize for that yeah. I know it happens. I know any board. Members have any questions jordan. He raised a very good issue we have to discuss, but I don't think this is the time to discuss these issues because we are not discussing yeah. No, I know that so the issue is, I just want to talk about jordan because he raises a very valid issues and I agree with him. The only situation is we have in this period of time that we have to be more careful to raise issues that will be complicated for the applicants or we still have a chance in the future to approve or disapprove this application in this kind of service. But in this case I would like to propose a motion to approve okay. Thank you. Do we have a second? Mrs brown has a question. So do you want to yeah? Yes, I'm having difficulty in hearing everyone. It's garbled. I sent a message to will, but I didn't get a response. I said I'm not certain the answer. I don't know somebody else can recommend for her. Is there a closed caption button at the bottom of anyone's screen as the host? I can't see that no, I the there's one on on youtube, but I do I don't know where it is on zoom yeah. I don't know either okay, so we have a motion seconded all in favor. We will take everybody as a yes, unless somebody says no anybody say no judy. I have a question. Can you hear me yeah? What are you voting on 30-day waiver 2a? What they did? They forgot to notify the community board within 30.. Not all of us have agendas appointed at. I think we should have the name and address for each thing before you start discussing it. Oh, I said: rhymer saladna, corp, dba, pqr, pizza, quadroni, 1631, second, avenues store between 84th and 85th. Thank you. It's a 30. It's a renewal. The only reason that they're coming they forgot to notify the community board within the specified time. Okay, are we but anybody vote? No, I don't see any hands so that goes down as a unanimous. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to the regular 1a de fardema group, llc, dba de fara 1304, second avenue. It's really quickly before you before. We call on them. Do you want to just audibly go through the board members that we have in attendance so that in the record we have everybody who voted on that? Okay, we have me, we have a leader, barry, schneider, brian carrero, laurie, boris marco, mrs brown, paul higgins, russell, and that's it. That's awesome. Everybody votes. Yes, okay, let's go to 1a de fara group, lb, llc, dba de fara is the applicant here. Yes, so what is this establishment? It's a pizzeria, slash restaurant. We just you know changing the name and that's it it's a little bit here. So all you're doing is changing the name. Yeah changing your name and I have other party coming in okay. We were over 10 years. We never had any problem, nothing, it was under golozy. Then we changed them to donna margarita. But I didn't do very well right. We try, you know we try it. You know to stay over there. We, like the neighborhood or whatever it's a small. You know not even 40 seats inside like we cannot use anyway. Yeah, that's right and the third ratio is 80. Food, 20 drinks yeah. It's most pizza food yeah, so we have only one beer. So, okay, anybody have any questions from the public any board. Member. Let's go mrs brown first okay, mrs brown you'll have to unmute. Was that a move to approve mrs brown? Yes, okay. Second, marco will second. Unless he has a question, do you have a question? Marco? A second? Okay, all in favor. Anybody vote no raise your hand, otherwise it'll go down as unanimous. It's a straight okay. So that's that one let's go to 1b. Well, this is the committee that we recommend to the full board, but there shouldn't be any problems. I really appreciate it. Thank you and I hope to see you soon over there. All of you are you serving outside we serving outside, because we have a sidewalk permit, and now we put a little gazebo in the parking lot. We had a something with the department of trust. Yes, okay, so that's how little paper we have two little tables. That's all good! Thank you! Okay, the next one is 1b botanicas, Lexington, inc, dba, laboratory, botanista, 833 lex, new application, liquor wine- beer is the applicant here. Yes, oh who's. This is robert callahan from michael kelly's office. Okay, any can you tell us a bit about it. Yeah we also have christoph is also with me. I see him on the list. You'll have to unmute yourself. Okay, you want to tell us a bit about yourself and thought. What's going on, basically we're at eight through 33 Lexington, between 63rd and 64th, which used to be the le paint quote to the end where an organic plant-based restaurant will have 11 tables with 40 seats, one bar approximately 15 feet long with nine seats. The hours will be 11 a.m, to 9 00 pm every day. So we're not a late night place we'll have light background music with no open windows. The owners have other locations under the same name. You could see on your questionnaire. We have one down on grand street and one on 43rd street third avenue. They seem to be very successful. If you have any questions about the business, I'm sure christophe can answer them. Okay, anybody have any questions. Who do we have? Mrs brown? Thank you. I noticed that there was a violation that is still active on november 8 2019.. What was that violation, and why is it still active? That's the building, the building owner. We have to get him to clear up. I think it's just a proof of correction that should be cleared up shortly, the only one that seems to be clear. Would you be kind enough and repeat what mr callahan had stated: yeah it's a building violation, but theoretically, if you're a new establishment going there shouldn't this have been cleared by the building or le panca tdn. It's not necessarily that space. It could be anywhere in the building anyway. But that's I mean we'll I'll, we'll talk to the landlords and we'll figure out what's going on with it I'll have to bring it up and examine it more closely. Okay, so that violation will be cleared up, yeah I'll, try and bring it up now and see what it's all about, but okay, judy any outdoor tables. Yes, how many we just have five tables outside. Thank you. I just saw for the moment yeah, that's just for the open restaurants program. Yeah! Yes, oh okay, but yeah, there's no sidewalk cafe or outdoors backyard, seating, no yeah, but the open thing that really doesn't affect us at this stage right anybody else, any questions, no one else. Okay, do we have a motion brown, a motion to approve with the stipulation that they will get back to the board prior to the next meeting, with the violation that it has occurred? Yeah. I think that will agree to that. Okay and also too cause. If you could ask the applicants when they address the board to let us know what the hours are, if they're in the out backyard space and the food drink ratio, it'll be a lot simpler. Thank you. Yeah food to ratio is 90 10 90 food, 10 drinks. Yes, thank you. Do you have a backyard? No backyard? Okay, any other questions, marco. Yes, I think if they ask the speculation for the violation and if we don't know how we're going to put in a stipulation to be in compliance because the problem is our legion could be something serious and a violation could be something very simple and- and I agree with with this- with the stipulation that it should be put it to correct that part. But the problem is: how do you enforce because the violation it could be for somebody else it could be in residential? I don't know if it's a residential part, it could be it the same, the same le pain cotigan once they remove the pink again. Theoretically, the violation is gone, but in the record of the of the of the building department is still active, so it has to be filed, but that is going to be a very tricky argument. But, yes, I would like to support that motion. Yes, okay, if I may just for a second. Yes, I'm on the department of buildings website, so the violation was actually issued to the building itself for failure to file an annual report on their boiler back in 2017.. So they've done it 2018 2019, but apparently either it didn't get into their computers or they just didn't go so we'll speak to the landlord. We'll have him file that with the buildings department, it's not a serious violation. We actually miss brown. The paper that you were looking at that showed the violation. If it was a dangerous violation, there would be a big red area that would say that it was a critical violation and that you know stop the work order and everything would be on the building. So it's just a minor paperwork, one that we'll take care of. Well, I had to disagree with that part. I'm sorry, but a boiler is a serious violation. That's completely wrong, so I know that there's just only a registration of the of the that has an inspection, but the inspection is crucial because the boiler can operate the problem. No, let me finish, however, no, however, let me finish the po. My point is in this case the commercial space do not use the boiler and use the residential, so it doesn't is directly impacted the commercial space. So it's a very tricky way. This is what I said: it's very tricky to ask you some stipulation for something that very hard to appreciate that the stipulation be there, because the issue is next. At least you can put pressure to the learner to be to do the right thing for the residents. I think, makes a lot of sense in that direction, even though that the commercial space pro is more likely do not. The boiler doesn't serve that part, because it is an independent boiler on an independent heating and air condition system right. So I think it's valid and that's basically, I'm afraid that to enforce, but please I appreciate that you reached the landlord and said the community border is asking for that. Please try to fix, and then we have the rest of the building, even though that we shouldn't do that. That's not our role, but I think it's a smart idea to help the residents. Thank you. I think what I would like to put in the resolution in the stipulation is that, even though it is it is not the establishment violation, it is a building violation because we should not hold anything against the establishment when it's the building problem right, but the issue is you put it at least the tenant. In this case the cash base put pressure on the arnold to do the right thing, and I think it's fair the business person they can help us to help the community. I think it doesn't. It doesn't hurt okay, russell yeah. I was just gonna. Second, if it hadn't been seconded already, I wasn't sure. Okay, any okay. I assume it's a unanimous. Unless somebody says no anybody say no, I don't see any no's okay, so that goes down as unanimous. Okay. Thank you, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you kristen who do we have now guadalupe lucero, dbo, taco and tequila 1742 second avenue new application for liquor. Wine and beer is the applicant here. Yes, I'm here, oh you're, the zoom user, yes hi! Okay, you want to tell us a bit about yourself and what you're doing yes, we pretend to serve mexican food. The establishment name is tacos and tequila, so we pretend to company our food with some cocktails. Some drinks some mexican drinks, especially- and we are- this- is gonna, be a new place. It used to be a wine bar, and now we pretend to serve our mexican food in their establishment. Do you have a backyard? No, how many seeds do you have inside inside? So we have 40 seats? Okay, but at the moment do you have your DOT application that you can use the sidewalk and the street or not yet not yet, when will you be opening, then we haven't opened the restaurant. So that's why we haven't applied for the outside tables yeah, because we haven't opened up: okay, yeah, okay, anybody have any questions. Anybody have any resolutions, any approvals, disapproval smart code. I have motion to approve. Okay, russell. Did you second, that yeah? Okay? I assume it's unanimous. Unless somebody says no anybody say no! Oh okay, I don't see any no's. So that goes down is unanimous. That's it isn't it abc. That is all of item one and item two old business. New business is all you have left and we had a few layovers. So if somebody is here for one of the layovers, we will be sending out more information on if and when they come before us, okay, the time being, 6 54 and I'm getting hungry. The meeting is no yeah not yet cause. Don't go yes. Okay, yes, ma'am! Look because I think we are doing something wrong right here. First of all, first of all you ask the questions when in reality, we have to have a questionnaire for all applicants. All applicants should answer the same questions such as. Do you use the area? Are you going to use the or do you have the area? How many people do how many chairs you're going to have? How many all this information which allow us to ask to make an assessment? What is the ratio of the food and liquor so this is? It should be a mandatory answer from the applicant, so we can hear from the applicant all these kind of questions. So then we have a good judgment of the of the restaurant and then we can approve or disapprove this application. All the we can raise questions and we can discuss a little bit deeper. I think, in the way that I prepare a good document to be sent to everybody to all applicants, so this questionnaire we have to have each of us in advance. So when the applicant is coming and they either forgot or whatever it is, we have at least the answer from the from in that questionnaire, and then we can ask proper questions because I found that sometimes you ask one question to one person, one applicant and another question for the other one. I know that you don't do intentionally, but the issue is we need to have a more complete information of these applicants. Then we can everybody, they can raise the issue whatever it is, and this is why we can have the applicants to answer our concerns, maybe clarify- or maybe we can raise a serious issues about this application. So I think that we have to. We have to establish this form, this phone. That is already I already created almost many years ago, because I don't know why is reluctant to start applying that, because it's fair for everybody and then we have something intangible from the applicant. What are they saying and then we have to have a record in the record we can say. Oh, that is what the applicant is claiming, and if this is not true, then we can fight people around the future. It means we have to figure out this kind of stuff and this- and I don't think that is your role as a chair or you know, as an acting chair, you should start giving the information from the rarity who should be doing. This is the applicant but the applicant. I know this tense moment is hard to express all the ideas, and this is what we need a questionnaire and everybody can have in advance. Nobody want to raise this issue, marco everybody does get the questionnaire. It's the community board aid liquor license questionnaire. We have a DCA questionnaire that the board sends out to all the applicants and the applicants fill it in now. The problem may be that all the members do not get a copy of it, which is something that we can look at, but everybody does and it's got all the questions, the address the ratios, the hours, the tables for membership. It's got all the questions and I think it's the same one that you and the others worked on. Sorry cause, but it's not because I was remembering one of the meetings with the commissioner for the legal license authority. He was saying that he was organized a new form because they consider us incomplete, and that is why it triggered to me to prepare that form, because I try to make as much follow as possible. This is the only direction I understand what you're saying- and this is one point the other point is we don't have the information on time. It's hard, you know for will to start sending all the information, but if we have just only one page for restaurant and to send it to us, so they can have in advance many information that we need to have it on time. Okay, you saw today, marco, that we still even with just four applications we still got stuff sent to us at you know: 4 30, 5 o'clock p.m. So it's just you're dealing with a I mean, I'm not going to overspeak but like you're, dealing with a group of constituency in this case who have other priorities than getting paperwork filled out and submitted in a timely manner, and we just try to be accommodating of them as they submit them and get them to you guys when we, when we have them. Remember one more thing that that's basically, this is the open open or what it called public open discussion. It has to be some limited. They has to have some time to represent in the community where it has to be posted. It has to be all this time in advance. It cannot be do it within 48 hours. It has to be at least a week, so the community has to be aware. What's going on so the community also has to be invited in this process and, as we have to make a very good assessment of the applicants and then therefore the community can listen. Whereas where is our opinion and then we can keep rising many issues, so maybe we can approve right away. Remember for the applicants they are right here is our intention is: we are not the enemies of the applicants. We support business. We need business, we are. We claim that we really need their business. The only thing is we're looking for a good management business. We are not looking for poor management business. That is the only difference that we are here. On the contrary, we would like to hear from them. What are they needs? What we can do better in order they can be successful, especially in this, in this tough time for them. So that is this is my goal. That's what my intentions, when I ask something very specific. Thank you. Okay, yeah well, we'll see we'll speak to will and abraham about getting the forms out. I think we can get just that one page out as soon as we can so everybody will have the basis rather than the full application. I don't think everybody needs the full application a week ahead of time, but if we get that one form a few days ahead, that will help everybody. I think, okay, who else judy had a question. Yes, why is there a layover on an item? That's between 100 and 101st street when that's not our district, because they sent in the wrong, they sent it to the wrong community board and it is not ours and it's a layover. We will not hear it in the future either. So I will I'm assuming that you directed them to the board above us. Yes, I yeah we're gonna reach out to them and make sure that they know that they need to talk to cb11. Thank you good night, all good night. Anybody else have any new old business new business. Any questions no okay meeting is adjourned. 701 pm. Thank you one and all thanks will welcome. You guys have a lovely night. You too, you.
