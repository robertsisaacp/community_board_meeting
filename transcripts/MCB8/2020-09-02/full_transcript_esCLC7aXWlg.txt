C, do so we're still waiting on a few of our board members and we'll get started, but I just want to let everyone know if it's your first time at one of our virtual public meetings, we mute everybody from the beginning, you're unable to unmute yourself. So the way you'll participate in the meeting is when the time comes, for you to participate in speaking or whatever you'll need to use the raise hand feature in the participants menu. So you can find the participants menu at the bottom of your screen right now it has the word participants. It has a icon of two people standing next to each other, then a number next to it right now. That number is 15.. So if you open up that participant's menu you'll see a new box that appears and in the bottom corner of that box, you'll see the button that says raise hand, and so, when you click on that raise hand button, you come up to the top of our list of participants. Our co- chairs, Chuck, Warren and craig later they'll be able to see you and they'll recognize you and call on you to be unmuted I'll unmute you, you may need to click a button on the bottom of your screen to confirm on muting, so just be looking out for that too, as it comes up. So if anyone has any questions about how the meeting is run and how to use zoom, you can always chat me through the Chat box. Do you not want those when you're throwing those away those two that I just put on them? Well, maybe it's coming from! He was coming from quake. It was, I think it may have been his son ready to go. It's 6:30 and I do not see more people signing in right now. So I'm going to stop sharing my screen. Let you guys: okay, welcome everyone, meeting of the transportation Committee of Community Board, eight, my co- chair, Chuck Warren and my other co- chairs craig later all right good evening, everyone and why do not we get to the agenda? The first item on the agenda is something that we back for reconsideration. A revocable consent application for proposed fenced in area, including steps planters, together with the snow melt system in front of 106 East 78th street. Is this a revised application? Is there someone here from the applicant anik? Is that you yes anik Pearson? I will be presenting this project. Okay, application, if you're ready should I share this green will? Is that yes, you're great to go? Okay go ahead? Okay, can everyone see this screen, and can everyone hear me? Is this all clear? Yes, all clear, so this application is to modify an existing area way, which is at 106 east 78th street between Lexington and Park Avenue on the south side of the street. This is a property just east of 875 park, Avenue and next to it are two identical townhouses built by the same family in the late 1860s, and so each of these townhouses has an area away in front of them and, as do other properties, down the block on the south side of the street. If you look at the pictures on the bottom, it is showing our proposed our existing townhouse. I'm sorry looking north looking south from the curb in front of the existing fence that extends past the property line. There is a tree pit and the distance between the tree pit and the existing fence is eight feet: we're not proposing to expand the area away at all. Contrary to our last application, it was to expand the area way for this proposal, we're just proposing to rebuild the area way on its current footprint, which is eight feet clearance from the tree pit on the sidewalk. This block has extended area ways that go past the property line on both sides of the street, our clearance being eight feet. There are other clearances down the street that are much less, the smallest one at 4 foot 10 only so the existing sidewalk is quite large compared to the pinch points further east on the other side of the street is the same condition where the smallest pinch point is at five foot. Six and again, our existing and proposed fence extension will remain at eight feet: clearance from the sidewalk from the tree pit. I'm sorry so here on the left of this page, we see the existing fence and our existing townhouse facade. Next to it is the proposed fence and proposed townhouse facade. The fence is straight as opposed to varying in depth, as it is now in existing condition. We are planning to straighten this fence, acrosss the foot clearance to the tree pit and to dig down so that one can get to the ground floor level of the townhouse, which is three feet below the sidewalk, so it would create a clear landing acrosss, the two front doors of the townhouse, which are sunken below the sidewalk by three feet: there's an existing planter, which is not built into the sidewalk on inside of the fenced in area we're proposing to expand this planter so that it goes almost acrosss the whole face of that fence and also to have a an in- ground planter for a climbing plant to climb up the face of the townhouse. So we're proposing to expand the green space of this area away, as well as modifying the fence, aesthetic itself and finally, as was previously approved by the Community board. At our last hearing is a proposal to heat the sidewalk with the snow melt system below the sidewalk level, so that the snow melt system would extend for the full width of the townhouse from the sidewalk at the curb back to the townhouse facade, so that the snowmelt system would be maintained and in use and help to clear the snow and ice from the sidewalk in the winter. Did I omit or forget anything that you would like me to cover I'm happy to scroll back to the first page, we'll get the questions and maybe that'll people. May you can answer them, then? Okay, so normally our procedure is to go to the public. Are there any members of the public? Who would like to ask a question or speak on this application? You should use the icon. That raises your hand, so will Wright bill can whose coordinating this can see that just a reminder for anybody on the phone it's star 9, to raise your hand and for everyone else, you can find that icon in the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. I do not see any members of the public, okay, no members, then let's go to the board members of the board that want to comment or ask questions. Michelle and Alita Okay Michelle go ahead. Thank you. A couple of questions with the snow. Let me go to the snowmelt, the snowmelt. Is it inside the area way and the sidewalk up until the curb? Yes, oh, so it's both is that what you had presented last time? Yes, okay! So we have it. We answered all our questions about access, repairs and everything. My recollection is that they are done from inside. You have access to the vault under the area way. Is that correct and there's a drain? Yes, you're, remembering exactly right, we're not changing any of that? Yes, okay, that's the same all right! So what you are changing, though you're not expanding, but you are changing this fence, so you what you're proposing? Let me understand because I'm I my computer, is out being repaired. So I'm on my phone, so it's small, so this fence is now going to go all the way. Acrosss one hole one doorway, so that access will be only down the steps in front of one doorway and then the access to the other doorway is only from the airy way and no longer from the sidewalk. Is that correct? That is correct? Yes, okay, so I'm seeing it correctly, I have to say I'm not I'm not hysterical over that, but aesthetically. I think it really ruins the balance of it. All. I'm looking at the sketch that you have and the length of that newly proposed fence is how long how big it is. I'm sorry, let me try to find add these two numbers together. It's about it's about 15 feet, no, somehow yeah about 13 feet and 36 inches high and the one that you're replacing, which is the fence. That's between the two doorways. How big is that, because this looks like it's almost two and a half times that size is that about right? It's less than twice it's! The fence section in the middle is seven foot three and then the two ends are 11 and 10 inches each. So all of that adds up to about nine feet of fat, but the center part, which is the bulk, is how many feet is only seven foot three yeah and the other is 13, so it is almost twice the amount I have to say it looks very heavy and it looks it looks a bit lopsided now. I do not think that this is under cons consideration tonight, but I just want to be sure the window and the facade that you have in the in the existing versus the windows and the facade that you have in the proposed are different. Are you, but is that that's not in consideration tonight? Correct landmarks has approved our facade design and they requested that we have nine over nine gridded windows to restore it back to the original history. Okay, that's good! That was at the staff level. No, it was a full hearing. Oh okay, all right! That's good! I'm very pleased that you're not extending the area away. So I thank you for that correction. I'm! I really am pleased that you came back to us. The snowmelt is fine with me. I'm really not too happy with the with the new bulk of the fence, but let's hear what others have to say. Thank you. Thank you. Okay was the leader leader was next. I think. Thank you. Yes, I am thank. You will head to and meet me thanks chuck, I'm just wondering why you're not why the applicant is not coming back to landmarks over the fence and the planters that are in the area way, particularly because the fence is extending. I know that it has been and you're not further extending the area way into the public space, but it already extends beyond the area way. So why are you not going back to landmarks? We are. We received approval for our last design. We have a certificate of appropriateness from landmarks, but we have gone back to them for a post- approval amendment to shorten the area away so that it does not extend the existing. I'm sorry, I was not clear. I meant to come back before the CB8 Landmarks committee, about the fence and the planters, and I know this is not transportation issue chuck. But as long as the applicant is here and raising these issues, oh because the defense designed it did not change and they had already approved the fence at the CB8 hearing, they did not approve this fence. Did they approve offen? I mean I was at that I was at that meeting. Did they did we approve? Offense that extent we were focused on some other issues. Did we approve a fence that extended almost twice the length and change design and with different planters in that area? Well, the application was approved at that hearing so and that the design that I presented last time. Yes- and it was this fence- yes, okay, but not over the second door. Yes, it was over the second door. Okay, then my mistake, thank you sure any other. Are there any other members that want to talk on this? There are you have Jordan Marco, Michelle again and Rita? Okay? Why do not we take Jordan hi? Thank you very much, Ms Pearson. Thank you so much for pulling back and leaving us the full sidewalk and not intruding into it anymore. I really appreciate you heard us on it. I have a couple of questions about the snowmelt system. What is the energy source? Is this for the snowmelt system? There's a boiler inside the townhouse that heats up. You know the system for heating up the townhouse inside the mechanical room, so this will tap into the whole house boiler system, but the liquid running through the tubes is not water, so it will not freeze. Okay, thank you. Do you know what causes the system to activate? Can you tell us what causes the system to activate there's a temperature sensor and a snowfall sensor, and also a manual on and off override? And do you happen to know what the temperature sensor is set to? I assume it's something above 33 degrees. Yes, I think the temperature sensing changes depending on the on the depth of the snowfall. I think that is what affects the temperature. It's not always the same temperature. I would assume that it turns on before there's snow. Am I correct? Yes, the sidewalk has to heat up when snow is anticipated. They that's why you usually trigger the snow, melts to start warming up the sidewalk ahead of time. Yes, is that manual? Is that automatic? I believe that is manual, but I'm not a hundred percent sure. I would have to ask our engineer. Okay, I'm not a fan of snowmelt systems. I understand what you do what's being done here and I think I understand why if the applicant is not available, what is the backup for making sure the boiler is on and that the temperature sensor is set and that kind of thing there's a full- time caretaker for the townhouse who takes care of all of this anyway? So even if the snowmelt system, you know, did not turn on often enough, the responsibility falls on the homeowner to clear the sidewalk one way or the other, so the caretaker is on hand for any of these also to pick up trash- and you know, as you know, the neighborhood's very strict about picking up litter on the sidewalk and not leaving anything in the way. Thank you very much excellent answers. Thanks Jordan next, marco. What I think was next, if I could just before marco- goes just remind everyone that we did pass in June the snow melt component of this. So we are not voting on that part of it tonight and that was voted on overwhelmingly by the committee and the board in in favor of it. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, mark, okay, I will appreciate the clarification. I think it is fair when, once we have a position, we can not or go again and to discuss that motion regardless. I was opposing that application. There is no mail, but the issue is once the policy. The community will take a position we can not discuss. That has to be very clear. Let me ask a question on the on the drawings that you have on the left side on the top you have the compose and the and the existing you see in the on the back. At the background, you see a failed, the back, the back yes, that area, why you do that just so. This is a matter of curiosity. Are you asking why the drawing is pale in the back? Oh because it's in the distance it differentiates what's in front. What's in front, is the fence and it's it is sorry it is. It is six foot four. No do not worry about that. The distance! Okay, I'm not concerned with that. I'm concerned it's in the way that you represent. I think you did the right thing, I'm nothing wrong, because you are no marco, you cut out there. Something happened there. Oh I'm sorry, I'm asking these questions because you did the right thing because right here for this committee is knowing discussion, the real part of the facade. So therefore you did not specify, and that is the way that should be done and I think I'm okay with the with this application. Now I think you at least you maintain the eight feet because you have right there down of the street. You have the school and I think it makes a lot of sense, and since you also said that defense, we discussed in a Landmark committee, so I do not have no problem with this application. Thank you. Thank you. Why do not we go next to Rita? Then we can come back. I know Michelle had her hand raised, but Rita has not spoken yet Rita. Why do not you go ahead? I think you did a great job. You did everything that we asked you to do and you come back I'd like to make a motion that we accept the the new improved plans as presented. Is there a second did? Someone can you see well, yeah Elizabeth Rose gave it a thumbs up. So thanks we can have fur. Why do not we go to Michelle? If there's any? If you want to say anything further Michelle, you also have Alita and Rebecca Dengor who have their hands up, sure we'll then get we'll go to Rebecca then and then okay, I did not realize it rebecca okay. Why do not? Well, let me let's go to Rebecca first, she has not spoken yet then we'll get to. I just wanted to tell everyone I sent. Will the previous application that was sent to landmarks and the resolution and it's in the chat now? Okay, thanks rebecca, why do not we go to Michelle? Then you had a further comment. Let me can you? Can you hear me something happened with my yeah okay, I lost my visual but all right, I'll work on that, but you can hear me okay. No, I wanted to say that, along with Elita, I did not recall the extension of this fence now what's possible. Is that since we turned down the application about the extension, I think we probably did it in two parts, so we voted affirmatively for the snowmelt and since we voted down the application for the extension, I assume that the fence was in that you know in that part of the resolution, and maybe that's why neither she nor I are remembering specifically discussing this fence, because I do not, I think it's too big to and it's too bulky- and I do not know if others feel the same way aesthetically to me- it's not as attractive as having the doorways on either side and you know and having the smaller fence in the middle. So this is the only thing we're voting on tonight. So when you in the in the resolution, it's a matter of approving the fence and the planters, because there's nothing else up for consideration- is that correct, right, yeah and if I may just make one comment about that. If you remove four feet of planter, you would have less greenery along the front of the townhouse. That is the impact. The negative impact to having two parts of the fence removed is that the green area is reduced from 12 feet to less than eight feet. I understand that, but that's on the interior right, that's inside that's in the area way and that's what would be visual visible from the townhouse, but it won't really affect the visibility from the street. The planter is as high as the sidewalk and then the plants will be exactly behind the fence itself, so the greenery will be visible from the street, but this fence design is a little denser than your original. You know, I think you can see through it less now. I'm recalling, because I've lost my visual on my screen for some reason, but at any rate that's what I'm thinking that it's a denser fence the partitions are closer together. I do not know that you would see that much more greenery from the street and at any event, I think it's a very 13 plus feet of fencing. I think, is very bulky. There so that that's my only comment. That's all we're that's under consideration tonight. Thank you, okay, Elita does anyone else will besides Jordan Sorry Jordan and Rita Popper? Okay. Thank you chuck. I wanted first to say that I was a little gnarly earlier and I really do appreciate your cutting back on your proposed extension and sticking with the space that you already have. It's always noted and appreciated when an applicant does what the community board requests, but so I did want to apologize for my gnarliness and say that I appreciate it, but I'm looking at the resolution and all it says about the fence is a whereas clause, which is, whereas the fence at the front of the house is made of black painted painted iron. It does not address any change in design. It does not address any change in length and I do not know if it was Jane or David who wrote the resolution, but they are very attentive to detail and had there been a changes of the type that you've noted tonight. I suspect I could be wrong, but I suspect, and Michelle and Marco could agree or disagree that it would be included in the Whereas clause. Yet that's all that it says about the fence. Well, what did you say about defense, Ms Pearson? Can you clarify that for us again, the Fen design is exactly as presented at the last communable Community Board hearings, both of them both for the transportation committee last one and the one about the front facade the Landmarks committee too. Yes, we have not changed the fence design at all, since we proposed this new fence. This is the same okay, so it was before the Landmarks committee, our committee. Yes, when it came okay, this was in April of this year and the resolution. The discussion of the fence that I think Alita was alluding to was part of the it was a two- part votes. It was part a that was the building where the fence design was discussed. Where was referred to as being made of black painted iron, Part B was the area way which spoke nothing of the design and was more in line with what we had voted against ourselves in June, which had to do with the area way infringing on the existing Cyber walk space, the public right of way there was no discussion of the design of the fence in that piece of it and page. Five of that presentation that I posted into the chat is the depiction of the front area way that they were presenting in it to my eye. It matches the other the right that's currently being presented, oh okay, so we have. We have Jordan who wanted to make another comment, I assume, or is it Philippe Jourdan? May we well? Who is you the question, the good eye? What is the role of aesthetics for the members of the committee in voting on an application? It does not seem to affect the movement of people or whatever transportation covers. It does not seem to address how much of the sidewalk is or is not covered. What is our role in evaluating aesthetics? It's not our role. Actually, it's a as you said, it's a revocable consent and we do not. We do not normally get into design when it comes to that and it's been obviously before our landmarks committee, because I've heard a member of the board seriously questioning the design, and I do not know how much weight that should carry with me in terms of approving voting on the application I'll. Let you decide for yourself: Rita Rita does not have her hand up any longer. Marco and Barry have their hand up all right. Well, marco has spoken Barry. How about mark who can speak it very. I do not know what Barry's going to. I may know what Barry's going to say but go ahead. Barry I there we go, I'm unmuted call the question. Okay, all right, so the question has been called to own favor. I assume, if I can just list everyone who I see, that is a member that is on right now and if anyone is missed, please let me know so I can make sure I have the vote. Ali correct myself: Chuck Elita, Barry Brian Cause Elizabeth rose Elise Jack Jordan Laurie Marco Peter Rebecca Dangor Michelle Rita Lowell Valerie. Did I miss anyone? Okay, so why do not we vote? Although we're going to presume that everyone's in favor, those who want to vote no abstain or not voting for cause, you should use the icon, raise your hand and we'll call on you see anybody there. Well, I can't I do not. I do not yet anybody going once going twice unanimous. Okay! Thank you thanks everyone and good this good discussion. Thank you. Miss Pearson and thank you. People have said it's good that the applicant and you had taken our comments very seriously. Barry now has his hand up. I'm not sure. If this is in regards to this or something else Barry, do you have your hand up on something or that? No, you just had it before. It's still a carryover okay item, two is another revocable consent. The proposed front yard extension at 16, East 94th street. Do we have someone here for the applicant on that I do and Anik. Could you stop sharing your screen? Please? Actually there we go Alan, so we have me as the applicant of record in Marvin Mitzner, who is a legal counsel for the owner. Marvin. Are you there? Yes, I see. Marvin you have to yeah he's got marvin you'll have to confirm on muting there you go okay, Marvin's, going to start out all right. It's okay go ahead! Marvin, okay! Good evening my name is Marvin Mixer on the Landing News Council for the owner of the building. Marvin speak up a little your voice, so people can hear you clearly okay, so I am the language attorney for the owner of the building at 16 East 94th street. This is an application to approve the extension of the front yard and approaching three feet into the sidewalk and we're still these 12 feet of thunderstruck with hydraulic space in front of the building. The front yard extension is part of an overall renovation restoration movement of the building, which was approved by the Landmass Commission in 2016 and for which we had a building permit December 20th of 2016 and the improvements were constructed. The original building had a short landing between the bottom step and the front door which needed to be corrected and also the the advisor to the threat ratio was very unusual, so the owner engaged in a renovation project which included extending the the steps into the funded buildings to allow for proper access. I would like to have Alan just give a clear presentation on the what the proposal is. This is, do you want me to share the yeah? Can you share the existing condition? First? Yes, if not, we can dlp2 DOT sheet twon'te number two. I can do that for a moment, all righty. Why do not we share it? We're going to share it marvin there we go. That's not the existing, that's the proposed the ot2 is the sheet. Would you like us to share it? Well, I think it's a good idea. If we could see what you're trying to do, I do not know we're going to share it. Charles, it's going to be harder to have the committee consider it you can't see it totally understand we're going to share it open. Okay, can everybody see no we're not seeing anything here? Okay, one? Second, I can also pull up their presentation if it's the same one, they sent me yeah. Why do not somebody? Okay? There we go okay, so this is was the existing condition. The distance from the bottom of the stair to the front of the building was one foot 10 inches, leaving an inadequate untenable space for a landing on safe space for a landing. That was the first reason for extension, also the ground floor, lowered by 13 inches. So we needed two additional steps and without an expansion of the area way that was also not possible to do. We originally requested a community board, a six foot extension, which was declined in the recommendation. There were subsequent discussions with Lowe and me and we took an advisement his recommendations and when we showed up at landmarks we proposed instead of a six foot extension, we proposed a three foot extension which was built so we're going to show that Eve sure, okay, so this is what was built so we needed two extra stairs and if we had done that, we would have been hitting the front door and also now we have a three foot, eight inch landing, which is more appropriate to have a landing at the bottom of the stairs, and that was the request to landmarks and to DOB, and I also did have a couple discussions with Lo, and this was what was approved and built four years ago. I have to say so there you have it. So what are you doing now? Anything, no construction is complete, and so it's already done and what you're looking this is an approval of you never got a revocable consent from D.O.T before yeah. Well, Jimmy, are you there Jimmy Gandy our expediter. He was on the line before, for whatever reason, for whatever reason he at D.O.B and landmarks, they said it was not necessary to go back, but obviously it was and therefore my team screwed up Jimmy. Can you explain what happened when you spoke to the DOB yeah unmute me yeah, you're unmuted go ahead, okay, yes! So in 2016 we filed the application at the DOB to do renovation work. We got the landmarks approval yard and we submitted to DOB at that point, the plan examiner did not ask for DOT revocable consent, so we'd, and we did not realize we needed once and he did not ask for one and he approved the job. Subsequently, the application, the plan examiner left the Dod and in 2018 the application was assigned to a new plan examiner the new examiner. Then we were finding an amendment for interior stuff, but the new examiner decided to review everything from scratch and she found she found that we needed due to revocable consent. The new crowd examiner is saying: we need to go back and obtain that to be in compliance. We did get the landmark approval for an enlarged area and we got DOB approval, but somewhere along the way we did not catch it and the DOB did not catch that there needed to be a DOT revocable consent. So what you're trying to do is essentially legalize. The three foot extension pass: the property line into the sidewalk area. Yes, okay, so won't understand what this application's about, and okay, anything further Mr Berman. I think that's it Charles! Do you want to see an elevation or a section? Here's the section, so we had to add at least two more stairs because the ground floor, we had to add two more steps because the ground floor, lowered by 13 inches. So with the existing condition with a one foot. Ten, the stairs would have pretty much hit the front door so between hitting the front door with the lowered elevation and between having a tenable landing. It's sort of like this is how the direction we had to go to make it accessible, not a dangerous situation, and so that the new stairs did not hit the front door and have no landing okay. If that makes sense right, I understand I think well, why do not we see if there's any members of the public that have any comments on this application? Will? Can you see any members of the public that have indicated by that? Can you use the hand raised symbol, yeah, Low, Van, Der, Waals, halo, hello, just at the bottom of your screen, you'll see a button to confirm on muting. Okay, am I on yeah, okay, yeah, we're actually very pleased with this application. I think Allen did a great job. You know you do not you're, not seeing the facade and that's not what's before you, but they renovated the facade, and I know when this came before the Landmarks commission. They originally wanted to come out six feet and we indicated that, even though that would not be as far as the neighbor to the east, it would be much further for the neighbor to the west, and so the compromise that was reached was a three- foot extension which we could live with and which we saw the need for it's really. The minimum need the minimum to satisfy their need to have a safe landing space and reasonable reasonably sized steps. So we also think so we're very happy with this application. We also think that the the fence, the railing is nicely done. It is embellished slightly with these round bulbs that are very modest in size, and you know when I looked at the earlier application this evening, you see those little round bulbs along the yes. Thank you. Thank you. That's just that's the most modest embellishment and it's wonderful for our neighborhood and when you saw the last application, it was just a flat top and these townhouses deserve more. So I think this is a wonderful restrained, restrained addition and extension, and we wholeheartedly approve. Thank you. Thank you, love any will. Are there any other members of the public on this? No other members of the public. You have Elizabeth Rose, Michelle, Jordan woke and Valerie Mason, okay, how about Elizabeth rose? Why do not you unmute a little bit Elizabeth yep? So if I get this correct, the homeowner wanted to increase their interior space by dropping the floor a little over a foot. Yes, so this desire of the homeowner then necessitates a longer staircase down which necessitates an expansion into the public way. Yes, but even if we did even if we did not drop the sidewalk Elizabeth, we still had the a foot 10. Even if we left the floor where it was, we had virtually no landing. It was very unsafe, so whether we lowered the floor or not, the existing condition was very dangerous, and so now because our city agencies are not working together well, this was com. This work was completed without one necessary set of approvals, and it sounds like I do not know will if we have any history of what of this came to the community board at the time in 2016. I do not have the presentation, but I do have the resolution. That's posted in the chat. It came before the landmarks. Yes, sorry, but it did not come before transportation. Okay, so that's also, then an hour bad as a community board, because if we see some, if landmark sees something like this- and I guess this is a question for elita- how do we as a community board work better so that if we see something as encroaching landmark, sees a presentation- and it clearly has a proposal to encroach on the public way? Why are not we automatically flagging that this had better come before transportation as well? That's something that we need to correct in our processes I mean, but my I guess my question to the attorneys in this case is at this point: what is our recourse? You know this building was built without appropriate approvals. What is our recourse here? Well, let me say a couple things on that. Just from my perspective, Elizabeth, it's a it's very hard to have members of the Community, Board or, and even the staff. You know we react to applications when they come from agencies would be asking the members of the Landmarks Committee to somehow say well. Have they gotten the revocable consent when that's not something that the Landmarks committee folks are very cognizant of, I'm sure and just like we, you know we ask. So if we know it's in a landmark area, we might say, have you gone to the Landmarks committee or we have not found resolution, so I think it's a tricky thing and it's difficult to ask board members to do that. So I'm not sure what I have no incredibly high regard for the intelligence of our board members and every meeting. I've ever attended board members have made connections to things in other areas. So I respectfully disagree. We should be flat. We should at least have the capacity to flag these things and make sure this is gets calendared or mention it when a an application is coming before one committee that we know you know say, and have you also gotten on the agenda for the other committee, so I will respectfully disagree on that. But let's go back to my prior, the bigger question: what is what is the recourse here? Here's what we can do, which we could we can either approve it to essentially pass it on to the department of Transportation, who would then grant it and legalize it or we can say you know we did not. We never saw us. We should have seen this. It's there's blame that goes to the applicant as well as to the government and because it's applicants should know what kind of approvals that they do need and we could disapprove it and on that basis, and then it's up to the department of Transportation to either agree with us or not. You know, that's our. Those are our options. You ask what we can do as a prac. That's what we can do. I do not know in the end, if it'll practically what it'll mean, but that's what we can do. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you from my perspective, I would not let the opportunity to say: hey, wait a minute. This did not follow appropriate process and procedure, and you know disapprove it. I would not let that opportunity go by. Otherwise it is. There is absolutely no no impact. Okay who is next will sorry. We got off in a colloquy okay, so you have Michelle Jordan, Valerie, Marco and Elita, and I believe Elita wanted to respond to some of them first in this. Yes, because Elizabeth raised the question for the whole about the whole board. So let our esteem board chair, thank you, chuck Elizabeth. This has never come up where an applicant with an architect did not know that they needed to get consent. The issue of extending into the sidewalk has come up numerous times at landmarks, as well as issues that involve the BSA, such as when they're seeking some kind of zoning variance as well as landmarks. They always know to do it, so I understand your point. It has. It has never come up. I'm really stunned that an applicant with an architect would have missed this, that they needed to do this, and so I'll raise my hand again, but I'm with you on taking this opportunity, because this is not the case where a homeowner got up on a sunday and decided to paint their facade of a landmark house or in a historic district and did not realize it. This is moving something into the public way and the Landmarks committee did disapprove the original iteration where they intended to go out six feet. So six feet is a large amount of space that they did not know is really surprising to me, but I understand your point. This has just never arisen before where a professional did not realize what was required in the city. So so thank you and I'll bring that back to the Landmarks committee. When we next meet and I'll raise my hand again for a substantive comment, so I do not cut off anyone. Thank you chuck and thanks will sure. Okay, we, I think Michelle was next Michelle. Why do not we admit yourself yeah if this was done about four years ago and there's an unsafe landing there, because two extra steps were needed? How has the family been gaining access all this time? They purchased the property and they had not. They did not move in yet they just moved in recently, so they purchased the property and it's been an unsafe entrance since they've purchased. This is the first time they're seeking remedy. No, we sought remedy when we first made our applications to the DOB and landmarks. When was that four years ago? That's my point so for four years, if they were not living there, somebody else was living there, correct no one's been living there. It's been under construction for four years for four years well, a year to get the permits and then probably two and a half three years, yeah, no one lived there. It was vacant. Oh just really speaks to the efficiency of the entire project. Yeah. Sorry to hear all this, but I'm really I'm sort of on the fence about this. I too am disturbed that this was not caught. Initially, I'm still not quite sure at what point the two extra steps became needed. They were needed four years ago when that family moved out. When did they become a necessity? Well, I do not know what the previous family felt about the steps. I have not had a conversation with the previous family, but somebody was living with this scenario. Correct somebody was living with it, if not the current donor than the previous owner right. So should we get them involved in this conversation today? No I'm just asking I what I'm saying is somebody in the process thought that these three steps were enough and they were living with it. So it was built a hundred years ago and I guess no one complained so when this family bought the project, they said we have a 1 foot, 10 landing, it's untenable and let's try to make an application to expand the area way. I know if I bought the house and I would assume if you bought the house, I would not feel safe with a one foot, ten landing so you're saying that this original one foot ten landing was original to the 100 year old building. I do not know it was renovated in the 20s by a spanish embassy who did a total gut job. So it's been there, probably since the 20s 1926, I think okay, so many family, we can. We won't go back, but many families have been living with this 1.10 landing. Has there been any determination if there's any way to make it wider without expanding into the public way? Is there a way of doubling a step of making a platform of doing anything? Has that been explored? I we're not here to design, so I'm not asking you to do that now, but I'm just saying has that all been explored? Yeah, yes, and nothing is no architect, could figure out a way without this three feet: expansion. Yes, every architect that well myself and six staff members, three who are licensed, look for other ways and to do what you're suggesting would be a side landing and steps going down on the right angle instead of directly and even to do the side landing, we would have to come out three feet to do a five foot landing turn the stairs sideway and leave a three foot area way to double back to the front door. So what about to the end? What about inside the house? What about moving the front door back, hey Michelle? Can we can we not get into the whole history? And this where it's done? I do not think I'm only trying to decide whether or not there was an alternative that had been explored. I do not want to vote on something that is impossible to achieve, so I'm weighing my vote based on whether or not there's a solution to this. So I'm asking sure solutions like that have been explored. That's all yes, Michelle, absolutely and respectfully we explored every solution and and every solution would mean turning the stairs on the side, leaving a three foot to 40 inch, egress in front of the front door and create a landing from the street and even to create the landing in the stairs. We would have had to come out three foot, no matter what we did and and how about going into the house. Well again, the clients were not concerned about going in the house. They did not want to step onto a 1 foot, 10 landing. I would assume anybody reasonable buying a house for a lot. No all right! Okay, I understand I understand what you're saying I'm saying: if the front door will push back, you have without coming three feet into the public way. You would have space going into the house for putting the extra two steps. I'm only asking if that was explored. That's all yeah. We explored many scenarios and I apologize. I lost you. I can't hear you in the sound. We were told by DOB that we did not have to go back to Community Board, so that was I kept asking. We have many extraneous emails requesting and asking, and we were told by DOB originally that we did not have to go back. So if everyone wants to blame me, I will take full responsibility, but there was no other way to create a safe landing, regardless of which direction the stair was or if we turned it and did a landing. There was no way to make it safe without pulling out at least three feet, and I'm sorry that I was told otherwise by the DOB and yes, it is built. We've got so many compliments from people like Lo and the neighbors how this building was an albatross on the street, and we worked very hard with landmarks to improve the quality of the street. The area way the building is gorgeous. Now we just we continue to get compliments from so many people in the neighborhood to what an improvement that we made and from now the safety that we now have a three foot ten landing, whereas we had a one foot, ten landing regardless. If we lowered the floor or not okay, thank you. Thank you. Will who's next. You have Jordan Valerie, Marco, Alita. Okay, then go ahead Jordan! Thank you very much. Elizabeth rose. You really asked the questions that I wanted to ask very well. If we were absolutely back at the beginning, I'd say: why are they lowering the floor? The first floor, 13 inches? That seems to be a critical factor as to where the landing has to be so. I do not know what how to vote. It's not it's one of the more peculiar things, but I say Elizabeth Rose. Thank you so much for helping to clarify it. Okay, next will I'm losing train here who was who's next after Jordan Valerie hi? I just want to follow up. Obviously it's too late for us to do anything in this particular instance. I hear I think it's Alan Berman, saying that he has correspondence from the DOB basically telling him that he did not need to come back to us. I really think that we need to vote to disapprove this, even though it's already been built, and then we need to send a letter to the DOB with copies of this correspondence, alerting them to the fact that they are approving things that they should not be approving without our approval, and we should be very strong in this, and I do not want to take up any more time, but this can happen again and once we, and once this is of record, which now everyone's going to know about it, they're going to try to do it again, not this particular architect, I'm not imputing. Any kind of you know malicious intent, but it's obvious that the DOB really is not on the market. I think we have to go on record that this was not approved by us and that we should, if we can find out who approved it and put it on record that you know this is not. You know they need to be more proactive in making sure that we get these approvals, because I do not think even though it makes the block more beautiful. We have you know many times you look at these sidewalks and they're shrinking and shrinking, and that is not what we want. So I'm done was it marco next? Will marco? Oh thank you. I agree. The procedure is no is no fine at all and I think it's wrong. However, the three feet that they are asking, I think, is reasonable. I had to make a couple of comments. First of all, d.o.v never said: do not go to the to the community war. That is wrong. That is not true. I do constantly with DOB never set up. Secondly, DOV have a system in the in the in the in the in the applications for many years that immediately trigger when it's a landmark building. They put it to the any planet examiner. That is a plan that this project must go to landmarks, so I do not buy the explanation of the expediter, I think, is wrong. It's better to tell us the truth. The truth is yes, you did a very good job. Yes, you need a little bit more space in order to organize better your space. If that is the truth, yes, I will support the application, but when you are coming with different history or different scenarios that I think made me feel a little bit uncomfortable and by the way you are not the only one. It happened right now in landmarks. The other day there is another application is exactly the same that almost after they finish the job they came to us, so regrettably, that become a parent not only in the in the in this committee, but also in landmarks. The issue of the rice Jordan in the application before that this one, but he's right when they said what we're talking about static stories for transportation. So, therefore, all the applications they should be deal. What is design and history should deal with landmarks and that's in the way that should be handled these applications, so the there in this case it should be first go back to Landmarks, landmark, has to have a position and then come back to our transportation, because otherwise we're encroaching and we're confusing, especially those members of transportation that probably they have no much skills in the history of landmarks. So my bottom line right here is: I do not have a problem to allow this three feet of extension, because I'm a professional too and to go and demolish. I do not think it's fair, and what are you they asking, I think, is something reasonable. They do knowing crotch more than the existing adjacent property that already encroached the sidewalk. So probably my sense is more with it with the direction to recommend the approval. Thank you thank you. Can I chime in or should I wait till the end? I'm the expediter? Okay, I just want to clarify that we did get the enlarged front yard approved by landmarks and we went to a Landmarks committee for the Community Board for the enlarged front yard and we and we got the landmarks permits and the deal you approved it with a landmark permit. If we just did not get the D.O.T revocable consent- and that was a big oversight on my part on the applicant's part and on the plan examiner's part and now the DOB Dave. Also they found out that they have the youtube revocable consent and they informed us late last year about that. So we were, and so we did not know the guilty. You know it felt landmarks missed it. Dob missed it. We missed it. I apologize as the expediter for the project, but we did. We did get the community board hearing for the landmarks and we got the landmarks of approval and sometimes when people ask did you go before the Community Board or the enlarged front yard? I would say yes now. I did not realize that we have to go to the transportation subcommittee, and that is also my thought and I apologize, but I thought by getting the landmarks approval and a committee board's approval on the landmarks side of things. We had all the approvals we needed and I do apologize for that oversight. Okay, Elita, I think, was the leader. Next will yes, sorry yeah? Why are not you? Thank you. First, I have to say that my closest one of my closest friends from law school actually lived in that building a long time ago. I think on either the second or third floor. I knew the address and it looked familiar so I know that or at least her studio apartment in there anyway. Also I chuck. If do we need a vote to see if a letter in the type that Valerie suggested should be sent by the board on this issue? I do not think so. Okay, because I support what Valerie said, I'm really troubled by forgetfulness on the part of applicants that they do not know or do not realize that they need to come before the Community board or they need to go before the board before going to city agencies. So I just can't support this on principle that I know it was built and it looks like it's a lovely job, but I see a second doorway to the right and it's hard to imagine that with some creativity, an architect could not have figured out how to do this and yes, it would have obviously caused some expense. But this is just not it's just not right, because it's an encroachment- and also, I think, was I going to say I just I just I'm troubled by the fact that I was not recognized by anybody and the Landmarks Committee, because I looked at the resolution disapproved the original extension into the sidewalk. It was the previously desired six feet, so that was the only time at least the resolution that I saw from 2016 that went before landmarks and that specific item was disapproved. Unless I read it wrong, so thank you very much. You guys. Thank you. Thank you. Lee next is felice harbour Fleece can unmute police. This is unneeded. Okay, exactly am I just wanted to. I really had just two questions one since this is already built. I wanted to understand what the consequences are of voting no on the revocable consent and then my second question is: how do we make sure that this sort of issue does not happen again to the point that elita and others have raised? I think felice that to answer your second question. First, I think Elita alluded to it. If there's more of a focus in landmarks, when there's when there's an extension like this, because landmarks did actually vote it was, it was six feet, not three feet: they did vote against it the so they knew that there was an extension. The question will have to be to applicants. Are you aware you need a revocable consent, that's going to have to be one of the things probably written in at landmarks, and I think that probably can be dealt with. I you know I think after Elizabeth's discussion. I think I agree. That is probably something we can help keep from happening again, because I do not remember ever dealing with a situation like this. Frankly in our committee, where someone's come to legalize things, they've come to legalize a lot of other things before the board, but this is one I do not remember. I do not know, maybe Barry might remember, but I you know from back to transportation a long time ago, but I certainly do not remember and the other thing is you said you know what are the consequences? I mean it seems to me that in I only know of one circumstance where and it had to do with Zoning and Marvin probably remembers the famous 96th street 12 stories, where you know an architect made a mistake in reading the zoning map and the Park Improvement district went covered the building when he did not think it did and they had to remove 12 stories from the building, and so I do not believe that the department of training we could recommend against it. But then the department of Transportation has the same has to make the decision. I think it's highly unlikely that the Department of transportation would say we're not going to give you a revocable consent, because then it would be illegal and theoretically, if it's illegal, the buildings department might say to them. Okay, you've got to remove this. That would be the most extreme thing, and I only know that I do not know too many other cases. Marvin, it's been around a long time. He may know some other cases where someone done something that you I made pay money and legalize it or whatever, but that was the only case I can think of, because I was somewhat involved in that case Marvin. I do not know if you comment on that. Yes, I do. I do recall that, can you hear me yeah? Can anybody hear me? Yes, okay, I'm having a lot of. I apologize, I'm having a lot of connection problems, so I hear just about every third of every other word right, but to Chuck's point I do recall that. But let me just say this: we've come to you honestly conveying what happened here and the mistakes that were made and they were made. Certainly by the architect, certainly by the expedited certain DOB and the last committee and a whole bunch of other people, but that should not. That should not prejudice the owner who was not innocent in this, and that should not speak to the merits of what we're proposing. So I think it behooves the board to look at what our application is and whether it's an appropriate application, the use of their vocal consent or not and voted on that basis. We all acknowledge a mistake, but why would you penalize an owner who knew nothing about this? Who does not have the knowledge to say otherwise and prejudice him? I do not understand that if you want to make a point, you can certainly make a point in your resolution. How happy you are about the circumstances, and you can certainly make a point to the agencies about how happy you are about the circumstances, but to then take it out of this innocent owner. I do not think is appropriate and fair, and I would ask the board members to consider that and look at the application itself, no matter how and not how it got to you. Thank you, okay, why do not we go next to Jordan? Woke he your hand up. Can we unmute Jordan? You can just if I understood this speaker before I should be looking at this application x as this as if this does not exist, in which case I would probably be arguing against the extension. I believe that a representative of the applicant said that there exists emails from the DOB saying affirmatively that the applicant did not need to get the revocable consent. That certainly would be an interesting item to have available prior to the full board meeting, and I see the representative nodding his head up and down yeah Jimmy. Do we have the actual email or was it a conversation, Jimmy, okay, hi? No, we do not have those emails, but typically what I have is at the beginning of the project, the examiner issues, all the things you need for approval, the objection sheet and the DOT revocable consent was not there, but there are no emails. There is not an email that affirmatively says you do not need a D.O.T revocable consent. Okay yeah, he did. He did note the enlarged side, the enlarged front yard, but I think the examiner and me we wrongly assumed that the landmarks approval for enlarged front yard is enough, and it's not- and I- and I that's on me also- and I apologize again, but we do have. I can't provide you the original objection sheet where the DOT require consent was not required. There is no the issue objections, provide a landmark, permit, provide a you know so- and- so permit, but they did not issue an objection to provide a revocable consent. Okay, thanks, why do not we go to Elizabeth rose? She had her hand up again. Thank you. So, in looking through the presentation and I've been looking through the whole presentation on the Community Board website. All of the documents are dated January of 2020 and are presenting it as if this were, you know, had nothing had happened yet from what I can tell it is the the photographs on the dot- one sheet are those the original condition prior to the extension expansion of the sidewalk? Yes, this is the original yeah that was the original okay. I think the new documents with the year 2020 in it was part of an overall post- approval amendment, but that was not addressing this specifically and that just reappeared from the original approval, which is in 2016. Jimmy. I just I look. I do not have not done this a lot. It feels like the documents are almost trying to go back and remake this right, rather than acknowledge that this is what happened, and so, while I appreciate the comments about the homeowner rather than the professionals whom the homeowner hired it even the way it's being presented now, and I I've got to believe that there are different ways of presenting it makes it feel like there is that there is not acknowledgement of error. So I could address that. We made this application with the advice of edge schnau who's, the ndot in charge of revocable consents. He said in a legalization, you just you have to do it as if you're doing it from the beginning, and you have to follow a certain format. That's why it's format it's made like this, because you have to show what was existing and what was proposed. What was proposed is already built, but you still have to show what was there before and what is there now and you have to retrace everything as if you were doing it before you built it. That's just how they wanted us to present it from the D.O.T right, but the 2020 documents were not trying to fix an areaway issue. The 2020 documents were dealing with other post- approval amendments about the building, and we just reiterated the issue. It was not trying to make a correction or lie or subterfuge or correct mistake. We were still under the belief that we did everything right. So there was no subterfuge or trying to correct something about the area way. It was just a regurgitation based on other things that needed to be updated in the 2020 documents. Okay, thank you. Elita camp thanks again chuck. I just want to say that there is an interest from many members of the board to look at the idea of revocable consents under circumstances where a homeowner decides they'd like to encroach upon the sidewalk, and there has been a lot of recent objections to those revocable consents, which complicates this a little bit because you're asking for something that no one is sure the board would have approved to begin with, and the fact that you're asking for it retroactively because there was a mistake even being cognizant of the innocence of the homeowner. Is it's a it's a very difficult situation, and I just wanted to throw that in the mix that the a lot of board members are not happy with this kind of application. Thank you chuck sure, marco Tamayo. Can we have you, marco? You just have to confirm. Okay, thank you. We have to clarify something. Many members does not understand. What is the process right here? First, landmarks: one is landmarks: it has to go directly to landmarks and DOV say you got ta go to landmarks, but here DOB the authority is from the lock line to inside of the lock and DOV said, the lot line outside is the ot, so this application will be assessed by DOT, because you did not touch anything inside. So my experience in the way that I've seen before D.O.T, usually they approve all revocable consent, even that regardless we have against of any application. So in that direction, the only thing that bothered me so much is they are claiming that there is not the objection sheet from DOV. There is nothing that tells that this applicant has to go to landmarks. I think it disappeared. That paper, which basically I always have these up this paper in my old applications. So I am able to produce at any time and that bothered me a lot if they are hiding that part. So, but at any event, my point is I. This is an issue of D.O.T and this no is not an issue of uv, because it's outside of the lot line and D.O.T is more likely going to approve now seeing in the way that law described. I think they did a very good job, I'm not supporting the illegal actions, but I want to give some relief to the to the applicant and say yes thank you. Thank you, Marco Valerie Mason. I just want to call the question. Okay, sorry, Barry Paul! Is there a second there yeah? What is the motion on the floor? There is no motion on the floor. You're right. Well, I mean I okay. The motion is to to disapprove. Well, let's put it in the affirmative, and people can vote the way they want. The motion is to to approve this application, as amended. Oh to approve it. Okay is there? Is there a second there being a reaction or thumbs up from anyone? I got one from Brian, okay, so it's been moving seconded. So can we go to a vote now at this point? Why do not we do that? Yeah? I mean I clear everybody's hands that are up and yeah. Everybody should take their hands away and they're. Here I can now we're going to assume that you vote have voted in the affirmative. This is a motion to approve, unless your hand is raised where you and then that you want to vote no abstain or not voting for cause. So let's see okay, so let me call in first Peter I see Peter Borock Peter, you need to unmute yeah. Thank you clear. This question has not been called and I would actually offer a substitute motion to take. No action. I think Valerie's point is well taken. Peter, it's been called the questions been called, it's called, so you either vote or not it's up to you. I mean the question was not called because Valerie there was not a standing motion. Valerie call has not been a call, and so I would offer a substitute motion, which is that the committee take no action. I think it's inappropriate what happened here and I think to ask us to go back in time to put our impromature on this for something that, as a leader rightly pointed out, a lot of members of this committee are now against. I think just it just does not really pass the smell test and even if we vote yes, I do not really know what that does. So. I would offer that the board actually votes to take no action on this. Based on the procedural circumstances, we've called the question on the motion to approve Peter. So the emotion's, not your motion's, not in order. So let's so you do want to vote or you do not want to vote I'll vote. President. Okay. Well, you can't vote for president. That's not one! You can abstain, you can vote yes, no abstention, etc. Nope, you, muted, you're, muted, again, Peter Allen, Okay Elizabeth rose Unmute yourself. I vote no unclear whether we would have approved this. Had it come in the appropriate fashion, all right, Valerie, Mason and Mute sure I'm voting no too, but at the main meeting I would not be against the substitute motion. Well, let's can we just vote and not I'm voting now, I'm voting now. I understand I'm not talking to you, I'm just talking to the future people. If we can just keep the commentary down: Brian Ryan Correa, oh Michelle, First, Nissan, Mute, Michelle, I'm sorry! I missed you know yeah. I'm voting, I'm actually going to abstain, but I want to be sure but wait a minute, but I want to be sure that all of the whereases reflect this conversation because I'm not I'm not happy with a no effect you know like if we have a tie or something because then the DOB is just going to do what they want so somehow and which would be the same. If we took no position so some gotcha, I got it. We understand Brian Correa, I'm a no okay! Thank you! Brian Rebecca Dangor, you miss Jordan, Sorry, Miss, Jordan, Sorry, Jordan votes! No, sorry, I'm Rebecca Dangor, no Okay, Rebecca, Lamorte, Sorry First Abstain. Thank you, okay and then I'll eat a camp. Thank you. I vote no, and I want to see the paperwork that they're talking about lose to the board. Yes, well, no, I got you I'm going to come to you. Next, do not worry Lol's being very demonstrative and I do not did not want him to freak out Sorry Elita. That's okay! I'd like to just ask for the paperwork before the next before the full board meeting, so that we could determine whether I'm sorry for my ringing phone so that we could determine whether what they're saying is really accurate and there are the communications from the DOB that they're that they've said have happened. No well! Okay, we'll talk to that. Let's can we, let's thank you, vote here, felice farber felice. Can you hear me please? I I'm staying abstain, okay, jack and then Lowell will come back to you. Oh, I see jet right. Okay, Jack join me up, jax, abstaining, okay and then Lowell had his. He was waving. Well, you just need to confirm. I guess I do not see Lowell here. Maybe I just no okay, sorry, anyone else! No, that is, everybody, is craig. Writing all this down and has a cat. Yes, I am, and there are more no's than there or abstentions than there would be yeses, so it fails. Okay, all right, so that fails. So the motion to approve fails so at this point, why do not we we'll just have a resolution that says we disapproved? We failed to approve the motion to approve it. Is there you have alita with your hand, up and rebecca dengort with their hand up? Yes, elita, you just have to confirm. Okay, thank you. I we need to do a motion to disapprove in order to have any impact. A failure of a motion to approve to pass is the board taking no effect so in order again to have impact. We'd have to have a disapproval. Thank you. Well, if someone wants to move that, we can move it then dangor. I make a motion to disapprove. The application. Is there a second? I see. Elizabeth rose okay, so all right is there any further discussion on this? Are we ready to vote on that? Well, I read a popper. I think once you want to say something reading me to just confirm Rita the confirm that you want to be on mute yeah again. I just I'm voting. Oh okay, oh okay! So, let's, why do not we vote? So everyone will be assumed to vote? Yes, unless you raise your hand, okay, so Rita you're, first up go ahead. Read it rita you just muted yourself. Yes, I, okay costs. Sorry, the motion is to disapprove and disapprove. No, yes, we're presumed to vote. Yes only raise your hand if you do not want to vote yet. Yes, is it disapprovable I know, is an approval right, chuck, yes, correct! So Rita are you voting to disapprove or yes, you just muted yourself again say again: are you voting it's a motion to disapprove? Are you in proof? No on that right? Okay, that's no cost yeah! I vote. No, I think we're beating a dead horse. This has been going on for too long. We've been on this for an hour, let's get it over with. Thank you. Thank you. Cars do not beat any further horses yourself, Jack, Zimmerman, Abstain, okay, Peter Borock was saying Barry Schneider, no marco tamayo, I know and craig later I'm I know, and I'm also I'm also a no to craig, so got it. So you probably I do not know you have the tally. I do not know what happened to that one. So as of now, I see one two, three, four, five, six, seven eight. I see eight no's and I see a total of two four six, eight ten twelve fourteen, sixteen eighteen 20 members currently present- or at least I think they are currently present. So that would mean that the motion would pass okay, so we have 20, we have 28 or so people. Here we have 20 and I'm getting 12 people who have not raised their hand, which would mean yes and one two, three, four: five: six no's and two abstentions: okay, so it's twelve eight in effect on that, okay, so that does pass okay, we'll pass on that resolution to the DOT. Our next item. Number three is a request to change the parking regulations on East 72Nd Street East of York Avenue and Craig did who's. Is there somebody who is sponsoring this? Who is someone here to speak about this, or is this something? I know we put it on the agenda because someone wrote in about it, but is that person here? If they are here, would they raise their hand through the participants menu star nine, if you're on the phone craig? Why do not you go ahead on this because we did get it? We did put this on because of a request that we got sure I'm just trying to go back to see who provided this initially it was from residents. I have the photos up. If you would like me to yeah, you have the photos great. I do so East 72nd street between York and the East. River is a Cul- de- sac, and we have received complaints from constituents and, as will said, he is going to put some of the photos up of vehicles being parked illegally within the Cul- De- sac area, to the extent that vehicles are unable to turn around safely and especially emergency vehicles. This is in some ways similar to what we discussed a few months ago on Cherokee place, except here the vehicles have to make the u- turn it's a no standing zone and cars are parked in the no standing zone, creating this challenging environment, and the question was whether we would consider changing the parking regulations along the street. The challenge is that, at least from my perspective, looking at how we can achieve an outcome that would improve safety and allow for vehicles to not to be able to make the turnaround. I'm not sure what the best solution is, because currently I have to go back and actually see what the what the parking regulations are, but in the Cul- De- sac itself up until a certain point is no standing and on the other side let me just go back and check. I am sorry I should have had this in front of me, but we would have where I thought there was a question as to whether it should be alternate side or something else. So it was more of a discussion if we had the parties who were making the complaints, it would be helpful for us to be able to get their insight into this as well, but without that I think we're left to try to come up with our own solutions. What why do not we put this? Why do not we put this off and we'll take it up next month and see if we can get them to come in because normally, when we have a situation in the you know, people ask us to do something if they do not show up, we normally put it over or give them a chance to show up, and since we do not have it, and since there are issues- and we need to look at it more close closely, why do not we? Why do not we just put this? I think we'll reschedule. Do not you think that makes sense right. I think that makes sense. It's not one of those clear- cut situations where we know what the what the preferred outcome would be that would address and rectify the situation. Yeah. Okay, why do not we go? Then? We item number four on our agenda was a discussion. We asked to put this on the agenda because some of the board members had talked about this and had come up in other contexts about parking and things like that, and this is the prevalence of illegal and counterfeit placards and impacts on safety, resulting from placard packing and parking in those standing zones and stuff, and that came up from some of the issues that we have chuck before we go there. Apparently valerie was waving on the last thing, so I just want to make sure that she has a chance to yeah. Oh sorry, you want to talk about the last thing. Go ahead, just for a second, I think it's great to put it over craig. Can you tell me, I think Gordon Musell might have been one of the signatories to that letter or another somebody else from our neighborhood association. What I just want to, if you can go by people go by the issue, is there that Cul- de- sac is being used as a way station for ubers and lifts and there's a lot of medical offices on that building and it's almost impossible for residents to even just pull up in front, because it's obviously not a through street and people are just using it to hang out as a depot, etc. And so the block is trying to get some control over what's happening in that circle, because it's just making it it's mind- boggling and they can not it. You know they can not get people can't pick up in front of these. Doctors, offices and residents can't even pick up in front of their buildings because it's being used and nobody is coming down there to enforce the regulations because peop, because the drivers are sitting in their cars, idling, etc, and they just move one block over. So that's really the issue over there. So that's it! That's it! Okay, all right! So thank you. Valerie we'll take it up, and hopefully we can make some progress on it next month. The placard the placards issue, as everybody knows, has been a difficult one, and you know during the Bloomberg administration they really tried to reduce the number of placards and who could issue placards and they did. They did do that and it did actually help some, but I think things have sort of slipped back over the last. You know eight years and we do have many placards and I guess the question is: how can we? What can we do about it? And it seems to me that there ought to be a situation where the city really gets control over? Who can issue these placards and how many packages there are try to reduce them dramatically, and that may be something that we want to put in. You know in a resolution that will go to the mayor's office and a number of the other agencies, but it's really the mayor's office that has to get control over this because placards are issued by any number of different agencies, but I'll throw open the floor to people who want to discuss this. I do not know if there are any members of the public that want to talk about this issue. Just a reminder: it's star nine times, to raise your hand if you're on the phone or to use the participants menu if you're a member of the public would like to speak about this issue, and let me just while we wait for anyone to possibly raise the hand just mention that in March of 2019 we did pass a resolution related to park and placard reform. The resolution itself was geared towards a package of City Council legislation that I'm not. I do not recall whether they were past. I seem to recall that the city came up with their own policy and sort of bypassed the city Council, but we supported a lot of the actions that I think we probably still want to want to support. If we were continuing to have that stance. That may not be, as may not be part of proposed legislation at this point, but maybe policies that we wish to see implemented yeah. Thank you craig. I think that's good lori. I see board members. I think Laurie Boris has her hand raised lori. Why do not you do have one member of the public Julianne Britania? Oh sorry, Julianne Virtanium right, please go ahead. Can you hear me? Yes, we can so I I'm speaking specifically about East 62Nd, Street and East 61St street, but we know that this is all around the city and just to sort of support. Your effort, in whatever way we can to reach the mayor's office. We have historically documented, probably for three years on and off when we had council member garodnik in place and also keith powers, and we've met numerous times with department of transportation. To your point, you know really the there's two issues here: one is the issuance of these placards the and then the enforcement of them, because many of the are not only personally photocopied illegal placards, but they're also expired placards where they could be two years old and they're, not getting ticketed, and when we did meet with department of Transportation. I mean I do not know if anyone has any up more updated information of this, I'm sure, given many of the resources that are being cut acrosss the city, one of the ideas was that there was something coming down in the future that would actually allow ticket or ticket officers to be able to use a handheld device like you scan in the grocery store onto a placard with a barcode. That would then determine if it was valid, expired illegal on their system, but I'm sure that's very far down the path. At this point, and I think the real issue is as an immediate concern, how does it actually get enforced as well as how do we limit these placards? That are being issued to add to your letter? I would love to put a footnote in there that you know Md plates are very honorable, but house calls have been a thing of a past for a long time and these Md plates as far as I've historically heard, are things that were put in place like doctors could do house calls. Yet you know, on our block on 62nd street and 19th precinct can give you 20 blocks where there are vehicles with Md plates that will sit for weeks and months on end without receiving tickets and that ticketing officers will not ticket them because they're Md plates, and I think that's something that needs to be addressed. The odd thing about that is that at least what I've been told is that it's from the department of education that, if you're a doctor and you get a license to be a doctor, then you now have the ability to have this license plate and it never really gets revoked or there's no re- issuance. If it. If your you know, medical license was revoked or you've retired. You still have this plate and you still can park wherever you are, and I think that's you know added to the illegal copying of plates as well as lack of ticketing of expired placards. You also have this issue with Md doctor plates that are, you know, not being ticketed and taking up a lot of spaces throughout the city. Thank you. Thank you. Julian. Are there any other members of the public? I thought I had seen someone else's hand up, but I do not see any will. Do you see any members of the public? I do not okay. So why do not we go to the board? Oh, actually, there is one more oh yeah. They just came up, Timor Solomon and it's actually a Peter Chola Chawla. Sorry yeah, P taymor, yes hi. How are you I'm actually just following up on what Julianne Brittany was speaking about in regards to the placards, so I'm resident of lifelong resident of 61st street between 2nd and 3Rd Avenue, and we have now developed a new issue and I do not know if that's going to be addressed by the committee. Please stop me if it is, if we're going to address this at a later time. In regard to the newly installed bike lanes on East, 61St, Street and East 62nd streets, it ties in directly with the placards because, as experienced for myself yesterday, they installed these lanes. They changed the signage on Saturday from a normal Sunday parking, whereas there's no parking, 7 am 7 pm Monday through Saturday, with Sunday parking allowed. They changed that to no standing, no stopping rather and made it a full bike lane with a bike lane a buffer zone with pylons going along the street. This was done, as part of I believe, the mayor's initiative in regard to obviously bike safety and moving people through the city more easily during the Covid-19 epidemic pandemic. The issue here and again, please stop me if this is going to be addressed separately with the bicycle lane that came out of this was that say, for instance, forgetting the traffic patterns that changed completely in this area. This we are part of treadwell farms, historic district. These are small homes with yes, admittedly, a low resident count per se, and but, as I said, I've lived here, my entire life, I'm raising my family here. I have my 85 year old mother here, and so there is something where I've seen how the traffic patterns in this neighborhood have changed because of the 59th, Street, Bridge and Second avenue, and how it's all developed placards have been an issue because they cut off a lane acrosss the street from us. We have trinity baptist church that has a no parking zone. That no parking zone is understandably used by handicapped placards, for which I have nothing to say rightfully so, but yesterday and the day before and the day before, that there was a Md plate with a out- of- state surgeon's committee, Captain Surgeons Committee Placard in its window, and I actually asked the traffic agent. Is that a valid placard she answered me? We do not. No it's an empty plate, it can stand there. I said well, my father was a was a doctor serving New York City with Md plates for 50 years before he passed and he never parked there. We never he never ever looked at it as if an Md plate was valid, as you know, parking anywhere anytime. So I think the placards are a huge issue but and do need to be addressed. I mean even fundamentally having a standardization as to which placards these are not even city placards. These are just any old placards, as Julianna said, Julianne said that could be photocopied or laminated by anybody and traffic ticket agents just pass right over them. Now, please, let me know if I'm going on about something that we're going to be covering, otherwise, because I really do want to address the issues that have developed since the installation of the bike lanes on 61st and 62nd street, or, more so specifically, 61st street, because that's where we're going to talk we're going. Okay, thank you so much. Thank you. Peter Ciao, yeah hi I'll, be very brief. Just to say that I think we you know, given the expectation of increasing number of car trips in the city, we should be doing whatever we can as a community to try and discourage unnecessary trips, and so the more we can limit placards. The better and but, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, the you know, the traffic enforcement agents often do not enforce so the more it can be automated the better they've done it with white bus lanes. We've done it with red light cameras, the more that we could encourage DOT to look at how to do automated enforcement. The better you know, there's a couple of hot spots around where I live on second avenue at 91St Street on 90th street there's often placard plaque, you know not real placarded vehicles and then there are real placards, often used on East end Avenue in front of car shows park, but they're. You know two three deep, unnecessary and illegally parked and dangerous places. So I think there's a lot of issues to address and I really hope that you can pass a new resolution to do this. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, there's, no further anything from the public. Why do not we go to Laurie Boros? Is we Gloria? You can unmute yourself? Okay! Thank you chuck. I want to say thank you to julianne, because I have been advocating this for quite some time and as I've said in previous meetings, there is not a technology we could solve this problem with technology very easily. I happen to have a parking pass from the department of Transportation, which has a a qr code on it. So the the I do not know if the parking agents have the the machine that reads them or not. But the point is that there is a way to do this with technology, and I am appalled by the number of fake placards that I see all over the place. I mean people just take a sticker and slap it on something with a circle, a circle and it looks official and then there's you know, they're, taking up all the parking spaces and really, I think that the major or one of the major issues is that you know, because of Covid-19 everybody who has access to a car is coming into the city. I mean people do not want to ride the subway they're afraid to take a bus, and so, if you have access to a car in any way, you're driving and you're bringing it into the city- and I just I am shocked and appalled by the traffic that has come back just in the last. You know few months and when school starts, you know it's going to be another problem, but this is what I wanted to ask when we passed the resolution a few in 19 about this very issue. It was to support our Congress Enough Congress, our City Council person, who had made a proposal right whatever happened to that proposal who knocked it down and the reason I'm asking this is because I also read an article that our mayor is considered a pro- car mayor, which I did not know or realize that or even understand it. But so I want to know where, like how it went up, it obviously went up the chain a little bit and then was knocked down like how are we going? We can't we can't get something like this passed unless we know where the obstacles were so lori. I take back what I said before. I was just looking into it. The resolution that we passed refers to five different proposed bills and three of them in fact, were enacted. They were enacted towards the end of 2019.. One was a bill that would require the police department to evaluate at least 50 sites a week based on 311 complaints relating to the misuse of parking permits, an obstruction of various various infrastructure like bike, Lanes, Bus lanes, etc. One would one requires 3-, 1- 1 to accept complaints and photographs related to illegal parking and the misuse of parking permits and the city would be. Response is required to respond to complaints about a city vehicle blocking Bike, Lanes, Bus, Lanes, Et cetera, and then there was the new standardized application process managed by DOT for city- wide city issued parking permits, and there were other related pieces of legislation as well that were passed as well. I need to just go through them to figure out what else has been done, but then I thought there was some something else that happened subsequent to it. I do not know if it was in regards to Covid-19 upending things, but I thought the mayor then made a determination that some of that enforcement would be would not occur. If I recall- and I need to again look into that- I remember thank you craig. I remember that there was a part of it that was going to go to each department that issued the parking permits and to say and to give a specific list of the people who got them and the reason why they needed them. That was that was the key. To my mind, of you know why they needed the parking permits, because I know personally that there are many like I always bring this up. You know the press, the press plates, you know, which was everybody salivated about getting a press plate and the press plates were all given to the executives so that they would not have to pay for parking. It was not given to Gum shoe reporters. It was given to the executives, so things like that I think, should be taken away and if you have to explain the reason why someone gets a tick, I mean a a press plate that might you know a parking permit. That might be one of the deterrence, but the bottom line is that I personally think that we have to do this with technology, because there's no other way to make to determine what's a fake plate or not. I agree with you. Let me suggest: can I suggest this? There are a lot of things that have happened in this because at one point the mayor was suggesting ways to deal with counterfeit placards. I do not know where that is. You know we wanted to get this discussion going I'd like to I'd like to put this over until next month, so we can actually find out where some things have gone that were passed in 19 in 2019 is craig was saying and what the state of the play is and then maybe we can craft a resolution next month. That reflects where we are the latest state of the thinking and where we think we ought to go because I my sense is: we do not really have enough information. You know, we know what the problem is and we do not have enough information on what's happened and what's on the books and what more we might want to do so. I know I'd like to be better prepared, so we could formulate a resolution that makes sense, because we did that last year supporting these specific legislative efforts, but I think we could probably do something more and different once we know exactly where we are, and so I'd like to I'd like to put this off until next month. I think we'll be better prepared and we'll come back. I'm happy to do that as well. I'll just add, I did find the article that I was alluding to back just in July the announcement that the mayor essentially cut the funding 5.4 million dollars dedicated to the NYPD unit that was dedicated to stopping placard abuse. So that's part of the equation, I think yeah. I think we'd like to see what's going on and there may be things that we can suggest, because I think lori is right. I think there does not need to be a way that people, the traffic control agents can just with their phone detect. When there's a you know a placard, that's either phony or that's not, you know or that's out of date, etc. But it's not legal anymore and that'll help. Why do not we go ahead to the D.O.T updates and no one from D.O.T is here, but I think craig. It might be useful at this point to go over the the bike lane. You know temporary bike lane issues because we've had some. You know: we've had some correspondence with the D.O.T on this and we've had some of the public who have written it and it was raised by Mr Solomon. Also yes, so earlier today, even though we do not have DOT present at the meeting, we did reach out to them to ask. I think what are some of the pertinent questions that people are most curious about and they were able to answer a number of them. So let me just pull that up, so I could give you their precise responses. So the questions that we put forward to them was: will the bike lane be on the left side of the street in all locations and if not, which streets would it be on the opposite side? And the response was that the temporary bike lane will be on the north side of the street at all locations? And that is a consistent alignment along the corridor. And then we asked in July D.O.T committed to allowing restaurants to provide outdoor seating all along 61st and 62nd street, and the flyer that the ot put out promoting the new temporary bike lane indicates that the project will quote change parking regulations as needed to accommodate bike lanes and provide curb access. So we asked how exactly is bike lane going to be configured to not interfere with the outdoor seating that is currently being provided by these restaurants and DOT responded that they have developed and yeah they've developed designs to accommodate existing roadway seating for open restaurants that are similar to treatments around construction sites? Bikes are routed around the dining areas. We should note that two of the restaurants that originally expressed concerns about the project- that's amaranth and David Burke- do not currently have seating set up in the roadway D.O.T reached out to them and based on their responses that they do not plan to set up seating. They kept the lane curbside. Then we asked what type of parking regulation changes are going to be made for these temporary lanes. The response was where floating parking can not be accommodated. No stopping anytime regulations have been installed on the north side of the street. In many of those locations, commercial loading or overnight parking has been relocated to the south, curb where there was previously no standing during the day. And then we asked about the designs that were depicted on the flyers. They had two examples of what they were going to do with the 30 foot, wide core sections, and then they had one example for the 34 foot wide cross sections, and they clarified that the floating parking will be included on the 30 foot wide blocks, which includes 61st street, from fifth avenue, to Lexington due to vehicular volumes and ongoing construction. They were unable to accommodate floating parking on 61st street and 62nd street, from York to Second Avenue, where the street is also 34 feet wide and then, finally, in terms of the implementation, it's expected to be completed by the end of next week. So that is the latest and greatest information afternoon, and they say they were coming back to us about permanent by explaining right and they've always said they emphasized this when they made their presentation in July. This eventually is going to become permanent, with permanent infrastructure put in place, but before they do anything of that nature, they will come to community Board aid and provide a full presentation on the proposed design, which could theoretically differ from what's in place right now. This is right now just temporary bike lanes that are being put in there with temporary materials and before anything, that is to be done using permanent materials. They will come back to us and we do not have a time frame for that. Yet as it is, this was supposed to be implemented at the end of at the end of July, and here we are in early September and it's clearly taking them time. So I do not know how quickly they're going to get around to coming back to us. Okay, thank you, Craig! Is there anything else or we can go to the public yeah? I think we should go to the public and try to answer any questions that they may have. I do not know that we'll have any answers beyond that, but always happy to try. Yes, so for the, I think I see I see Judy Schneider first here Judy. Why do not you go ahead and mute yourself? Yeah, I'm a little confused. I thought these bike lanes were to help people coming over the 59th street bridge going directly acrosss to Central Park, so I assumed that the bike lanes on six one and six two would start at second Avenue. Are they in fact, starting from York all the way acrosss six one and six two? It would appear. So the flyer for the project did note that it was from York Avenue to Fifth Avenue and the response that I was just reading. When I asked about the 30 foot versus 34, 34-foot right- of- ways did make it sound as if that they're going to be doing it to York as well. Can I ask if anyone present knows whether they've put in the bike lane, let's say between second and first on 61st or 62nd street, I think I saw I saw Timor there raising his hand. Is that? Yes, yes, so basically the signage has changed all acrosss 61st street from York Avenue to Fifth Avenue. Further, it changed the signage. Now they have not put in the physical bike lanes or painted the lines on most of these streets. That's why he was asking right, so the signage has changed from York Avenue, all the way west to Fifth Avenue on 61st street, for the nor for the north side, as well as on 62nd street from Fifth Avenue going east to well. Actually. As far as second Avenue I'm sorry, I did not go beyond second avenue on 62nd street, but the lines have been painted only from 61st and 2nd to 61st and 5th. They have not painted any lines or put any physical barriers, meaning the pylons on 62nd street whatsoever. They, I I'm sorry, I actually painted some lines on 62nd street from Fifth Avenue, I believe to park Avenue, but no other blockages. Now, if I can elaborate what they did was set a 10 foot bike, Lane plus Buffer zone from second avenue, on 61st, through until Lexington avenue, on 61st, leaving a 10-foot wide bike lane and Buffer Zone, one active lane for traffic, which is tight and then one parking lane, because they left the commercial zone parking with muni meter on the south side of 61st street, from 11 A.M till 7 pm, there's no standing from 7 A.M to 11 A.M as it was before so fundamentally, what they've done was make it impossible for a car to stop if the commercial zone parking is used by trucks and and commercial plates, which it is inevitably and basically constantly during those hours. It is impossible to stop a vehicle to disembark, to drop off packages, to do anything of the sort between 2Nd, Avenue and Lexington avenue. Without stopping all traffic, then from Lexington avenue to Fifth Avenue, they decreased the size of the bike, Lane and Buffer zone to seven feet affording, and I have photographs to show all of this- I'm sorry I'm not. I was not prepared for this meeting, so I do not have them to be able to show to you to share right now, but what they did from Lexington avenue to Fifth Avenue was make it seven feet wide, which then allows should the parking on the south side of the street be filled cars and trucks to unload without invading the actual bicycle lane on the north side, so because there's enough room to go into the buffer zone and not actually intrude upon the bicycle lane. Now I'm a resident of 61st street between 2nd and 3Rd Avenue. As I said, I'm a lifelong resident. I was born into this house, I'm raising my children in this house. I have an 85 year old finish my question: oh I'm sorry! Yeah! Can I just interrupt you, one second teamwork, just to say chuck and craig the East 60s Neighborhood association has gotten a number of calls and I did not. Since I have not been out walking, I did not understand that it was going to extend down to York Avenue and with the bridge ramp emptying and all the other problems we have due to the bridge here in the 60s. People are not happy with this solution now, if I understand correctly- and this is my last question- that they're trying this and that this is temporary and that it's not permanent and that DOT will take a look at this and maybe make changes or is that an incorrect thought, it's quite possible to hear what comments we got and that they would listen and we'll see we'll you know and when they go to make permanent they'll come back to us, and so we do have a chance to. You know, have some discussion with them on this. Yes, okay, go ahead, Taymor, I'm sorry! I interrupted you no, not at all! I'm sorry! I please. I interrupt me at any point if I seem to be going off topic or elaborating too much along one line. But the point is this: this. I understand that this was announced. This went up in a very inopportune time as I within the five brownstones two to either side of me. They have not been occupied by their residents. The owners are not in residence. As of maybe April. We have always been in residence. Our next door. Neighbor is a renter who just returned. In August we have three apartment buildings on the north side of 61st between second and third and about, I believe, 15 private homes along that line, they've basically made it impossible for us to legally access our homes via anything by a car or via taxi whatever it might be, and, as I said before, I have an 85 year old, basically wheelchair bound mother. I have a four a three- year- old daughter and a nine- month- old daughter. I do have a car which I park in a garage and the only access I have to legally either put any of them in that car or bring groceries to my home, whatever it may be, is to hope that there's a parking spot acrosss the street that is not filled by trucks where I would not be legally parked anyway, because I'm I do not have commercial plates or I have no access. We do not. We can't park or stop on second avenue, as you all well know, because of the bridge. Third Avenue is again a no parking area unless there's a meter, but during most hours of the day it's no parking. So it leaves us in a situation where we have now. Our access to our own home has been removed from us. We have to take care of the curb we have to clean the street, but yet we can't even park when they were installing the lines. The representative from the D.O.T who was here was was a gentleman named Sean Macias, he said, he's the deputy director of the bicycle division and when I asked him just fundamentally, how am I supposed to access, or how am I supposed to get my mother in the car or my children in the car and put them in their car seats? He said that to use these exact words, expeditious, loading and unloading of passengers is allowed you're allowed to invade the bicycle lane for expeditious unloading and loading, to which I see what's expeditious. This is not. We are not taxi drivers, we are not livery car drivers we're residents and if we have no access to our curb, what are we supposed to do? And that was the question that I said that I placed because had there been public postings had there been all these things, especially during this pandemic? I think you would have heard more voices from the actual people being affected by this and on the I'm sorry we did, we did have a hearing where there was a presentation by the bicycle people on July 1st in our July meeting, and there were a lot of people and there was a lot of discussion of it. So there has been, there have been concerns that have already been expressed to D.O.T. No, I understand I mean my point is obviously this is a. This is a reaction to the pandemic as well, but a lot of the residents that are being directly affected are not actually here right now and that's a big problem. So I think when it comes to the permanent bike lanes, then you know, hopefully more people will be back and we'll be able to get a fuller dialogue on it. I hope so. Thanks, thank you and in a communication to us, the deputy commissioner said the temporary installation will be monitored after implementation and it provides us an opportunity to inform development of longer- term design. So clearly, they are going to be willing to listen and take into account actual experiences from when bike Lane is in in a temporary way. Well, I'm sorry if I just add one thing just then fundamentally, if the DOT would just approach the idea of removing the commercial meters and muni meter from acrosss the street and make it what it always was in the past before the mirrors, trucks, unloading and loading, then it would at least grant us access granted again for me to put my mother in the car I'll have to dodge one. A bicycle lane which we all know now has become not easy, especially with the use of e- bikes. People are running 30 miles an hour in the bicycle lane, with electric bikes that are just as dangerous as motorcycles. So not only do we have to dodge right off the curb E-, bikes and bicycles, but then a lane of traffic to get in a car. I'm even willing to do that, but then remove the muni meters from acrosss the street so that we can actually have some place. That is a no standing zone that we can stop at least to do this expeditious loading and unloading of passengers and packages. All right, I think, that's an approach. Thank you. We have we. Let's move on to some other members of the public that want to speak. Julian you. Why do not you unmute yourself? I know you wanted to say something julian you're unmuted, oh okay, I was like trying to figure that out. I would absolutely reiterate what Tamora said, and I think one of the main things for people to take away is that these two blocks, 61st and 62nd, for those that do not know already were incredibly heavily trafficked blocks and they have an egress to the fdr. They have ramps coming off of the Queensborough bridge. They are turning and backing up onto second avenue trying to get onto the bridge from the front side of it. We have already been heavily trafficked with the elimination of one lane. Frankly, due to the bicycle lane, which is really effectively taking up one of what used to be three very small lanes, our streets just could not accommodate one lane. Only as taymor said, you either have to eliminate the parking on one side, otherwise, there's just effectively. One lane I have shared with will he's happy to post it if there's a way, a youtube video from the first day at 8 am- and I appreciate people are sending this to me. That literally shows the back up onto second avenue. Pedestrians unsafely trying to get through second avenue, because already 61st street, going acrosss from East to West was already backed up onto second avenue and that one lane on a as somebody else here spoke earlier. I think it was lori. We do not even have full capacity in the city, yet people are on vacation. As Taymor said, a lot of residents are away, but wait till school start wait to truck traffic starts coming back into the city with full deliveries. You know we will see a huge increase, but as it is now with a first day of first installation, we are seeing major traffic issues and you know, excuse me, there's often traffic officers just a block away and in the video you can actually see a traffic officer on the corner of 61st and 2nd not assigned to this bike lane issue, but really just in complete gridlock unable to handle what he's being asked to handle. So I think it's a real safety issue. I think it's a real concern and I think, as a as we have the ability to go back at a future date. Personally, I'm a biker, I'm, you know very excited about more bike lanes. This is just a bad choice. The way they have this set up and I have sent emails to Edward Pinkar and I've been in conversations with him a little bit at D.O.T. I was hoping somebody from D.O.T would be here so that they can hear more from a larger audience of the public. But this is at this point an accident waiting to happen, and I think that there needs to be very specific rules for residents in particular, because residents- and I also should say there are two houses of worship on these two blocks and so being able to go to mass on a sunday whether you're part of trinity, Baptist, church or you're, whether you're part of the coptic christian church, those poor people from what I understand on Sunday, exited their masses and actually had tickets on their cars when this was not even publicly announced and the signage had not even been changed yet. So there was a lot of sort of cart before the horse attitude here and I think, there's a lot of pieces that have not been thought out well and unfortunately, we're already seeing the impact not only in traffic, but just you know, let's all hope for ourselves and our neighbors- that nobody really gets hurt here. Thank you, Julian! Let Peter chawla! You want to make a comment. Yeah Peter go ahead, Unmet commute yeah, so I do not have that much to say specifically about the 6162 bike lanes, except to say that there was some comment about. Why do they extend all the way down to York? So once we have an East river greenway that actually is functioning and has a sound pavement, then a lot of bikes do come down the greenway and it's helpful to have access acrosss all the way down to the East River. So that's an important point to think about. I actually wanted to raise something slightly different, but because we're in new business and we're talking about bike lanes, I thought I hope you do not mind. No peter we're talking only about this issue. If you want to raise something, that's different. You know that back on other bike lanes when you ask for new business, then, okay, thank you all right. Why do not we? Why do not? We go first to sort of reverse here, but when we go to old business- and I know that this is the this is- we still had more comments from Valerie and Michelle want to speak on this. Sorry, I'm sorry. We have board comments, yeah, you're, right, Jordan, now sorry Valerie, I feel for these people, and I just think you know once again the DOT I mean it's already not working, and how long does it have to be temporary before they come in and look at it? So I would advocate that we get in touch with them. To I mean, I think it's really suspect that nobody's even here tonight and that you know, even though they said we were going to have an opportunity to comment. Nobody is really checking in with either the Community Board or any of the neighborhood associations that govern not govern these blocks, but at least have a look- see into them whether it's E-60S or Julianne's organization- and you know, they're, not really taking real- time feedback, and you know why. What is the point of you know if we're in the experiment- and we already know it's not working? Why does it continue? I mean why does it have to get worse before it gets better they're in the in the temporary spot, and I think we should just call out the DOT for not really supervising this quote- unquote temporary experiment, and we should not wait and, if they're not going to show up that shows that they do not even care what we're saying, and I really think that's what we should do. Well, I think they have. They said that they were all. Everybody was all covering other meetings. That just happened because we asked for someone when they said Colleen had to cover something else and they could not show up, but they said they were willing to listen to. You know what has been said here tonight and we're going to go back and report and talk to them about it. So I think I think people will get a chance to weigh in on this michelle yeah a couple of things. I've had my hand up since item three, so thank you for recognizing me with respect, I'm going to just make very quick comments, but with respect to item three East 72Nd street, in that East of York is the majority of medical buildings and medical offices. So I think that street has to be very carefully and fully posted so that we can discuss that thoroughly at our next meeting. I really want to hear from the residents with reference to the parking placards. I understand you want to put it off till our next meeting. I do not have a real objection to that, except to say we really have nothing more to say about that, except that we'd like to see a more efficient system and the only thing that would be more efficient is an electronic one, and if we wanted to make that resolution tonight, we certainly could do that because we can not point to individual places where there are illegal or counterfeit placards. I can tell you one thing as having had cars with Md plates Md plates are ticketed everywhere, with the exception of where it says, Md parking so be under no illusion that you can park anywhere. You want with an Md plate, simply untrue. I have personal experience with that in terms of the parking placards, if we could do a resolution saying that we want some electronic tracking, I think that would be a good idea. We can even do it tonight with respect to 61st street and 62nd they rolled this out. I, the first public notice I got was- I think, yesterday about this, and the truth is before we go any further with. It needs to be posted those people on those blocks. We need to have them here and hear what they're saying this is not unusual for the DOT not to bring things to us. We know that very often they do something, and then they come to us to tell us about it when it's already a Fed to come play. I hope it's not the case with this, but you know with the buses on 70s, 9th street, etc. They always tell you that they'll come back and look at it after it's in place for a year and that's how they make a determination as to whether or not it's working. I hope that's not the case in this situation, but 61st and 62nd street ought to have a prominent place on our agenda and be very well posted next month. So in terms of anything any more discussion about those bike lanes without those residents here and without the DOT to listen to us, I think this conversation is probably mute, but if you did want to reconsider a resolution tonight about electronic tracking with the placards, I think it's something we can entertain. Maybe also in that resolution reinforce our prior resolution and then have something we can take off the agenda for next month. Excuse me, Michelle. I think we should wait, especially given that one of the bills that was enacted did have to do with the creation of a centralized electronic tracking system. So I really do think it would behoove us to. Oh, that's good yeah. If you're past, then that's good, but no that's good, and when we put the 61st 62nd on the agenda next month, we ought to make our feelings known to the DOT that we're not happy that this was put into place without advising us first and giving us an opportunity to comment and notify the public. Thank you. Thank you all right. I think we could move forward to new business. Now you agree Chuck, you did so he. Why do not we? Why do not we first I'd like to go to old business actually first and then we'll go okay? Yes, that was yeah. I think I think the schedule got sort of mixed up. It's really old business first, but anyway, why do not I'd like to call on Rita Popper to- and I want to talk about this too, but I have to read it about East 91St street. This is an issue. That's been going on for a long time about the street condition, etc. Rita. Why do not you go ahead and I know that you've been working on this yourself for quite a while. You know with every rain the situation gets worse. What we really need to do is establish that the D.O.T or DEP, when they put in or corrected a flooded sewer that that's where the water is seeped, underneath these pavers, which are just put into earth they're not cemented in and what we need to do is, and we've asked for the work order, so that we can show that it is definitely related to that to the fixing of that sewer. I do not know how to do that. I mean how many people can you ask, and meanwhile this is a sledding street. This is you know when we're talking about that. We need to open up streets. We have an open street that we close. You know I need to understand the logic, but then again after tonight, I do not understand the logic in anything, but that's where it stands is that we need to get the work order as to when that sewer was fixed and how long it leaked period. Well, let me I had a discussion with Ed Pinkar about this Rita Ed basically said this, and this is one of these things where we have to figure out how we go forward from here. He said: look D.O.T is never going to put this stuff. You know the kinds of pavers back. They won't do that. They said that's not what they do and they'll never do it. So that's one thing he said: maybe you can get DEP if, but he thinks that's a long shot to do that and that's what you're talking about getting into the work order about the sewer connection, etc and then try to get them to do something and what he said was. If you really want to get it done, you have to get the buildings to get it done, they have the pavers and they should do it, and so that's the city position at least from Ed Pinkar. So we're going to that's where we're going to have to figure out a way to move this thing forward, and maybe we have to talk to our city council people and see if there's a way they can. You know get this thing straightened out. Question is not the pavers the people, the owners of the buildings, will put down the papers. The street itself has risen up in places and has depressed in places gotcha these people in the building a they did not cause the leak to begin with, and they do not have the equipment to straighten the street out. The pavers are not enough. Ed Pinkar wants the papers to be a problem and DEP wants to pay. The papers are not the problem. It's the ground. Okay, that's very helpful if the if the buildings are willing to put the papers back in, that's very helpful. Let's see, let's see if we can move this forward with the DEP first and then hope and then D.O.T at least get this underlying street fixed Gotcha. Okay, some other Jordan. Well, I'm unmuted! May I ask for something for the next meeting: some we have very a lily population in my building and they have seen that Omni Omny that you can get on public transportation with your credit card seniors who wanted to know how that would how they could get reduced fares with their credit card unless says they can. We have somebody come and talk about Omni next time, sure, okay, yeah! Now I do not know Jordan did you? Did you have something on this or were you did you want to talk about this Jordan? Well, no. I did not want to talk about this. I had another piece of old business. Oh another piece of old business. Okay, why do not you go ahead? Jordan give us another piece. I guess it was two months ago there were recommendations for opening various side streets in the area for pedestrians and bicycles, and, as I recall, that list was not discussed and it would be discuss this meeting. Anyone know what I'm talking about. I do not think we agreed to visited them. We passed a resolution last month for 81St 82nd street between York and first on Saturdays, and I think we just left it, as is at that point. When you say last month there was an August meeting in July in July. Okay, that's when I thought it was discussed, but it was, but we only passed a resolution on that we were not going to. We did not do anything in the others. Was the plan to discuss the others? No. Well then, this is close. 91St street between 5Th and Madison is now an open street on the weekends. Well, the city does what it does. I guess sometimes right is there further old business is Elizabeth. I see well first well, I think Peter had some new business, but let's see if there's old business First Elizabeth rose, did you have this old business or new business? My question was just related to James Cagney Place and the when the Department of Transportation recognized it as a pedestrian plaza. Does that imply that the Department of transportation does making it a public plaza imply that the city then is responsible for the maintenance of the underlying street, because I think where some of this issue continues to rub is that when it was de-, mapped and not used as a public street, the department of transportation would not be responsible for the underlying street and the city creates lots of water damage to private property on an annual basis, and I do not think the city is responsible for the restoration of that private property. So I it sounds to me like this. All issue hinges on: does the conversion of that space to a public, plaza, implicate city, responsibility for the underlying street? Well, it's it and Rita probably knows this, but it's still it's still not it has not been de- mapped is my. It has not been the map, it still is shown on the city map as a city street it happens to be, they could at any time, come back and say we're opening this street to traffic. They have you know, they're not doing it. We do not think they're going to do it, but it's so, but the city is still, it still is considered on the map of City Street Rita's right, correcting that you're shaking your head. Yes, okay, it does and does tot agree with that yeah. I think they do yeah D.O.T just to be clear, always a city street, you got a declared a permanent plus a pedro, a pedestrian plaza only because it's been closed for like 45 years, but it is a city street. It's not too mapped and it belongs to the city right yep, that's helpful. Thank you sure, lori Boris, do you want to say something on this old business issue already. I believe. Peter also is a resident of that area and might have had something to say about James Gagne's place as well: Peter chowa yeah. No, he has a new business item he wanted to raise. He said, okay, I do not know this is I have both actually, if that's allowed. So of course, of course it's allowed yeah I mean I live in the same building. Rita does- and I actually raised this with the community board back in. I think it was September or October last year, the street condition and at the time Colleen was in the room. She joined us that time and she said at the time back in September, that's from colleen from the Department of Transportation right. She said: DOT will not redo this until DEP takes responsibility for the leakage that created the situation, which is really I mean this is crazy to me that we have two departments that are just both refusing to take responsibility. I mean in my mind, when I walk on James Cadden place. There is a sign up on the side on the street side that says its department of transport responsibility, so this is department of transport responsibility, but they refuse to correct their problem, and we really need to ask them to do something about this, and I do not care about the internal politics between DEP and Department of transport. It's a street problem. The Department of transport should fix it. It's really unconscionable that it's been like this for two years lori. I think it should not be surprising that government agencies are saying it's someone else's responsibility, that's what we always have to work our way through lori. Do you have just briefly? I wanted to back up what Rita said about inviting an omni person, because the people with disabilities are also concerned about how they can get their disabled discount or whatever on the Omni system. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Okay, let's see I now I think new business now we'll go. I think Peter you had it. You had the new business item. Peter Chawa had a new business item. He wanted to raise, go ahead, Peter yeah! Oh sorry, thank you yeah. So it was related to bike lanes as well. You know I'm a regular cyclist in the city, my kids, my wife or our cycling family. We get around regularly by bicycle, and so some of the new bike lanes that have come up have been very helpful but, as you might remember, early in the year or late last year, we raised the issue of a number of advocates raised the issue of crosstown bike lanes. So I just wanted to raise to the to this committee that cd7 on the West side- just I think it was yesterday or the day before passed, overwhelming vote for a resolution for a two- way protected bike lane on 72nd street and to keep in line with what this committee has done earlier in the year to ask for a cross- agency study or cross- agency group to work on river to River bike lanes that work from East River all the way to the Hudson. It would be really helpful if we could, in this committee and then in this community board, also addressed the issue of of a bikeway protected by claim in the 70s to connect up through central park and to the 72nd Street bike lane, which CB7 is proposing as of yesterday or the day before, not to the exclusion of ideas for which we had earlier in the year for fixing the 96th Street bike Lane through the park, which is partially responsible. At least its poor condition, is partially responsible for the death of Dr Cameron, who died on his bicycle on the transverse on 96th earlier in the year. Thank you. Okay, thanks further, is there any further business that anyone has or can we are? We ready to Adjourn Rita has her hand up okay, Rita. Yes, sorry I just wanted to add. One thing is that it is 91st street is a bike lane and because the top of the hill is cordoned off the delivery. People are using motorized bicycles and going up the sidewalk, and there are benches at the lower half of this street and they're, mostly elderly people, and everybody is trying to be outside, so someone's going to get hurt with the bicycles on the sidewalk they're. That's the only way to get delivery up. They won't use the center because they have to get off and walk their bike around because the area that's cordoned off. That's I just wanted you to know that. Thank you, Rita. You reminded me on these on the electric bikes and things like that. Our board chair, who is here tonight Elita, has asked. If we were going to look, you know take up the issue of having the city pass, something because the state law came to legalize these things and scooters and stuff like that. But there is the opportunity for the city to pass a city like New York, to pass its own laws and that's something we're going to take up we'll probably put that on the agenda for next month. I think we have one more person: Diane Malachi, Moomin Pinkston like to talk, say something yeah an issue. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me, can you hear me? Yes, can you? Can you hear us? Yes, we hear you wait. Let me try this. Let me take off, we can we can hear you yeah, we hear you, we hear you. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you can me or you can't. Can yes, you can? Okay, I'm going to try to talk quick. So I want to say it's report that everyone you know concerned bicycles, I'm full delivery for myself and I also write dates for exercise because you know of my illnesses. So I understand he's concerned, but they have also keep on people rolling up on the sidewalk, also because they'd be going to a building that is on the sidewalk and, like I said, I can't relate to people because even some bicyclists next to me sometimes dude, it's kind of low okay did not know that person coming sometimes they're moving fast, but I would say you know let blame it on anyone person like me, and I know that any other. Like me, we are very cautious our bike and it's kind of disturbing times when the pedestrians complain. I have to yelling at me, but you're on the street, and sometimes you know honestly. I heard that and say my business because I'm going to the present right there you know so I mean I think, the two towards the bikers, all of them all in the same pool, were wrong and also give it some consideration that sometimes bicyclists are delivered to the business on the sidewalk so that I wanted to see. Thank you. Thank you. We understood, okay, if there's no further business, I think we can up Valerie Mason, yes, go ahead. Valerie, you have our valedictory statement here. Sorry I got thrown off. I sent you something about how doctors can get their parking tickets fixed for just 25 a year. You'll see it in the chat. You can just join the New York medical Society and they and they and they promise that they waive 70,000 in parking tickets each year. But besides that, I'm really I wanted to raise this in old business. We've been talking about these benches that are on the sidewalks and we have gotten really bad service. I believe from the department of transportation on an issue that we've been talking about for over two years, these defective benches that we have- and I have been asking colleen chattergoon for at least 11 consecutive weeks to tell me whose responsibility it is to clean these benches that are be being used as essentially trash, receptacles and open homes for rats and other vermin, and I can't get her to answer the question. I did not realize that it was such a difficult question, but you know elita and chuck and craig you've been on some of these emails. I can't believe that this is that difficult, a question to answer, and I find it just you know we're all volunteers, and it should not be that difficult to answer this question I mean we have a bench that here near 72nd street, that's in front of the subway, and I can't take anyone to take responsibility for it. And if nobody is going to clean it, then I think it needs to be removed and- and I just there's just no response from the Department of Transportation- and I think that's a theme we've been listening to tonight- is that they take our complaints and they put them in some abyss and we never get any real action on anything, and I think we need to in this environment hold their feet to the fire a little bit here, whether it's the fact that they're giving revocable consent without consulting with us or you know, putting in bike lanes and not getting feedback or you know whatever it is. I think that they just need to be more accountable, and if that means that you know ed or Colleen has to be on these phone calls, they need to be here. They need to be responsive and they're, just not being responsive, and I do not think we should let them get away with it. So that's my valedictory address for tonight. Thank you and we'll talk we'll bring that up with Ed, absolutely okay, so I think we're ready to adjourn in the without objection. Thank you. Everyone Alita does have her hand up. I do not know if you wanted to who does elita. Yes, of course, I'll be very I'll, be very fast. I just want to say that I also am very disappointed that D.O.T did not appear at the meeting tonight and and find it troubling, particularly in light of what has been said and what Valerie said, and I will end on that. Thank you. So much you've had shown incredible patience and kindness and great deal of warmth, both you and craig. Thank you and we'll be after D.O.T on those issues without the patient's kindness and warmth. Perhaps so we are adjourned and thanks everyone for participating next month, good night, everyone.
