Is something that we back for reconsideration: a revocable consent application for proposed, fenced in area, including steps planters, together with the snow melt system in front of 106 east 78th street Is?
This is a property just east of 875 park avenue and next to it are two identical townhouses built by the same family in the late 1860s, and so each of these townhouses has an area away in front of them and, as do other properties down the block on the south side of the street It is showing our proposed our existing townhouse Sorry, looking north looking south from the curb in front of the existing fence that extends past the property line.
We're proposing to expand this planter so that it goes almost across the whole face of that fence and also to have a an in-ground planter for a climbing plant to climb up the face of the townhouse We're proposing to expand the green space of this area away, as well as modifying the fence, aesthetic itself and finally, as was previously approved by the community board at our last hearing, is a proposal to heat the sidewalk with the snow melt system below the sidewalk level, so that the snow melt system would extend for the full width of the townhouse from the sidewalk at the curb back to the townhouse facade, so that the snowmelt system would be maintained and in use and help to clear the snow and ice from the sidewalk in the winter.
We have a certificate of appropriateness from landmarks, but we have gone back to them for a post-approval amendment to shorten the area away so that it does not extend the existing I meant to come back before the cb8 landmarks committee about the fence and the planters and I know this isn't transportation issue chuck, but as long as the applicant is here and raising these issues, oh because the defense designed it did not change and they had already approved the fence at the cb8 hearing , they didn't approve this fence They approve offen?
That's why you usually trigger the snow, melts to start warming up the sidewalk ahead of time, Okay I'm, not a fan of snowmelt systems and I think I understand why if the applicant isn't available, what is the backup for making sure the boiler is on and that the temperature sensor is set and that kind of thing there's a full-time caretaker for the townhouse who takes care of all of this So, even if the snowmelt system, you know, didn't turn on often enough, the responsibility falls on the homeowner to clear the sidewalk one way or the other.
Just so, what's in front, is the fence and I'm asking these questions, because you did the right thing, because right here for this committee is knowing discussion, the real part of the facade Okay, with the with this application, Now I think you at least you maintain the eight feet because you have right there down of the street.
I, don't know that you would see that much more greenery from the street First, to say that I was a little gnarly earlier and I really do appreciate your cutting back on your proposed extension and sticking with the space that you already have It's always noted and appreciated when an applicant does what the community board requests, but so I did want to apologize for my gnarliness and say that I appreciate it, but I'm looking at the resolution and all it says about the fence is a whereas clause, which is whereas the fence at the front of the house is made of black painted painted iron It, doesn't address any change in design.
Actually, it's a as you said, it's a revocable consent , don't normally get into design when it comes to that and it's been obviously before our landmarks committee, because I've heard a member of the board seriously questioning the design- and I don't know how much weight that should carry with me in terms of approving voting on the application.
We proposed a three foot extension which was built, so we needed two extra stairs and if we had done that, we would have been hitting the front door and also now we have a three foot, eight inch landing, which is more appropriate to have a landing at the bottom of the stairs, and that was the request to landmarks and to DOB An approval of you never got a revocable consent from dot before He was on the line before, for whatever reason, for whatever reason he at dob and landmarks, they said it was not necessary to go back, but obviously it was, and therefore my team screwed up jimmy So in 2016, we filed the application at the DOB to do renovation work.
We did get the landmark approval for an enlarged area and we got DOB approval, but somewhere along the way we didn't catch it and the DOB didn't catch that there needed to be a DOT revocable consent What you're trying to do is essentially legalize The, three foot extension pass, the property line into the sidewalk area.
I think allen did a great job, n't you're, not seeing the facade and that's not what's before you, but they renovated the facade and I know when this came before the landmarks commission They originally wanted to come out six feet, and we indicated that, even though that wouldn't be as far as the neighbor to the east, it would be much further for the neighbor to the west, and so the compromise that was reached was a three-foot extension which we could live with and which we saw the need for it's really The minimum need the minimum to satisfy their need to have a safe landing space and reasonable reasonably sized steps We also think so we're very happy with this application.
It was very unsafe, so whether we lowered the floor or not, the existing condition was very dangerous, and so now because our city agencies are not working together, well, This work was completed without one necessary set of approvals, and it sounds like I, don't know, will if we have any history of what of this came to the community board at the time in 2016.
, it's very hard to have members of the community board or and even the staff you know we react to applications when they come from agencies would be asking the members of the landmarks committee to somehow say: well, Have they gotten the revocable consent when that's not something that the landmarks committee folks are very cognizant of.
, when this family bought the project, they said, we have a 1 foot, 10 landing it's untenable and let's try to make an application to expand the area way I wouldn't feel safe with a one foot, ten landing so you're saying that this original one foot ten landing was original to the 100 year old building.
We were told by DOB that we did not have to go back to community board, so that was I kept asking So. If everyone wants to blame me, I will take full responsibility, but there was no other way to create a safe landing, regardless of which direction the stair was or if we turned it and did a landing We've got so many compliments from people like lo and the neighbors how this building was an albatross on the street, and we worked very hard with landmarks to improve the quality of the street The area way.
I really think that we need to vote to disapprove this, even though it's already been built, and then we need to send a letter to the DOB with copies of this correspondence, alerting them to the fact that they are approving things that they should not be approving without our approval, and we should be very strong in this and I- don't want to take up any more time, but this can happen again and once we, and once this is of record, which now everyone's going to know about it, they're going to try to do it again, not this particular architect.
The only one It happened right now in landmarks The other day there is another application is exactly the same that almost after they finish the job they came to us, so regrettably, that become a parent not only in the in the in this committee, but also in landmarks, The issue of the rice, jordan, in the application before that this one, but he's right when they said what we're talking about static stories for transportation, What is design and history should deal with landmarks and that's in the way that should be handled these applications, so the there in this case it should be first go back to landmarks, landmark, has to have a position and then come back to our transportation, because otherwise we're encroaching and we're confusing, especially those members of transportation that probably they have no much skills in the history of landmarks So. My bottom line right here is I.
Don't have a problem to allow this three feet of extension, because I'm, a professional too and to go and demolish They- do knowing crotch more than the existing adjacent property that already encroached the sidewalk Okay I just want to clarify that we did get the enlarged front yard approved by landmarks, and we went to a landmarks committee for the community board for the enlarged front yard and we and we got the landmarks permits and the deal you approved it with a landmark permit.
Okay, because I support what valerie said: I'm really troubled by forgetfulness on the part of applicants that they don't know or don't realize that they need to come before the community board or they need to go before the board before going to city agencies.
So I just can't support this on principle that I know it was built and it looks like it's a lovely job but I see a second doorway to the right and it's hard to imagine that with some creativity, an architect could not have figured out how to do this and yes, it would have obviously caused some expense I, just I'm troubled by the fact that I was not recognized by anybody and the landmarks committee, because I looked at the resolution disapproved the original extension into the sidewalk It was the previously desired six feet.
You said you know what are the consequences and it had to do with zoning and marvin probably remembers the famous 96th street 12 stories, where you know an architect made a mistake in reading the zoning map and the park improvement district But, then the department of transportation has the same, has to make the decision I think it's highly unlikely that the department of transportation would say we're not going to give you a revocable consent, because then it would be illegal and theoretically , He may know some other cases where someone done something that you I made pay money and legalize it or whatever.
In that case, marvin I apologize I'm having a lot of connection problems, so I hear just about every third of every other word right, but to chuck's point I do recall that the mistakes that were made- and they were made- certainly by the architect, certainly by the expedited certain DOB and the last committee and a whole bunch of other people, but that should not So I, think it behooves the board to look at what our application is and whether it's an appropriate application, the use of their vocal consent or not and voted on that basis.
This is an issue of dot, and this no is not an issue of uv, because it's outside of the lot line and dot is more likely going to approve now seeing in the way that law described , I think they did a very good job Is there, a second there The motion is to to disapprove Well.
Three: okay, we'll pass on that resolution to the DOT Number three is a request to change the parking regulations on east 72nd, street east of york, avenue and craig We put it on the agenda because someone wrote in about it, but is that person here?
The challenge is that, at least from my perspective, looking at how we can achieve an outcome that would improve safety and allow for vehicles to not to be able to make the turnaround actually see what the what the parking regulations are, but in the cul-de-sac itself, up until a certain point is no standing and on the other side let me just go back and check Why. Next month and see if we can get them to come in because normally when we have a situation in the you know, people ask us to do something: That would address and rectify the situation.
We asked to put this on the agenda because some of the board members had talked about this and had come up in other contexts about parking and things like that, and this is the prevalence of illegal and counterfeit placards and impacts on safety, resulting from placard packing and parking in those standing zones and stuff, and that came up from some of the issues that we have chuck before we go there Go ahead, just for a second I You tell me I.
If you can go by people go by the issue and it's almost impossible for residents to even just pull up in front, because it's obviously not a through street and people are just using it to hang out as a depot, So the block is trying to get some control over what's happening in that circle, because it's just making it You know they cannot get people can't pick up in front of these Doctors offices and residents can't even pick up in front of their buildings because it's being used and nobody is coming down there to enforce the regulations because peop, because the drivers are sitting in their cars, idling, etc, and they just move one block over The placard.
But it's really the mayor's office that has to get control over this because placards are issued by any number of different agencies, but I'll throw open the floor to people who want to discuss this I , don't know if there are any members of the public that want to talk about this issue.
If you're a member of the public would like to speak about this issue, and let me just while we wait for anyone to possibly raise the hand just mention that in march of 2019 we did pass a resolution related to park and placard reform.
7 am 7 pm monday through saturday, with sunday parking allowed They changed that to no standing, no stopping rather and made it a full bike lane with a bike lane a buffer zone with pylons going along the street I believe the mayor's initiative in regard to obviously bike safety and moving people through the city more easily during the coca-19 epidemic pandemic.
Let me know if I'm going on about something that we're going to be covering otherwise, because I really do want to address the issues that have developed since the installation of the bike lanes on 61st and 62nd street, or more so specifically, 61st street, because that's where we're going to talk we're going Just to say that I think we, you know, given the expectation of increasing number of car trips in the city, we should be doing whatever we can as a community to try and discourage unnecessary trips, and so the more we can limit placards the better.
There's a couple of hot spots around where I live on second avenue at 91st street on 90th street there's often placard plaque, you know not real placarded vehicles and then there are real placards often used on east end avenue in front of car shows park, but they're and I really hope that you can pass a new resolution to do this No further anything from the public.
I mean people don't want to ride the subway they're afraid to take a bus, and so, if you have access to a car in any way, you're driving and I, just I am shocked and appalled by the traffic that has come back just in the last You know few months and when school starts, you know it's going to be another problem, but this is what I wanted to ask when we passed the resolution.
This was supposed to be implemented at the end of at the end of july, and here we are in early september Is there anything else or we can go to the public I think we should go to the public and try to answer any questions that they may have I, see judy schneider first here , judy I thought these bike lanes were to help people coming over the 59th street bridge going directly across to central park, so I assumed that the bike lanes on six one and six two would start at second avenue The flyer for the project did note that it was from york avenue to fifth avenue and the response that I was just reading.
So I just wanted to raise to the to this committee that cd7 on the west, side- just I, think it was yesterday or the day before passed, overwhelming vote for a resolution for a two-way protected bike lane on 72nd street and to keep in line with what this committee has done earlier in the year to ask for a cross-agency study or cross-agency group to work on river to river bike lanes that work from east river.
We'll probably put that on the agenda for next month, So I want to say it's report that everyone you know concerned bicycles, I'm, full delivery for myself, So I understand he's concerned, but they have also keep on people rolling up on the sidewalk, also because they'd be going to a building.
That is on the sidewalk and, like I, said: I can't relate to people, because even some bicyclists next to me, sometimes dude I, have to yelling at me, but you're on the street, and sometimes you know honestly I heard that and say my business, because I'm going to the present so I mean I.
