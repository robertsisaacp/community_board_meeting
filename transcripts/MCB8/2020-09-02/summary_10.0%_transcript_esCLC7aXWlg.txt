Let you guys, okay, welcome everyone meeting of the transportation committee of community board, eight, my co-chair chuck warren and my other co-chairs craig Don't we get to the agenda?
The first item on the agenda is something that we back for reconsideration:: a revocable consent application for proposed fenced in area, including steps planters, together with the snow melt system in front of 106 east 78th, street.
So this application is to modify an existing area way, which is at 106 east 78th street between Lexington and park avenue on the south side of the street.
This is a property just east of 875 park avenue and next to it are two identical townhouses built by the same family in the late 1860s, and so each of these townhouses has an area away in front of them and, as do other properties, down the block on the south side of the street.
This block has extended area ways that go past the property line on both sides of the street, our clearance being eight feet.
We're proposing to expand the green space of this area away, as well as modifying the fence, aesthetic itself and finally, as was previously approved by the community board at our last hearing.
I'm just wondering why you're not why the applicant is not coming back to landmarks over the fence and the planters that are in the area way, particularly because the fence is extending.
I meant to come back before the cb8 landmarks, committee, about the fence and the planters, and I know this isn't transportation issue chuck, but as long as the applicant is here and raising these issues, Oh, because the defense designed it did not change and they had already approved the fence at the cb8 hearing, they didn't approve this fence.
Think I understand why if the applicant isn't available, what is the backup for making sure the boiler is on and that the temperature sensor is set and that kind of thing there's a full-time caretaker for the townhouse who takes care of all of this anyway.
What's in front, is the fence and, I'm asking these questions, because you did the right thing, because right here for this committee is knowing discussion, the real part of the facade.
Have the school, And I think it makes a lot of sense, and since you also said that defense, we discussed in a landmark committee, so I don't have no problem with this application.
Is that, since we turned down the application about the extension, I think we probably did it in two parts, so we voted affirmatively for the snowmelt and since we voted down the application for the extension, I assume that the fence was in that you know in that part of the resolution, and maybe that's why neither she nor I are remembering specifically discussing this fence, because I don't And, you know and having the smaller fence in the middle.
We, don't normally get into design when it comes to that It's been obviously before our landmarks committee, because I've heard a member of the board seriously questioning the design- And I, don't know how much weight that should carry with me in terms of approving voting on the application.
An approval of you never got a revocable consent from D.O.T before He was on the line before, for whatever reason, for whatever reason he at d.o.b and landmarks, they said it was not necessary to go back, but obviously it was, and therefore my team screwed up jimmy.
We did get the landmark approval for an enlarged area and we got DOB approval, but somewhere along the way we didn't catch it And the DOB didn't catch that there needed to be a DOT, revocable, consent.
Sort of like this is how the direction we had to go to make it accessible, not a dangerous situation, and so that the new stairs did not hit the front door and have no landing Why don't we see if there's any members of the public that have any comments on this application?
You're, not seeing the facade and that's not what's before you, but they renovated the facade, and I know when this came before the landmarks commission.- They originally wanted to come out six feet and we indicated that, even though that wouldn't be as far as the neighbor to the east.
It's very hard to have members of the community board or, and even the staff You know we react to applications when they come from agencies.
This has never come up where an applicant with an architect did not know that they needed to get consent.
I'm, really stunned that an applicant with an architect would have missed this, that they needed to do this, and so I'll raise my hand again, but I'm with you on taking this opportunity, because this is not the case where a homeowner got up on a sunday and decided to paint their facade of a landmark house or in a historic district and didn't realize.
This is moving something into the public way and the landmarks committee did disapprove the original iteration, where they intended to go out.
They said we have a 1, foot, 10 landing, it's untenable and let's try to make an application to expand the area.
Yes, every architect that well myself and six staff members, three who are licensed, look for other ways and to do what you're suggesting would be a side landing and steps going down on the right angle.
You know they need to be more proactive in making sure that we get these approvals, because I don't think, even though it makes the block more beautiful.
If, that is the truth, yes, I will support the application, but when you are coming with different history or different scenarios, that I think made me feel a little bit uncomfortable and by the way you are not.
Okay, because I support what valerie, said, I'm really troubled by forgetfulness on the part of applicants that they don't know or don't realize that they need to come before the community board or they need to go before the board before going to city agencies.
I, just I'm troubled by the fact that I was not recognized by anybody and the landmarks committee, because I looked at the resolution, disapproved the original extension into the sidewalk.
I wanted to understand what the consequences are of voting no on the revocable consent and then my second question is: How do we make sure that this sort of issue doesn't happen again to the point that elita and others have raised?
Certainly, don't remember, and the other thing is You said you know what are the consequences And it had to do with zoning and marvin Probably remembers the famous 96th street 12 stories, where you know an architect made a mistake in reading the zoning map and the park improvement district But, then the department of transportation has the same, has to make the decision.
I think it's highly unlikely that the department of transportation would say we're not going to give you a revocable consent, because then it would be illegal and theoretically , He may know some other cases where someone done something that you I made pay money and legalize it or whatever.
I, don't think, is appropriate and fair, and I would ask the board members to consider that and look at the application itself, no matter how and not how it got to you.
We don't have those emails, but typically what I have is at the beginning of the project, the examiner issues, All, the things you need for approval, the objection sheet and the DOT revocable consent was not there, but there are no emails.
Well, let's put it in the affirmative, and people can vote the way they want.
I, think just it just doesn't really pass the smell test, and even if we vote yes, I, don't really know what that does.
Number three is a request to change the parking regulations on east 72nd street east of york, avenue and craig We put it on the agenda because someone wrote in about it, but is that person here?
Next month and see if we can get them to come in because normally, when we have a situation in the you know, people ask us to do.
We asked to put this on the agenda because some of the board members had talked about this and had come up in other contexts about parking and things like that, and this is the prevalence of illegal and counterfeit placards and impacts on safety, resulting from placard packing and parking in those standing zones and stuff, and that came up from some of the issues that we have chuck before we go there.
But it's really the mayor's office that has to get control over this, because placards are issued by any number of different agencies, but I'll throw open the floor to people who want to discuss this.
I, don't know if there are any members of the public that want to talk about this issue, just a reminder, it's star nine times.
You know on our block on 62nd street and 19th precinct can give you 20 blocks where there are vehicles with md plates that will sit for weeks and months on end without receiving tickets and that ticketing officers will not ticket them, because they're, md, plates, and I think that's something that needs to be addressed.
Think You also have this issue with md doctor plates, that are, you know, not being ticketed and taking up a lot of spaces throughout the city.
I'm actually just following up on what julianne brittany was speaking about in regards to the placards, so I'm resident of lifelong resident of 61st street between 2nd and 3rd avenue, and we have now developed a new issue.
I have my 85 year old, mother here, and so there is something where I've seen how the traffic patterns in this neighborhood have changed because of the 59th street bridge and second avenue, and how it's all developed placards have been an issue because they cut off a lane across the street from us.
Let me know if I'm going on about something that we're going to be covering, otherwise, because I really do want to address the issues that have developed since the installation of the bike lanes on 61st and 62nd street, or, more so specifically, 61st street, because that's where we're going to talk we're going.
Just to say that I think we you know, given the expectation of increasing number of car trips in the city, we should be doing whatever we can as a community to try and discourage unnecessary trips, and so the more we can limit placards the better As the previous speaker rightly pointed, out, the you know, the traffic enforcement agents- often don't enforce So the more it can be automated the better they've done it with white bus lanes.
I. Don't know if the parking agents have the the machine that reads them or not, but the point is that there is a way to do this with technology, and I am appalled by the number of fake placards that I see all over the place.
Think that the major or one of the major issues is that you know because of Covid-19 19 everybody who has access to a car is coming into the city.
You know few months and when school starts, you know it's going to be another problem, but this is what I wanted to ask when we passed the resolution.
I. Remember that there was a part of it that was going to go to each department that issued the parking permits and to say and to give a specific list of the people who got them and the reason why they needed them.
We could formulate a resolution that makes sense, because we did that last year, supporting these specific legislative efforts, but I think we could probably do something more and different once we know exactly where we are, and so I'd like to I'll just add, I did find the article that I was alluding to back just in July the announcement that the mayor essentially cut the funding 5.4 million dollars dedicated to the NYPD unit that was dedicated to stopping placard, abuse.
I think there doesn't need to be a way that people, the traffic control agents, can just with their phone detect.
Then we asked in July D.O.T committed to allowing restaurants to provide outdoor seating, all along 61st and 62nd street, and the flyer that the ot put out promoting the new temporary bike lane indicates that the project will quote change parking regulations as needed to accommodate bike lanes and provide curb access.
I thought these bike lanes were to help people coming over the 59th street bridge, going directly across to central park, so I assumed that the bike lanes on six one and six two would start at second avenue.
When I asked about the 30 foot versus 34, 34-foot Can I ask if anyone present knows whether they've put in the bike lane, let's say between second and first on 61st or 62nd street All across 61st street, from york avenue to fifth avenue.
So I think when it comes to the permanent bike lanes, then you know, hopefully more people will be back and we'll be able to get a fuller dialogue on it.
Sorry, if I just add one thing just then fundamentally, if the DOT would just approach the idea of removing the commercial meters and muni meter from across the street and make it what it always was in the past before the minors, trucks, unloading and loading, then it would at least grant us access granted again for me to put my mother in the car A bicycle lane, which we all know now has become not easy, especially with the use of e-bikes.
Not only do we have to dodge right off the curb, e-bikes and bicycles, but then a lane of traffic to get in a car, I'm even willing to do that, but then remove the muni meters from across the street so that we can actually have some place.
And, I think, there's a lot of pieces that haven't been thought out well and unfortunately, we're already seeing the impact not only in traffic, but Once we have an east river greenway that actually is functioning and has a sound pavement, then a lot of bikes do come down the greenway It's helpful to have access across all the way down to the east river.
I actually wanted to raise something slightly different, but because we're in new business and we're talking about bike lanes, No peter we're talking only about this issue.
Just think you know once again, I mean it's already, not working, and how long does it have to be temporary before they come in and look at it?
Think people will get a chance to weigh in on this michelle I'm, going to just make very quick comments, but with respect to item three east 72nd street in that east of york, is the majority of medical buildings and medical offices.
You know, take up the issue of having the city pass, something because the state law came to legalize these things and scooters and stuff, like that.
Think we need to, in this environment, hold their feet to the fire a little bit here, whether it's the fact that they're giving revocable consent without consulting with us or you know, putting in bike lanes and not getting feedback.
