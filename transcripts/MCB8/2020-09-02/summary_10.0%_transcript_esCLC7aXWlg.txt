A, revocable, consent, application for proposed fenced in area, including steps planters, together with the snow melt system in front of 106 East 78th street.
So this application is to modify an existing area way, which is at 106, east 78th street between Lexington and Park Avenue on the south side of the street.
This is a property just east of 875 park, Avenue and next to it are two identical townhouses built by the same family in the late 1860s, and so each of these townhouses has an area away in front of them and, as do other properties, down the block on the south side of the street.
This block has extended area ways that go past the property line on both sides of the street, our clearance being eight feet.
So it would create a clear landing acrosss, the two front doors of the townhouse, which are sunken below the sidewalk by three feet: there's an existing planter, which is not built into the sidewalk on inside of the fenced in area.
We're proposing to expand the green space of this area away, as well as modifying the fence, aesthetic itself and finally, as was previously approved by the Community board.
I'm just wondering why you're not why the applicant is not coming back to landmarks over the fence and the planters that are in the area way, particularly because the fence is extending.
I meant to come back before the CB8 Landmarks committee, about the fence and the planters, and I know.
Think I understand why if the applicant is not available, what is the backup for making sure the boiler is on and that the temperature sensor is set and that kind of thing there's a full- time caretaker for the townhouse who takes care of all of this anyway?
What's in front, is the fence and, I'm asking these questions, because you did the right thing, because right here for this committee is knowing discussion, the real part of the facade.
Have the school, And I think it makes a lot of sense, and since you also said that defense, we discussed in a Landmark committee, so I do not have no problem with this application.
Is that, since we turned down the application about the extension, I think we probably did it in two parts, so we voted affirmatively for the snowmelt and since we voted down the application for the extension, I assume that the fence was in that you know in that part of the resolution, and maybe that's why neither she nor I are remembering specifically discussing this fence, because I do not And you know and having the smaller fence in the middle.
I. Do not know that you would see that much more greenery from the street and At any event, I think it's a very 13 plus feet of fencing.
We do not normally get into design when it comes to that It's been obviously before our landmarks committee, because I've heard a member of the board seriously questioning the design, and I do not know how much weight that should carry with me in terms of approving voting on the application.
There, were subsequent discussions with Lowe and me, and we took an advisement his recommendations and when we showed up at landmarks we proposed instead of a six foot extension, we proposed a three foot extension, which was built So. We needed two extra stairs and if we had done that, we would have been hitting the front door and also now we have a three foot, eight inch landing, which is more appropriate to have a landing at the bottom of the stairs, and that was the request to landmarks and to DOB, and I also did have a couple discussions with Lo, and this was what was approved and built four years.
An approval of you never got a revocable consent from D.O.T before He was on the line before, for whatever reason, for whatever reason he at D.O.B and landmarks, they said it was not necessary to go back, but obviously it was and therefore my team screwed up Jimmy.
Sort of like this is how the direction we had to go to make it accessible, not a dangerous situation, and so that the new stairs did not hit the front door and have no landing Why do not we see if there's any members of the public that have any comments on this application?
Well, This work was completed without one necessary set of approvals, and it sounds like I do not know will if we have any history of what of this came to the community board at the time in 2016.
This has never come up where an applicant with an architect did not know that they needed to get consent.
I'm, really stunned that an applicant with an architect would have missed this, that they needed to do this, and so I'll raise my hand again, but I'm with you on taking this opportunity, because this is not the case where a homeowner got up on a sunday and decided to paint their facade of a landmark house or in a historic district and did not realize it.
They said we have a 1, foot, 10 landing, it's untenable and let's try to make an application to expand the area.
Yes, every architect that well myself and six staff members, three who are licensed, look for other ways and to do what you're suggesting would be a side landing and steps going down on the right angle.
Sorry that I was told otherwise by the DOB We've got so many compliments from people like Lo and the neighbors how this building was an albatross on the street, and we worked very hard with landmarks to improve the quality of the street.
I hear I think it's Alan Berman, saying that he has correspondence from the DOB, basically telling him that he did not need to come back to us.
I really think that we need to vote to disapprove this, even though it's already been built, and then we need to send a letter to the DOB with copies of this correspondence, alerting them to the fact that they are approving things that they should not be approving without our approval, and we should be very strong in this, and I do not want to take up any more time, but this can happen again and once We, and once this is of record, which now everyone's going to know about it, they're, going to try to do it.
You know they need to be more proactive in making sure that we get these approvals, because I do not think, even though it makes the block more beautiful.
If, that is the truth, yes, I will support the application, but when you are coming with different history or different scenarios, that I think made me feel a little bit uncomfortable and by the way you are not.
Okay, because I support what Valerie, said, I'm really troubled by forgetfulness on the part of applicants that they do not know or do not realize that they need to come before the Community board or they need to go before the board before going to city agencies.
I, just I'm troubled by the fact that I was not recognized by anybody and the Landmarks Committee, because I looked at the resolution disapproved the original extension into the sidewalk.
I wanted to understand what the consequences are of voting no on the revocable consent and then my second question is: How do we make sure that this sort of issue does not happen again to the point that elita and others have raised?
You aware you need a revocable consent, that's going to have to be one of the things probably written in at landmarks, and I.
The famous 96th street 12 stories, where you know an architect made a mistake in reading the zoning map and the Park Improvement district So I do not believe that the department of training we could recommend against it.
I think it's highly unlikely that the Department of transportation would say we're not going to give you a revocable consent, because then it would be illegal and theoretically , He may know some other cases where someone done something that you I made pay money and legalize it or whatever.
I do not think is appropriate and fair, and I would ask the board members to consider that and look at the application itself, no matter how and not how it got to you.
I believe that a representative of the applicant said that there exists emails from the DOB saying affirmatively that the applicant did not need to get the revocable consent.
We do not have those emails, but typically what I have is at the beginning of the project, the examiner issues, all the things you need for approval, the objection sheet and the DOT revocable consent was not there, but there are no emails.
He did note the enlarged side, the enlarged front yard, but I think the examiner and me we wrongly assumed that the landmarks approval for enlarged front yard is enough, and The original objection sheet where the DOT require consent was not required.
Well, let's put it in the affirmative, and people can vote the way they want.
I think just it just does not really pass the smell test and even if we vote yes, I do not really know what that does.
Number three is a request to change the parking regulations on East, 72Nd, Street, East of York, Avenue and Craig I know we put it on the agenda because someone wrote in about it, but is that person here?
We asked to put this on the agenda because some of the board members had talked about this and had come up in other contexts about parking and things like that, and this is the prevalence of illegal and counterfeit placards and impacts on safety, resulting from placard packing and parking in those standing zones and stuff, and that came up from some of the issues that we have chuck before we go there.
I do not know if there are any members of the public that want to talk about this issue.
You know, on our block on 62nd street and 19th precinct, can give you 20 blocks where there are vehicles with Md plates that will sit for weeks and months on end without receiving tickets and that ticketing officers will not ticket them, because they're, Md, plates, and I think that's something that needs to be addressed.
Think You also have this issue with Md doctor plates that are, you know, not being ticketed and taking up a lot of spaces throughout the city.
I'm actually just following up on what Julianne Brittany was speaking about in regards to the placards, so I'm resident of lifelong resident of 61st street between 2nd and 3Rd Avenue, and we have now developed a new issue.
I have my 85 year old, mother here, and so there is something where I've seen how the traffic patterns in this neighborhood have changed because of the 59th , Street, Bridge and Second avenue, and how it's all developed placards have been an issue because they cut off a lane.
Let me know if I'm going on about something that we're going to be covering, otherwise, because I really do want to address the issues that have developed since the installation of the bike lanes on 61st and 62nd street, or, more so specifically, 61st street, because that's where we're going to talk we're going.
Just to say that I think we you know, given the expectation of increasing number of car trips in the city, we should be doing whatever we can as a community to try and discourage unnecessary trips, and so the more we can limit.
Think that the major or one of the major issues is that you know, because of Covid-19 everybody who has access to a car, is coming into the city.
I mean people do not want to ride the subway they're afraid to take a bus, and If you have access to a car in any way, you're driving and you're, bringing it into the city- And I, just I am shocked and appalled by the traffic that has come back just in the last.
Response is required to respond to complaints about a city vehicle blocking Bike, Lanes, Bus, Lanes, Et cetera, and then there was the new standardized application process managed by DOT for city- wide city issued parking permits, and there were other related pieces of legislation as well that were passed as well.
I. Remember that there was a part of it that was going to go to each department that issued the parking permits and to say and to give a specific list of the people who got them and the reason why they needed them.
We could formulate a resolution that makes sense, because we did that last year, supporting these specific legislative efforts, but I think we could probably do something more and different once we know exactly where we are, and so I'd like to I'll just add, I did find the article that I was alluding to back just in July the announcement that the mayor essentially cut the funding 5.4 million dollars dedicated to the NYPD unit that was dedicated to stopping placard, abuse.
I think there does not need to be a way that people, the traffic control agents can just with their phone detect.
You know temporary bike lane issues because we've had some.
Then we asked in July D.O.T committed to allowing restaurants to provide outdoor seating, all along 61st and 62nd street, and the flyer that the ot put out promoting the new temporary bike lane indicates that the project will quote change parking regulations as needed to accommodate bike lanes and provide curb access.
We asked how exactly is bike lane going to be configured to not interfere with the outdoor seating that is currently being provided by these restaurants and DOT responded that they have developed, And, yeah they've developed designs to accommodate existing roadway seating for open restaurants that are similar to treatments around construction.
We asked what type of parking regulation changes are going to be made for these temporary lanes.
I, see Judy Schneider first here I thought these bike lanes were to help people coming over the 59th street bridge, going directly acrosss to Central Park , so I assumed that the bike lanes on six one and six two would start at second Avenue.
Can I ask if anyone present knows whether they've put in the bike lane , let's say between second and first on 61st or 62nd street So basically the signage has changed all acrosss 61st street from York Avenue to Fifth Avenue.
I was not prepared for this meeting, so I do not have them to be able to show to you to share right now, but what they did from Lexington avenue to Fifth Avenue was make it seven feet wide, which then allows should the parking on the south side of the street be filled cars and trucks to unload without invading the actual bicycle lane on the north side.
We can't park or stop on second avenue, as you all well know, because of the bridge.
So I think when it comes to the permanent bike lanes, then you know, hopefully more people will be back and we'll be able to get a fuller dialogue on it.
If the DOT would just approach the idea of removing the commercial meters and muni meter from acrosss the street and make it what it always was in the past, before the mirrors, trucks, unloading and loading, then it would at least grant us access granted again for me to put my mother in the car A bicycle lane, which we all know now has become not easy, especially with the use of e-.
Pedestrians unsafely trying to get through second avenue, because already 61st street, going acrosss from East to West was already backed up onto second avenue and that one lane on a as somebody else here spoke.
I actually wanted to raise something slightly different, but because we're in new business and we're talking about bike lanes, No peter we're talking only about this issue.
You know that back on other bike lanes, when you ask for new business, then, okay.
You know once again, The DOT I mean it's already, not working, and how long does it have to be temporary before they come in and look at it?
All issue hinges: on: Does the conversion of that space to a public, plaza, implicate, city, responsibility for the underlying street?
You know, take up the issue of having the city pass, something because the state law came to legalize these things and scooters and stuff like that.
Think we need to, in this environment, hold their feet to the fire a little bit here, whether it's the fact that they're giving revocable consent without consulting with us or you know, putting in bike lanes and not getting feedback.
