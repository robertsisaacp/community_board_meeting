27Th is the last day to apply online for your absentee ballot, but you can apply for it in person through November 2nd.
Even though you've requested an absentee ballot, you still have the option of voting in person.
If you vote in person, they will not count your absentee ballot.
Well, let's say: you're they're, not sure if your signature is the same as when you registered or you forgot to seal it or if you are voting with a mark and They will try three times by phone to notify you that your ballot has a defect and it can be, and it can be corrected.
I do can tell you that there are long lines at the at the early voting sites, but you can just go in and drop off your ballot.
