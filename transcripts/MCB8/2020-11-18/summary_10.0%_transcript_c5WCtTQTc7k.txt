All, you, millions of people to the zoning and Development committee meeting for November for community board, eight.
I'm going to run through some slides that talk about the blood center and some of our accomplishments and some of the things that have happened during Covid-19, as well as the plan for a new building on our site, which is why we're here and we have a number of people from our team and as well as some of the experts in zoning and the architects to help me present.
I'm, Councilmember, Ben, Kaylos and I will have a vote on this project as it goes through the Euler process, I, from what I've seen so far, I have a concern, some concerns about what we'll see tonight and particularly its impact on St Catherine's, park.
Now, all right next I'll just say next: slide, not a problem at all next slide, so you know we're a not-for-profit community-based blood center serving originally Manhattan in 1960 and then all the way into the boroughs and then the tri-state area.
Driven not-for-profit and this whole project is really a public private partnership, and you know we have in the red circle innovating new treatments, taking care of people in the right making new products and impacting global health, and in fact we serve almost every state in the United States, with blood or research projects or specialty laboratories.
The first stem cell product ever licensed by the FDA, you think, would come from some fancy university like Harvard, but it came from New York, Blood Center, so we're very proud of the accomplishments.
Every day, New York, Blood Center collects about 4,000 units of blood, serves about 75 million people, advances research, but in addition many people don't know that we support several growth.
We need to replace and modernize our facilities, which is why we're coming to explain and to ask for your input and to explain the project and to show you we do translate basis basic science discovery into new cures.
The concept here, is that we put even more r d, more blood collection and more companies into this new building, and it would attract, allow us to attract a critical mass of talent and really help promote New York as a destination for the life sciences, industry and cultivating scientific collaboration with our community and fuel jobs, create jobs, fuel growth, create jobs, and so this bottom set of arrows is really what we do.
Next slide, and this slide was put into not only to show as I think everyone in the and the community board knows exactly where we are, but it would Jay rack.
Some of my relationships at Rockefeller are older than that, even though I've only been here 11 and a half years next slide, the the folks, our partners were so moved, essentially by us, trying to build a facility that would have more interaction, time and more research for them that we got a number of people reaching out to us saying you know we really want you to be where you are and be able to grow.
You know most of the positions we have in on the blood side, as well as many positions on the research side require only a high school degree and we've been working with a number of different degree, granting programs, universities and colleges to try and ensure we have a diverse and team-oriented workforce development project and program which we're very happy.
A lot of people were clear that you know this notion of creating jobs and economy in the local area doesn't always directly create those things for the community, but we are very strong community citizens and couldn't have a bigger heart for the whole of our community, as well as our borough, as well as our city.
I had asked that we really focus on the zoning and what ha you think you need to do what you've said.
Buildings are typically planned on a module, 11-foot module which allows for the right spacing around equipment and people, and also allows for flexibility as labs change over time, and then the laboratory space itself is often divided into this.
Okay, I'm, often Peter Shubert, here in Ed. We wanted to talk about the basic volume of the building and really its height in relationship to the surrounding neighborhood.
And I think it will be a very much a building that will be much more approachable and something that really makes science a part of the community.
The proposal is to move the 2 8 boundary north one block to 67th street the effect of making the non-conforming theaters on the western side of Second Avenue, conforming use and to remap the blood center into a 270 school district, which permits both institutional and commercial medical labs at higher FAR than are permitted.
Centers, and the proposed amendment would allow the city Planning Commission a special permit to authorize site-specific actions needed for the proposal, and that is a flexible mix of institutional and commercial uses where the permitted residence commercial area would exceed 2far.
I want to say, I appreciate the blood center, the work they've done and when Mr Hiller was talking about the intersection of those four things.
Second Avenue is off in a parking lot all the way, as everyone probably on this call knows to to the 59Th street bridge.
This humongous tower on a in a mid block where you have talk about traffic, you've got school buses and it's a street with a bus lane to try and put 20 an office building of this magnitude in in this neighborhood.
If they does grow to the size that they want it to just the numbers of cars and people coming up and down, 67th street will be really difficult to move up and down bringing in kids from all over the city.
I would like to remind people if they want to ask questions that they raise their hand and as we move forward, because the clock is ticking, I'm going to ask.
Yes, I'm, a long-term resident of the neighborhood and quite live close by to the blood center, which I think very highly of, and does a great job.
In order to do that is an unfairing position on the community and changes the basic community facility, nature of the use to a commercial office building which is going to draw in large numbers of workers daily in an already congested location and make the living environment significantly.
So if you, if I bring more traffic onto 66th street you're, going to back all the way down the block to where my client's building is located and further so that there'll be no access or emergency access, as Mr Bell indicated also you've done, I saw the shadow survey.
Want to thank the blood center for the concerns they've expressed about the impact on the park over the years.
What's your question or concern good evening and thank you, Dr Schuler members of the blood center for your important achievements in advancing the science as we are at the cusp of great change.
We can not right now accommodate everybody whose hands have been raised, I'm, going to ask that if you have questions or concerns or want to voice your support or your opposition, that you email the board office and that is at info.
Their proposal doubled the existing floor area on the overall site, including the residential tower, and that it featured two buildings in excess of 500 feet, tall, the residential tower at park in 76, and the Lexington Avenue tower, which occupied the entire Lexington avenue block front between 76 and 77.
This chart basically talks about the zoning issues and compares the current revised proposal from Northwell Lennox Hill, with the existing building, which is on the top.
The existing far floor area ratio of the project is 7.5 and the building is 200 feet, high, as it says in the upper right, hand, corner of the slide and the proposed building is, as I said, 436 feet high and the far is 12.5, and so two things to note.
These are the buildings in the neighborhood right now that are over 210 feet high, and this next view, which is I, think important, is a very crude model, showing you what the 436 foot high building on Lexington looks like above the 210 foot plane and one of the things to notice.
The Uniform land use review process and will be will have to present its proposal to the community board, and does anyone have a question.
You know years ago, this community board, along with three brand new organizations, formed because of our concern about the growing density of our community and the friends of the Upper East side was represented at a meeting of the city planning and that was Helena.
We were trying to think about what we could do in advance to protect our neighborhood and our residential area, and we understood having that with this wonderful person from city planning.
We are being approached into these two proposals with undoing that I think that we owe the groups all of us who worked so hard looking in advance to try to protect the livability of our area.
Certainly the blood center has been a very important part of our area, they've, always lent their time to the community.
You know one day: I'd like to have a talk with some of the health people in terms of their talking about the effect on our health, residents, health in dense and overbuilt buildings and communities.
Also, a health problem, but I think that the other people who spoke, who said that they appreciated the blood center, wanted to see it develop in a sense that they need to have more space and to do something better with it, but certainly not to have a building put in mid-block with that with all of that.
I am just sorry that all the work, the community board and the different organizations that all work together to protect our mid-block zoning now looks in like it may not happen.
You know position of this firm and the fact that they've done one for the blood center which, by the way, I find very damning that the park is actually obscured in shadow for several hours in the afternoon, which is when the children get out of school and go to play.
No and I would actually go so far as to say that of the 25 people who voted, yes, I would venture to say they are probably mostly the blood center and the hired consultants who are appearing for them.
You know I feel like there is some level to project whether it's the architects or the developers in the area have perhaps been emboldened to pursue these types of plans at the Lenox Hill site and in other areas like the New York Blood Center in part, because our electeds are not making our positions.
Yeah go ahead, Anthony okay, effectively, rather than the initial proposal tore down everything on the site or more or less tore down everything on the block and built new hospital buildings, with the exception of a hundred by hundred foot lot at 76th and park, having removed that and removed that income stream from the project, northwell is now building just a brand new tower on Lexington that is more or less 180 feet square and 436.
So I asked the proposal to the blood center to please keep that in mind and do what you can to mitigate and to listen to the comments tonight and in the December meeting.
I have one question: Anthony did a fabulous job, everybody who comes, they only want to build larger.
You make a very good point that the need the anticipated need, certainly of this community for additional hospital space, seems dubious at best, and the problem is that this building, if it's built as currently proposed, will be with us for the rest of our grandchildren's lives, and there is nothing scarier than a bad building that is going to be there long after everyone.
I think the community would be completely supportive, but instead we have a very self-serving proposal to massively build up on a speculative level to completely obliterate.
Obviously, the slides went by really quickly, but knowing the size of the blood center lot I believe their proposed building is even larger in terms of the cube.
That is a huge loss to the community, and so you know, since this board, has come out and voted against the proposal that Lennox Hill made I hope that this board will act very similarly and vote against the proposal of the blood.
Don't mind, since the board doesn't have the benefit of being able to ask questions to the blood center itself and their representatives that there be a way for the members of the board to send questions to will who will or Elizabeth or Elaine who will then be able to submit them for the to the blood center for answers which will be posted on the website that we then I know the public was invited to do.
This applicant is requesting to change the mid block, contextual, unique district character, Rab, whose maximum building height is 75 feet, which provides light human skill and a sense of residential community, as it were a simple piece of paper throw to the garage as well as they are requesting to wave several zoning resolutions.
I think it was very disingenuous for the blood center to come forward and talk about how Covid-19 makes this life science center all the more needed.
You know to say that they have life, science, partners, they're, hoping to rent floors in a building, and we are right now in a situation in New, York City, and we can walk around everywhere and see empty storefronts.
79th and 80th I live across the street from six buildings that were emptied out on the corner of 72nd and 2Nd. I mean there are plenty of open spaces, as Michelle said that we don't even know, what's going to happen to them, for us to support a re-zoning so that the blood center can let space to who knows who, because when it becomes available, who knows.
It was also disingenuous, that we didn't see any financial information related to the blood center tonight, and we don't know where the money for this project is going to come.
I think we should a member of the public who has something would please send their question to the board and Board office info at Commun, cbadam.com.
I also think it's important that this presentation of the blood center be made to the entirety of cv8 at a land use meeting.
I would like to have them present to our committee to discuss transportation impacts, as they may not be as clear-cut as everyone thinks they are in terms of the modal splits and how people may arrive and being able to work with them to ensure that any deliveries take place during off hours and have a minimal impact on traffic congestion and air quality and quality of life.
Regarding both Lenox Hill and the blood center I think we need to project more of a sense of collaborative spirit and understand that the world changes and we need to be open to changes in order to allow institutions to flourish, even if it means there's a component that is for profit that allows for their critical life-saving missions in these cases to flourish.
I fear as a board and as a committee here, we're projecting a visceral intolerance as a community for development and zoning changes and expansion.
So, I, guess I'm, not just saying the current plans for Lennox Hill are acceptable yet, but as an example, but I want to at least give them a little credit for curtailing the most egregious elements of their proposal like the residential tower and that we could hopefully work with them and find ways to be able to get something that we as a community can be accepting of.
And, while the blood center project isn't perfect, rejecting out of hand because they are seeking a zoning change on a mid-block.
So, I say: Let's work to propose improve the proposal, address shadow impacts and see if we can be part of the planning that could benefit both the blood center and community and finally, I just want to respond in general to the broader discussion we've had tonight regarding zoning.
Variances are routinely granted across New York city for projects that are arguably much less critical to the economic vitality of a city or community, and I like to remind everyone that the zoning resolution is a living and dynamic document.
I. Ask that people submit their questions because I think the blood center had left and Northwell has been invited to this.
The blood center has not been very forthcoming with its materials, but by all means you, as co-chair of transportation, should certainly invite them and any other entity that you feel deserves to have comments and questions from the board and the public and with inquiries that you would like to make absolutely with respect to Northwell.
Certain things are desirable to have in communities, but when you think about the bulk of these buildings and the impact on the quality of life in the residential community that surrounds them, it's not as simple.
Okay, a leader I, just wanted to say, Lenox Northwell, had promised that after the task force meeting, they would come to the community board in the committee they refused to come.
I. You know how long it's taken us, the blood center ambushed us by not coming to us and the fact that they're as far along as they are in their application, with not considering coming to the community board, is a disrespect, and so I wanted to say why I held out the board speaking about the blood center as I was hoping.
Many committee members have said so I'll stop here and thank you because they were asked only to present on zoning.
Think if an institution pro proposes something that is extremely damaging to the community by definition, because it's so far out of the law, if I were an institution, I, would stop talking about zoning, because that's where I lose.
I was really surprised that the blood center had not engaged with J wreck, and it was a little painful for me to hear that J wreck had to go through a public comment session at a community board meeting to get a hold of them and to express and to first view, their presentation.
We think how the I think the most effective thing that has been done this evening is that I'm sure that there's somebody from the Lenox Hill hospital listening in on this, and certainly the blood center, is aware.
We go to Sherry Weiner, yes, hi I want to concur with what Elizabeth said, I think.
You want a zoning and development to pass a resolution tonight or what is your thoughts.
So I, don't know what Elaine thinks about this, whether you prefer a letter and to whom or a resolution.
I also think that we're in a time crunch, because if we do the resolution tonight, it really should go to the full board tomorrow, night.
They somebody wants to propose a resolution on the blood center.
Perhaps you need to take a consensus of the board members on the call and see what direction we want the letter to be in.
I think we need to know, okay, how the board members feel so your letter.
So, yes, means you want your letter to support the blood center and no means you're.
You take some input from me that what we're looking at now is not any programming, but the zoning issues related to the site that the blood center wants to redevelop.
Okay, no, because they're in they're having a scoping, session, December, 15th, so they're much further ahead in the process than Northwell, because after the scoping center excuse me session, they will be responding and doing the Eas. For it's clear to all the board members I know, some of them are pretty new to the process.
I think we're trying to combine a letter saying that we're opposed to the project.
Thank you for very dynamic and robust discussion, I'm in favor of a letter, but does not state that board is opposed, because this item actually belongs in the zone in the land use committee where the full boards are engaged and I would then probably encourage a letter to say we have concerns regarding the presentation.
We need to let the public know when that is going to be, because I think you know the biggest question that I have heard from members of the public over the past week.
After, this very full presentation and with respect to the attendance that was here tonight as Elizabeth rose, said, I, think we have to come up with something stronger than a letter.
I. Don't think we can say that we disapprove of it, but we can certainly say in a letter that we are in opposition to the plans as presented and to me if you say that we would invite them back to a land use meeting and then have another presentation.
That's what I would suggest and I think it could be worded in a way that the board's not taking a position, but our concerns are clear and I'm happy to write that, if that's acceptable to Elizabeth Inouye.
Having addressed the concerns that the community and the board members have raised so I think that would be the ideal situation.
But I- think the priority in terms of the the letter and kind of what we're doing now should be to try and get them essentially to engage with us in a constructive way that actually addresses the various things that folks have said.
The purpose of this that we don't like not that we don't like, but that we are questioning the usage of R8B, the zoning for R8B for how they plan to use it, so that that's what we want to have explained as to why they need this, and.
I have a million questions about the project, but my questions are not going to address the fact that this is like a 30-story building on a side, street.
I think as Elaine or Elizabeth pointed out that our resolutions are not always taken very seriously by the city and that's a bit of an understatement.
Since we have people in support, since it seems that everyone is in support of the letter, I think it would be more effective than having a split vote on a resolution and enough people have said that they are concerned about a resolution at this point that they don't know enough, and even if there is a failure to comply with the zoning rules as written right now, there are people who have expressed other points of view.
But I would also add to the letter that the blood center has not engaged with the community to this point and indicate that we have not had an opportunity to discuss, concerns or hear from them in a fuller manner and and be strong in language, about that.
By the time we get to the full board, voting on Euler people ought to have seriously considered what they're doing, but just my opinion, I think.
If the committee passes it, it's something that's going to go to the full board, and you know, as others have pointed out.
We should have a resolution formally saying that the board is going to take a position on this before it even really formally comes before us as a land use.
There are enormous concerns or there's widespread concern from the community, and we really want to hear more from the applicant to say you know what they're basically to provide the additional information that we're looking for and also again, hopefully to address the concerns.
I, don't think a split vote would really help, but maybe there's a kind of a resolution saying something like we've been blindsided and the blood center has not presented any information sufficiently to the community board and we want.
There are people who have very thoughtful responses who are willing to abstain rather than vote in favor of a resolution opposing it, and that doesn't put the board in a great position.
Maybe there is some language that we could use in a resolution that is more I, don't know if it would be more emphatic than a letter and again I'm just thinking.
So I think since I initially proposed the resolution, I'm willing certainly willing to modify it because my intent is for whoever testifies on behalf of community board 8 at the scoping meeting, and there clearly is an opportunity.
I think we should at least write a letter saying that if we based on their presentation today, if they were asking us to support their project, we would have to vote no and that their presentation was inadequate for a zoning meeting, and that gave us no.
I think we can just go on record now to say: If that's the best you got, we would have voted no and go on record that this project is just there's no reason to even be at the scoping stage, based on what we heard and that the community is against it.
I think the resolution was very simple and we should take every opportunity we can to talk about the how outrageous the zoning is, and the other issue is.
I am in favor of a letter and even if it goes into, if it becomes a resolution, I just want to make sure that two points are addressed, directly, one that we were blindsided, but even more so that I did feel the presentation was in bad faith.
I, know, I think we should include in the letter how many people are in favor of the letter, and it seems to me that it's a unanimous support of the Le of a letter tonight not a unanimous support of a resolution but of a strongly worded letter opposing the way the blood center has.
I would include a report of the position of the community because I think, yes, that that is whoever is the recipient of this letter.
You know you all do what you want, but I, don't think it's appropriate to insult the applicant that doesn't give us a strong, position.
When the board, when the committee is not willing to do a resolution to say we are against it, how do you know the community is against it.
The resolution is we're opposed to the project and the changes in the zoning.
So, if we write the right kind of letter, it doesn't mean that we have to degrade the blood center, but we can make it very clear that there are concerns and.
First sentence really speaks to the outpouring of concern by the community and even in a straw vote how many people were opposed to the proposal as presented.
And I think that it's much better to go with a letter unless we can get unanimous support from the committee on a resolution.
No, yes, okay, the beginning of October community Board 8, issued a request for a proposal for an architect to continue work on our bait, going into phase two from phase one on special districts with the 210 height limit, affordable housing, along with preserving the tenements and supporting small business.
