Gail barron, I'm, the co-chair of the women and families committee of cb8, along with peggy price, and tonight we're going to have our meeting center around the urgent need for child care in our district.
We know how critical the need is for both affordable and quality child care, and we're very excited to be able to have our speakers tonight, because we're interested in finding out what kind of child care facilities are in essence, funded by or At least, the funding is assisted by the city of new york and if any of those facilities are in our district and we're also very excited to get an update from representatives from the city on mayor de blasio's program of providing a hundred thousand child care seats for those students who are now the younger grades back in school and, of course, the challenges for parents who really need to have some place where their children are able to be taken care, of.
Tonight we have a stellar group of speakers to address the need for child care on the upper east side and the city's learning bridges program that hopefully addresses our community's need.
And let's begin our program from hearing from our elected officials about the need for child care and what the learning bridges program will mean for our community.
I really want to give a lot of credit to councilman kayla's for a second, because this has been an issue that he's been talking about in the city council in the district, even before I got to the city council, which is the need for good quality, early education programs in that breeze side, but also to have good child care services for new yorkers.
And then you're going to hear from the agencies about the announcement on the mayor's proposal for childcare, child care, which is called the learning bridges program, which was just started and was announced a few weeks ago, which is basically a new program to provide child care options for children, 3 decay, 3 3k, through 8th grade for days when they're scheduled for remote learning and that's obviously makes a lot of sense.
We really needed an opportunity to be able to help out with child care for lots of the working parents here in the city, and it was announced a few weeks ago and just launched.
We just launched, and it's essentially meant to be operated by community based organizations and partners to provide opportunities to connect us children with their remote learning activities, which could be including art and recreation activities and other age-appropriate appropriate activities, including, and also, of course, including meals and snacks, for free at all.
At the same, you know, while you're doing your remote learning- They've, been working with the district, 75 principals and families to make sure that there's also supportive placement for children in the in the program, and now that we have sort of learning off the ground in the last couple of days, we're going to be able to see sort of the effectiveness of the program and how it will be able to support.
I think, along with councilman, chaos, is to expand child care options for parents and families in the city into the long term.
I want to say thank you to all our folks in the city, agencies for the work, they're doing I , think it's a really great topic and a really important time.
And I'll, just say, like pre-k, has been important to me, particularly in pre-k and child care, because when I started running in 2012, even before I was married and before, like the idea of being a parent, was in my eye when I talked to people who I grew up with in the neighborhood.
So I think, as you also know, as a community board, which I would love to have official support, on, but I've gone to every developer in the city, including extel, to say.
I want to thank this committee for looking at this important issue and I will be doing everything in my power to get child's care, I'm, starting to come to terms that I may not get 3k by the time.
And, then I'm sure you want to get to q a so as you heard, learning bridges, free child care programs for students who are enrolled in blended learning.
We have had an application portal open on the department of education website and anyone who you know who might be interested It's very important to send them like the first step, would be going to schools.nyc.gov learning bridges and inputting your expression of interest.
I just want to say this was mentioned, too, that we are 100 following all the safety protocols of new york, city, department of health, new york, state office of children, family services, working in conjunction with with department of education and those safety protocols and for short, we're calling our safety measures a high five We've got wearing masks and participating in daily health.
Susan gave a great overview as the council members, as we said, but I just want to add that we are also giving priority for these seats to a few different groups who we know really need this service.
We don't want to accommodate every single person who needs the service, but we are sort of giving first shot at the at the seats to those groups of families and that list That list of who's being prioritized Is also on the DOE website.
The request for information outlines a lot of questions about your experience, working with children, your organization's staffing, whether you have site control over a space, we're also taking people who want to apply because they just have space or people who want to apply because they're just able to do the service, and we have a classic responsibility, determination that providers go through in order to get to the contract process.
Working with young people, you don't That will get you moving more quickly, but we're also willing to partner with department of health and ocfs and move those license processes along if the if the school-aged child care is something that's new to you.
No, I just want to jump onto what susan said thanks susan and thanks to the community board as council member mentioned, I live in this district, so I'm delighted to be here, Nyc.gov, backslash passport, there's a more detailed link in the chat box, but tamika and any other provider that is here this evening and actually any business that has space interested in learning.
We're in contract with Stanley Isaac for those seats, and the next steps in that that have probably already happened is that across all of our you know, two to three hundred learning lab sites that are in operations already is that young people, families who have applied through the DOE portal, who go to certain schools or live in certain sites, would be matched to a learning labs program so match to Stanley.
You know schedule all young people in the learning labs programs are going to be participating in blended learning, so our programs need to connect with the family and understand a little bit about more about the young person comes in, most importantly, which days do you need the service?
The city thought about any sort of child care program for those young families?
I think that, whatever information you guys can provide is great, maybe something that the committee can think about doing in terms of providing just highlighting some opportunities that are out there from what I've learned from other families- And I think before we're only taking care of like 10 of our kids or something like that right, now, with child care, facilities, small, shrinking their size, classroom sizes for obvious safety, reasons.
It's, certainly part of the school-age child care, regulations, and I You know I, don't have all the details on that space, but to put just like kind of broad strokes on it Is you know a safe place for young people to be socially distanced to be able to eat their meals, participate in activities.
You know they're working out that enrollment processing families there might be a little bit of a lag time, This was the first week just started for k-8 on the Stanley isaac's program in particular, just starting this week within a within a couple, weeks.
We we're also looking at specific geographic areas for citing these programs up making sure those are areas of need, including for people who are working, families, essential, workers, teachers, workers at community-based organizations like the ones that are running the programs.
I, don't want to use the word replacing, but you know providing a supplement to the blended learning plan with mirroring what a typical school day might look like in concept.
I want to add that, because you mentioned the earlier part of the day that sometimes families need care after 3, p.m, and learning bridges certainly only go from 8 to 3, but we also have many after-school programs in the district that will cover the 3-6 period, and so those baseline programs that DYCD has funded in your community remain and those can be accessed at learning more about those programs can be accessed at discover, DYCD.
The information that you have is so crucial to families who want to stay in new york and help their kids get an early start on education, and thank you to gal and peggy for organizing and putting together such an essential, program.
Other thing that kills me is that, like we think, a full day is like eight to three when, like zero people actually work eight to three So. We make sure that we pair additional services with with any sort of provision of seats so that we are actually giving comprehensive child care.
We state that the 60 seats that are in Stanley isaacs are not yet adequate, but we think that we need a minimum of five sites in the district.
If we can help with the outreach to find other sites and be creative, then right now, as they're looking for sites, I, think it's an ideal opportunity for the community board to actually help The. Other alternative is if they are basing a base on the site, based on like they're, trying to keep the kids together, who are going to the same school.
But you know something, maybe more proportional to our population out of new york city, so whether it's the population of children of a certain age or the overall population just to take the latter as a quick, example, If, it's 200 or 210 000 people in our community district out of eight and a half million.
We request an increase of seats proportional to our population, and then I leave it to the committee, whether we want to say our population as a whole or a population of children, of a certain age who would need child care, but I think that would at least give us something more concrete to demand.
We want to vote on the general idea that it we're going to call for a lot more seats, hopefully starting anytime before the end of the year and with a either a whereas or a be It further resolved that the city call on developers to provide space in buildings?
