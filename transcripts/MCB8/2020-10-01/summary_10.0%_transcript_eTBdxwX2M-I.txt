Gail Barron, I'm the co- chair of the women and families committee of CB8, along with peggy price, and tonight we're going to have our meeting center around the urgent need for child care.
We know how critical the need is for both affordable and quality child care, and we're very excited to be able to have our speakers tonight, because we're interested in finding out what kind of child care facilities are in essence, funded by or At least, the funding is assisted by the city of New York and If any of those facilities are in our district and we're also very excited to get an update from representatives from the city on Mayor De, Blasio's program of providing a hundred thousand child care seats for those students who are now the younger grades back in school and, of course, the challenges for parents who really need to have some place where their children are able to be taken care of while the hybrid model is in place and their children are not in school.
Tonight we have a stellar group of speakers to address the need for child care on the Upper East side and the city's Learning Bridges program that hopefully addresses our community's need.
And let's begin our program from hearing from our elected officials about the need for child care and what the Learning Bridges program will mean for our community.
Even before I got to the city council, which is the need for good quality, early education programs in that breeze side, but also to have good child care services for new yorkers.
So And, then you're going to hear from the agencies about the announcement on the mayor's proposal for childcare, child care, which is called the Learning Bridges program, which was just started and was announced a few weeks ago, which is basically a new program to provide child care options for children, 3-K, 3 3-K through 8th grade for days when they're scheduled for remote learning and that's obviously makes a lot of sense.
We really needed an opportunity to be able to help out with child care for lots of the working parents here in the city, and it was announced a few weeks ago and just launched.
At the same, you know, while you're doing your remote learning- They've, been working with the district, 75 principals and families to make sure that there's also supportive placement for children in the in the program, and now that we have sort of learning off the ground.
I think, along with councilman, chaos, is to expand child care options for parents and families in the city into the long term.
I want to say thank you to all our folks in the city, agencies for the work, they're doing I , think it's a really great topic and a really important time.
We have Susan Haskell from DYCD Shannon Middleton from OMB Elizabeth Williams from DOE, and we also have Jennifer geiling, who I work very closely with at Mox. She is I'm chair of the contracts Committee, and so we work very closely on making sure we get non- profits, paid And I also know she's a parent in the district.
K has been important to me, particularly in pre- k and child care, because when I started running in 2012, even before I was married and before, like the idea of being a parent, was in my eye when I talked to people who I grew up with in the neighborhood.
So I think, as you also know, as a community board, which I would love to have official support, on, but I've gone to every developer in the city, including extel, to say.
I want to thank this committee for looking at this important issue and I will be doing everything in my power to get child's care, I'm, starting to come to terms that I may not get 3-K by the time.
We have had an application portal open on the Department of Education website, and anyone who you know who might be interested It's very important to send them like the first step, would be going to Schools.
I just want to say this was mentioned, too, that we are 100 following all the safety protocols of New York City Department of Health New, York, State, Office of children, family services, working in conjunction with with department of Education and those safety protocols and for short, we're calling our safety measures a high five We've got wearing masks and participating in daily health.
Susan gave a great overview as the council members, as we said, but I just want to add that we are also giving priority for these seats to a few different groups who we know, really need this service.
We do not want to accommodate every single person who needs the service, but we are sort of giving first shot at the at the seats to those groups of families and that list That list of who's being prioritized Is also on the DOE website.
The request for information outlines a lot of questions about your experience, working with children, your organization's staffing, whether you have site control over a space, we're also taking people who want to apply because they just have space or people who want to apply because they're just able to do the service, and we have a classic responsibility, determination that providers go through in order to get to the contract process.
You can ask questions of DYCD in the platform while you're doing it and the process is completely digital We encourage you, know all businesses that are interested in learning more to come into the system and see what opportunities are there Susan mentioned at space, as well as child care, opportunities.
All of our you know, two to three hundred learning lab sites that are in operations already is that young people, families who have applied through the DOE portal, who go to certain schools or live in certain sites, would be matched to a learning labs program so match to Stanley.
You know schedule all young people in the learning labs programs are going to be participating in blended learning, so our programs need to connect with the family and understand a little bit about more about the young person comes in, most importantly, which days do you need the service?
The city thought about any sort of child care program for those young families?
You know pre- Learning Bridges page, so we will definitely take it back and we'll continue to communicate with the broader child care.
And, we can deal do a deal with the city, or is it only with providers What type of space is the minimum and who can occupy it and run it I'm going to try to reference the rfi again like as we're talking a little further, but the school- age child care regulations outline like the minimum space specification.
It's, certainly part of the school- age, child care, regulations, and I do not You know I do not have all the details on that space, but to put just like kind of broad strokes on it Is you know a safe place for young people to be socially distanced to be able to eat their meals, participate in activities.
We ensuring that our providers is going to be paid on time when they open their child care up for this program?
You know they're working out that enrollment processing families there might be a little bit of a lag time, This was the first week just started for K-8 on the Stanley Isaac's program in particular, just starting this week within a within a couple, weeks.
I. Think Elizabeth is making reference to seats for very young children through a different family program.
We we're also looking at specific geographic areas for citing these programs up making sure those are areas of need, including for people who are working, families, essential workers, teachers, workers at community, based organizations like the ones that are running the programs.
I do not want to use the word replacing, but you know providing a supplement to the blended learning plan with mirroring what a typical school day might look like in concept : I want to add that, because you mentioned the earlier part of the day that sometimes families need care after 3, P.M and Learning Bridges certainly only go from 8 to 3, but we also have many after- school programs in the district that will cover the 3, 6 period, and so those baseline programs that DYCD has funded in your community remain and those can be accessed at learning more about those programs can be accessed at discover, DYCD.
Other thing that kills me is that, like we think, a full day is like eight to three when, like zero people actually work eight to three So. We make sure that we pair additional services with with any sort of provision of seats so that we are actually giving comprehensive child care.
It should be comprehensive child care and then secondly, I think that we really need to calm the city to pay attention to those young families.
And we, as a community board, can do more outreach and provide more information to people who probably are not aware of this, offering at all or how you even apply, but for sure we ought to have some kind of a goal, maybe double the 60, maybe Maybe this is me putting forward a resolution, but I would, I would say, call for resolution that supports the creation of the Learning Bridges program, however, and thanks the whatever the city for recognizing the difficult position that our all families are facing at this moment, but to also say that 60 seats, without even having the data in front of us, the 60 seats we understand, is not adequate and to call for the establishment of additional facilities in our district, with at least that takes on takes on a population of at least 50 percent of students of children benefit coming from Community board.
We request an increase of seats proportional to our population, and then I leave it to the committee, whether we want to say our population as a whole or a population of children, of a certain age who would need child care, but I think that would at least give us something more concrete to demand.
We want to vote on the general idea that it we're going to call for a lot more seats, hopefully starting anytime before the end of the year and with a either a whereas or a be It further resolved that the city call on developers to provide space in buildings?
