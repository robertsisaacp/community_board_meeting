This is the November meeting of the Landmarks Committee of Community Board number.
This is, as we spoke about, an application for a new elevator and stair bulkheads to bring access to the roof next Tony.
We are trying to get a reconsideration from the department of buildings which wants a wall in the between the two bulkheads, but it will not really make a very big difference.
You know into a brown color and then clearly over the course of a much longer period, would oxidize and become a greenish color right, but we're looking to differentiate it from the existing building, which I think is in the spirit of these editions, but make it very subtle and allow it to kind of go away and blend into the kind of all of the noise of what happens on rooftops.
I mean I, think the renderings might show you maybe gives you a better indication.
You know you have to guess that, but I would think it's more.
Area, a block, and you can see the you mean park from like 62Nd Street.
Looking back from 63rd street along Park, right, okay, nice Northwest, corner.
As long as the letter didn't provide us any reason, because I always like to hear from the community and if they're right near there that sometimes they've seen something that we wouldn't have known about.
Are there really a low weight kind of a sedum type product, or you know green roof type product that we could we'd like to do.
You know little clips at the edges that you can tie yourself to, but I don't have any particular problem with this, especially since we approved a similar I can't confess to remembering exactly what it looked.
Just a question for the applicant you mentioned earlier that you had a differing opinion from the department of building, as it relates to a safety issue, I'd like for you to expand on that.
Don't need to discuss this one that is outside of the hours couple work just notified that way, but the bottom line right here is I will support your application.
You don't want to build the wall and the vestibule is so that you can have more glazing, in other words, you're going to have.
I mean that's a point of access for someone who might want to go up to the you know.
I'm time to call the roll okay, I'm just going to mute everybody and take the screen put up our all right.
And I hope that the commission is smart enough to know that it is nothing but full of errors, but I think we have enough problems trying to make sure that appropriateness is the standard around here that some.
So I, don't know how people want would like to deal with this, but I.
Do you think it's good to write to civitas and copy landmarks, or vice versa.
Oh I guess can I just say that if that's the case, it was civitas who addressed the letter to us with the cc to landmarks, no civilization.
But if the letter was addressed to landmarks I think we should address it.
I, don't know you're going to draft a letter and to landmarks.
Let's move to a leader, because we also want to see what type of response we get from landmarks after they receive the letter.
In response to numerous letters that the board sent to the Landmarks, Preservation Commission will and I had received an invitation to a meeting with Sarah Carroll to talk about some of it, but it made sense to bring some very knowledgeable people from this committee, so Jane and David and Elizabeth joined us in the meeting.
It was that building that we took up here in the landmarks committee and also at full board, with a resolution to revoke asking the commission to revoke the permits for an approvals for the work on 210 e 62nd street because of bad behavior and changes in mind and just various things.
It was not a change that merited coming back to the board, and then we had that I'd like to think of it as a little bit snarky response from the owner that she didn't appear and sent a representative in her place that everything was fine.
But we disagreed with that, and that was another instance of how the community board is not necessarily given enough recognition or I guess advisory authority with the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
It was very nice that they had the meeting with us, but basically I think it was to maybe just say that we're here, if you need us, but we're not going to do anything any differently except maybe for.
That brings up the staff level approvals and I told her that we are not seeing the same level of applications and other boards have talked about that as well.
Just too many things are going to the staff, but she insisted that it was no different than it was other boards have issues with with the same kinds of concerns that we have too many approvals of things like rooftop editions or so we're, not the only ones.
I mean I talked about the window, I, don't know if you remember Jane, because you were particularly fond of the building on in the 90s.
I think that a lot of the presenters to our committee and to the board have the feeling that we maybe have a little bit more power than we really do.
I have the sense that some of the applicants who are very familiar with the process and know that very often the committee and the board are overruled that they just go their merry way and they've been talking with the Landmarks Preservation Commission at a senior level.
And I think there are others who, whatever their experience level when they know they've done a lousy job, as we pointed out to them, they're willing to come back because they recognize that they haven't done the right, job, so I think it's a mixed bag, but I think at least Sarah Carroll's on notice.
Think that if the resolution is just numbers, the fact that it's unanimous says that we voted on you unanimously, but if there is a great deal of passion, involved, maybe a cover letter that points out just how passionately the board was, and.
David I was thinking that that's tough, though you know who goes down to the to give our testimony I have on when it's an important, topic, I, think or when we're particularly concerned that they won't go the way that we went like the hotel whales, for instance.
That says the commission voted this way and x, Y and Z, but the board position was different and we represent the community and if you remember a number of years ago, we had an intern max.
You know with our committee meeting, but if we could at least get it and circulate some kind of a heads, up, because, frankly, after the staff level approves it.
You know with the open meetings rule and all that kind of thing.
And I had a one-on-one conversation about this and expressed to her that I really don't understand why things that are approved at the staff level, since they're meeting multiple times with the applicant anyway, why it can't come to the board, I, didn't think I couldn't figure out and.
You know what was extra work about that on her part or anything like that.
She was very nice and very responsive, so she knows how we feel about it, but she didn't offer anything practical, but I think we should do that.
Don't think that there's anything in that require if we see an application that looks substantial.
We know it's I, think that is the lowest standard.
They know that we have the most and the most important landmarks in the committee.
And I think we have to have a very good reason to want to do.
I mean you know, I'm, a stalwart of this community.
Not I mean you know, and I've, been a part of this community longer than people who voted up for the whales.
Commission is not a violation of as far as I know, of the open meetings law, but deciding whether to how the committee feels about something I.
That is in violation of the meeting open meetings law, but it's never been an issue with the applicants that come before the landmarks.
Yes, I think you know it's easy to get a description of what the application is.
If something is going to go before the commission, we don't have a problem because then it automatically we know about it because it comes to us first so that that's not.
You know what I mean.
Well, David, I, don't know what do you think the next step should be or Michelle.
It seems like we're, maybe a letter to landmarks asking if we can have access to projects that they're reviewing at the staff, level.
I'm sure you know, Wednesday is going to be a long, meeting.
And I, don't even know whether it has to go to the board for approval.
It doesn't have to go to the board you're, just asking for additional information, I think as soon as you can get to it.
Soon, as you can do it in your schedule, you know get it out, I, don't think it needs to go to the board.
