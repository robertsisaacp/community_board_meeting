So 629 all right. Well, it's 6:30! So we're going to start sounds great. Okay, so do you want to say a few words? First will or should I just jump in I'll, happily explain the setup so all right well for anybody that it's their first time at one of our cb-8 zoom public meetings. The thing you'll first notice is that you're, muted and you're not able to unmute yourself. We will take questions and comments from the public and from our board members through using a raised hand feature if you go to the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. You'll find a little box that will pop up and then, when you open that box you'll see a raise hand button and whenever you're ready to make a comment or a question on an item. You'll push the little raise hand. Button you'll go up to the top of the list. Jane and David will see you and they'll call on you and in turn, and that's really all there is to say other than. If you have any questions, you can always chat through the chat box. If you're having problems with the software, thank you well with that we're going to start good evening. This is the November meeting of the Landmarks Committee of Community Board number. Eight. We have one agenda item, an application for a c of a, and we will hear from the applicant we'll allow the public to speak and then we'll go into executive session with the board just the board. After we formulate a resolution on our one agenda item, we will go into executive session and discuss two new business items or really they're actually old business items. So with that we're going to start the fir, the only application is 107. East 64th street is plus Cal architects. Here, I see, Tony, plus Cal, plus Co am I pronouncing it correctly and Mary Dietrich's you're on the same application. Yes, okay thanks and this is a row house on E64 street. The application is to construct a rooftop, stair and elevator bulkhead, I, guess a bulkhead for the stair as well. Is that correct is our? Have we got it correctly? That's correct, yeah, great okay, so we'll go to the applicant. Are you both going to speak? Yes, I'm speaking and then Tony? Okay? So perhaps we could get the shared screen going, so we can see the drawings. Can you see that yeah we can see? Are you able to see that great okay? This is, as we spoke about, an application for a new elevator and stair bulkheads to bring access to the roof next Tony, oh, is it who is? Is it tony? That's yeah, I'm doing it yep it's described as a no style building by landmarks. It's this the White row house in the center. Next it was built in 1881 to 1882, designed by Wp and Am Parsons. It was altered in 1924 by Delano and Aldrich. It's the one, two, it's the third one in from the corner. Next yeah, thank you and it was altered again by the George B Poston sons and got stripped, and this dude had already been removed and then it was altered again in the 70s at minimum they changed Windows tony Plesko, Plasco architects is going to describe the proposal. Thank you thanks Mary. So the proposal, basically, what we're proposing is an extension of an existing stair bulkhead, an elevator bulkhead up to the roof with a connecting vestibule, and this is a view of from the South the street elevation of the both the existing facade and what's proposed up on the roof, and this is set back quite a ways from the roof. How many feet set is the setback? I would say you know it's funny, I, don't know exactly what that number is it's probably 35 feet or so. I'll show a rendering that gives you a sense of where it is I know we love detail. Okay, so it set back approximately 35 feet from the front elevation right, I would say so. Yes, I'll verify that while we're on this one. Yes, this is a an image. This is an image. Basically it's an extension of that. You know vertically of the existing bulkhead inside the building, the existing stairwell and the existing elevator shaft. So it's set quite a bit back again. I'll get you that we'll work on that number. This is a view from the courtyard side. This is the north side of the building showing the extension. This is an enlargement of that the this is the side facing south, which is the street elevation and the side facing the courtyard just for information, there's a ladder on either side for Fire Department access up and over to each side. What is the height? Oh, could you give us the dimensions of yeah it'll be in the section okay, so this is a view, an aerial view. This is the stairwell extending up again, it literally sits on top of the existing stairwell and then the bulkhead for the elevator and then a vestibule that connects the two right now at this moment, we're showing what we would like to do with the bottom, which can't actually be seen from the street in any event just the top. But at the idea we are trying to get a reconsideration from the department of buildings which wants a wall in the between the two bulkheads, but it will not really make a very big difference. It won't make any difference in how you see it from the street and won't make that much of a difference. In the elevation that you're looking at- and this also shows that remember the extended chimneys in the back right- is that the rear elevation or the front elevation. This is the rear and how many feet is that set back? That's the front. This is the front. Let me I will I'll double check on our plans. I! Don't have it immediately in front of me that distance, but let me check and get back to you Jane on that and while you're checking you know, we also want to know the height the square feet, especially for the vestibule, the connecting vestibule that that's 120 square feet. The connecting vestibule is 120 square feet: correct, okay and you're, going to get me. The height yeah I'll give that to you. It's set in it's in the drawings themselves, but I'll give you that number I'll articulate that number. Thank you. Of course. This is a section through a cross section through the building from the cellar all the way up in through the vestibule and the extension of the both the stair and the elevator bulkhead, and then this this is the existing, and this is the proposed. This is a longitudinal section showing the existing and the proposed- and this is the stair up into the vestibule here, and you can see it's more or less sitting right in the middle there and we're set back from both the front setback. I'm sorry, it's 29 feet, 2 inches and it's 16 feet, 2 inches from the rear. It's 29 feet how many inches 29 feet two uh-huh and where is 16 feet to at the rear? Okay and the height is 11 feet and as long as you're giving me the height, how about the width? Well, I! Guess it's the width of the house right, which is a standard lot, so we're about it yeah! Well, you know what let me get to our plan. Okay, so we are just about yeah, I'm sorry! We are, let's see what do we got here? It's a 20-foot lot! Okay! Just for my own clarification, the vestibule is that livable space or what's the purpose of the vestibule, it's so that when you, the vestibule, is basically it's currently compartmentalized. But it's really just a connection between these two bulkheads and currently it's also weather protection as well, so that where it's not the elevator and the stairwell are not exposed immediately to weather and you're. Under the code, you're allowed to do 120 square feet without it being considered a floor. Oh okay, you know I mean if you can imagine it's quite not a particularly large space, but you can you know, rather than going immediately out into weather in either of these two conditions, that's connected by a small, enclosed space, and there are windows on it. There are there's windows at the rear and currently and as Mary had mentioned, the current requirement for the current currently we're dealing with we're working with DOB on this. They wanted a wall in between the two right and we would like to get that removed so that we could increase the amount of glass we have at the front the back, but the goal is to make as to put as much glazing here as possible. Ultimately, okay. Is that the extent what materials are you using we're using a a copper shingle on that which would have initially patina as a brown, you know into a brown color and then clearly over the course of a much longer period, would oxidize and become a greenish color right, but we're looking to differentiate it from the existing building, which I think is in the spirit of these editions, but make it very subtle and allow it to kind of go away and blend into the kind of all of the noise of what happens on rooftops. So the copper shingle will be basically for the extension between or will the the whole thing will be in copper. Well, it should yeah, there's whatever's, not glazed would be you know anything here and we can show you back. I mean I think the renderings might show you maybe gives you a better indication. So, like the bulkhead surface for the elevator, whatever surfaces we have here, you know that surface here this surface here we're trying to get daylight into that stairwell. So this would be glass, so whatever isn't glass is going to be? Basically a copper shingle yeah I mean that yeah and the doors were envisioning steel, sash doors so thin profile again in keeping with you know, some of the older homes in the area, a very narrow style. Oh, the extended chimney will be brick, okay and there's a security fence on the sides yeah along here, which is we want to do in a perforated, copper material, so again continuing with the same language same material language. Here this is really just to keep people from walking across the various roofs. Okay. Is that the extent of your presentation we're going to run through the views, because this is sorry to show you that yeah do you want to take over Mary I mean just tell me when to advance but I think right. We did a mock-up and quite a nice one and keep going Tony here's more mock-up. Then you can see it go to the next one. You can see. Oh yeah, you can see it from down 64th, you know to the west kind of so that's the that's the that's what you would see and then we did a close-up of kind of roughly words. Can we get the pointer and oh I, see it behind the tree brand yeah and yeah it's in the regular view. You really don't see in here. How many feet are you seeing in that? You know you have to guess that, but I would think it's more. It's certainly more than you could do at staff level. It's maybe tony. We say three feet. Two I mean I'd, be guessing it's four feet. Perhaps so approximately four feet is visible: going down, 64th street going west right looking from the west yeah, okay, all right! The next is the rendering of the same view and there it is okay. Next few, this is a little closer on 64th and that's so tell me, Mary I know I'm interrupting, but the house in front of what we're seeing who was the architect for that house. I, don't know, that's yeah that building yeah, sorry to say, I, don't know this! Yeah okay go on all right next one! That's the rendering that one thing to the left is the extended chimney. Okay, next view: this is the the main view down park about a block and a half right area, a block, and you can see the you mean park from like 62Nd Street, yeah, 63rd, probably 63Rd, okay, Jane. Have you seen number three yeah, that's one block over okay at that corner. This is the chimney once again and the bulkheads. So that's you can see that four feet from that view line as well. Oh I would say: that's, maybe more! Oh, how much is it no actually I, don't think so. I, don't think it's any more than that! Yeah! Okay, it's really the very you're, only catching the a bit of the bulkhead and you're catching the thickness of this roof here, and this is no more than two feet. So this is probably about three foot here and then maybe three and a half to four here of the elevator bulkhead. So it's three to four feet: okay, looking back from 63rd street along Park, right, okay, nice Northwest corner and that's the rendering of it. Okay next is down park a little bit more. Oh I'm! Sorry before that last year a an addition was was approved at landmarks for the building next door. That's 105 where ours is 107. and that edition wasn't built and the house is for sale now. But if that edition were built, you wouldn't see very much of our bulkheads. Actually, you wouldn't see it obscures virtually all of it that that's it right there that's the addition and then this is it ghosted over what we proposed. So you could pretty much. That edition would obscure the entire thing that we're doing, but it's not there. No, it's not there at the moment gives you a little bit of a history with them right that was recently approved. Yeah. Thank you next Tony, and it could be that it will be, though I did mean to prove that. Does anybody remember I, don't remember it at all. It was approved at the landmarks hearing at the end of March, so it would have come to you before March. It would have had to things have a way of not always coming to us and you may not have approved it. I don't really know what was the address of that property I'll. Look it up! 105, east 64th! This is once again what you see and remember: you're, not seeing the close-ups we just when we give you the other photo. You really can't see anything but you, but if you had really good eyes, you could that little orange thing there yeah and then it goes away that that's the end of that view, but we, the railing, is also visible. So this next next one tony. Oh I'm sorry! This is the rendering yeah that's right so yeah. First, we have the Molocup followed by a rendering, and this is that same view from the third looking back park yep. So now this is getting. This is between 63rd and 62nd, midway through the block on the western side of the sidewalk. You see where my cursor is right there by number four yeah. You can see that that's the location, so you have a little. You have a location, but no question anybody strolling down. There can see it maybe from three to four feet: the extension yeah you can see it. The roof. Okay, I just want to make sure. We all know that okay yeah I mean this is the view four, not the close-up, but view four is really representative of what you would see and, as you can see, the roofs are pretty busy and there's a lot of stuff on them, and this really blends in with the rest of all of the stuff. That's on these roofs in the roofscafe escapes, okay, and what we're seeing in that rendering in view four close-up is the brick cladding I. Is that correct in the room? Yeah? That's right! The extended chimney! One side it looks like there are two parts but okay, so this is the bulkhead for the elevator and that's the chimney so that we're extending the chimney and then, where we've got this, so this is copper, and this is brick so just to clarify I the extended bulkhead for the elevator is going to be clad in brick right. No, that's in copper, okay, gotcha, okay and then the other the extended stairwell is going to have to be clad in brick. No, I'm sorry but I, that's my fault. I could see. I wasn't clear at all on that, because the elevator bulkhead and the stair bulkheads are near the back chimneys. The chimneys themselves have to be raised three feet. Is it three two or three feet above the level of the of the bulkhead, so that what you're, seeing primarily in this view on the left, is the chimney that has to be extended? Okay, thank you, yeah! I'm! Sorry, okay! Thank you! Okay! Next Tony from this view, which is Park Avenue close to 64th. What you're seeing are the new security railings on the side yeah this and this okay? The next view is from park and 65th, and there you're seeing a little bit of the extended chimney at the it's, the rear, chimney, Tony, so yeah, so January you're, asking about the copper material. The we found that you know a house. That's got the material on it's a little, it's a shingle type product and it here it weathers to this brown color, which is quite quickly. You know within a few months, so this will be the tone of the material that's being used to clad the primary volumes, including the bulkhead enclosures for the stair and the elevator. Okay, very good I love that cloud primary volumes. Okay and then here's just another view of it showing a little bit more closely. Okay and then that's it. I mean this is a final view of that from here. Well, there's an appendix after that with some plans and things, but this is really the heart of it. Well, thank you very much and I'm assuming you're here, because it is so visible from the public way. Is there. Anyone from the public who wants to comment will I'll just remind everybody, open the participants box use the raise hand feature. If you would like to raise a comment and if you're on the phone, it is Star 9. well, and we also got a letter from a neighbor who's opposed to this Deandra Douglas. Did you see that David Halpern? What did I see? There was a letter that we got sent that it was addressed to Elita a from a name. I didn't see the letter, oh okay, anyway, so it was a letter in opposition. Just so everybody knows from Deandre Douglas who's a neighbor. Do you know? Okay, so we'll go to the committee and we can take the committee in alphabetical order. I guess! Well, can you give us the gist of the letter or well? It was just a very simple one-line letter I mean Deandre. Douglas, you know is a celebrity, but in any case it basically said that I am opposed to the rooftop edition. It was a really very simple one-line letter and it was addressed to Alita. Yes, that's the extent of the letter, so if you're ready to go through the committee members, it is Elizabeth Ashby up First, Elizabeth yeah. As long as the letter didn't provide us any reason, because I always like to hear from the community and if they're right near there that sometimes they've seen something that we wouldn't have known about. Otherwise, but if there's nothing there and this seems to be except for the pigeons, pretty invisible and so I think I could live with this, because it's so far back and so hard to see. As far as I can tell thank you. Elizabeth next is Gail Barron yeah I have a question: what is the actual height of the extension 12 feet? I'm sorry didn't hear you 12 feet from the ground plane to the top of the roof. So from here Gail to the top of this is 12 feet. Okay, thank you know the other question. I just had out of curiosity. Why is DOB pushing for a wall between the vestibules? It's really a it's a they're viewing it as a fire. Separation I always want to give it safety yeah. That's right! I mean it's simply: yeah I mean we that's their current view, working with the examiner that we have currently assigned to the project. We have a slightly different perspective on it, but that's it's really based on a fire life safety issue. Okay, thank you. No other questions. You're welcome. This is Michelle Bernabaum. Thank you did I hear you say that this extension is on top of the of another extension, the bulkhead, the original bulkhead came out. No, it the no what we are doing, maybe I. We are extending the bulkhead. That's currently so there's a there's, basically what you would refer to the interior stairs a bulkhead and we there is no bulkhead at the moment like that, actually expecting. There's no bulkhead at the moment that extends beyond the roof is flat. Okay, whatever was interior came up flat to the roof, and this is just going to be above it correct. What's the total height of the building, including this new, would you say, 12 feet? Yeah, let me go back to that. 72 2 to the top of the elevator and 71 foot, two to the top of the roof of the of what I'm the vestibule and the elevator shaft is one foot higher. So it's under what like 75 feet, which would be permissible on the slot. Is that correct? I'm sorry say that again it's under the 75 feet that would be permissible on this lot. It's under 75 feet, yeah, okay, also, what is the height of the security fence and the materials the height of the oh, this the security fence is simply it's 40. We're trying to we're doing something it's 42 inches is that the height requirement the safety requirement. That is even though there's no, it's a guard rail we're using the guardrail height, and we just you know, which would be even though there's not there isn't a there, isn't an issue with your. You know, falling to some elevation below where you might get harmed 42 inches is a standard guardrail height. So that's what you're using so that's what we're using yeah is that in the back of the house as well- yes, but that that's existing already. So we have something here at the back: that people don't fall off the roof right and then basically, what we're talking about on either side is something just to keep people from walking onto the roof, because, basically, when you get on the you know, when, if people access their roofs, they can walk from one roof to the other, is the height of the side, railings? Also 42. That's what I thought we were speaking about. Yeah no I was talking about the front. Oh, the front railing is existing, that's not being changed that meets the requirement of the code, which is 42 okay and to either side on the party wall separating you know one row from the other: it's also 42. so I'm sorry, I thought you were talking, yeah, no okay, so you have four. Basically, four fences two sides one front and one in the back right: what's the material in the color, the ones on the side are perf, we're looking at a perforated, copper that would go dark, Brown and then the front and back are the front's existing. It's painted black and the rear. If it were to be is the intention is to use the existing railing, provided it's structurally secure and it would also be painted black okay, but so the sides are perforated proper and the front and the back. What's the material the front and the back? Well, the front's existing it's wrought, iron, okay and the back is probably it's existing as well. It's probably wrought iron, however, if we feel like we have to because of you know of its soundness, if we were to change it, we would change it to look exactly the same as it is now, but it would be probably black painted steel, it wouldn't be wrought, iron, I, don't know, I, don't believe it would be, I mean it's you, it would look, but it would look identical. Did you reach out to any of the neighbors? Have any personal notice or conversations with any of them there's been communication with the neighbors to either side and this lady who wrote you don't know that she was one of those neighbors well I. Could a Michelle? Okay? Thank you. Michelle. Do you want me to read the letter? No will posted it. So we've read it. Oh thank you Michelle. Were you done? Yes, thank you. Okay, thank you. So up next will be Elita. Thank you I. My apologies for not sending around that very brief email in which she expressed her opposition. What is growing, what is going to be on the roof of the edition? It looks like you're, creating a green roof, some plants up there. Well, that was yeah, so we were looking at the you know. We were interested in the possibility of growing or having a small garden up there and possibly doing a green roof on top of that portion of it. So are there really a low weight kind of a sedum type product or you know green roof type product that we could we'd like to do that? So are there safety related issues because it looks like it's just sheer flat surface on the top? How would someone be up there taking care of the garden and accessing all of that? Do you need to have more safety rails, making it even bigger I, don't think so, I mean. If we did, we wouldn't do it. If we had to make it larger, it would kind of be counterproductive. Too I mean if you see a lot of green roofs. You know the majority of those green roofs. It's not meant to be an occupied roof, so it's really more of a decorative thing. So, if you're there for servicing, if you need to service it, you know you can service it from a ladder. You can certainly get up to this on a ladder that we would be providing, but if it required additional structures simply to have the green roof, it would kind of defeat the purpose of it, and so we wouldn't do it. Yeah we're not even allowed a window box. I know nothing about green roofs. Okay and to me it seems visible from the street, but I I don't have any other questions and I'm eagerly listening to my colleagues. So thank you all right, I, don't believe. Oh Sarah Chu has joined us. I, don't know when she joined so I'll go to her hi I just joined a few minutes ago, and so I'm still catching up on the presentation, but I don't think I'll vote because I I've missed so much of the conversation. Thank you Sarah. The next would be Anthony. Okay, I think. Basically, this is fine. The green roof, the problems of people falling off a workmen falling off the green roof can be solved with tie-downs, and things like that. You know little clips at the edges that you can tie yourself to, but I don't have any particular problem with this, especially since we approved a similar I can't confess to remembering exactly what it looked like. A similar addition, rooftop edition to the building next door, one more one lot closer in fact to park Avenue, so I don't have any particular problem with this myself. Thank you. Anthony next would be may hi. Just a question for the applicant you mentioned earlier that you had a differing opinion from the department of building, as it relates to a safety issue, I'd like for you to expand on that. What is the Dob's position? What is your position, and why do you feel like yours is the right position so currently the position of the of DOB is that for they would like to see a separate they'd like the vestibules to be separate from one another, so you when, so, if you come up the elevator, you would go into a vestibule that would disconnect you from the stair and vice versa, and they have a very narrow viewpoint of on that. At this point, and that's again, this is an opinion. It's not yeah with you know, it's an opinion of the supervisor or the plan checker that we're currently working with it may not be an opinion of a supervisor that person happens to work under, but you know to be clear: I, I'm the architect for this project and basically the buck stops with me. I stamp all of the drawings, and my primary concern is the life safety of all the people. You know of the of my client and anyone else inside this building. I'm of the position that 120 square foot space is, you know it's a very small room and it would be nice if we could somehow just connect those two and make it into one. The space will be fully sprinklered, it actually there's. You know adequate exiting out of that, and it just makes it it's just a better. It's just a better design. So you know that is that's it. It's less confining as well, so we feel it's a better proposal. Ultimately and again, you know we'll we're that's the conversation we have and it's a difference in opinion just to follow up and just and for the sake of my clarity and thank you for explaining that Tony. So when so, the Dobs position is based on what it when you said, it's a mat like is for. Is it a true safety concern on their end? And if so, can you expand on that and I understand that it is the opinion of the person you are working with and that may differ from their supervisors right so again, I have not personally spoken to this plan checker about this particular issue. These are notes that we're getting back from you know the expediters of who we consultants that we have that are working with that person and we think it's a it's. We don't believe that you need to build a wall and chop a space into ten by six. That suddenly makes it a safer space than to inhabit versus something that might be ten by twelve. It simply degrades the quality of the actual experience right. So this is my you know. We have different perspectives and we have a different reading of the code and so I don't know. If that answers your question, but I, don't think I. You know we have there's there myself and this and the current plan checker have a different opinion, we're trying to work through it. Thank you very much sure so. I do not believe Harrison has joined if he has raise your hand, but that would make Marco next. Thank you. I just want to follow up what you just said. Are you aware that you are obligated to have a meeting with the panic, the purview of this conversation of this meeting? Okay, but just let you know you are obligated to meet them, so the expertise can not be there. You must be there and the experience, but not the expedition alone. That is the new rules, but this is not our role right here. I just wanted to clarify to you and you don't need to explain anything more about that. The proposal I think is reasonable by the way the corner really I. Remember very well. Yes, it may cover your project and I. Think. Yes, we approved that project. I think it was reasonable project and in this case, I found it. Yes, your setbacks in the front and the rear is fine, and the only thing that you're doing is basically is the functionality of the space. The inside of the space you have the bulkhead for the elevator and for the staircase, which basically you need it. So it's nothing wrong and yes, you try to make the attractive which is I found this. There is something over there that I think I will support this application. Thank you, yeah is it. This is Marco right. Is that correct, yeah Marco I have in fact had you know we're do this is our Covid-19? You know there's a certain Covid-19 protocol. We have in fact had, and I've been on the phone with the plan examiner, but the particular issue related to the wall was a response that she gave to an expediter without my being present. No, the espd. This process is start, probably like a four or six months ago. So I have been dealing myself too. So no everything is I. Don't need to discuss this one that is outside of the hours couple work just notified that way, but the bottom line right here is I will support your application. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Now we'll move on to our public members, Christina Davis and Kim Selway, and then we have three board members who are also here that we'll go to after that, so starting with Christina Starsix done Mute I think all the questions have been answered and I can support this application. Thank you, Christina and then I talk to him, sellway hi good evening and I agree with for Christina, just that all of my questions have been addressed and I can support this application. Thank you. Kim I saw Sharon Pope Marshall was here not seeing her we'll move to Russell Squire and then to Sherry Weiner. If she is still here, wait, I have no comments beyond what others have said. Thanks Russell is Sherry. Still here not seeing her. Oh there, you are, you have your hand up there you go I can just can you point out where the vegetables are that you're? Talking about that the differences between your opinion and the DOB I'm having trouble visualizing? Where sure, let me, let me run up to a plan here, hold on it's hard. It really doesn't have any effect on the. It has a very limited effect on the on in the rendering it's really it's a plan issue yeah. So basically there's a wall. This is the plan, so these are the vestibules and they want a wall beach. Oh, they want a wall between yeah we'd like to take the wall out so that it's one room which, as it is, it's not that big, it's only 10 by 12. This would make it even tighter, so we're simply asking them if we can remove the wall, yeah that that's very helpful, seeing the visual I just couldn't okay great. Thank you very much, you're, very welcome so Jane and David. You also have hands up from Elizabeth and Michelle. If you want to go back to them before the two of you well, we might as well sure. Okay Elizabeth, you had your hand up first yeah. This is very quick, but earlier on in the questions, and so on, some it was said that the height limit is 75 feet. I believe this is in an Lh-1A area where the height limit would be 60 feet. I, don't think it's going to affect anything but I. Just thought I would bring that up. Thank you. Elizabeth will Michelle also had her hand up okay and then that's it. Yes, thanks Elizabeth that helps my recollection. Is you said that you one of the reasons you want to remove the wall or you don't want to build the wall and the vestibule is so that you can have more glazing, in other words, you're going to have you know a lot of glass that would break it up and this without it you'd have a bigger expanse of glass. So I also wondered in that case, what kind of lighting are you doing in there? Because if you do get that wool removed, you will have 12 feet of glazing. Is that correct I know it's not the you have to remember that we've got the thickness of a roof structure, and so it's not 12 foot of glass. It's probably nine to ten of which you might see a foot from the street very little of that glass. If anything would be seen, you're pretty much seeing the underside of a little roof overhang from those viewpoints. So what kind of lighting would be in there would it be on all the time? Oh no I mean at a minimum. We would have an occupancy sensor in there, so you know it would most. You know most of the time it probably would be off. I mean it would only be if someone were to go up there. They'd turn the lights on and then presumably we would not. Presumably we would attach an occupancy sensor to that so that if there's no movement inside that space, it would automatically shut off okay, so you're not looking for that to be a decoratively lit space in some way. No okay and I just want to clarify something about the roof. On the top of this structure it's inaccessible at the moment, you would have to have a portable ladder that you would hold up and take down in order to plant that and to treat it. Is that correct? No well, we actually have a ladder that we that the fire, Department and Dobs required us to attach to the side of the elevator bulkhead on both sides for fire department access and actually your if you, this is a you're required to have a path of travel for the fire department. And it's noted here in this hatch section and along this, so there's a little there's a ladder here. That brings you up and then a ladder on the other side. That brings you down to the other side and that's a requirement so that the fire department get to both ends of the building. Yeah I saw that actually in one of the earlier renderings, but I thought it was laying horizontally, in other words, to be re to be placed when needed. But you're saying it's vertical all the time and that's your access. Yeah there are rungs. So there'd, be you know, kind of yeah architecturally. It's going to be a nice piece that we're going to make blend into the copper right, and so you ought I mean that's a point of access for someone who might want to go up to the you know. If there's a gardener I mean this is very Mo low, maintenance planting. Frankly, and if someone were to go up there, we would have you know, tie downs, we've done it before on roofs, where we have OSHA required. Don't you need to have a hook? Pardon don't you need drainage. Does something have to come down the side of the structure for drainage from planting? Well, the drainage is internal and Attac. The drainage would be internal. Yes, of course you have to drain it, but you have to drain the roofs anyway right so and we're handling that through the existing roof drain system, that happens at the back of the building at the courtyard. So the roof is currently drained by a gutter at the rear of the roof at the courtyard side and comes down roof gutters. So there's nothing that happens on the front of the building. It all happens at the back, and so basically any water that falls on this green roof or the roof itself will be handled similarly to how it is how it's being handled now. Okay, thank you, okay! Well, it sounds to me like it's a move to approve so I think. Is anybody ready to Jane? I'm? Oh, I'm sorry David, please speak! I'm sorry, I! Don't doubt that it's a move to approve, but I'm not comfortable with it. I, don't remember what we did on 105. I'm not comfortable with the shape to me. It looks like an oddball element. That's placed on that roof unnecessarily. I would feel very comfortable if just the elevator came up and just the stairs came up and that you then had incidental elements on the roof. Just like you have on some other roofs, but I just don't feel comfortable with the connection which I feel is totally unnecessary. You could have zero clearance doors if you were concerned about weatherproofing on the on the elevator and where the roofing on the stair is not an issue at all. So if I were doing it, I would want to see just the incidental elements that bring you up to the roof and I think that the bulk that's been added is unnecessary bulk and I'm not in favor of putting unnecessary bulk on roofs. So I can not support it. Thank you David. Does anybody want to introduce a resolution committee members Russell has his hand up Russell to motion to approve. Is there a second okay, I'm time to call the roll okay, I'm just going to mute everybody and take the screen put up our all right. Everybody can see the vote sheet now. Yes, we can see it. Thank you will, oh sorry and then I think I have everybody. Unmuted Christina was the last one, and so I'm just going to go through the roll. This is an approval and we'll start with Elizabeth Ashby. Yes, thank you. Cal Baron! Yes, thank you. Michelle Birnbaum! Yes, thank you. Elita Camp, no David articulated what my level of discomfort was. Thank you David Sarah Chu, not voting. Please just skip. Yes, thanks, Anthony! Yes, thank you David! No! Thank you. May no! Thank you Jane! Yes, thank you Harrison's, not here Marco. Yes, thank you Christina! Yes, thank you Kim! Yes, thank you Russell! Yes, thank you and Sherry. Yes, thank you will okay, so that was an appro. Thank you to the applicant coming we're going to move along to our two other items to discuss. The first is the master plan Initiative now Elizabeth. Do you want to start that discussion? Okay, well, I? What I think that we really have to discuss is the objection to it, but in case people haven't caught up. Gail, Barron and Michelle Birnbaum are going to lead this committee and provide information to and to the community. But after we end zoom meetings, because I think they quite rightly decided that zoom meetings weren't the way to do this, I don't think we've had really any response from landmarks. We did I hope all committee members got a copy of the letter that Civita sent that which was not supporting our proposal and I hope that the commission is smart enough to know that it is nothing but full of errors, but I think we have enough problems trying to make sure that appropriateness is the standard around here that some either we should write to Civitas and straighten them out and copy landmarks or write to landmarks and point out the errors, but I'll just very quickly go through some of the errors they talk about this being within the Fifth Avenue historic district. There is no fifth Avenue historic districts. They talk about requiring original materials, it's good stuff, but on a apartment building over six stories, you do not have to use the original materials on windows. They talk about high cost and energy efficiency. There are so many I think when we do this letter. I hope I'll work with Anthony and Marco, because they've been most helpful, but how to word this, but the modern replacement windows don't dis in order to get energy efficiency, you don't have to use one over ones or single pane or you can get an appropriate design. That is energy as energy efficient. It doesn't add to the cost and other things the burden isn't there because of a an appropriate winter master plan. A window master plan doesn't require anybody to do anything. Your building can require them to do it in environmental laws, but the master plan has nothing to do with it and it doesn't require any extra review by landmarks, because any replacement window in a historic district or a landmark building goes to landmarks. So the one thing that makes it easier if you have a master plan, it's a very simple step. So I don't know how people want would like to deal with this, but I don't want an effort and position that we took after a great deal of thought. I, don't know whether you've, how you other people feel do you think it's good to write to civitas and copy landmarks, or vice versa, so I leave that and any other suggestions, because I sent the letter to everybody and everybody had our letter. What your positions would be on this one and why you feel about who gets what letter I don't know Elizabeth, nobody is volunteering. Anything I think there are two hands up right now: Michelle and then Elita and I just want to. Let you guys know that you're, basically only at board members left here, so I've made I've left several of you on unmuted, but you're. Also all able to mute yourselves now so use the hand raised features still but like. If you guys want to you, can jump in Michelle, okay, so I was just unmuted can before we address that Elizabeth. Can we just get a summary or some sense of the meeting that you had with Sarah Carroll I, don't think, we've ever I know I. We have never been briefed on that and I would just like to know the nature and the tone of that. How long it was can somebody brief us on that? Well, I think Elita can Michelle it's on the agenda for tonight. It's the second item after the window initiative, but perhaps it I don't know a leader could take the floor and discuss it. Why don't we talk finish talking about the window master plans and then we could go to the meeting with landmarks because they don't really overlap. Oh I guess can I just say that if that's the case, it was civitas who addressed the letter to us with the cc to landmarks, no civilization. We succeed, everybody on our letter, right, Uncle, Tom, Cobley and all right civitas, cc'd. Nobody I just was sent by a Civitas board member a copy of the letter. Okay, so they just the community board, was not copied and had I not been copied. We would not know of it of its existence. Okay, well yeah, I'd like to hear what everybody else has to say, but if the letter was addressed to landmarks I think we should address it. Are you know back to landmarks and Cc civitas, okay, I agree, Michelle I do as well. I'm happy with that. All right, are you Elizabeth? Are you going to draft the letter? Yeah I'll want help from Anthony and Marco, and I'm I can't volunteer them, but I'm sure that they'll help so right. Okay, they just volunteered themselves. Yes, Anthony shaking has said yes, Marco is hiding behind a non-visible screen. So Elizabeth is there further discussion? I, don't know you're going to draft a letter and to landmarks and you're going to have input from fellow Landmarks committee members, and is there any further discussion on this item or should we move along to Elita and the zoom meeting? Well, let's move to a leader, because we also want to see what type of response we get from landmarks after they receive the letter. Absolutely so back over the summer. In response to numerous letters that the board sent to the Landmarks, Preservation Commission will and I had received an invitation to a meeting with Sarah Carroll to talk about some of it, but it made sense to bring some very knowledgeable people from this committee, so Jane and David and Elizabeth joined us in the meeting. A lot of what we talked about was 210 East, 62Nd Street, because, as you remember, it was that building that we took up here in the landmarks committee and also at full board, with a resolution to revoke asking the commission to revoke the permits for an approvals for the work on 210 e 62nd street because of bad behavior and changes in mind and just various things. So that was a big focus of the meeting. The lawyers from the Landmarks Wizard, Commission whoops. Sorry, the lawyers from the Landmarks Preservation Commission are very involved in that particular project, and it is still not set for hearing I understand. Is that correct? Well, but that was the, but that was even without discussing that was a large focus of the meeting. We talked for about I. Think over an hour. I raised the staff approvals because it's not just an issue with this board, but with other boards as well. That too many items are going to staff level approvals and they said it is no more than they've ever had before the 95 percent. I think what did they say? Well, 95 maybe are being handled by it's the same percentage as with within, like two percentage points, yeah I think so yeah. So they were not very receptive to the argument that staff is handling too many things, and that was basically what we had talked about and they made it very clear that if we have future issues with them or future concerns to just call them up and talk to them did I mean we also we there was one. We also discussed the application on three East 89Th Street, the house, that's being converted to an art gallery and the rooftop extension which, in the initial approval, wasn't part of the initial approval and then, of course, it came back as a public hearing instead of a public meeting, which means there's no public input except for letters, and you know they really were not that receptive on that, no, they weren't. In fact, they rejected our efforts to communicate with them and to say that it should come back to the board. They said it was not it's a. It was not a change that merited coming back to the board, and then we had that I'd like to think of it as a little bit snarky response from the owner that she didn't appear and sent a representative in her place that everything was fine, but we disagreed with that, and that was another instance of how the community board is not necessarily given enough recognition or I guess advisory authority with the Landmarks Preservation Commission. There will have been other issues as well, but that's really what my notes pretty much dealt with, because I think in reality the reality Elita is that Sarah Carroll gave nothing. She gave nothing in a very nice way. She said everything we're doing right, which is I. Think to have you change anything. No. It was very nice that they had the meeting with us, but basically I think it was to maybe just say that we're here, if you need us, but we're not going to do anything any differently except maybe for and even then the initial I guess reaction to 62Nd Street was about well. She even went through the regulations with us so that she was clear with us. This is the way it is yes and on individual things. You're right I mean she didn't get on anything individual or general. It was more of a public relations gesture but worth doing I think at the end of the day, I think it was worth doing yeah and she knows we are watch dogs on the Upper East side. I mean that was a great message that really got across that, even if they aren't going to bend for us that they know we're looking at them all the time. Well, maybe on important I mean they're all important, so I don't mean it like that, but maybe there are times when it would be appropriate to take her up on her offer and call when there is an issue, but these are things that we're not the only board in Manhattan. That brings up the staff level approvals and I told her that we are not seeing the same level of applications and other boards have talked about that as well. That just too many things are going to the staff, but she insisted that it was no different than it was other boards have issues with with the same kinds of concerns that we have too many approvals of things like rooftop editions or so we're, not the only ones but well I wonder. Is there a way to track them? I, don't know you know to track the number of actual staff level approvals in our district. Oh sorry, Jane they did show us the number of applications they received year over year and if I recall- and it has been a while and I apologize, the number has actually gone down the number of applications that they received generally, if I remember seeing it, but we could also ask for that. I know that they would share that slide with us because they did have a slide with. This is how many applications we had overall this year and then the next year then the next year- and you know, they're, trying to show that the percentage was always within the same percentage, even as the number went down, but do we know how many applications there are that get submitted that then get approved at the staff level? No, and that seems like a good point that that's something that we should that we should find out, because that would give the evidence about how much is going to staff if we know how many applications they get and how many overall applications are going to the commissioners. I thought they had that slide, but maybe not just for CB8, but I thought they had that slide overall. Well, that would be worth seeing if they do so, maybe you can ask for it. I mean I talked about the window, I, don't know if you remember Jane, because you were particularly fond of the building on in the 90s I think near the oh, that's the J Mclaughlin Store, where they did a very modern that modern second floor was approved at the staff level. Yes, yeah and that I don't know how that happened. You know and I think we wrote a letter about that. We did yeah because they gave us the paint color to approve, and then they took that away too yeah I mean that was to me a really egregious example, but I don't know you know we're now in the time of Covid-19 anyway, I think we should just continue to be harpies down there at the commission. Well, the city will come back and businesses will be there and we saw the really strong improvement I. Think on that building. On Lexington, where we objected to the windows. Remember they took all the multi-pane windows, oh yeah, they came back and they came back with something much better. So I think if you don't mind my saying so that we do need to be to continue to be active and ask for the very best that they can do. I think we need to be active despite the fact that Sarah Carroll didn't get an inch I think the reality is she's on notice. Yes, I think she will therefore be a little bit more sensitive, but number two I think that a lot of the presenters to our committee and to the board have the feeling that we maybe have a little bit more power than we really do. I have the sense that some of the applicants who are very familiar with the process and know that very often the committee and the board are overruled that they just go their merry way and they've been talking with the Landmarks Preservation Commission at a senior level and they think they've got it won they're not about to accommodate us, but others are ready to accommodate us and I think there are others who, whatever their experience level when they know they've done a lousy job, as we pointed out to them, they're willing to come back because they recognize that they haven't done the right job, so I think it's a mixed bag, but I think at least Sarah Carroll's on notice and I. Think when there are issues where we feel really strongly I think we need to maybe make more of it than just a resolution. Maybe it needs a follow-up that says well here's the unanimous resolution, but you have to understand that there's more to it than just the votes. Well, I think that's a good idea to send a follow-up letter after the commission makes its decision in closing our resolution with a cover letter. You know I think that's a good idea, David, it's more beautiful what about before they make their decisions. You mean to send a cover letter with the resolution and send the resolution and I think that if the resolution is just numbers, the fact that it's unanimous says that we voted on you unanimously, but if there is a great deal of passion involved, maybe a cover letter that points out just how passionately the board was, and the public was in the board meeting about this particular situation. It's one thing to look at numbers. It's another thing to feel some of the emotion that's involved. Well, I agree with you. David I was thinking that that's tough, though you know who goes down to the to give our testimony I have on when it's an important topic, I, think or when we're particularly concerned that they won't go the way that we went like the hotel whales, for instance, that rooftop edition, possibly the on 96th and park, that building on the south, the southeast corner and other ones as well. I've gone down there, but I went down there on the the rule, the rules amendment and that's what also what we asked about, which was why that we needed it wasn't just that there were staff level approvals, but that we needed more community input for staff level approvals, and that was the reason that the first iteration of rule amendments were not accepted was because there was such a community outcry. The second ones were supposed to accommodate public interest, but there doesn't seem to be a space for it. So we made that point well, here's another thing that we don't exact, or at least I, don't know if we, as the community board, vote one way and this LPC votes another way. Do we get that information like do? We know exactly I mean we know for the freak or we know for the hotel, whales or whatever, but for the other lesser issues that we care about, do we get a summary sheet? We don't really and keep track statistically, and then we could write a letter once a year to the commission. That says the commission voted this way and x, Y and Z, but the board position was different and we represent the community and if you remember a number of years ago, we had an intern max who did that study and he found out that the that the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the board were in sync with about 85 of the applications? Well, that's pretty good, which wasn't bad I think it may have been. Eight I think he was in the 83 to 87 range wow, the idea being that we were reasonably in sync, but sometimes they made adjustments. Well, that's a pretty good percentage, well yeah, but it's the 15 percent that they don't approve, that the mistakes that you live forever and we don't want them to approve sorry, David and Jane. Michelle and Elizabeth have had their hands up, I, don't know and then Christina, please. Yes, thank you me Michelle yeah, yes, I! Have it yeah now what I was going to say is what precipitated all this and trying to get to see them and have an appointment with them is because of the couple of egregious mistakes. We felt that they made and in our original letter to them we gave them those addresses and we told them that had this come before us, we would never have approved. It was windows, and we also made the point that in the past such a thing would have come before us. So I, you know, she's got the stats and she could tell us two percent or it's all the same or whatever, but in our anecdotal experience it really isn't the same. So, for me the issue is to get notice of. What's coming to the staff prior to the staff, making a decision is there a way we can ask the commission to notify CB8. If other boards don't request this, then it won't be a massive undertaking, but if they have something coming before them that we ask that our office be notified and then we can look at the plans and then we could get ahead of it. You know we can write about it before the staff sees it because they do send them yeah. We do receive that, but we don't hear it and it's also on the Lpc's website, but it's just sent in a giant spreadsheet. Oh, so is there a way we can isolate it and get it to us I guess it doesn't always coincide with our landmarks meeting. You know with our committee meeting, but if we could at least get it and circulate some kind of a heads up, because, frankly, after the staff level approves it, you know you can't take anything away. Our letter could show our outrage, but the practical result of that is not going to change anything. The staff is not going to pull back on their decision because they got a letter from us after the fact so I think. If we get that information monthly, we have to maybe figure out a little internal routine that we have in order to give everybody a heads up. Look at the plans feed some commentary that Jane and David does that and then let them write and how we feel about it. I don't know what this does with our sunshine laws, I mean. Do we then have to request that they come to us, or can we offer an opinion if we're meeting in that way via email, I, don't know what that has to do. You know with the open meetings rule and all that kind of thing, but it just seems to me that if we have the information, I thought we didn't even get it, but now I'm happy to say we get it so now I think we have to figure out what to do with it. If I could just interject, we can't have meetings by email. That is a violation of the open meetings law yeah, that's what I'm thinking, but is there a way that it you know it won't come up? That often, is there a way we can. If we get such information that we can call a meeting with that one agenda, item, I, don't think it's going to be dozens every month. If it happens, you know once or twice every couple of months. I think that's something we can handle I think we should, if that's what you know if we're asking them: they're not I, had spoken to Sarah Carroll at Hdc's anniversary party and I had a one-on-one conversation about this and expressed to her that I really don't understand why things that are approved at the staff level since they're meeting multiple times with the applicant anyway, why it can't come to the board, I didn't think I couldn't figure out and I asked her. You know what was extra work about that on her part or anything like that. She didn't have a satisfactory answer. She was very nice and very responsive, so she knows how we feel about it, but she didn't offer anything practical, but I think we should do that. I think that if we get the info that we should have an interim meeting to discuss that one property, it doesn't have to be a long meeting. At least that would really show her that we're interesting that we're interested that we're really following it and we picked this up and now we're writing I, think that would be the way to go yeah. Let me know when you're ready to move on to other people, yeah I'm done Elizabeth and then Christina, okay, I, don't think that there's anything in that require if we see an application that looks substantial, I, don't think, there's anything in the sunshine laws that require us to inquire about it and ask if we should see it. The thing that I wanted to bring up is the terribly low standards that applied and I brought up the two Ogden Cardman buildings on my block on 95th street, between Fifth and Madison that about six years ago the applicant wanted a canopy. It came to us, it came to the commission. It was a perfectly terrible idea. We turned it down. The commission turned it down that a canopy was inappropriate, a building the other cardman or one of the there three on the block, the other cardman building I woke up one day and there was a canopy and the rationale that we were given after our meeting and that we were sent and sent around to. Everybody really was that before designation, it had a canopy, it did not have a canopy even at the time of designation, but the canopy, an inappropriate canopy prior to designation, gave the precedent for staff level to approve this inappropriate canopy when the whole commission had disapproved one years ago. So I think that the precedent or the standard that anything that existed prior to designation, creates a precedent to put up purple front doors with orange polka dots for all. We know it's I, think that is the lowest standard. I've ever heard of and single-pane tilt and turn Windows existed all over these pre-designated buildings. We get those I think that standard scared me to death and I, don't know how we deal with it, but that was the worst. The standard was so horrible Christina. If Elizabeth is done, yeah no well I agree with Elizabeth on that canopy I. Remember it well and that simply fell through the cracks. Elizabeth and shouldn't have happened. I, don't I guess was tyranny. The chair, then I can't remember anyway. I do want to make a comment, a couple of things that Sarah Carroll, how fortunate we are and I told them mayor personally at Gracie Mansion one evening of his appointment of Sarah, because she has the most experience and the most competent landmark. Commissioner, we've ever had in the time I've served on the board and the time I was chair 15 years, the landmarks Foundation and you know how lucky we are and I think we should keep that in mind as and that we want to make sure our voice is heard and that we don't overreach I mean we are not the commissioners even if we'd like to be. We are not, and we are very good stewards of this. Most important landmark community in the city, and they know that we have the most and the most important landmarks in the committee. I always used to say that to Bob Tierney when I spoke, I would say it from the podium and I've said it to Sarah as well, and so, but we don't want to overreach and because then we don't have as strong a voice. If we do that, and we have to keep in mind that Sarah is running an agency- a very important one, completely online, and you know that I had a long chat yesterday with Marjorie Perlmutter head of the BSA. It is not an easy task for these people to run an agency virtually successfully and the architects that I've spoken to while they miss seeing the commissioners face to face. They are very pleased of how it's going and so I think this is all just we have to keep you know. We have to keep this in mind, we're in a different occult time, they're doing an outstanding job. She's the most experienced commissioner, that we've had in the last 25 years, and so you know, let's keep it balanced so that we don't lose our important voice. Thank you. I'd like to quickly echo what Christine has said because I, despite anything else, I've said tonight about how tough Sarah Carol was in that meeting. That doesn't mean that she's not the best landmarks. Commissioner, we've had in a long time, because I dealt with Sarah as an architect many times and I dealt with tyranny, and so on down the line. And, yes, we are fortunate. We have Sarah and the reality is the head. She has no choice but I think to take the stand that she did with us. That doesn't mean she's, not on notice, but it was important that we met with her, but it's also important that we do understand just how good she is because she really is good at it. The other thing is the practicality. You know the people who do the the reviews for certificates of no effect. There are rules and regulations and precedents that they go with and they're, not always perfect about it. But the whole point is that, if it's a certificate of appropriateness, it goes to the commissioners for the kind of major judgment calls that are required if it's, if there's just not enough time for the commissioners, to look at everything. Therefore, there's a clear separation, sometimes not so clear about what does go negative, no effect to the staff level. So if we're going to try to influence something that happens at staff level and I think we have to have a very good reason to want to do it number one mainly. We think it does require a different kind of judgment level and belongs, then staff level should be making or number two. It is such an important building that, whatever it is, that's going to have a visual major visual effect on it. That is something that can be done as a certificate of no effect. Maybe it should rise to a certificate of appropriateness level. In any event, all I'm saying is that it's very I think we have to tread carefully because the commission is set up to make judgments and decisions in relation to the level of change that is being suggested with respect to the applications in all five boroughs. You know it's not just us. Well, you know. I Christina I appreciate what you're saying I appreciate what David is saying: nobody's calling into question: Miss Carroll's professionalism, always with the community with city government with other agencies with er, it's a political job, and she knows it and she has a huge agency to run, but that doesn't mean that we abdicate any responsibility at all, as the watchdog for the beautiful neighborhoods that we live in on the Upper East side, so I am would take a stronger line respecting her always. But if we are in disagreement, there's nothing wrong with raising our voice about it. I agree with that. I didn't want you to think I'd disappear, but I disagreed with that and I. Don't think. Christina disagrees well Christina. What is your point? No I mean you know, I'm a stalwart of this community. I've lived in Carnegie hall 45 years, but you know I voted with the way the commission voted on the hotel, Wales and I walk by it every single day, and the commission agreed with how I felt and the community did not I mean you know, and I've been a part of this community longer than people who voted up for the whales. So you know there's different passions right and so you know we respect different viewpoints but, of course, we're going to be strong stewards for this precious landmarks. On the Upper East side we have the most historic districts. We have everything and I think they appreciate that we do watch it well. I want to mention. Also Sarah talked about expanding landmarks and bringing it into other boroughs in different kinds of communities that previously have not had landmark buildings, because with the feeling that if communities of people of color or immigrant communities see landmarks in their own areas, that they will, it will I guess elevate the nature of landmarks, the appreciation of landmarks, the entire city being behind designations and preservation, and that it's important for the inclusion of certain commun of communities that have not otherwise been as included as as areas in the city in the landmarks area. Never in the landmarks umbrella, I guess. Nevertheless, it's hard to know to comment on items going to staff without knowing what those items are, as Michelle pointed out and we did make, there was a very large voice to get community input into staff level. Dis approvals. So writing a letter, whether it's something that rises to the status of the building of 3, East 89Th street, or something like far less significant or no for noteworthy buildings are. It should be part of what they consider given that was supposed to be included in the new rules was a way for communities to be involved. I'm not sure that it's necessary to take your time or the committee's time in doing that, but it's supposed to exist as a way to maintain the stewardship and to review what's going on and to be able to have input into the sometimes quite large decisions that staff is making. So the first step would seem to be to find out what they're doing and have a method for the board or this committee rather to be able to review it, because we can't do it by email. Knowing about it is not sending around information from the Landmarks Commission is not a violation of as far as I know of the open meetings law, but deciding whether to how the committee feels about something I think from what I've learned would be. You can set an agenda through email. You can not decide on an agenda item on how to vote for an agenda item yeah, but the first step would be to find out what's its staff. Sherry has her hand up I, make determinations and open public meetings Laura all the time. You can certainly distribute the material, but you can't have a meeting. In other words, you can't send emails back and forth where you're discussing it that becomes a meeting, but you certainly can distribute any material that needs to be evaluated and then have an actual meeting where you can discuss it. That's not a problem at all yeah, but people once they get. It start discussing it back and forth by email. Well, they can't do that. Well, they do it. Well, that's the problem. You need that's what that's when an attorney tells the group that is not permitted, you can not do. That is in violation of the meeting open meetings law, but it's never been an issue with the applicants that come before the landmarks committee. We have the materials we look at them. There's never been an issue of improper correspondence among committee members and I. Think getting the material and having a discussion of should this go on the agenda. Maybe is not a violation as much as what do we. It depends on the broadness of what will said and I don't know. We could certainly conv confer with the borough president's office on that, but deciding whether something is what the response should be would be, but we're not there yet, because we don't have a way or we don't have a an efficient way of finding out what those items are and if even if we find out that they're looking at a window on Madison Avenue, where are the plans are? Is it public, if they're just at staff level, I, don't know that and I'm sorry plans are not public. It's just the application. Description, I believe Anthony probably knows more than I. Do he does he's nothing? He said yes, he does, but he's muted. Yes, I think you know it's easy to get a description of what the application is. It's a lot more complicated to try and get the only things, I think that are easily available and maybe are those presentation, materials that go before the actual commissioners. So we need, if we're going, to weigh in or I mean in terms of thinking about process, and maybe we could email about process it's important to have a timeline or know when things come and how to see them as best we can just for the record if I can intercede for one second one month, my internet was fine after a month ago, but it seems that my internet is becoming very unstable. Again. I've lost half of the conversation in the last 10 or 15 minutes. So if I disappear, you'll know why and I'll try to get it fixed again for Wednesday night, but I'm having a very big problem again and Jane. Can we make sure for our own process? This is Christina again that we ask questions that are within our purview and not outside the purview of landmarks. Are you discussing the wall that was to be taken between well, it's tricky on zoom and we haven't I was discussing and I just we having a big election on Wednesday night and I wasn't about to interfere with anyone's comments tonight so my hand as I was just going to say. If I can I be heard, yes yeah, if something is going to go before the commission, we don't have a problem because then it automatically we know about it because it comes to us first so that that's not the issue is the stuff that's going to be presented at at the staff level. So now we it's good. We found out that all we get is recognition of what the item is that we don't see plans, but if, in the description it says replacing a bay window with one over one, you know what I mean. If the plan is descriptive enough- and we see that in advance- then I guess we can ask for the plans, you know otherwise the plans. If it's going in front of the commissioners, the plans come out the Friday before the Tuesday meeting- that's not enough time for us anyway, but it's irrelevant, because we get that information. It's the stuff. That's going to the staff that we're trying to get a hold of so I guess, step number one I would suggest that we just try to follow. What's coming, you know that listing that we'll refer to that comes in that. If we see that, if will could send out the addresses to the whole committee when it comes out and then we can look at the descriptions and decide whether or not the co-chairs can decide whether or not we want to look into it further. Hopefully the description is enough to at least give us that much guidance if it isn't and we're, but we're peaked in some way. We can request more information in our experience. Just so, you know when we do certificates of no effect, primarily we're sending in the drawings, so whatever they use to describe the drawings may or may not be the whole gist of what we're putting in. But when we put in for a certificate of no effect, it's based upon the fact that it doesn't require certificate of appropriateness, but knowing what our firm is putting in typically is probably no different than what most firms do. It tends to be a different level of presentation. Quality than what has to be done for a certificate of appropriateness can actually be a set of construction documents which can be read by the reviewers, because they're trained to do that. So I think it's going to be very difficult. I'm not saying we shouldn't try to understand, what's happening through well to go backwards based upon the kinds of drawings that I know are typical for certificates of no effect, it's going to be very hard to find out what the true scope of what that certificate of null effect is about. So I'm not saying we shouldn't try to find out, but I'm saying it's a lot different than looking at the presentation, drawings for a certificate of appropriateness, because they're very often done at a different level. They're done sometimes just to the construction documents level, and sometimes it may be done as a what I'll call a feasibility study to see when we go to landmarks, whether it requires a certificate of no effect or a certificate of appropriateness, but once it's deemed to be a certificate of no effect, it doesn't require the same level. David and Jane David she's, read and reviewed by somebody who's familiar with reading drawings. Well, David, I, don't know what do you think the next step should be or Michelle I, don't think we I think we should give it a try. Okay, so I think if we know I think I'm sorry to interrupt John I just think we knew that the buildings what buildings were involved, even if the descriptions were not very good, we would know which, perhaps of the more right which would be more pressing to deal with. So why don't we give it a try and work out a little system for ourselves see how it plays out over the next couple of months. Would you guys like to see what we receive I? Have it pulled up? If you want to see it? Oh sure, okay, so we receive a usually you know, 15 to 20 page document that'll, give us everything. That's in the course of a month. It'll show us the permits that were issued, so you can click on these pdfs and you just see the permit. It doesn't show you the descriptions or the drawings. It just shows you the permit that they issue, I'm sure most of you are familiar with that. So you'll see you know, there's a bunch of those certificate of no effect. You know authorization to proceed, Et cetera, you know when they file for the certificate of no effect is that published so we'll scroll down, you see, filed applications down further, and so you can go through and you see it's under review and it just says you know miscellaneous amendment certificate or no effect a work, type interior alterations, work type, you know, so you would see the address which historic district it's in what approval they're looking for and then we can scroll down you see these are all of the applications that they currently have before it that are still under review. Did you notice if 1025 park is on this yeah, so I have a question if I may, when do you get this, because in order for us to have any impact at all, we'd have to get this? Have you or max, or somebody go through it and pull out? Will you get it I, guess and figure out? Well, we can share it with everybody, but we receive it. This one was received on November, the 4th and I. Don't want to throw a new one under the bus here, but I do forward it to you, Elita, Jane and David. Yes, I see it I do see it, but I see that too, when I I've looked through it, but I'm looking at this, for instance, filed on October 14th 20, East 69th street for telecommunications equipment, and we know it says nothing about it or the next one, 1024, Lexington, restoration and other facade work, roof work, there's nothing additions and new construction for 870 Madison. There is so little detail for some of these things, that how could we and it's- and these were all filed in Mid-October? Well, they would be also under review for if they need and correct me, if I'm wrong folks who've done this on the architect side. It's also under review to see if it needs a public hearing as well right Anthony. Yes, so we don't know what they're really so, maybe the blank ones are where it's under review, for whether it needs a public hearing and where it says it's the certificate of no effect and then, if they disagree with that, if it says under review, even if they disagree with the owner, designates it as whether that's what they're looking for or does landmarks designate it generally speaking architect. Generally speaking, you know based upon the scope of what you are proposing, whether it's a certificate of no effect or a certificate of appropriateness. Sometimes there are some marginal conditions where it might be under review or under discussion as to which way to go, and sometimes you get a hybrid and we've seen a lot of hybrids and the hybrids are you know, 70 of this application was approved as a certificate of no effect or it's being approved as a certificate of no effect and you're going to rule on the other 30 percent. In terms of the resolution that you come up with or you'll make a recommendation on the 30, that's a certificate of appropriateness and I. Think when you see the hybrids that have been coming through to us, you get a pretty good idea of what most of the certificates of no effect are all about. Are we done with this I can't take it off the screen, I think so. I think we need to figure out what a definite next step is and go from there. It seems like we're, maybe a letter to landmarks asking if we can have access to projects that they're reviewing at the staff level. I don't know. Maybe we should just think about this until next month. Well, it would follow with the meeting that we had Jane, where we asked for more input into staff level decisions to ask for more information about the staff level decisions. Well, that would how about a letter from the board yeah I could write one. Thank you Alita for volunteering, I appreciate it. No, you know, I have the resolution to write up. We have a big meeting on Wednesday night, as we all know, I, like writing the letters, so I don't object. Well, maybe we should circulate a draft to all the committee members and they could have some input. I always do I, never send anything out without a whole bunch of eyes on it for the record, because I'm assuming we're still being recorded. Yes, we are, we know you do your best work at 1 am in the morning. That's early. No, it's just what they like to hear. I'm sure you know, Wednesday is going to be a long meeting a later I think wait till December or something and I don't even know whether it has to go to the board for approval I think it happened. It doesn't have to go to the board you're, just asking for additional information, I think as soon as you can get to it. As soon as you can do it in your schedule, you know get it out, I, don't think it needs to go to the board. Well, it'll! Go to you guys! Okay, that's great! So thank you elite. Is there a move to adjourn everybody wants to stay on and he raised his hand. Thank you, Anthony! Is there a second welcome. Thank you. Okay. Thank you guys. Everybody will I won't get my resolution in until tomorrow afternoon. Just so, you know okay, tomorrow afternoon. Thank you. You're welcome.
