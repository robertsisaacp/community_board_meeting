, it's a brief presentation and then, as I mentioned, there's a number of members and the project team on the video We represent Barry's bootcamp in this application to the New York City Board of standards and appeals seeking a special permit to allow a gym.
If approved, only Barry's bootcamp as the applicant would be permitted to operate this specific gym and any changes that you know we're made or would need to be made would have to go back before the BSA for an amendment and actually come have to come back before the community board.
First As we ask all public members to give, And, then I'd like to ask that no one called a question until everyone has had an opportunity to speak, please so, if anyone's raised their hand and intends to well ask for a resolution, actually I'd like to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak before we get to that point.
With, respect to you, know, Koba, 19, related precautions, I'll, let Adam chime in in a moment, but I'll just say that you know gyms are, you know, won't be permitted to reopen until phase 4, which you know is uncertain at this time and that the state has yet and the city have yet to release specific guidelines related to gym reopening what we anticipate Limited capacity, ventilation, requirement for personal protective gear for patrons and instructors, and just intense cleaning like we're.
Talking about it, a previous school board meeting, which is the idea of having the virtual meeting versus in-person meeting, and this is all presuming that the governor will at some point make us go back to the open meetings law with the exemption.
I am supporting a hybrid if people want to travel to community board meetings, they should, for others who wish to participate.
If, you would milk unmute her will and is there anyone else from the public that would like to comment on the nature for board meetings, whether they should be virtual or hybrid, or only in person once the restriction is lifted.
We cannot overlook the fact that when you were at a personal meeting when you're in person, there is the opportunity to connect with other people to truly be a community, whether it's in the audience or people who have been speaking to have aside conversations to make connections and to work out problems.
Pope Marshall, because we don't have a vaccine As long as there is this health risk, no matter what officials are saying, I mean when schools really can open I think that's an indication that perhaps we're safe or not necessarily what the president is saying, You know on a more local when we see that we're really safe.
I also agree with what Barbara added about timeline that if we are going to offer any type of guidance in a resolution of what we think the sort of Governors open, meeting laws should look like or what the future should look.
I think the requirement is social, have six feet of social distancing will really substantially limit the capacity of the New York Blood Center and before we even think about being able to return in person whenever were allowed to by the open meeting law that we really need to be able to figure out what that does in terms of capacity and Whether or not that limits additional participation of people attending so That said.
You know that the attendance is better than it's easier for parents, that it's easier for the disabled, and So I just don't think that that's an issue, So I, would very much support, always being able to do virtual meetings.
If you would bear with me and allow switching back and forth to the members of the public who have raised their hands And, so I'm going to put you on hold for a second Chuck and Wilma We could do that again because there were people, who've raised their hands, so let's go to you Andrew and Then Betty and I think one of the key important factors that comes with the Open Meeting Law is that we are better able to find consensus when there's an audience that is either cheering or clapping or disagreeing.
I know, for me, I'm, only able to message will which is lovely, but it's not a totally open group discussion, so I would be in favor of a hybrid model in the future, because that allows both consensus that you get when you are in person which provides us with information on a variety of issues, but Regarding online availability under the current pause of the open meetings, law, I, think and I could be mistaken-.
This is very convenient for everyone doing this way, but it doesn't really give people they're, really good information about how the board works and whether those people who would not have had a chance to speak if they were at the open meeting, but they would have sit, sat there with their friends.
I. Think it's very important for the board to have the meetings where people will come and.
Joe I lived at 4:15 East 85th Street between first to New, York, Avenue's, I've, been attending board meetings in person and now virtually for the last couple of years.
We can just keep on going everyone's at home, I'm, well, aware of that, and we are working on it too, and it fluctuates with the number of issues in how controversial they are and other people may differ, but I like to make sure that people everyone has attempts to speak.
A war is a war, and we have enough time it's seen to try to work on making the more so that when we can't find a spot to have our meetings, because it's getting harder and harder to find a space big enough to accommodate the board and everybody else, maybe one every two months or a year a month or every three months they can have a virtual meeting.
You know with new technology that was not contemplated when open meetings law was developed and that certainly was not contemplated when the Community Board process was developed.
You know what should an open meeting look like in the future inclusive of what our norms and expectations of board members in terms of in person versus virtual participation.
You know, and one of the things that we can benefit from this experience is how do we use this experience to move forward and create greater access on a long-term basis and one small point: I personally participated in community board meetings when there were too many speakers for everybody to be heard.
Don't think that being virtual absolutely requires that every single person necessarily be heard, but that's the kind of thing that might go into a set of recommendations for how to leverage technology to remove barriers of participation in the future, even after, were able to have gatherings of unlimited numbers of people.
I just want to say that I think that we should keep virtual meetings until the vaccine has been tested, and the other thing is that several of us have to take public transportation to the meeting How. Do we accommodate those who are unable to participate while there are barrier or and address some of the barriers that may prevent some people from doing it in person at a time where we are able to meet so talking about not only just as current koban 19 environments, but beyond that, so, for example, if someone days under the weather we're all much more sensitive towards fighting germs, and even when this whole crisis is over, hopefully we'll all have learned our lessons that, if anyone's feeling sick, they just stay home, and sometimes we all want to be there- We're all invested in the community board and we all want to participate.
Should we be out of an in-person meeting if we're not feeling a hundred percent, a hybrid format would work same if someone has a childcare issue and can't find a babysitter or needs to be able to be home for some other family situation, but otherwise would be out of meetings.
And I think we'd have to work through the issues of how do we make sure that we allow the public to participate if they are participating remotely, but in a way where it doesn't slow things down?
If you had to attend every meeting in person, I would hate to have to put him through that and how would we make sure that we can, if the point of this would be to get the public to be able to participate and the members to be able to vote, to make sure that we had mechanisms in place to allow both things to happen without causing meetings to go till all hours of the evening?
Valerie well, I just wanted to say that I think you know just going back to Adele Bartlett when she said about open meetings law in the key words Craig that you read or stated, or that you can participate.
The best of all possible worlds is an in-person meeting where we can evaluate all the people who have come and to speak out on an issue, but I think it's important for the community board to have the live streaming option so that people actually know that we exist I mean it was interesting at the transportation committee meeting to hear people talk about how they never gone to one or whatever, and in my opinion, even though they participated, virtually.
Everyone I, don't know to evaluate issues and the way that they are supposed to be evaluated, whether it's a community board level, whether it's at the House of Representatives, Whether it's at the city, council, public hearing and MTA public hearing in person meetings are the best.
That in this way, that there does have to be some special accommodations for people who do need to speak on issues who, for whatever reason, can't be there to make it It certainly is a way that we've all been able, through many facets of our lives, stay connected not only with business, not only with community boards, but with family and friends.
I. Think that the fact that community board meetings and committee meetings livestream the public is a pret is a prized of what we are doing.
A lot of you who have been on the board when they know how strongly I believe in open meeting law.
It was part of the New York Department of State, and this is some horror stories about what happens throughout the state when people try to have closed meetings and don't invite the public So I wouldn't want anybody to fool around with it and any really any major changes in the open meeting law changes you make have to be very carefully.
I'm have public meetings where we go Yet until we probably have the vaccine, but it's a very important issue to me- It's, not completely open, and we wouldn't want to change the state law, because it's think of all these places throughout the state that would love to have all closed.
And I think that the that means a few more meetings, maybe even working groups with people who want to explore some more of these digital options before we dive into really making recommendations?
You're, not urinated, okay, I think you know last time we kept going on and on it's an important conversation to have.
And I think your idea sounds very intriguing, except that I think the idea would violate the open meetings law, which is that even committees can't formulate resolutions in advance of even to propose I'm, not sure about having a board meeting without the public being invited to discuss these things would be a good idea, but it's something that could be looked.
Why there'd be an open meetings problem, because why not just have an ad-hoc committee that meets publicly on zoom' to discuss these things, but here's my only concern about that, because otherwise I think it's a good idea.
Don't know what the Manhattan borough president office is doing right now, but there should be maybe something run centrally out of the MVPs office to talk about what the community boards can do going forward and whether we can make a united front to request the funding.
You know we create a sort of and made risk to our democratic institutions by suddenly going back to in-person meetings and shutting a lot of people out.
Let's have a committee to discuss it, It'll be a great vehicle for people to get expertise and really think these things through with the time this issue deserves, and maybe it ought to be run out of the borough president's office even putting together all the Manhattan community, boards.
Don't know what the answer is: And I, don't think anyone is suggesting that people come back to a meeting without proper person without a vaccine or without proper precautions because of the health risks.
I'm all ears, not right this second, but in general, okay, I'd, like to turn to the last item on the agenda, which is a conversation on how the board could better support the black members of our community and black businesses within our community.
So I, just think every single committee should be able to come up and maybe send you some ideas of what we want to do.
Businesses are businesses that are owned by people of color, I, don't know there would be any interest in community board a spearheading, some sort of efforts to promote them or have put it put out as some sort of flyer or sticker or poster that could be put in Windows of any business that wishes to participate, indicating that it is black owned business or business owned by a by people of color, so People, so the general population would know and may seek them out in order to try to frequent them, and it goes back to our general issue with also just not always knowing who owns any business And if the end that, if a seemingly small business isn't, is or isn't what it appears to be, and then the other thing, which is slightly off topic But, have we ever considered having some sort of perhaps task force for people of color or something that will allow community to address issues regarding people of color and whether it be promoting businesses or other issues that are faced with, based on a regular basis like these matters and stuff, and such but things that are more systemic.
We, have our committees that are able to plan and talk about and come to some kind of resolution or how forums with speakers on various local issues right now, but I'm, listening to everybody, And I think there's an effort, and maybe it's rightly so, to see what the work the committees can do.
But I do think there may be an appropriate time for us to consider whether a community board Rachel does justice committee or Task Force is warranted, but let's start first with the committee's.
Let's find ways to reach out to the people in our community or black and brown, who don't necessarily look like this community board, but you know we know there in our community.
They may not might not always come to our meetings, but they're, you know, And I think we have an obligation to meet them where they are and not expect them to come to our community board.
Think, it's very important for a community that isn't primary, that isn't majority people, color majority black for us to be having these conversations to it, makes it bigger.
That way we can at least identify second thing: I do want to figure back on what Billie was saying, because I think it really is important to we're talking about it now as a group and then to take it back to the to the committee level.
I agree that the work of supporting lot community members and business owners should be undertaken by all committees.
You know this opportunity citywide to ensure that not only are we attracting black community members and more of them, but we're attracting people who represent an intersection of a number of identities, including, hopefully more LGBTQA?
And I need to work relentlessly in support of you, know, addressing systemic racism, I'm starting kind of framing my thoughts in that way, because I think this community board, as folks have you know, have said you know, is, does not appear by virtue of a quick glance to be the most diverse board and I.
I think the committee's are a great venue for that, but the starting point has to be that there is a collective understanding, perhaps and a statement to be made to say that this board values understands that, creates that it What its job is and that is to represent the needs of its community at the same time, I.
So I, just really echo the things that I've heard and would love to see having people brought in either call to you know, ask what could be helpful and bring in those community members to adhere their voices and thank you, yeah.
I think we have a real opportunity, like Sondra, just said, to really make something more of this and not have it be a Manhattan Board thing, but a cb8 thing, because right now, while we're meeting, hundreds of our community members, are at Carl, Schurz Park, marching to support racial equity and justice.
That's, not just supporting a black owned business, but it's the board having a mission statement about racial equity, injustice and the work we want to do to write past wrongs in our neighborhood, be it with zoning or transportation access or education and equity, and for the task force.
You sure I, really like the idea that believe would forth about a passport I think we should maybe allow the committee to work a little on doing some things first before a task force, because a task force is a smaller amount of people and they don't meet as much and the committees would allow a lot more people to gather information and go back and forth thoughts and then eventually a task force to be used.
And I want to make sure that we've got some sense of where we're going as a board on these important issues.
I'd like to ask the committee's, as people have suggested, to come up with a plan to look at to tackle the issues pertaining to the committee that relate to social justice.
If you have ideas about other people who either can advise- Or it could be on the task force, then please email, those suggestions as well, because the time is right and we are leaders in the community and in this and in the borough and in the city, and we should be doing something or many things so and for Loraine.
Okay, Wilma green without food I really think that at this time not a task, force, I think there's going to be a lot of work to be done in their community committee and I.
