That's shown on the plans, if approved, only Barry's bootcamp as the applicant would be permitted to operate this specific gym and any changes that you know we're made or would need to be made would have to go back before the BSA for an amendment and actually come have to come back before the community board.
First As we ask all public members to give, Please so, if anyone's raised their hand and intends to well ask for a resolution, actually I'd like to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak before we get to that point.
With, respect to you, know: Koba, 19, related precautions, I'll, let Adam chime in in a moment, but I'll just say that you know gyms are, you know, won't be permitted to reopen until phase 4, which you know is uncertain at this time and that the state has yet and the city have yet to release specific guidelines related to Gym reopening what we anticipate Limited capacity, ventilation, requirement for personal protective gear for patrons and instructors and just intense cleaning like we're.
Let's talk about what we started talking about it, a previous school board meeting, which is the idea of having the virtual meeting versus in- person meeting, and this is all presuming that the governor will at some point make us go back to the open meetings law with the exemption.
It's very important to have meetings in which it's really easy to participate in And I believe that there are others like they are out there in terms of community board members as well as members of the public, who believe the same as I.
If people want to travel to community board meetings.
We, have the longest commutes and I've been doing this now for a while, but I want you to know that I have enjoyed and appreciated every single day that I have ever attended a community board.
Second Avenue subway helps with shaving off 15 minutes of that My preference is to attend community board meetings and to be present because I enjoy them.
If, you would milk unmute her will and is there anyone else from the public that would like to comment on the nature for board meetings, whether they should be virtual or hybrid, or only in person once the restriction is lifted.
And I really appreciated the remarks of Miss Bob Marshall I want to make sure that when it is safe to do so that we are able to have an in- person option always available And I do think that a hybrid meeting is certainly feasible.
We can not overlook the fact that when you were at a personal meeting when you're in person, there is the opportunity to connect with other people to truly be a community, whether it's in the audience or people who have been speaking to have aside conversations to make connections and to work out problems.
I also agree with what Barbara added about timeline that if we are going to offer any type of guidance in a resolution of what we think the sort of Governors open, meeting laws should look like or what the future should look.
And I personally work for an organization that is nationwide, that has a thousand plus people working all acrosss the country, and when you hold yourself to higher expectations of digital meetings and participation, you can be just as productive But if we're, if what we're concerned about is discipline of board members or participation, then that is a separate issue that we can address by having a conversation and agreeing to norms and expectations and holding ourselves to those expectations.
Does encourage greater participation from the community However, we move forward and the future were not permitted to meet in person that we continue to have a virtual option for people to participate.
I think the requirement is social, have six feet of social distancing will really substantially limit the capacity of the New York Blood Center and before we even think about being able to return in person whenever were allowed to by the open meeting law that we really need to be able to figure out what that does in terms of capacity and Whether or not that limits additional participation of people attending so That said.
You would bear with me and allow switching back and forth to the members of the public who have raised their hands And, so I'm going to put you on hold for a second Chuck and Wilma We could do that again because there were people, who've raised their hands, so let's go to you Andrew and Then Betty and I think one of the key important factors that comes with the Open Meeting Law is that we are better able to find consensus when there's an audience that is either cheering or clapping or disagreeing.
I know, for me, I'm, only able to message will which is lovely, but it's not a totally open group discussion, so I would be in favor of a hybrid model in the future, because that allows both consensus that you get when you are in person which provides us with information on a variety of issues, but Regarding online availability under the current pause of the open meetings, law, I, think and I could be mistaken-.
Just I had assumed that the question had to do with when we will no longer need to be doing this virtually because I think it's very important for people to be present.
This is very convenient for everyone doing this way, but it does not really give people they're, really good information about how the board works and whether those people who would not have had a chance to speak if they were at the open meeting, but they would have sit, sat there with their friends.
I. Think it's very important for the board to have the meetings where people will come and.
Joe I lived at 4:15 East 85Th Street between first to New, York, Avenue's, I've, been attending board meetings in person and now virtually for the last couple of years.
A war is a war, and we have enough time it's seen to try to work on making the more so that when we can't find a spot to have our meetings, because it's getting harder and harder to find a space big enough to accommodate the board and everybody else, maybe one every two months or a year a month or every three months they can have a virtual meeting.
I. Think that that's of like a tale of two city, these thing they're going to have a bunch of people who are maybe have comorbidities who are concerned about their health or of a certain demographic or age or maybe sitting home, and then you'll have a bunch of other people coming together.
So, clearly, a community board meeting an open, long covered meeting can't even be contemplated until we are beyond you know the end of phase 4 and are in a world in which there could be unlimited attendance at one of our meetings.
You know with new technology that was not contemplated when open meetings law was developed and that certainly was not contemplated when the Community Board process was developed.
Basis, and one small point: I personally participated in community board meetings when there were too many speakers for everybody to be heard.
So I do not think that being virtual absolutely requires that every single person necessarily be heard, but that's the kind of thing that might go into a set of recommendations for how to leverage technology to remove barriers of participation in the future, even after, were able to have gatherings of unlimited numbers of people.
Do we accommodate those who are unable to participate while there are barrier or and address some of the barriers that may prevent some people from doing it in person at a time where we are able to meet so talking about not only just as current koban 19 environments, but beyond that, so, for example, if someone days under the weather we're all much more sensitive towards fighting germs, and even when this whole crisis is over, hopefully we'll all have learned our lessons that, if anyone's feeling sick, they just stay home, and sometimes we all want to be there- Should we be out of an in- person meeting if we're not feeling a hundred percent, a hybrid format would work same if someone has a childcare issue and can't find a babysitter or needs to be able to be home for some other family situation, but otherwise would be out of meetings.
And I think we'd have to work through the issues of how do we make sure that we allow the public to participate if they are participating remotely, but in a way where it does not slow things?
Valerie well, I just wanted to say that I think you know just going back to Adele Bartlett when she said about open meetings law in the key words Craig that you read or stated, or that you can participate.
The community board, give them the opportunity to observe through Facebook, but at the same time, show up for things that they feel passionate about in person and, while I think it's.
So, I, guess I go back to Betty and to Chuck and to say you know the best of all possible worlds is an in- person meeting where we can evaluate all the people who have come and to speak out on an issue, but I think it's important for the Community Board to have the live streaming option so that people actually know that we exist I mean it was interesting at the transportation committee meeting to hear people talk about how they never gone to one or whatever, and in my opinion, even though they participated, virtually.
Everyone I do not know to evaluate issues and the way that they are supposed to be evaluated, whether it's a community board level, whether it's at the House of Representatives, whether it's at the City Council public hearing and MTA public hearing in person meetings are the best.
I. Do think, though, that in this way that there does have to be some special accommodations for people who do need to speak on issues who, for whatever reason, can't be there to make it Thank you and stay safe for next month.
I. Think that the fact that community board meetings and committee meetings livestream the public is a pret- is a prized of what we are doing.
First of all, I agree with Michele that we should not have a resolution tonight, but I also want to follow up what Chuck said a lot of you who have been on the board when they know how strongly I believe in open meeting law.
It was part of the New York Department of State, and this is some horror stories about what happens throughout the state when people try to have closed meetings and do not invite the public so I would not want anybody to fool around with it and any really any major changes in the open meeting law changes you make have to be very carefully.
There's a few different issues that play about what's working and what's not working in this virtual platform, And I think that the that means a few more meetings, maybe even working groups with people who want to explore some more of these digital options before we dive into really making recommendations.
I, think you know last time we kept going on and on it's an important conversation to have.
I think we should come up with a plan of what we really want to do in the future, whether it's an in person or both for virtual or hybrid.
Are you suggesting creating a working group to come up with recommendations that could be presented to the board in another special meeting like that?
And I think your idea sounds very intriguing, except that I think the idea would violate the open meetings law, which is that even committees can't formulate resolutions in advance of even to propose I'm, not sure about having a board meeting without the public being invited to discuss these things would be a good idea, but it's something that could be looked.
That I think was right on the money starting with Sharon, and you know: I think it makes a lot of sense to have a working group or a committee.
And I do not know what the Manhattan borough president Office is doing right now, but there should be maybe something run centrally out of the MVPs office to talk about what the community boards can do going forward and whether we can make a united front to request the funding.
You know we create a sort of and made risk to our democratic institutions by suddenly going back to in- person meetings and shutting a lot of people out.
Let's have a committee to discuss it It'll be a great vehicle for people to get expertise and really think these things through with the time this issue deserves, and maybe it ought to be run out of the borough president's office even putting together all the Manhattan community boards, but I do not think this is something for us to resolve in this meeting right now.
And I do not think anyone is suggesting that people come back to a meeting without proper person without a vaccine or without proper precautions because of the health risks.
So I would rather just talk about what happened once it's safe to go back to over some meetings and Alita I meant to call the question when the tabling issue: Billy, yes, is that it okay So then, unless Berry, is that what you're doing are you second thing?
I'm all ears, not right this second, but in general, okay, I'd, like to turn to the last item on the agenda, which is a conversation on how the board could better support the black members of our community and black businesses within our community.
Just think every single committee should be able to come up and maybe send you some ideas of what we want to do, but I would I would like to hear that, of course, and I have asked committees to, and not with respect as much but before to come up with ideas and talk about things.
That really needs to be discussed holistically in terms of holistic, discussion, I've reached out to all of the Manhattan community boards for joint participation in programs and borough- wide programs on issues of racial equity, social justice and more than half have responded.
We, have our committees that are able to plan and talk about and come to some kind of resolution or how forums with speakers on various local issues right now, but I'm.
But I do think there may be an appropriate time for us to consider whether a community board Rachel does justice, Committee or Task.
Let's find ways to reach out to the people in our community or black and brown, who do not necessarily look like this community board, but you know we know there in our community.
They may not might not always come to our meetings, but they're, you know, And I think we have an obligation to meet them where they are and not expect them to come to our community board.
And I think that Billy touched on this and more specifically with black owned businesses, but with our communities overall and certainly how we interact with each other on the board.
That way, we can at least identify second thing: I do want to figure back on what Billie was saying, because I think it really is important to we're talking about it now as a group and then to take it back to the to the committee level.
I agree that the work of supporting lot community members and business owners should be undertaken by all committees.
Think, a fundamental question for me: is: how does how do we as a community board and how does the network of community boards broadly acrosss the city promote community board participation like where And you know this opportunity citywide to ensure that not only are we attracting black community members and more of them, but we're attracting people who represent an intersection of a number of identities, including.
And I need to work relentlessly in support of you, know, addressing systemic racism, I'm starting kind of framing my thoughts in that way, because I think this community board, as folks have you know, have said you know, is, does not appear by virtue of a quick glance to be the most diverse board and I.
I think the committee's are a great venue for that, but the starting point has to be that there is a collective understanding, perhaps and a statement to be made to say that this board values understands that, creates that it What its job is and that is to represent the needs of its community at the same time, I.
So I, just really echo the things that I've heard and would love to see having people brought in either call to you know, ask what could be helpful and bring in those community members to adhere their voices and thank you, yeah.
I think we have a real opportunity, like Sondra, just said, to really make something more of this and not have it be a Manhattan Board thing, but a CB8 thing, because right now, while we're meeting, hundreds of our community members, are at Carl, Schurz Park, marching to support racial equity and justice.
That's, not just supporting a black owned business, but it's the board having a mission statement about racial equity, injustice and the work we want to do to write past wrongs in our neighborhood, be it with zoning or transportation access or education and equity, and for the task force.
It's really incumbent on the community board as a whole, not just to say We care about black businesses, but we care in general about this issue and we're going to take it.
Respect that the other point I would like to raise is social equity, many time in the community war they coming to us, and they said we wanna feel more for more of your area.
You sure I, really like the idea that believe would forth about a passport I think we should maybe allow the committee to work a little on doing some things first before a task force, because a task force is a smaller amount of people and they do not meet as much and the committees would allow a lot more people to gather information and go back and forth thoughts and then eventually a task force to be used.
And I want to make sure that we've got some sense of where we're going as a board on these important issues.
Coming from on how I can share my these people, the things that I would like to see them or have done- Help us work, together, I, try to figure out something and all because walls Court, which is said tonight.
If you have ideas about other people who either can advise or it could be on the task force, then please email, those suggestions as well, because the time is right and we are leaders in the community and in this and in the borough and in the city, and we should be doing something or many things so and for Loraine.
Okay, Wilma green without food I really think that at this time not a task, force, I think there's going to be a lot of work to be done in their community committee and I.
