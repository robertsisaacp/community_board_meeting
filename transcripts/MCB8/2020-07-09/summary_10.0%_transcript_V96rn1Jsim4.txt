It's a brief presentation and then, as I mentioned, there's a number of members and the project team on the video We represent Barry's bootcamp in this application to the New York City Board of standards and appeals seeking a special permit to allow a gym use, It's called a PCE or a physical culture, establishment at the site on East 86th, Street, I'm joined by Adam Shane, the chief development officer of Barry's and members of the project, architect, dxu and also the sound consultant for the project is here to about to answer questions So. So here's an image of the site.
So I have two things first: I want to get for the record his name and address, as we ask all public members to give, Please so, if anyone's raised their hand and intends to well ask for a resolution, actually I'd like to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak before we get to that point.
You know, but without specific direction from state and local government We have roughly 50 domestics to do, of which, let's just say, ten, are currently open in different parts of the country, including Los Angeles, and we are following pretty strict social distancing guidelines which require people to be You, know minimum of six feet apart or more depending on the local mandates Even if we start a construction in August, the earliest, we would be open as early 2021 We are kind of you know taking our time in that sense, to allow New York City to kind of give us some on what gyms are or are not allowed to do, including boutique fitness studios, but for the most part in our current studios that we have reopened in this current environment, we have social, distancing restrictions, we're running at about 20 to 25% capacity.
I, don't know that we're some other business I, don't know that there's enough of a financial impact for you not to vote for cause I, don't think so either, but my preference would be to not vote for cause If there's any sort of suggestion that I should feel compelled to vote I'm happy to defer to you either If you are uncomfortable with voting and feel that there is a conflict, Who am I to say, you're wrong, so don't vote for cause It looks like it's basically unanimous vote in favor of resolution with one not voted for cause Let's talk about what we started talking about it, a previous school board meeting, which is the idea of having the virtual meeting versus in-person meeting, and this is all presuming that the governor will at some point make us go back to the open meetings law with the exemption, and so let's just talk about what we'd like to do at that point, So who'd like to start there are a lot of people who had their hands raised at the full board.
It's very important to have meetings in which it's really easy to participate in and I believe that there are others like they are out there in terms of community board members as well as members of the public, who believe the same as I do that There is less of a need for childcare and you run into less childcare issues if you're able to participate virtually and, of course, I believe that it would be significantly easier for individuals who have disabilities or other issues or other mobility issues or immunity issues to enable them to participate from a safe space.
We cannot overlook the fact that when you were at a personal meeting when you're in person, there is the opportunity to connect with other people to truly be a community, whether it's in the audience or people who have been speaking to have aside conversations to make connections and to work out problems, I hate to confess a senior but I'm a senior and I am staying at home as much as possible because of the pandemic and I very much respect the remarks of mr Pope Marshall, because we don't have a vaccine As long as there is this health risk, no matter what officials are saying, I mean when schools really can open I think that's an indication that perhaps we're safe or not necessarily what the president is saying.
But if we're, if what we're concerned about, is discipline of board members or participation, then that is a separate issue that we can address by having a conversation and agreeing to norms and expectations and holding ourselves to those expectations, I mean to make sure that people are disciplined and actually engaged fully.
We can't have the chat, open , It all gets recorded, it's impossible for people to see it just wouldn't work in terms of ensuring attention or anything else, and that's why the public is invited to participate and the meetings can go on for a while to in to enable everyone to speak Yes, okay, I, just I had assumed that the question had to do with when we will no longer need to be doing this virtually because I think it's very important for people to be present.
That's what I'm against that's an interesting point too that people have been brought up It's so enlightening to listen to everyone and to see how engaged you all are because more and more people are wanting to participate so So a couple things first is Phase four only allows gatherings of up to 50 people So. Clearly, a community board meeting an open, long covered meeting can't even be contemplated until we are beyond you know the end of phase 4 and are in a world in which there could be unlimited attendance at one of our meetings.
This is now an opportunity that potentially removes barriers for community participation and I think we are clearly in a moment in time where a very big focus is on I would like to sort of see if there is interest on the board in developing a set of recommendations that could be brought to the borough president, you know towards the notion of you know in this new world of technology.
You know what should an open meeting look like in the future inclusive of what our norms and expectations of board members in terms of in person versus virtual participation, You know, and one of the things that we can benefit from this experience is how do we use this experience to move forward and create greater access on a long-term basis and one small point : I personally participated in community board meetings when there were too many speakers for everybody to be heard.
I just want to say that I think that we should keep virtual meetings until the vaccine has been tested, and the other thing is that several of us have to take public transportation to the meeting How. Do we accommodate those who are unable to participate while there are barrier or and address some of the barriers that may prevent some people from doing it in person at a time where we are able to meet so talking about not only just as current koban 19 environments, but beyond that?
So, for example, if someone days under the weather we're all much more sensitive towards fighting germs, and even when this whole crisis is over, hopefully we'll all have learned our lessons that, if anyone's feeling sick, they just stay home, and sometimes we all want to be there-- we're all invested in the community board Should we be out of an in-person meeting if we're not feeling a hundred percent, a hybrid format would work same if someone has a childcare issue and can't find a babysitter or needs to be able to be home for some other family situation.
Valerie well, I just wanted to say that I think you know just going back to Adele Bartlett when she said about open meetings law in the key words Craig that you read or stated, or that you can participate, you can observe and that's why the live-streaming work, because it doesn't violate the Open Meetings, because all you're doing is giving the public an opportunity to observe, and so that doesn't violate the open meetings law.
The community board give them the opportunity to observe through Facebook, but at the same time, show up for things that they feel passionate about in person and, while I think it's You know important to hear from everyone.
So I guess I go back to Betty and to Chuck and to say you know, the best of all possible worlds is an in-person meeting where we can evaluate all the people who have come and to speak out on an issue, but I think it's important for the community board to have the live streaming option so that people actually know that we exist I mean it was interesting at the transportation committee meeting to hear people talk about how they never gone to one or whatever and in my opinion, even though they participated, virtually They still haven't been to a community board meeting and that could be a better or worse.
Everyone I, don't know to evaluate issues and the way that they are supposed to be evaluated, whether it's a community board level, whether it's at the House of Representatives, whether it's at the city, council, public hearing and MTA public hearing in person meetings are the best.
Think, though, that in this way that there does have to be some special accommodations for people who do need to speak on issues who, for whatever reason can't be there to make it It, certainly is a way that we've all been able, through many facets of our lives, stay connected not only with business, not only with community boards, but with family and friends.
I'm have public meetings where we go Yet until we probably have the vaccine, but it's a very important issue to me- It's, not completely open, and we wouldn't want to change the state law, because it's think of all these places throughout the state that would love to have all closed meetings.
That could help enhance again that the conversation of the meeting the flow of the information just last week, I, was on a zoom meeting with close to 700 people, where we managed to use the chat without any problems and in some ways we could use the fact that it's a there's, a public record of the chat to our advantage, I realize we shouldn't make a resolution tonight and I think that the that means a few more meetings, maybe even working groups with people who want to explore some more of these digital options before we dive into really making recommendations?
You're not urinated, okay, I think you know last time we kept going on and on it's an important conversation to have whether it's an in person or both for virtual or hybrid , the hybrid is an extra you know, basically in-person and virtual, so I think we can all come up with certain recommendations and, let's you know, put our heads together, but we could be discussing this for the next hour or two and we are not going to get anywhere so and the law that the rescinding of the open meeting it's not going to be for months, If we all write our recommendations, send it in to you and we'll, then we could basically have a select meeting, basically the board without the public and come up with suggestions.
You know having hundreds of people and I think your idea sounds very intriguing, except that I think the idea would violate the open meetings law, which is that even committees can't formulate resolutions in advance of even to propose I'm, not sure about having a board meeting without the public being invited to discuss these things would be a good idea, but it's something that could be looked into.
Who's interested in has ideas about how to do this in a public setting, then by all means, Veneman I think this is really important and all of the other boards share that Billy, That I think was right on the money starting with Sharon , B I think it makes a lot of sense to have a working group or a committee.
You know we create a sort of and made risk to our democratic institutions by suddenly going back to in-person meetings and shutting a lot of people out so I just think we got to be patient and wait for a vaccine or wait for a suitable, hybrid approach which I don't see happening unless we have a huge infusion of funding for community boards, Yes, let's have a committee to discuss it it'll be a great vehicle for people to get expertise and really think these things through with the time this issue deserves, and maybe it ought to be run out of the borough president's office even putting together all the Manhattan community boards.
Every single committee deals with this and I would sort of like to maybe each committee You talk about environment , I, just read a wonderful book with the ice don't see about the Flint situation, So I, just think every single committee should be able to come up and maybe send you some ideas of what we want to do This was supposed to be a way for people in the community who might have felt that they were not listen to that they don't have a voice, because community boards are the lowest level city agency, and that here is a direct line into the city for people who have otherwise felt somewhat removed from the government processes.
And it goes back to our general issue with also just not always knowing who owns any business If the end that, if a seemingly small business isn't is or isn't what it appears to be, and then the other thing which is slightly off topic But, have we ever considered having some sort of perhaps task force for people of color or something that will allow community to address issues regarding people of color and whether it be promoting businesses or other issues that are faced with, based on a regular basis like these matters and stuff and such but things that are more systemic I've reached out to all of the Manhattan community boards for joint participation in programs and borough-wide programs on issues of racial equity, social justice and more than half have responded positively.
Right now, but I'm listening to everybody, But I, do think there may be an appropriate time for us to consider whether a community board Rachel does justice committee or Task Force is warranted, but let's start first with the committee's If we're going to look to our committees tackle these questions.
Whether put that in a district need statement or make that its own report I, think that would be completely appropriate and it's something where we could look to each committee to separately, contribute to as well know black owned businesses and community district 8 Have somebody speak to the state of black owned businesses in New, York City and in our district This is an overwhelmingly white board I think we should would benefit from starting off with somebody presenting to us helping us gain the expertise, giving us a foundation for doing our own work as a community and then, lastly, let's find ways to reach out to the people in our community or black and brown, who don't necessarily look like this community board.
That would be a good test for each committee to do on his own and it may be bringing everything back to the next board meeting Brian when you find out whether other black owned businesses, We, haven't actually really talented designer who's, an intern in the office, and she did agree flier for how the community could support small businesses if they would want something to identify, they may or may not, I don't know, but that, and then Greg may you're, not unmuted I agree that the work of supporting lot community members and business owners should be undertaken by all committees.
I am also the executive director of an organization that largely serves black and brown people and is largely run by black and brown folks, and so again there are ways in which the experience that they have had and what they experienced is very different than what I have experienced and I need to work relentlessly in support of you know addressing systemic racism, I'm starting kind of framing my thoughts in that way, because I think this community board, as folks have you know, have said you know, is- does not appear by virtue of a quick glance to be the most diverse board It doesn't feel particularly inclusive, but I say that saying as well that I've been around for a year, it may be I, don't know as much as I guess.
If we, if we're going to do it as a community, This is about more than just black owned businesses to me, I think we have a real opportunity, like Sondra just said, to really make something more of this and not have it be a Manhattan Board thing, but a cb8 thing, because right now, while we're meeting, hundreds of our community members are at Carl, Schurz Park, marching to support racial equity and justice and I think the community's really ready for change That's, not just supporting a black owned business, but it's the board having a mission statement about racial equity, injustice and the work we want to do to write past wrongs in our neighborhood, be it with zoning or transportation access or education and equity, and for the task force.
Kick it off with the task force where there's representation from each committee and we have representation from black leaders in our community So there are the voices leading and that we as white allies, we're you know just complimenting and uplifting because they think we'll take up Perhaps too much space in this conversation and a part of Just this weekend, one of our council members said there are 300 available portable apartments on Roosevelt Island and at the same time, there is a new development in East, New, York Brooklyn, and in doing a comparison of where the ami was basically only 24 families 24 out of the entire in Brooklyn out of the entire building, which is over 300 apartment, 24 people could qualify to apply on Roosevelt Island because of the ami The. Other thing is that the media I stopped watching the network 11 o'clock news, because all I saw on the news were people who were behaving badly and more often than not, they were a person of color Not a community board.
I just want to thank my colleagues so much and for raising this issue and being open to it and for this broad energy that that's moving on wanting to take on this issue about 10 or 12 years ago , we were having a discussion about the J rec complex in I, think 68 and second, and whether or not the school would be raised to be replaced with a research center for Hunter and I was really surprised and struck by some of the comments from the that I heard in the course of those community board meetings and at one point, someone from the community stood up and said these kids don't look like us, they aren't our children and so I The great news is that I think that our community has changed a lot.
There are different country owners because are very simple people and I respect that the other point I would like to raise is social equity, many time in the community war they coming to us, and they said we wanna feel more for more of your area and we want to put our affordable housing in the Bronx.
So I just wanted to put that on the table, because I think we could very well leave this meeting without a direction and I want to make sure that we've got some sense of where we're going as a board on these important issues and Coming from on how I can share my these people, the things that I would like to see them or have done- There are two other people who have raised their hand, so hi here, unlimited hi, since we're talking about next steps, I like to suggest that, just echoing what a number of my colleagues have said, that the task force integrates people from the community affected communities and community leaders, because they could they would be our advisors on how to move forward and these advisers can help enable us, as we move forward and put plans into action, and that may be this task So it could be a strategy for us internally in terms of our development art, and it could be a strategy for how we move through the work that we're doing through the committee's Thanks My thought is, as I mentioned earlier, I think a task force would be very beneficial on a on a local level and if we can get something started right away, that would be great, but especially considering the interest in having this be more broad-based and reaching all the different committees.
Thinking of that may be hybrids with committees may be beyond the committee scope, as we've seen it right now and will help address, and maybe part of it is education or resources or learning or inner exploration opportunities for board members or members of the community If you have ideas about other people who either can advise or it could be on the task force, then please email, those suggestions as well, because the time is right and we are leaders in the community and in this and in the borough and in the city, and we should be doing something or many things so and for Loraine.
