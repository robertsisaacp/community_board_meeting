Welcome to zoo, enter your meteorology, followed by town. You well I'll, be ready at 6:30, no 42 people, yeah I, think so I think so it looks like we have quorum. Okay, I can't tell so I'm relying on you. Okay, just a sound and I will meet myself all I'm, not speaking okay, good evening everyone and welcome to the largest meeting of community board 8. It's actually it's kind of a hybrid meeting, because we have other items besides land use, but we're starting with the land use items. So the way land whose works is that there will be a presentation by the applicant and then we will begin whoops and I'm still -. Still no video here! Well, I'm! Sorry about that. Okay, there we go so welcome to the land, use meeting, it's a hybrid meeting and we will start with the applicant, after which the public will have a chance to make any comments. You should raise your virtual hand, which is, if you look at, and click on, the participants button you'll get a list of everyone participating and under that is a raise hand button. So when I ask you to raise your hand, I don't mean your regular hands, because I won't be able to see you if you're doing this. But if you raise your virtual hand, then will and I will be able to see you, we will oils to speak after the applicant. The public will have a chance in then the sole board and then we'll move to some board items, and obviously the public is not only welcome but encouraged to attend those and for our last item, I will be calling on the public to participate. Not so much for the second item. So thank you and if the applicant is here is the up look into your will. If you wouldn't mind raising your hand in the participants menu, if you are going to be speaking on behalf of the application I'm trying to find Ryan, is that you push a button to confirm unmuting, yes, is there anybody else, who's gonna be joining your presentation, or is it just you Frank is? Are you also gonna be presenting - hi? Yes, hey! Well, yes, I'll be doing the presentation. There's other members of the project team that are here that are available for questions, but I'll handle the presentation all right cool. Are you gonna, be sharing your screen? I assume I can actually I'm, not sure. If I can do that, I'm sorry I'd sent over the presentation. If you give me a moment, I can just put that up on this screen. I have you to it as well? It just so speed up the process. If you're able to do that. Sorry, I hadn't actually thought about that. So, if you're able to share your screen with the presentation, I'll just run through it, if you wouldn't mind just advancing on, you know from slide to slide. Okay, give me one. Second, thanks, I appreciate it all right open it. That's the one yeah, it's a brief presentation and then, as I mentioned, there's a number of members and the project team on the video and we're happy to answer any questions. So hello, everyone. My name is Frank sage Occam with a Kerman. We represent Barry's bootcamp in this application to the New York City Board of standards and appeals seeking a special permit to allow a gym use. It's called a PCE or a physical culture, establishment at the site on East 86th, Street, I'm joined by Adam Shane, the chief development officer of Barry's and members of the project, architect, dxu and also the sound consultant for the project is here to about to answer questions. So if you just advance to the next slide, so here's an image of the site. This is what we're seeking here again, is a special permit from the BSA for an approximately 72 or 73 hundred square foot, Physical, Culture, establishment or PCE. This is going to be a gym. Barry's bootcamp portions of the first and Celer floors of 237 through 241, East, 86th, Street and Manhattan. This is the former Laettner's Linden space. As you can see from the image that was taken prior to that signage being removed, we could go to the next slide. So just some context. The site again is located on the East 86th Street, it's within a c28, a commercial district where the PC special permit is available to go to the next slide, and this is the tax map showing the site and the context of the block. Again, it's on the north side of East 86th Street, just west of 2nd Avenue at the site. There's an 18-story mixed residential and commercial building, and the lot itself is about 90 400 square feet. You get to move to the next slide. This is an area map showing the land use context for the application, the as you can see, from the color zone in the land use map, I'm, not sure if you can see the legend, but essentially that pink color indicates mixed use, so commercial and residential buildings red is for commercial Luis community facility. So, as you can see- and you may be familiar with this stretch of East 86th Street- it has a very mixed-use character, which we believe is appropriate for this proposed gym. If we could move to the next slide and here's just some photographs showing the context of East 86th Street the site itself and then the lower photos showing some context along East 86th, we can go to the next slide. So here's the floor plan for the first floor again this the gym will be located on both the seller and ground floor with a total of about seventy three hundred square feet. So it's proposed to operate from 5:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Fridays and 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. So on the first floor, the gym would have the main fitness studio which is sort of on that left-hand portion of the screen, as well as a reception area, a fuel bar for snacks and water, and things like that and lockers. On the first floor, we can move to the next slide and then here's the cellar floor plan. You can see that this on this floor, the there's a flex lab which would be able to accommodate stretching classes and then pre and post class stretching as well as the locker rooms with showers. So that's the entirety of the gym space I'll note that it's not open, yet it it's still a proposed gym. You can move to the next slide and we just have a few remaining slides are just with respect to the sound attenuation. That's proposed for the inside of the gym here are several details of the walls showing the baffling and acoustic sound attenuation that would be built into the to the walls and then, if you could move to the next slide here, you see just details of the isolated flooring, isolated ceiling and some of the additional acoustic walls and then, if you could just move to the last slide. Finally, this is what the proposed signage would be on the exterior of the building. You can see on the corner, there's an elevation detail showing the signage that would be proposed for this Barry's bootcamp I'll note that Barry's is not a traditional gym where you just members, go in and work out on. It's class-based, so there'll be a schedule of classes throughout the day led by instructors. So, in order to work out it berries you either you would attend a class for about an hour so work out and then leave it's sort of different from a traditional gym in that respect. There's several locations throughout the city and actually throughout the world. At this point and we're excited barry's, is excited to bring a location to the East 86th Street. So I went through a lot of that quickly, I'm happy to answer any questions and again, as I mentioned, there's members of the team that can also answer more technical questions. That I'm not able to. Thank you. Okay! Are there any questions of any members of the public? Please raise your virtual hand and again for anybody on the phone. That's star, nine and the participant menu is where you find the raise hand feature, and there should be at the bottom of your screen. We have one member of the public named Josh and then two more, please right, I see Josh. So why don't we go to Josh? First, she may have to push a button on your screen time, hi, so I'm. Actually, a resident of East, 86th, Street, I live two doors down. I would just curious how it's gonna affect the noise and how people are going to be loitering outside of it and how that is being dealt with jorah. So there shouldn't be, as you saw in the detailed drawings. Barris has put a lot of thought into this location with respect to sound attenuation. There's not anticipated to be noise emanating from within the gym, either within the building or to the exterior of the site and Barry's also discourages loitering outside of their studios. There's ample space within the reception area and, as you can see, it's two floors so that stretch lab provides a space for patrons that arrive early to a class if they get there before a class ends to congregate stretch, so that you know, there's not going to be loitering or assembly in front of the building. So, yes, the answer is operationally. Barry's discourages that and in terms of the space itself, it's designed such that we don't into various, doesn't anticipate an issue with it. Okay, thank you and I, don't see anyone else from the public. So why don't we go to the board Barbara rudder will. Would you have meet her yeah Josh reraised his hand, I, don't know if he muted little bastard, let's go back, let's go back to today. The sign will the sign be illuminated. Give me just one second, very slight: I should go too. You know we're actually on the slide. Yes, so there's 111 or that's actually about 12 square foot. Illuminated sign would be compliant with the regulations for the okay, huge fan, hoping to see it open anything else. Okay, let's go to Barbara. Okay, let me clarify there is equipment in the gym, so there's classes and we'll. Actually, if you wouldn't mind going back to that first floor plan, it should be around page I. Think that's page 7! Oh great! Thank you got there before me. So there are. There are treadmills as well as small benches for free weights, so they are. The classes. Are a combination of work on the equipment and then work? You know with free weights on the benches and my understanding is that they classes focus on different body parts everyday, so you could go in and do an arm workout or an upper body workout or a lower body workout. This is one of the gyms we represent, that I actually haven't taken. The classes for I would say that I'm more in the beginner side and I haven't taken one. So I can't comment on that, but I know that their policy is to be 100%, inclusive and inviting and I know they enjoy a very they're very popular in the city. So if that answers your question, that's oh great! We should you should stop by and check it out. One bill. Okay, let's go to Michelle! Well, one second Michelle you may have to UM Adam. Do you mind fielding that question? This is Adam Shane! Please! Yes, thanks! Well, okay, great! Can you hear me? Okay, I also wanted to answer the former comment. We do. Our classes are based with treadmills and strength training, so it's interval training and we have weights of all different types of weight, so you could use a five pound weight or you could use a 25 pound or 50 pound weights, so it does allow for all levels of fitness to enter and go into the treadmill or the floor, and if you do not want to run, we do offer spots on our floor where you could just do the strength, training portion of the class. So we do accommodate people with injuries where people who don't want to run as well the and what was the next question. Our least we do long-term leases. So we do. We do invest money and we do want to be a long term. You know community member of the Upper East Side, so we do ten-year leases with two five-year options. We typically are in our spaces, for you know up to 20 years. The reason I'm asking is just granting this special permit change the youth group for this location, and, if so, does the youth group revert to what it is now at the termination of your lease, or does it change the youth group of the property indefinitely, and the second part of that is what does that new? You screw, if that's what you're creating what other entities are permitted under it? So I think I got the question and that's it's actually a really good question. The special permit is unique in that it, essentially it's as its contemplated in the zoning resolution. A special permit allows certain uses if they meet the finding set forth in the zoning resolution. What this special permit would do would allow Barry's bootcamp to operate this specific gym. That's shown on the plans, if approved, only Barry's bootcamp as the applicant would be permitted to operate this specific gym and any changes that you know we're made or would need to be made would have to go back before the BSA for an amendment and actually come have to come back before the community board. So the special permit is not only limited to the applicant, but what's shown on the plans and any conditions that the board of standards and appeals adds to an approval, not only that, but special permits for gyms or PCEs are limited to a maximum term of ten years. So at the conclusion of the ten year term, Barry's would have to come back and apply for an extension of term to the BSA. If they didn't do that, and you know we're no longer operate at the space. Anyone else that came into the space would have to apply for their own special permit or operate under it as of right use. Now, as far as the youth group goes, the physical culture, establishment or PCE is a is considered a use, but it's not under any specific use group. It's just a use. That's only allowed pursuant to the 73 36 special permit, so it's very limited in effect again, if this special permit were granted, it's only for berries and only for this specific space which we're asking for, as shown on the plans that you know, hopefully, would ultimately get a proof by BSA. Okay, thank you. That was very thank you. Let me just ask one other question: no, you know what Michele I really want to know if you can see through Michele hang on, please, because we have a lot of people who have raised their hands and I want to make sure they each have an opportunity to speak and a lot of people. So I have two things first: well, could you find Josh again I want to get for the record his name and address, as we ask all public members to give, and then I'd like to ask that no one called a question until everyone has had an opportunity to speak, please so, if anyone's raised their hand and intends to well ask for a resolution, actually I'd like to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak before we get to that point. So Josh wherever you are, could you raise your hand so we'll quit, calling you and you can give your name and address- please Thank You Josh, two to five East 86th Street! Thank you very much. Okay, let's go to police, barium, n, Elizabeth, I. Think just two questions. It's a little unclear is the second floor residential. So is this a budding directly residential space, or is it abutting a second floor of commercial space because, as I read the materials you're on the ground floor and the cellar floor, and then this question so gyms have not been allowed to reopen in New, York and clearly you'll have some time will take to rebuild to build out the space? But what are you doing to address what are probably going to be, though the longer term cope in nineteen related health protocols that may be required for all gems? How will that be incorporated into the space sure so that the answer the first question the second floor is entirely commercial. So there's a you know, a level of commercial use between the first and the third floor where residential use begins in the building. With respect to you know, Koba 19, related precautions, I'll, let Adam chime in in a moment, but I'll just say that you know gyms are, you know, won't be permitted to reopen until phase 4, which you know is uncertain at this time and that the state has yet and the city have yet to release specific guidelines related to gym reopening what we anticipate and again I'll, let Adam chime in with specific details. But you know some form of you know: limited capacity, ventilation requirement for personal protective gear for patrons and instructors and just intense cleaning like we're. Seeing and many other businesses you know, but without specific direction from state and local government. You know we don't know exactly what the details will be. I will note that you know it'll be some time before this gym opens fingers crossed that you know we'll be in a better place, then with Koba 19, but with that Adam. If there's anything, you know specific that you wanted to add on or I've covered everything. Let me know sure I'll shed light on what we've done. We have up. We have roughly 50 domestics to do, of which, let's just say, ten, are currently open in different parts of the country, including Los Angeles, and we are following pretty strict social distancing guidelines which require people to be. You know minimum of six feet apart or more depending on the local mandates. We do believe this will be six months of construction, so we have not started construction. So, even if we start a construction in August the earliest, we would be open as early 2021. So we are kind of you know taking our time in that sense, to allow New, York City to kind of give us some on what gyms are or are not allowed to do, including boutique fitness studios, but for the most part in our current studios that we have reopened in this current environment, we have social, distancing restrictions, we're running at about 20 to 25% capacity, we've upgraded all of our HVAC systems to filter out some of the bacteria and particles that was very expensive and we've invested that money. To do so, we will take every precaution and follow the government, the governor's kind of leap, what he wants to see fitness as New York City, starts to investigate its reopening plan. All of that being said, we will not be open for a minimum of six months, more likely longer as we wait to start construction to see if there is a reopening in sight. So we anticipate this studio to open early 2021 sometime during the first quarter, and we are office ly trying to be optimistic, but we will take every precaution and follow the mandates as needed. Thank you. Well before we go - before we go to Barry I just wanted to I can't a belong unto that question, which is I, read that the governor is investigating air-conditioning systems and requiring different systems. Is that something that you're following it sounds like it, but to confirm actually yeah we actually on the forefront we have. We have. We are actually helping the government. You know kind of understand how HVAC and gyms you know, filter out air. So we actually are one of the few that has gone one of the few Fitness companies. That's gone public with upgrades to our HVAC air filtration, which includes hospital-grade air filters and ionization and or UV lighting within the HVAC system that helps filter out air. So we are at the forefront of that candidly, and that is part of our part of our intent here. So when we open in the event we are, you know in Co bid or even potentially out of Copan. We will have the latest and greatest kind of systems and technology, our HVAC, and if we walk for, we will do more. Okay, Thank, You, Barry, Elizabeth and then Peggy will in good evening in full disclosure. Why my name is Barry Schneider. My middle name is not Jim. It's buried, Schneider I distance myself from the applicant, however I distance myself in the applicant in this regard, however, just three hundred lessons if you're going to fee from my home, is that other Barry's gym on Barry's bootcamp at the corner of 62nd cv64, the second Avenue they've been there for several years now, they're a good neighbor. They don't have County people congregating on the street corner. I know very well that people who live in the apartment above and they have had no complaints regarding the presence of the gym there. So I strongly support this application and thank you very much Thank You Barry. Thank you, Elizabeth! Well, thank you Aleta. If anybody can explain the background as to why PCEs require a special comment, I'd be happy to explain that in the late 70s New York City was experiencing a lot of issues with commercial spaces, really acting as fronts for drug and prostitution spaces. So the city, through zoning, enacted essentially quality of life control to try and you know, do away with brothels and other sort of houses of ill-repute. So for the past, I guess since about forty years, every gym and spa in New, York City, that's that qualifies as a physical cultural establishment has had to go through the process of obtaining with special permit. So the findings for the special permit are essentially require an applicant to under undergo a Department of Investigation investigation to ensure that there's nothing in their background. That would indicate that they intend to do on the brothel at the space. There's been a lot of discussion about. You know, potentially removing the PC special permit from the zoning resolution. But that's you know. Obviously, in the in the city's court there has been a number of zoning special districts, area-wide special districts where the city has made PCE use as of right, but unfortunately it's not in place in this area and that's we have to seek the special permit in order to have this use. So that's very helpful. Thank you. Hey Peggy, Sharon Anthony, cone, Peggy you're up. Thank you. So a number of gyms have food. They sell in some capacity of gyms I'm, just wondering if this new gym has plans to sell food in some capacity Adam. Do you want to take that question? Yes, absolutely so we won't be hooking it all on-site. We do have a fuel bar, that's okay! We do sell some prepackaged food like granola bars protein bars and things like that, but it you know it's typically no more than that. Okay, thank you. I have my own background noise. Well, would you lend me a cheran and then answer me, please Thank, You San, you may have to push a button there you go and you can go ahead for me. Yes, okay, great I'd, like to call the question. Well, we don't have a resolution. Oh okay, I'd like to know, if you could you hold off on that show and we'll get to you right after Elaine, Anthony and Elaine want to speak. So this way they can do that before you create your craft, your resolution, okay, it's just a little more difficult with zooming. As you know, okay, would you you and thank you for your patience? Would? U 1? U 2 Anthony will Anthony. Ok, I, have a question and a comment and the comment first, this is a I think is a perfectly fine application, although I think it's a shame that the neighborhood is losing yet another dry, retail establishment, and but that's in a way. Neither here nor there I was wondering if someone could explain wheelchair accessibility to the lower level and then how, in the case of a well in the case of requiring an ambulance, how someone at the lower level can get upstairs in a on a stretcher sure. So there is an elevator providing access between the cellar and first floors. So I'll just take a step back and start by saying this site. The space is required and will be fully ADA accessible. So not only is there an elevator providing access, but the facilities, the ATA requirements in terms of the required width, that's required. If you can see the sort of the shaded path, sure the space that's showing that the minimum width is provided for, accessibility for wheelchair use and, in addition to being compliant with fire egress requirements. As far as the stretcher goes I'm, not sure how to answer that question. I, don't know if you know, if EMTs would take someone in a stretcher and I presume they would just take them in the elevator. But you know, I will just note that the space is compliant with all the a DEA regulations. So did you point out where the elevator is sure? Let's see, how can I do that in the screen? There is there's essentially a it's. Not the building elevators for the residents could correct, yeah, okay, separate elevator, so that guy okay, well, this point yeah is that it yeah correct. Yes, okay, thank you! Okay and Elaine Wayne! Well, yeah Oh Ann! You may have to push a button, Elaine you're still not unmuted. Is there something you need to click on there you go. Oh you got it. Okay! Thank you. I'd like to move and I. Don't want to sidestep sharing that we approve this application and I'd like to speak to it. Then, okay, well you're the last one with a hand raised, so you can go ahead and speak to it. I hope, sharing that you are okay with that. I think that the application was thorough, including the ad a I think we welcomed some activity on East, 86th, Street I agree with Anthony. Other options would be nice, but given what we are facing, the one thing I would like to see that there is a commitment to cleaning their sidewalks and taking care of the trees etc in front of the building and I'm hoping that they understand. That is part of being a community member and I move that we support it so some stuff for a second so well, I'd like to just ask Frank about and I appreciate, seconding about a commitment to do as Elaine suggested for being a good neighbor which is taking care of the tree and cleaning up and I'd, also ask if I'm, if I may, if I'm, not violating anything about the illuminated sign to just be careful of illumination on the sidewalks or residences nearby. Of course that's. These are all things that you know, Barry's anticipated you know in being a tenant in this building. You know between berries and the landlord for the building. You know these things would be addressed once they're up and operational and as far as the sign goes absolutely yes, this is something that the sign will be fully compliant with all the zoning, and you know illumination requirements or limitations within this, the zoning district. Okay, then, let's include that in the resolution did someone want to call the question. I see Barry at this hands up. Second Rebecca, okay, so the question is called: do it have a secretary available to take the role I believe that one of the three of them has so that they would do it if they were just raised? Thank You, Billy I see Billy okay, so we're going to do this instead of calling on everyone individually we'll do it the way we've done it. That's a board meeting. If there is no objection, everyone who does not raise the hand will be presumed to vote. Yes, anyone who wants to vote no or abstain or not vote for cause. Please raise your virtual hand and for those on the phone, its star, nine Billy has a hand up yeah. So while we give people a chance to raise their hand I'm moving into this building, and so just avoid any perception of impropriety I'm gonna vote for cause, I, don't think honestly is having taken McCoy training last week. I, don't think that's not voting for cause issue and the borough president likes to see people vote. You don't have a financial unless your rent is contingent on having a gym in there. I don't know that we're some other business I, don't know that there's enough of a financial impact for you not to vote for cause I, don't think so either, but my preference would be to not vote for cause. But if there's any sort of suggestion that I should feel compelled to vote I'm happy to defer to you either. No, that's, okay, I'm, not I'm, not going to stop! You I know that there's definitely a preference for voting. But if you are uncomfortable with voting and feel that there is a conflict, Who am I to say, you're wrong, so don't vote for cause just mark it down that way. Anyone else for the hand, brave I, don't see anybody, though Billy I don't see anyone else. So it looks like it's basically unanimous vote in favor of resolution with one not voted for cause. Okay, excellent. Thank you so much on behalf of Barry's boot camp gentleman and we look forward to seeing you in the neighborhood and for you being good neighbors. So thank you for your presentation. Thank you very much. We really appreciate your time. Take care, yeah, you're, welcome, and you too. Okay, let's move well what you can take off the presentation. Thank you. Let's talk about what we started talking about it, a previous school board meeting, which is the idea of having the virtual meeting versus in-person meeting, and this is all presuming that the governor will at some point make us go back to the open meetings law with the exemption, and so let's just talk about what we'd like to do at that point. So who'd like to start, there are a lot of people who had their hands raised at the full board meeting. Am I seeing anybody? Okay, Sharon lead us off. Thank you very much. A leader and also I'd like to thank the board as well for agreeing to continue this discussion. I initially raised this a couple of months back during a new business and coincidentally the following day. It was also raised at the end of the borough board meeting as well, and so leader has had the opportunity to perhaps participate in here. Several conversations on this already so I pity you for that. Since I've, since I first raised this I'd like to emphasize that I would like to see our virtual meetings continue at the very least through the end. December 2020, if not through the end of December, 2021 and I, have several reasons. First, is that I don't believe that there will be a vaccine that will be available to the public that will address this pandemic, that we're in right now and I guess I should have prefaced. All of my remote I have preface my remarks by saying that it is because I'm making this request because of the pandemic that we're in right now and also because there be there, won't be a publicly available vaccine and also the difficulty with spacing issues being socially distant from one another raises all sorts of complexities and I'm, not sure that and I don't have a high degree of comfort with being able to socially distant from my colleagues as well as from the public who will attend. I. Think, coupled with the fact that there are varying levels of adherence to wearing a mask, I mean it's mandated it. It's the law, I'm a strict, Mass, wearer myself, any time I step out of the apartment, but I do recognize and I have seen that other individuals, or for not choosing not to be as diligent as I am I respect, I respect what you know what their feelings are about masks, but I do believe that wearing helps prevent the spread of the virus. Also I have found that there has been a high level of attendance for these virtual meetings. Yeah. It's very important to have meetings in which it's really easy to participate in and I believe that there are others like they are out there in terms of community board members as well as members of the public, who believe the same as I do that it's really easy to participate in this I. The other issue is that it'll knit having virtual meetings enable more parents to join us as well. There is less of a need for childcare and you run into less childcare issues if you're able to participate virtually and, of course, I believe that it would be significantly easier for individuals who have disabilities or other issues or other mobility issues or immunity issues to enable them to participate from a safe space. With that I want to emphasize that it is not an issue of making it. You know it's, you know it's to make it so easy. You know. Well, you know, because the last time that we, when I raise this there was a significant pushback and the idea of doing video conference says in this way and there seem to be an emphasis on traveling to meetings. I am supporting a hybrid if people want to travel to community board meetings, they should, for others who wish to participate virtually. They should I'll end by saying that people who live on goals of that Island, the three or four that are now on the board. We have the longest commutes and I've been doing this now for a while, but I want you to know that I have enjoyed and appreciated every single day that I have ever attended a community board meeting. Most of my colleagues on the board are home with them fifteen or twenty minutes before the second Avenue subway. It would take me additional hour. The second Avenue subway helps with shaving off 15 minutes of that my preference is to attend community board meetings and to be present because I enjoy them. I enjoy being with my colleagues, I very much take very seriously the fact that I represent not only my community but the Upper East Side community in general. However, I can't be so naive as to not recognize that we are in the midst of a pandemic, and you will forgive me if I, if I add that this pandemic is not being handled very well, and my thinking is that it's could get worse before it. Possibly it gets better with that out in there and I'm. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and that's it Thank You Sharon Thank You Sharon. There is a member from the public who has their hand raised Wendy McKeever. If you would milk unmute her will and is there anyone else from the public that would like to comment on the nature for board meetings, whether they should be virtual or hybrid, or only in person once the restriction is lifted. Okay, Wendy go ahead. Well, thank you. So much for letting me speak and I really appreciated the remarks of Miss Bob Marshall I want to make sure that when it is safe to do so that we are able to have an in-person option always available and I do think that a hybrid meeting is certainly feasible. I know that at the Blood Center there is a drop-down screen that works with a smart board so that anybody can be up on the smart board, just as if there were two zoom meeting and participate that way. We cannot overlook the fact that when you were at a personal meeting when you're in person, there is the opportunity to connect with other people to truly be a community, whether it's in the audience or people who have been speaking to have aside conversations to make connections and to work out problems. However, I also want to say that I am I hate to confess I'm a senior but I'm a senior and I am staying at home as much as possible because of the pandemic and I very much respect the remarks of mr. Pope Marshall, because we don't have a vaccine I, don't care. What's promised, I haven't seen it yet. That's really not where the science is and I think that we need to be safe. I am so grateful to all of the CBA members who have really devoted their time and their energy and their mental energy to making these meetings. Work and I really want to. Thank you for that. So as long as there is this health risk, no matter what officials are saying, I mean when schools really can open I think that's an indication that perhaps we're safe or not necessarily what the president is saying, but you know on a more local when we see that we're really safe. That might be a time to open up the meetings in person again with that hybrid option, but I don't want to see that there is no ability to have in-person meetings forever. That would be very Villa Tereus to the community. Thank you for listening. Thank you very much Wendy. Well, let's go to Barbara writer. I saw her hand up here earlier, I was trying to early Barbara and then Vanessa, and then police and I would ask if and I appreciate that there are a lot of thought that goes into comment. I want to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak, and then we're also able to get to the last item on the agenda. So it asked if he could keep comment to three minutes. I, don't want to time you, colleagues of mine, but it to ask you just to use your good judgment. Barbara, Vanessa and Polly Thank, You, Sharon I think we're talking about two issues: one is pre total cure and the other is post I. Don't think we can say that anybody would feel totally comfortable with having face-to-face meetings until we really know that we're totally safe the open meeting laws mean that people are there. We can't limit, we can't say you can't come so I certainly think, and what I would disagree with Sharon if I may is to get any time we do not know if it's December or January or January of 2025, or something like that. Not I, do think that we did see in this new normal some benefit to having a virtual for people that are really not able to do it. I think the attendance has been good because we really don't have much else to do. I didn't miss the meeting. I was expecting because I didn't have my vacation to go on and I. Don't think anybody has a conflict with the other tickets at this point, so I do think that the you know we're in a stage where we have war by and then we will in others, but it certainly does open up the ability for people to be able to do it. There is nothing like face to face I've been my work, was doing training on a big system very often and doing it over the phone or video never took the place of looking at somebody's eyeballs and face to face and having the come on moderate, but I'm, very much for, as Wendy had said, a mixed concrete when we do it with an encouragement that we community board. People do in fact show welcome. Leslie is a real reason, object and thank you boat, our date about when we should start in terms of safety but Sharon. We don't not know when that's going to be, unfortunately, I wish. We did Thank You Vanessa hi save some time. I will share that I agree wholeheartedly with Sharon's comments and I also agree with what Barbara added about timeline that if we are going to offer any type of guidance in a resolution of what we think the sort of Governors open, meeting laws should look like or what the future should look like. Potentially focusing on metrics instead of dates would be a more productive use of our time. I also want to address. In the last meeting when we discussed this. There were a few concerns about the productivity or discipline that can be accomplished via virtual meetings and I want to really encourage all of us not to conflate in-person physical participation with actual participation and attention and discipline. There are plenty of times when we can be in person and not physically earn and be physically present, but not mentally present engaged in the conversation and I personally work for an organization that is nationwide, that has a thousand plus people working all across the country. And when you hold yourself to higher expectations of digital meetings and participation, you can be just as productive I understand it's not the same. It's not the same as face-to-face, but if we're, if what we're concerned about is discipline of board members or participation, then that is a separate issue that we can address by having a conversation and agreeing to norms and expectations and holding ourselves to those expectations. Regarding our virtual comfort regarding our virtual participation. So I just want to make sure that we're pulling those two separate concerns apart and not conflating that, just because we have virtual participation that we can't be disciplined, that we can't be collaborative that we can't be engaged and have full participation at the same rates, if not better than if we were all in person. I think these are just two separate issues and I'm happy to work with anyone. Should we get to the point where we want to sort of set some clear or reevaluate the norms that we're setting for our group, so we can ensure that we're really being as participatory and disciplined and engaged as possible. Thank you raised an interesting question about setting up norms for participation. I mean to make sure that people are disciplined and actually engaged fully Thank You Vanessa police. Well, thank you. Just briefly, I think having the ability to have virtual meetings. And/Or have a hybrid when we're allowed to meet in person really does encourage greater participation from the community and so I would encourage. However, we move forward and the future weren't permitted to meet in person that we continue to have a virtual option for people to participate. I think the requirement is social, have six feet of social distancing will really substantially limit the capacity of the New York Blood Center and before we even think about being able to return in person whenever were allowed to by the open meeting law that we really need to be able to figure out what that does in terms of capacity and whether or not that limits additional participation of people attending so I think it will be a substantial restriction. Thank you. That's a really good point. I just like to point out that it's not that we're permitted to have in-person meetings. That said, the open meetings law requires that we have in-person meetings, which is why the governor lifted that requirement during the pandemic. Thank you. Felice Laurium and Chuck well, I'm sure that it won't surprise anyone that I am a very big believer in virtual meetings. I think that we it that it has for all the reasons that were stated by Sharon. You know that the attendance is better than it's easier for parents, that it's easier for the disabled, and you know I, certainly don't feel a distance with you all and you know so I just don't think that that's an issue so I would very much support always being able to do virtual meetings. The one thing that I'm concerned about is that when you talk about hybrids, that I think is problem problematic in that, if you have some people who are participating virtually and some people who are participating in person at the same meeting, I think that sets up a dynamic that is totally different between the two groups. So what I would propose is that if you want to go back to all you know open meet the open meetings, laws or whatever, if that you know, comes down the pike that we should alternate having a total in-person meeting and then a total virtual meeting III having both at the same time, I think is problematic. That's it Thank, You, Lori, okay, Chuck and then Wilma. You know what there were some members of the public, but because of the nature of this, that's in the way virtual meeting I can't see who everyone is without scrolling up and down continuously, and there are a whole lot of people who have raised their hand. Even since you finished Lori, so I'd like to be able before we go back to the board, if you would bear with me and allow switching back and forth to the members of the public who have raised their hands and so I'm going to put you on hold for a second Chuck and Wilma I'd like to go to Andrew rabbits Gary and Betty, Cooper Wallerstein and John's iPhone, whoever you are John and except I'm, going to ask you because I don't want to bifurcate. It's like this. If everyone to just keep their comments now, I'm asking everyone to just two minutes. If we could do that again because there were people, who've raised their hands, so let's go to you Andrew and then Betty and then John is letting me I enter hi. Thank you for letting me participate in this discussion. I think one of the key important factors that comes with the Open Meeting Law is that we are better able to find consensus when there's an audience that is either cheering or clapping or disagreeing it's a little hard to do that on the zoom, because in our chat I know, for me, I'm only able to message will which is lovely, but it's not a totally open group discussion, so I would be in favor of a hybrid model in the future, because that allows both consensus that you get when you are in person which provides us with information on a variety of issues, but I also hear what others are saying regarding online availability under the current pause of the open meetings, law, I think and I could be mistaken- that there's a stipulation that we should be getting the transcript of these meetings. And/Or chat is that currently happening, and if so, where can the public find it? Thank you. It just says that it was be made or made available upon request. So, if there's a request, we will make it available, and so would that just be emailed to anyone who expresses interest or would it be on the CBA website? Now, where would the transcript be is over? Your question was yes, it would be opposed to just like our minutes are posted okay and then is there also a way to open up the chat so that we could have greater cross dialogue during these meetings? Not particularly without it being a distraction yeah, we can't have the chat open. It all gets recorded, it's impossible for people to see it and that's utterly distracting. So we can't use the chat as another form of dialogue in the same way that during the in-person meetings, I can't have anybody text me, I, don't even bring my phone up. I use will foam purely at a time so I'm it just wouldn't work in terms of ensuring attention or anything else, and that's why the public is invited to participate and the meetings can go on for a while to in to enable everyone to speak. Who wants to so. Thank you, Andrew Betty. Thank you. Thank you very much. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, I, just I had assumed that the question had to do with when we will no longer need to be doing this virtually because I think it's very important for people to be present. There were a lot of people last time with the Schools, Board, presidents etc, who were did not have a chance to speak, but a couple of them said they were so impressed with the board and they had never gone to a board meeting. I think it is important. The board does a good job and I think it is important that we have our meetings as we've always had. This is very convenient for everyone doing this way, but it doesn't really give people they're, really good information about how the board works and whether those people who would not have had a chance to speak if they were at the open meeting, but they would have sit, sat there with their friends. They would have asked someone else if they would get called on to mention something that they wanted. I think it's very important for the board to have the meetings where people will come and, of course the meetings will be shorter and that's good too. Thank you so much. Thank you. Betty I keep muting my phone for my loud background noise. Okay, there's John's iPhone yeah. My name is John. The climate I've been attending board meeting state. Where you live, I love you I should have asked everyone from the public please. This chat will hear. Joe I lived at 4:15 East 85th Street between first to New, York, Avenue's, I've, been attending board meetings in person and now virtually for the last couple of years and I think you're wonderful. The problem I've had recently and I know this. Maybe this just comes with the territory with the virtual meetings, but certainly I think an argument for going back as quickly as possible to in-person meetings is the length of time. I mean I, think, there's kind of a feeling that well we're virtual. We can just keep on going everyone's at home and they're reasonably comfortable I found it extremely frustrating I mean I. Finally, sensing that it was over bowed out around 10:00 after 10:00 only to learn that it just went on for another hour so and issues were discussed. That I would have liked to have heard about so I guess: I'm, just arguing for more discipline as long as we have these virtual meetings in keeping them moving and not having them go on for all night. Thank you, yeah I'm, well, aware of that, and we are working on it too, and it fluctuates with the number of issues in how controversial they are and other people may differ, but I like to make sure that people everyone has attempts to speak I appreciate when comments or sixth synced and non repetitive. So thank you so much and for also giving your information last chance. Anyone from the public. Okay with all of that, let's go to you chuck and then Wilma will. Okay. Am I unmuted here hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Thank you. Let me just let me just make the point we were having this discussion. The point is that the open meetings law is the law it's been suspended by the governor during this pandemic. He's probably he's not going to take the suspension off until we're past the pandemic, and then once we get to that point, we will have to go back to regular meetings, in-person meetings in order to do anything else, we'd have to get that amended by the legislature. He'd have to agree to it and I agree with that. I agree with Betty and John I think the open meetings law is there for a purpose. I think it served us well and I. Think there's a lot to be said for in-person meetings and I think you would be very difficult to get the legislature to come up with some kind of a hybrid scheme where you would go back to virtual meetings, so I think I, don't think much is gonna come so we can discuss it, but I don't think it's gonna. The law is the law and will remain the law. Also apparently happy birthday Chuck! Oh, is it your birthday, chocolates, okay, happy birthday, I'll spare you from my singing. That would be my birthday gift to you, so we always try and ask legislators, and they mayor, for instance, the governor to take certain steps, so I leave it to the board. But thank you for raising that, because you're quite right there is a law Wilma good evening. Thank you for taking me. I would like to make a comment on what the last speaker said about legislation to make a bet. A war is a war, and we have enough time it's seen to try to work on making the more so that when we can't find a spot to have our meetings, because it's getting harder and harder to find a space big enough to accommodate the board and everybody else, maybe one every two months or a year a month or every three months they can have a virtual meeting. I think it's important for future and I had to this before, because of the lack of places at times that we don't have. If we have a time with well, we know three months from now we're going to be able to have a virtual meeting. We don't have to worry about that. Particular month, so maybe a good business think about the future. Not all the time have a Dominions like this, because I do I really enjoy seeing people, face-to-face and but I think that this time we have a lot of time. Maybe there's like this. We're gonna be faxing anytime soon they I can work on changing that, so that maybe was well. We can have a virtual media. Thank you this and that that's an interesting point that no one else is raised yet Adam and then Lowell and Elizabeth will Adam. Please can you hear me Adam you're, on Jamie I agree with a lot of what Sharon said. I thought it was wonderful, although I do disagree on one point, I think she has a little more respect of tolerance for people who don't wear the masks, because I have little respect for people who don't wear their masks. I also, don't think that a hybrid model really makes sense. I think that that's of like a tale of two city, these thing they're gonna, have a bunch of people who are maybe have comorbidities who are concerned about their health or of a certain demographic or age or maybe sitting home, and then you'll have a bunch of other people coming together. I, don't think a hybrid model makes any sense. I mean I. Also think that we shouldn't be discussing. You know in-person meetings for a while I, don't think I'd really make sense, I, actually Oh, Lina and I. Had some curt discussion about I didn't think we should have the March meeting when we had the market I mean I was like I was up in arms and Aleta and Russell were kind of disagreeing with me a little bit. But you know I love to say, I told you so, but I told you that I was like. We should not have had that. We should not have had that March meeting and I don't see how we can really in earnest be discussing about a meeting in October November, December I, just don't see how it's realistic and I don't see a hybrid is being realistic either. So that's that that's my two cents, I just I, just have to respond to that I think! Well, the writing might have been on the wall. We certainly had no idea. There was a lack of leadership and the idea of having people meet in person obviously resonates with a lot of people. So yes, in retrospect, we should have locked down at the end of February, probably but moving forward. Now we have a lot more information and a lot more knowledge about how the virus spread so I. Think people rightfully so should be a whole lot more cautious about all of that. But thank you. Adam Lowell you're, a knight I, just want to say real, quick that yeah, for if we have the technology as legal, we should have our members be able to go virtual. You know it seems to work, we're all we're all vetted by our council mentor girl, president and our peers, but as far as the public I, don't think so, I could see often there's a hot topic where developer or someone else or a lobby may stack the room with people to speak on it and virtually that could go on for a long time and we don't know where, if the person's going from Upper East, Side or Texas. So that's what I'm against that's an interesting point too that people have been brought up. Thank you. It's so enlightening to listen to everyone and to see how engaged you all are, because more and more people are wanting to participate so Elizabeth and Trisha and Rita I. Look at your meter. So a couple things first is I. Don't think we need to worry about when this period starts or ends. Phase four only allows gatherings of up to 50 people. So, clearly, a community board meeting an open, long covered meeting can't even be contemplated until we are beyond you know the end of phase 4 and are in a world in which there could be unlimited attendance at one of our meetings. What we do have is the opportunity to really think about you know with new technology that was not contemplated when open meetings law was developed and that certainly was not contemplated when the Community Board process was developed. This is now an opportunity that potentially removes barriers for community participation and I think we are clearly in a moment in time where a very big focus is on. How can we remove barriers from participation? So I would like to sort of see if there is interest on the board in developing a set of recommendations that could be brought to the borough president, you know towards the notion of you know in this new world of technology, that was, you know that fundamentally changes the capabilities and capacities of meetings. You know what should an open meeting look like in the future inclusive of what our norms and expectations of board members in terms of in person versus virtual participation. This is a very different world. You know, and one of the things that we can benefit from this experience is how do we use this experience to move forward and create greater access on a long-term basis and one small point: I personally participated in community board meetings when there were too many speakers for everybody to be heard. They were known hot topics, you know topic specific events and there was a capacity constraints. There was a time limit there for both individual speakers and for the meeting overall, so I don't think that being virtual absolutely requires that every single person necessarily be heard, but that's the kind of thing that might go into a set of recommendations for how to leverage technology to remove barriers of participation in the future, even after were able to have gatherings of unlimited numbers of people. Thank you, Trisha you're, needed I said. I really do like idea taking this as an opportunity to come up with some best practices or suggestions for how this might work long term I'm very supportive of a hybrid model. I just wanted to add that I when thinking about what I miss most about in-person meetings. It is that interaction in those conversations with my colleagues I rely on a lot of their expertise and experience in shaping my own views on certain topics. So I do actually wish that there was a way out while I understand and appreciate Alita your thoughts on not opening up the chat to discussion during these zoom meetings. I wish that there were that we could think creatively about some other ways that we might be able to casually connect with each other. I would argue that most of my conversations that I held I had with my colleagues in our in-person meetings was casual but all very informative and helps me shaped my perspective on things. I rely on Jane and on Barry and Barbara, and so many others on how their perspective on this is and I like quick word beforehand or clarification on something. If I have a question, so I wish that there were a way that we could that we could instill some of that. That's what I do miss and I do wish that there was a better way to do that. So not really a not really a suggestion as much as just posing questions, but I do think that the idea of coming up with some best practices and things that worked and things I earn that could be fixed or improved upon. I agree with you Trisha, but I know you can't possibly sit next to all of the people that you mentioned and that's a problem from where I sit about the virtual meetings is not being able to see where people are in I mean it's not from my position here, but in sitting where anyone else. It's that you can't you can't turn around. You can't see how someone else is responding with respect to the chat. The chats are all public because they're being recorded, and so the ability to really have a conversation with someone would be somewhat I, think limited by that, and then it becomes it's just not meant to be used in that way. For these meetings and in a and I'm not sure how it all fits in with the public meetings all but you're absolutely right. This is a chance to be creative and that personal interaction before meetings after meetings is really lost in this virtual sense and there's no sense of the temperature. The overall temperature in the room are people, just people seem to be excited by an application or an idea or an objection. There's no way to tell from this or at all and I think that, for me, that's as a person- that's really lacking in this, but I should keep probably my comments to myself since I haven't raised my hand so Rita and Craig and Valerie will you did you have anything else to add Trisha before we go away from you, I, just muted ourselves: okay, good, never mind Rita, you're unmuted! Really you have to push a button to confirm Rita. We can't hear you yet there may be a button Rita I. Was there perfect better? You know we're. The community board is the community board, and now people have gotten a taste of that. It could be two things. It could be virtual or could be in person. The in-person board is very critical to being able to talk to other people who you don't get a chance to talk to. I just want to say that I think that we should keep virtual meetings until the vaccine has been tested, and the other thing is that several of us have to take public transportation to the meeting and we're really trying to stay off that as long as possible, so I hope everybody stays well or as long as possible. Thank you, Thank You, Rita, okay, Craig and then Valerie. Would you Craig you're unmuted? Thank you good evening. Everyone so I think we can all agree that an in-person meeting is the gold standard and we all ideally will want to be in person whenever that is possible. So I think this discussion should really be about. How do we accommodate those who are unable to participate while there are barrier or and address some of the barriers that may prevent some people from doing it in person at a time where we are able to meet so talking about not only just as current koban 19 environments, but beyond that, so, for example, if someone days under the weather we're all much more sensitive towards fighting germs, and even when this whole crisis is over, hopefully we'll all have learned our lessons that, if anyone's feeling sick, they just stay home, and sometimes we all want to be there- we're all invested in the community board and we all want to participate. But should we be out of an in-person meeting if we're not feeling a hundred percent, a hybrid format would work same if someone has a childcare issue and can't find a babysitter or needs to be able to be home for some other family situation, but otherwise would be out of meetings. So that's one piece of it. The second thing- and this is where I'm a little confused right now is: can we do it now? If the Open Meetings Lord was reinstated because, as I'm reading the open meetings law it talks about video conferencing in there to conduct meetings, and the rule basically, is that a public body that uses video conferencing shall provide an opportunity for the public to attend, listen and observe at any site at which a member participates. So I'm, not a lawyer, but to me that suggests that perhaps maybe there are accommodations in there. That would allow us, as long as we have a meeting location in place, to visit the location that we in theory would be able to have meetings that are of a hybrid format. That being said, I think it's really important, as a number of people have said that we, if we are to go that route, that we have ways to that. We really thought this through and have the ability to make sure that this isn't going to get out of control. So I say this after our transportation meeting last week when till 11 o'clock, four and a half hours and part of that was because we had great participation and we felt it was very important to make sure both chuck and I that everyone who wished to speak and participate and the public did so and that becomes a real challenge and I think we'd have to work through the issues of how do we make sure that we allow the public to participate if they are participating remotely, but in a way where it doesn't slow things down? And then, of course, there are the logistical concerns of making sure that if we are- and if is a little physical location with the meeting- let's say the Blood Center, do we have the ability to actually stream the meeting? If you have a single chair person at a meeting, are they going to be able to do it? Do we need to rely on cb8 staff to be able to assist with the logistics of running an online meeting and doing what we'll does because poor will? If you had to attend every meeting in person, I would hate to have to put him through that and how would we make sure that we can, if the point of this would be to get the public to be able to participate and the members to be able to vote, to make sure that we had mechanisms in place to allow both things to happen without causing meetings to go till all hours of the evening? So that's really where I am right now and I'd love it. If someone were able to clarify based on their understanding of the open meetings law, whether this is permissible because, as Chuck said, the law is the law, but whatever it is. If we are able to do it and I think we should definitely try it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If anyone wants to respond to Craig's question about the open meetings, law just raise your hand and you'll be at the end of the pile, because there's no way of differentiating and no way to ask people to lower their hands. So thank you and I've always appreciated how inclusive your meetings are, because you do allow everyone to speak. If you don't mind, Adele was actually spoken to us about that in the past, and because we had talked about the idea of using just a conference call line, and she said that everywhere the person had been calling from would need to be posted as a place that somebody could go to be a part of that conversation. So your interpretation was correct. Okay, I, okay, Craig did you have anything to quickly say in response or know the interpretation, meaning that if anyone participates from their own home, that becomes a public location? Is that the interpretation it would be? You need a single location listed on a public notice saying this is the physical location, and otherwise you call in no, she has said- and maybe she had a very conservative use of the interpretation, but that every place that somebody was calling from had to be open to the public. Okay I know- and this is from past experience in other locales like when I was working. Connecticut they're, open meetings, law required you to have a physical location for the meeting, and otherwise you can so anyone who wishes to show up good, otherwise you can call in and no one can be there in person, otherwise so I guess, if it's a matter of confirming that is the interpretation that the state is using. That would be perhaps maybe a question to ask, and maybe the interpretations changed in this current environment as people are looking ahead, I mean I was just citing the conversation. The presentation that Adelle Bartlett, the general counsel for the Manhattan borough president gave I'm not purporting to be an expert beyond her I'm just giving what her previous was previously was too old and in any event, the borough President believes that we would need to that. This. A hybrid meeting would not be permissible under the open meetings law as it currently exists. Okay, let's go to Valerie and Rebecca Dan Gore and then Michelle you have it: okay, I'm, sorry, Valerie well, I just wanted to say that I think you know just going back to Adele Bartlett when she said about open meetings law in the key words Craig that you read or stated, or that you can participate, you can observe and that's why the live-streaming work, because it doesn't violate the Open Meetings, because all you're doing is giving the public an opportunity to observe, and so that doesn't violate the open meetings, law. Iii just think. In this whole conversation, we've forgot about the fact that we've been live streaming, a lot of our meetings and I. Think I personally, don't think that the hybrid really works and I. Don't think that I mean it's great, that we have all these people dialing in on various nights, but I think the opportunity. The meeting, if we're there to listen to the public. But the meeting is actually between the community board among the community board and that's better. You know best practice is to have that be an in-person meeting. I mean I'm, not talking about worrying enough time of Kovan and obviously the governor has suspended the rule and we're doing it this way. But the optimum way to get the best result is to all be in the same place at the same time to be reacting to all and to be in the same circumstance and feeling the same pressures etc, and you miss all of that when you're in a virtual meeting, you know when we have when we have when we're at our meetings and people come in, you know. Sometimes we make the decision that we're not gonna hear from every single person who's on one side of the issue. We take a show of hands or we talk to whoever it has brought their people, and we allow them to express the views on behalf of those people and then they clap, and we know how many people are there. We can tell I think it's important once we're once we're beyond kovat and hopefully that sooner rather than later in 2021 that we use all the information that we've gathered from people signing in make sure that they still maintain their connections. The community board give them the opportunity to observe through Facebook but at the same time, show up for things that they feel passionate about in person and, while I think it's. You know important to hear from everyone. You know we get the message that you know certain buildings didn't want to Street closed and you know we can hear from everyone, but it doesn't really move the issue along and we get you know we can tell when we're in person better who you know what are the different points of view and I think it's easier to conduct the meeting to see in the room to make sure we get a balance of opinion when we're talking. You know like this on right now: I'm on a telephone and I'm streaming through to see everybody's faces to see who's there who's, not there. It's more disjointed and I think is not in the spirit of how these community meetings are supposed to be run. So I guess I go back to Betty and to Chuck and to say you know, the best of all possible worlds is an in-person meeting where we can evaluate all the people who have come and to speak out on an issue, but I think it's important for the community board to have the live streaming option so that people actually know that we exist I mean it was interesting at the transportation committee meeting to hear people talk about how they never gone to one or whatever and in my opinion, even though they participated virtually. They still haven't, been to a community board meeting and that could be a better or worse. But in any event it's not the same thing and I'm looking forward to be able to be in the room with everyone, I know and everyone I don't know to evaluate issues and the way that they are supposed to be evaluated, whether it's a community board level, whether it's at the House of Representatives, whether it's at the city, council, public hearing and MTA public hearing in person meetings are the best. I. Do think, though, that in this way that there does have to be some special accommodations for people who do need to speak on issues who, for whatever reason, can't be there to make it but I'm more in favor of continuing the livestream and bringing it back to all in the same place meeting. So thank you and stay safe for next month. Thank You, Valerie, okay, Rebecca, Dan, Gore and then Michelle Birnbaum, hi I, think there are two different issues here. One is during the time of Kovac kovat and the other is after I think during this time. Everyone understands the vital importance of virtual meeting, but we also have to understand that in the future there is a digital divide and I would be extremely uncomfortable when we're all in the clear to continue only virtual meetings, especially since there seems to be hesitation to do hybrids. Thank you, Thank You, Michelle, Byrne, bellman and Barbara taki, no I, muted, your show! Yes, thank you during this time, I'm very grateful that we have zoo meetings and virtual meetings. It certainly is a way that we've all been able, through many facets of our lives, stay connected not only with business, not only with community boards, but with family and friends. So this is really terrific. However, going forward I, don't believe that we should have in-person meetings until we actually have a vaccine and I suspect that limitation really or that accommodation really will not be in effect until we do have a vaccine. I am opposed to hybrid meetings. I think that the fact that community board meetings and committee meetings livestream the public is a pret is a prized of what we are doing. If they have advanced agendas, they can certainly write incumbents, as they have done in the past. I think that a hybrid meeting is a big imposition on those that are present. It makes for a very long meeting. As you see, there are delays between responses. It's not the most convenient way to do it, and the other thing is I think when we get back to normal, our in-person meetings should be the way to go. Also, I would ask that we have no resolution on this tonight. I think this is a wonderful conversation. I think it's a conversation that we may want to continue, but I don't think that anything affirmative or any resolution should happen tonight. They you thank you. Okay, barber chaqi, yes, I, like -. First of all, I agree with Michele that we should not have a resolution tonight, but I also want to follow up what Chuck said a lot of you who have been on the board when they know how strongly I believe in open meeting law. When I worked for the New York State Department of State, the open mean who met really. It was part of the New York Department of State, and this is some horror stories about what happens throughout the state when people try to have closed meetings and don't invite the public so I wouldn't want anybody to fool around with it and any really any major changes in the open meeting law changes you make have to be very carefully done. I just don't think we're going to be able to have open meetings. I'm have public meetings where we go virtually we go in person for a while. Yet until we probably have the vaccine, but it's a very important issue to me- we really cannot have meetings with the hope. It's not completely open and we wouldn't want to change the state law, because it's think of all these places throughout the state that would love to have all closed meetings. Oh that would be pretty. It would be pretty scary to think about not having to not requiring community boards to have meetings that everyone could attend and where there's a transparency, I don't think anyone would advocate for that. But it's a good point that you raised Vanessa Dean mind: can we skip over you until after everyone who hasn't spoken? Yet it has a chance to because you already spoke on this issue right, just giving a thumbs up? Okay, so let's go to cause and then Elizabeth did you see? You spoke on this issue, - I'm, going to ask you if you would wait y'all, so we just have conscience Andreea in case. Anyone else wants to raise their hand, cause go ahead. I'm just curious, I! Think I was the person at the last meeting that we just kept going on and on and is the governor gonna. Are we going back to the open law next month or six months or 12 months or 18 months down the road I mean the discussion should be had, but I think what we should all do is think about what we would like what we would recommend and wait until the law or the open meeting gets reinstated, I mean until then we're just spinning Willis, and this happened last time we went on till 10, 11, 12 o'clock and everybody's got their opinion, we're not voting on anything tonight and we're just spinning wheels again and again and again. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, country--I we'll go to and I Sharon. Oh, let's do the same thing. If we could go to Sondra and then Jack Don drea well, would you unmute her Sondra? You just have to push the button on your screen to confirm a meeting. Okay, all right, hello, readings. I am open to a hybrid format meeting when the time comes for in-person meetings, members should have an option any time. Such as this, even after a vaccine is available, we have to remain vigilant over board. Members in the community should be safe at all times. Open meetings when they resume will be very different from what the board is used to. The board should begin preparing for the time when we can gather together needs such as sanitizing before and after. We will also have to designate an individual to take temperatures our temperature, even upon arrival. So it is a lot to be done when it's time to return back, and we should be focusing on that as well and as well as giving people the option of the hybrid not as a permanent solution, but a temporary solution till people are fully comfortable because we do have different age groups, people with different underlying impossibly conditions and so forth, and you don't want to put anybody. Thank you. Thank you, Sanjaya, okay, jack. It's dejected, Jack's right there. Okay, I missed the in-person meetings, but I, also like the greater accessibility that virtual meetings have brought us, especially for our Roosevelt Island friends, but just a silly question or maybe a premature question. What is what does hybrid even look like or what it? What would that? Even? How would that even work I'm having trouble I'm thinking about what that would look like, but maybe it's premature I, don't think any one of us knows what it would look like. So, let's go back then to the people. Who've already spoken, I'd ask if you could keep your comments, succinct I know you had specific points you wanted to address Vanessa and Elizabeth and Sharon hi. Thank you. Actually these were great comments to go right after because I couldn't agree more with everything. That's Andre has said and I think while I understand open meetings, law is a law and that I understand that it probably won't be enforced or the suspension will not be ended very soon. There will be a time when it will be when the suspension will be ended and we will still have people who don't necessarily feel comfortable and feel like they have to make a choice. I really have some I, don't even know what the word is. I question those who are so who have spoken so strongly against a hybrid meeting for Jack's exact point. I have a little bit of suspicion of how many people have actually attended meetings that are half in person in half on zoom', because this is new territory and I want to also remind us that, just a couple of months ago, in March, when I was - expressing deep concern about the March meeting, we didn't even think this was possible. We didn't even think this is this was possible so right now to reject something that we don't even know what it could. Look like I feel like it's very narrow-minded and is not opening ourselves up to opportunities. I also respectfully disagree with the comments and the decisions that have been made about the use of all of the tools that these virtual platforms zoom that we're currently using offer I have I know that decisions were made about the chat, but I do think that there are a lot of different parts of this platform that could be used that we're not even exploring right now. That could help enhance again that the conversation of the meeting the flow of the information just last week, I, was on a zoom meeting with close to 700 people, where we managed to use the chat without any problems and in some ways we could use the fact that it's a there's, a public record of the chat to our advantage. We don't have to discuss the exact chat, that's just an example of a lot of tools that right now are at our disposal that we've rejected, because we're not willing to sort of think of other opportunities. So what I encourage I realize we shouldn't make a resolution tonight. I really think, there's a few different issues that play about what's working and what's not working in this virtual platform. If we have to be in this virtual platform for 18 months now, how could we improve it and then also at sundry, I said planning for when things do start to calm down? How are we going to adapt and I think that the that means a few more meetings, maybe even working groups with people who want to explore some more of these digital options before we dive into really making recommendations? That would impact a law, but I do think. We should be that this conversation is the right time and we should continue to think about this. Just let sort of history happen to us. We have an opportunity to be innovative right now, to use our voice as a community board, to make recommendations and to use all everything that we've learned during these past few months to help make our meetings as we transition to the gold standard of in-person meetings as productive as possible. Okay, thank you and if you have ideas about how to use things, digital tools or other things that we can incorporate I for one would be really interested in knowing what they are. The chat, I hadn't really thought about people using it so much between each other but more - to talk to me and will, and it is really hard to concentrate when it's all flashing by, but if it's private it's a whole different issue and I, don't know what the mechanisms for that are because I know that people have been chatting me through will right now and not even directly, so that's not even an option and it may be because I'm not a ho, so I, don't know how any of that looks. Okay, I know that Elizabeth and chair and you've been patient, but Marco and Billie have not spoken yet so I'd like to go to them first, if we could go to Marco and then Billy and then back to Elizabeth, if no one else raises their hands, so will Marco you are needed. Ah, thank you. I think everything has been said. I propose and I go like that is somebody won. A second is I would like to take off the th. Thank you. Can anybody second heylia saw causes thumbs thumb to up a second. Thank you. Okay, then, we should be having a discussion of tabling this issue, so everyone who has their hands raised you've got to lower them and raise them again. If you want to speak to tabling this conversation, okay cause and then Billy and then Sharon. This is all on the table in argument. Go god you're, not urinated, okay, I think you know last time we kept going on and on it's an important conversation to have. We don't want to make decisions on the fly. I think we should come up with a plan of what we really want to do in the future, whether it's an in person or both for virtual or hybrid, the hybrid is an extra you know, basically in-person and virtual, so I think we can all come up with certain recommendations and, let's you know, put our heads together, but we could be discussing this for the next hour or two and we are not going to get anywhere so and the law that the rescinding of the open meeting it's not going to be for months. Yet so, let's discuss this in a proper way, come up with plans to or recommendations to basically suggest or we would like and go from there, but I think just carrying on this discussion. You know once a month it's going to be fruitless. Are you suggesting sorry, are you suggesting creating a working group to come up with recommendations that could be presented to the board in another special meeting like that? I think everybody on the board has their ideas of what I would like to do when I would like to do it and in what way. So I think if we all write our recommendations, send it in to you and we'll, then we could basically have a select meeting, basically the board without the public and come up with suggestions. Once we come up with the suggestions, then we can have an open meeting discussing. Let the public weigh in on what we feel is the proper way to go so I mean we could be. You know having hundreds of people. Everybody's got a different opinion and we're not going to get anywhere so I. Think, sorry and I think your idea sounds very intriguing, except that I think the idea would violate the open meetings law, which is that even committees can't formulate resolutions in advance of even to propose I'm, not sure about having a board meeting without the public being invited to discuss these things would be a good idea, but it's something that could be looked into. Look we have until September anyway, because we don't meet in August to figure out how to do this. I for one am about being proactive and I'd. Much rather have a sense of what we would like to recommend to Albany and not wait for them so to be prepared for that, especially because listening to everyone, it's very complex and all of you who have raised interesting points that hadn't been raised by other people and, as you point out, there's a lot to be said. So I will figure out with anyone who is interested in this. How to go about this so that everyone is served because it is important. It's important for the board and even something like this I can't say now, because everyone will lose their place in line. All of you who are in favor of doing something like oz, suggest, raise your hand because then people lower their hands, they raised it and then they may not raise it in time if there's a time limit to be able to participate in a following discussion. So this kind of meeting is great, but it certainly is no substitute in terms of issues like that. So I'm, going on for a while and I shouldn't be so I'll try for anyone who's interested in has ideas about how to do this in a public setting then by all means Veneman. So thank you cause for thinking creatively like that and for everyone else. I think this is really important and all of the other boards share that Billy. Well, we do anything everyone's comments, and you know so much so much has been said already. That I think was right on the money starting with Sharon, and you know: Rebecca Dan, Lawrence, Andrea and many others have just said things I completely agree with and then upgraded up the cause who kind of took the words out of my mouth, a I. Don't think this is something we can make a decision on right now, B I think it makes a lot of sense to have a working group or a committee and I didn't quite follow. Why there'd be an open meetings problem, because why not just have an ad-hoc committee that meets publicly on zoom' to discuss these things, but here's my only concern about that, because otherwise I think it's a good idea. You know this seems to be an issue that affects all the community boards and I. Don't know what the Manhattan borough president office is doing right now, but there should be maybe something run centrally out of the MVPs office to talk about what the community boards can do going forward and whether we can make a united front to request the funding. We need to run whatever a hybrid would look like, but personally I think a hybrid based on everything. I've heard and I echo Jack's sort of skepticism I, don't see how it work. I, don't see us having the technical capability of running a hybrid approach and so notwithstanding or until we have a technical capability. I think we have to remain all virtual until there's a vaccine and for a very fundamental reason. There are people in our community who are immunocompromised, who will not feel safe and going in going to a meeting. They will be shut out of this very important democratic process of ours, and that is sort of a red line that we cannot cross and I hear all the calls for coming back to public meetings. I miss you all very much as well and I look forward to robust back-and-forth some bike lanes and other important matters, but you know we have to be patient because there is a massive public health risk out there and it would. You know we create a sort of and made risk to our democratic institutions by suddenly going back to in-person meetings and shutting a lot of people out so I just think we got to be patient and wait for a vaccine or wait for a suitable, hybrid approach which I don't see happening unless we have a huge infusion of funding for community boards. So the upshot of what I'm trying to say is: yes, let's have a committee to discuss it it'll be a great vehicle for people to get expertise and really think these things through with the time this issue deserves, and maybe it ought to be run out of the borough president's office even putting together all the Manhattan community boards. But I. Don't think this is something for us to resolve in this meeting right now, I think so we resolved it. We should just continue with these virtual meeting sizes. I, don't think just to clarify my comment to cause about the other meetings law was it didn't sound like he was talking about a public meeting. If he's talking about a public meeting, then clearly, there's no issue he's talking about board members, and that raises some issues and I. Don't know what the answer is and I don't think anyone is suggesting that people come back to a meeting without proper person without a vaccine or without proper precautions because of the health risks. That is precisely what everyone has suggested. So I think that should be completely off the table: the idea of having an open, an in-person meeting without there being a health situation that would allow for that to happen, and if the I think if the governor brought back the open meetings law before everyone was ready for it, I think there would be some kind of rebellion. So I would rather just talk about what happened once it's safe to go back to over some meetings and Alita I meant to call the question when the tabling issue: Billy, yes, is that it? Okay, I know that we I see Sharon and Michelle and Barry hasn't had a chance to speak, sherry and Michelle. Have this was just about the tabling Barry went away, did Barry go away, I don't mean we I. Believe Barry was going to do this having okay. So then, let's so then, unless Berry is that what you're doing are you second thing he's not a guess and causes as well? Alright, so then I think since we're just talking about tabling it, I'll just skip I hope you don't mind Michelle and whoever else I know there was someone else had raised their hands and let's just vote, we have a different secretary who wants to call the roll for the voting on the tabling of a discussion on in-person and virtual meetings? Is there okay? Is there a secretary here I know I'm looking at Billy anyone else, I don't see any hands raised so Billy. It's all yours go ahead. Oh I see Rebecca. So let's give her Becca a chance. Sorry, Billy Rebecca, are you ready, I think it's I can do it, but I thought Rebecca, daughter, Rebecca was going to do this vote and I can do it. I don't see her hand. So it's ok. You go ahead, Rebecca all right. So if you would like to vote no abstain or not vote for cause on tabling, please raise your hand we have do. We need to have a table and goal of when we can resurrect the conversation. Should that be part or just temporarily. Okay, I, don't think so. Okay going once going twice seeing none the motion passes unanimously, great okay, so then I guess we're sorry. She needed some light for anyone who has ideas about how to proceed. I'm all ears, not right this second, but in general, okay, I'd, like to turn to the last item on the agenda, which is a conversation on how the board could better support the black members of our community and black businesses within our community. I know: okay, but where you raise your hand and I know that Wilma also has something that she'd like to contribute. So why don't we took because I don't see her raising her hand so Barbara? Why don't you go ahead and this was really intended to be the way I had thought of? It was for members of the community to just talk about the things that matter to them. No speakers, no resolutions just really to listen, but having said that, I don't see anyone else, raising their hands, so I'll go with Barbara and then and then hopefully Wilma. Okay, we have son Draya, let's go to son Draya. First, okay, we'll go to Barbara, first go ahead, Barbara and then I see mrs. Brown, lorraine, brown and Sondre. Ah so go ahead, Barbara and then them like simple questions. Aleta. How do we change this? Many good things I. Think every single committee has something to do. If it's just businesses, you can go on a website. We could reinvent the wheel, but there are websites that talk about black businesses. I'd, be curious to know the ones in our area that was my favorite shoe store was black owned and the landlord wouldn't renew executive shoe store, wouldn't renew it on 3rd Avenue. We now have a cookie place for very skinny people. They must be no calories and these delicious cookies everything people go to every single committee. If you want to talk about education in our community, I know what I have heard of these schools that are predominantly black. Schools are predominately, not black. Certainly the Health Committee I think we can go for the next 42 years with issues that would be affecting housing needs to address what to do so. I think that this week this is just such an overwhelming topic, certainly anything to do with the judicial justice and mental health and every single subject. Every single committee deals with this and I would sort of like to maybe each committee. You talk about environment, I, just read a wonderful book with the ice don't see about the Flint situation. If you want to talk about environmental injustice and I, do know that some of the projects of some of the less you know some of the buildings have terrible asbestos and mold, and all that aren't there that there is a divide with that. So I just think every single committee should be able to come up and maybe send you some ideas of what we want to do. But I would I would like to hear that, of course, and I have asked committees to and not with respect as much but before to come up with ideas and talk about things. But this was supposed to be a way for people in the community who might have felt that they were not listen to that they don't have a voice, because community boards are the lowest level city agency, and that here is a direct line into the city for people who have otherwise felt somewhat removed from the government processes. So I see aundrea and then I, don't know what happened to your son was, for some reason will most hand just isn't raising virtually done meter, because I knew you'd recognize yeah, let's go to Wilma first and then country and then I, don't know what happened to Lorraine brown will so, but she was on okay Wilma go ahead. Please hi I spent a good part of the day today, searching around our district to find out that there were any black owned businesses and if I am wrong and I find in me, I would like to write it to. Let me know where they are I wish. There was a way to introduce black businesses. You know in our community is reached it with some ways, but all the stores that are closed, I'm, never gonna come back or store for this fire to go someplace or another state. There are a lot of opening, storefronts and openings, and if it was a way to get more or any like owned, businesses in our community I hope that it would be appreciated. Thank you. There would be so I would like to try I, don't I, don't know how on Sondre. Oh well, would you a mitochondria again I would like the one of several maybe about two decades ago, I used their tennyson lon mexican, and I was working out of the nineteen, but due to rent and everything like that. Sometimes those businesses just can't stay afloat because they're, not you know, they just don't have the funding, but it was a very pricey some long compared to other ones like have gone before and after and it was a good salon. I did go on my lunch break them so forth, but you have to see that it's affordable for them as well, because the area is so pricey, it's very hard for them. Just the same also I would like to say that recognize what one is tribute to over a people person of color. That's one of the issues. If you want to speak just straightforward about the privilege that others have and some people of color don't have, we need to educate people need to educate yourself about black history and understand that silence is complicit and hire, promote and support black professionals if they are qualified. That's very important, because at the end of the day, when one software we all suffer, that's just all I had to say. Thank you. Thank you. If anyone has any resources, I've been working on compiling a list of and I know, there's a ton of information out there on resources for people to become more educated and more aware, we could certainly publish those, so please feel free to send them to me or to will he'll pass them on. Are there any before we go back to the board members? Are there any other members of the community that would like to participate into to have a say now: okay, I, don't see anyone raising their hands from the community? So why don't we go to Craig again so building off of what Wilma was saying, I think one of my frustrations is that I don't have any idea either. What business is within our community are black owned. Businesses are businesses that are owned by people of color I, don't know there would be any interest in community board a spearheading, some sort of efforts to promote them or have put it put out as some sort of flyer or sticker or poster that could be put in Windows of any business that wishes to participate, indicating that it is black owned business or business owned by a by people of color, so people so the general population would know and may seek them out in order to try to frequent them, and it goes back to our general issue with also just not always knowing who owns any business and if we're all trying to promote small and infrequent small businesses and independent businesses. How do we really know who that is? And if the end that, if a seemingly small business isn't is or isn't what it appears to be, and then the other thing which is slightly off topic but I think is relevant as well as perhaps we want to even expand this effort, and this goes along with the idea that maybe all committees have a role in this. But have we ever considered having some sort of perhaps task force for people of color or something that will allow community to address issues regarding people of color and whether it be promoting businesses or other issues that are faced with, based on a regular basis like these matters and stuff and such but things that are more systemic. That really encompass more than just this topic. That really needs to be discussed holistically in terms of holistic discussion. I've reached out to all of the Manhattan community boards for joint participation in programs and borough-wide programs on issues of racial equity, social justice and more than half have responded positively. I haven't heard from the other half yet so. I think that that's a way so that we reach all of Manhattan and have a diverse group of people on all ends of it and for specific local issues we have come. We have our committees that are able to plan and talk about and come to some kind of resolution or how forums with speakers on various local issues right now, but I'm listening to everybody, so okay, Thank, You, Craig, Billy and then Tricia and then Sharon. So just a couple things on this I hope, I'm, not you know putting anyone on this spot. You know I know a couple of us have voiced. You know a few that there should be some sort of task force on these issues and I want to be and I want it, particularly you call it's andreia for you know raising this I. You know I'm being a little hesitant here, because I think we're all trying our best and I think there's an effort, and maybe it's rightly so, to see what the work the committees can do and I have a few thoughts on that. But I do think there may be an appropriate time for us to consider whether a community board Rachel does justice committee or Task Force is warranted, but let's start first with the committee's. You know, I think. If we're going to look to our committees tackle these questions, there ought to be a very specific directive, and that is each committee should have a meeting and produce something I'll just call it a report on what that committee and its subject merit matter. Area should be considering and what are the racial justice implications? What's the history of systemic racism as it goes to transit or small business or housing or anything in our city, so I think that would be important and bigger picture. You know every year we put out a district need statement and I would like to see us have a district need statement that considers the racial justice needs of our community. You know we have a population, I believe is 3.7 percent black. You know what is it that we can do should do at all levels of government to rectify that to acknowledge the barriers, the racial barriers that exist in our neighborhood in our city. So I don't see why, whether put that in a district need statement or make that its own report I, think that would be completely appropriate and it's something where we could look to each committee to separately contribute to. But you know, Wilma I think you know you're right. That's my understanding as well know black owned businesses and community district 8 I think we all have to ask ourselves why that is. It's obviously there's a long history in this country and it's too complicated for this one meeting, which is why I go to sort of my last idea, which is: let's have a full board meeting or somebody you know instead of a land-use presentation or something at the beginning. Let's have somebody speak to the state of black owned businesses in New, York City and in our district. Let's have someone with true expertise who studied these issues? Who can give us guidance because look? This is an overwhelmingly white board and I think with few exceptions. Not many of us have the expertise to tackle this really entrenched problem, so I think we should would benefit from starting off with somebody presenting to us helping us gain the expertise, giving us a foundation for doing our own work as a community and then, lastly, let's find ways to reach out to the people in our community or black and brown, who don't necessarily look like this community board, but you know we know there in our community. They may not might not always come to our meetings, but they're, you know, they're our neighbors they're, our brothers and sisters and I think we have an obligation to meet them where they are and not expect them to come to our community board meetings. Necessarily so I think those are all things we should at least be considering. Thank you. Okay, Trisha hi, everybody I just want to be very brief. I think that I thought I'd be more clear by the time I got to me and I think that this is such an important conversation to have and I'm really glad to have it with the entire board and I applaud Thank You Leah for creating an opportunity for everybody to talk about it. I really image practice the idea of thinking about systemic racism through each committee and thinking about equity issues and through each committee, I think that is interesting or not just interesting. But it raises interesting questions that maybe we haven't considered in the past and I would be very supportive of us kind of pursuing that pursuing that route. I just I want to share something very briefly and I I'm I recognizing that I benefit from a lot of privilege of my own and for my own personal life. But a lot of this has brought up a memory that I had when I, when the second Avenue subway had opened up, and we were in the subway and dope and I noticed that a woman was walking with her skirt, unzipped and I went over to her and I tapped her on the shoulder to let her know that her skirt was unzipped and she screamed and wrapped her purse and thought that I was trying to rob her and my husband had to go over and tell her that I wasn't trying to rob her. That I was just trying to tell her that something was wrong with her skirt and it's always struck me in that moment of. There are just so many underlying biases and again just a small minor thing from some from someone who is a person of color, but not a black person and I. There's a lot of more at stake here, but I like the idea of thinking about the undercurrents of bias that are in our that run, maybe through our committees through our own lives. Here on the Upper East Side I. Think it's very important for a community that isn't primary, that isn't majority people, color majority black for us to be having these conversations to it, makes it bigger and it elevates it so I would be very supportive of the idea that we continue these conversations past tonight. That would continue these conversations in our communities and then and that we kind of make equity and racial justice, an issue that is kind of weaves throughout everything that we do. Okay and one of the topics that I've talked to the other boards about doing, is a program on implicit bias. So I it does. It does come up in many context: okay, Sharon and then Brian. Are there any other? Is there anyone from the public eye just because the purpose of this was again to provide an ear for people in the public, but it's fine that it's turned into this, but I just want to make sure that anyone who might be interested in speaking has another an opportunity. Okay, Sharon! You are muted. First of all, thank you so much for your comments. So Sandra I really appreciate them and I'm so glad that we're having this conversation and also thank you Billy as well as Tricia, two things, one more directly to answer a question about black owned businesses. And how do we find it? How do we find them and locate them? A Yelp has begun a new initiative to list whether or not businesses are or blackened and that's a good place to start. They would obviously have to self-identify as such and contact Yelp, but that certainly and I'm not I, don't work for you if I'm, not supporting you by just saying that that's certainly a place to start and companies and committees and organizations around the country are having these types of conversations and I'd like to thank a leader and Bill as well. I will on that bill a leader and will for initiate initiating this conversation, and while we are, although we are talking about black owned businesses, I really want to follow up something specifically that Tricia said and that's. The idea of intrinsic biases and I should say that we should look internally as well, overall and I think that Billy touched on this and, more specifically with black owned businesses, but with our communities overall and certainly how we interact with each other on the board. I'll tell you that one of the reasons- and this is very low on my list, but one of the reasons why having these virtual meetings is because you get to see who raises their hands and often I, have certainly been in meetings where I've raised my hand and have done so consistently and often over a period of time and have been ignored consistently. So it is and I understand that these intrinsic biases do take place and they do happen even within the community board, and it speaks a lot to the board members to leader to our executive team, executive staff of the board that and board members overall that we're engaging in this conversation. So, although I know that we were supposed to focus exclusively on black owned businesses, I'm really happy that we're. You know expanding it a bit so that we look internally within the board as well as externally about what we can do. Thank you, Brian and Tara you and I. Well anyway, Brian and I'm in May and Greg Morris, yeah I appreciate it. Thanks Lita, as this conversation was going on, I actually started scouring the city's website for MBE or minority business enterprise businesses that were certified and looking in looking up to you, know, cb8 zip codes. I have found like three businesses so far, I think I'm going to make it a point. You know to kind of look up all the ZIP codes in CBA to try to see if I can identify names of businesses addresses that has phone numbers and emails and I'd be happy to share that list with you Elita you and well. So that way we can at least identify second thing: I do want to figure back on what Billie was saying, because I think it really is important to we're talking about it now as a group and then to take it back to the to the committee level and I think you know. Maybe a task for each committee is to answer the question. That's here on the agenda, which is how can the specific committee at create a mission statement to support black businesses and I? Think that would be a good test for each committee to do on his own and it may be bringing everything back to the next board meeting Brian when you find out whether other black owned businesses. We could then approached them and asked if they would want some kind of sticker like that to put in their window. We haven't actually really talented designer who's, an intern in the office, and she did agree flier for how the community could support small businesses. So maybe it's something to think about approaching them and asking if they would want something to identify they may or may not, I don't know, but that, but that's something that someone had raised. So thank you for doing that: okay, May and then Greg may you're, not unmuted. Yet uija. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah right and so I echo a lot of what's been said, I, you know, I want to piggyback also off of what the points that Billy made agree with the idea of a task force. I agree that the work of supporting lot community members and business owners should be undertaken by all committees. I think, in addition to answering the question, and maybe coming up with the action plan of guiding strategy, is to look at like all the activities of the committee and assess them through a real equity lens. There are frameworks out there. In fact, I know of money that are undertaking under you know, undertaking a similar process internally to just understand what are we doing? What can we do better in terms of I? Think the biggest issue is, we definitely have a deficit of black community members and the fact that there are there is no one from the community and please correct me if someone did speak to is here to ask a question says a lot, but it sounds like we're all on in agreement that has to be changed. I. Think a fundamental question for me is: how does how do we as a community board and how does the network of community boards broadly across the city promote community board participation like where? How are we promoting it? To whom are we promoting? Are we being really intentional about ensuring that we are diversifying- and you know this opportunity citywide to ensure that not only are we attracting black community members and more of them, but we're attracting people who represent an intersection of a number of identities, including, hopefully more LGBTQA? You know lgbtq+ identifying, committee members etc, so yeah and then I strongly agree with a lot of the sentiment shared, particularly by Brian and billion well, mines. Andrea! Thank you. Okay, Greg yeah, hi you're, a muted, Greg hi good evening everyone. So let me just echo some of the comments I've already heard, but also just start. You know obviously I'm a I'm, a white male and I have no doubt benefitted from power and privilege throughout the course of my life and I think a starting point to acknowledge. That is an important thing for those of us who have experienced that power and privilege to sort of start with. I am also the executive director of an organization that largely serves black and brown people and is largely run by black and brown folks, and so again, there are ways in which the experience that they have had and what they experienced is very different than what I have experienced and I need to both be a good listener. I need to be an ally and I need to work relentlessly in support of you know, addressing systemic racism I'm starting kind of framing my thoughts in that way, because I think this community board, as folks have you know have said you know, is- does not appear by virtue of a quick glance to be the most diverse board and I. Think when we think about the topics and the opportunities and the ways in which we communicate and the content we cover, one might argue as well. It doesn't feel particularly inclusive, but I say that saying as well that I've been around for a year, it may be I, don't know as much as I guess. My more pertinent point to this is that the quite the first question has to be I. Think what does this community board want to be and if it is a desire to represent the needs of all of the community? To the speakers point the fact that community men are not participating in this or the agenda. I think says a lot, I think the reframing reorganization and perhaps, and how I move this board intersects with the needs of the community. All community members probably has to change and I think identifying black owned businesses is a pretty low bar. It's important, it's critical, but it's the least. We could do I. Think the effort to be made to talk about what the value of this board is, how this board seeks to interact and engage with the community, regardless of what block you live in and represent the needs of the residents, regardless of how they identify is critically important. I think the committee's are a great venue for that, but the starting point has to be that there is a collective understanding, perhaps and a statement to be made to say that this board values understands that, creates that it what its job is and that is to represent the needs of its community at the same time, I think there's something important about us in this moment of national reckoning to say that there is systemic racism and we need to speak up any chance. We get to address that, because that racism disproportionately impacts black and brown folks. That may not be the typical nature of a community board, but the moment in time our moment in history has shifted, it's changed and we can either step into it and lean into it and make it part and parcel of who we are, as some of the speakers have sort of noted, or we can. We can hope that passes. It's my hope, and my interest as a member of this board to do more than I have done thus far to call out what I see and to push on the buttons that we need to push on to ensure that this community and our communities really understand what the value of this is and that it does represent all and also that we have work to do as a board. That's largely filled with privileged folks that we have to understand implicit bias and we have to understand microaggression, and we are not going to be content to just sit back and be part of systems that have disproportionately impacted folks, who may look differently than we do I believe everybody on this call is well-intentioned and we're all probably on different sort of range of the spectrum in terms of what we believe or how we believe, but I do believe as representatives in this moment. In this national moment of recognize, I said, we've got to do more, we've got to do more and it starts with acknowledging who we are, what is unacceptable and then it begins a process of figuring out. What are the mechanisms and steps we can take to be better than this? Thank you. There's a member there's, a member of the public Paige Montgomery I'd like to have her speak next, will would you unmute her Thank You Paige? Yes, thank you and I really appreciated all of this discussion, and particularly what Greg, the last speaker, I believe that was her name was just saying: I, just I loved the thinking about trying to understand and listen past our biases I, like the unconscious bias, training ideas, I like being able to reach out and understand who the community board is and what they represent and I was just gonna say, as y'all were talking about getting a list of the black businesses in the community. It would be really helpful to hear from them what would be helpful and I think you know what I have learned in through my professional career development that we're tackling this as well we're trying to listen to those black and brown community members. Colleagues to understand, because as much as we want to try to understand and listen, we don't walk in those shoes. So I just really echo the things that I've heard and would love to see having people brought in either call to you know, ask what could be helpful and bring in those community members to adhere their voices and thank you, yeah. That was that was the idea for this part of the meeting was to have people from the community, but maybe there was insufficient outreach or something. So we will work on that because absolutely listening is critical: okay, Sondra and then Rebecca and Rita LaBelle Rebecca, lamort, totes, Andre, oh well: okay, you're, unmuted, okay, hi, sorry, I'm back again, so systemic racism and our social justice is not limited to just black people, nor the LGBTQ community. I feel that this board does not have to collaborate with other boards in Manhattan. That to me is cb8 hanging in the shadows. If we are going to impact the community that the board serves, then we should spearhead a task force. And/Or committee that can focus on this type of work. Other committees have their own focus and they cannot take on these issues effectively compared to a task force and or a new committee that can solely do the work they can solely focus on the work. So that's my feeling of us lending it in to different meetings. It's not going to be the same impact is not going to be the same effect. If we're going to really do this work, we need to form something that a few people can get on in. The community can probably be on board and speakers and so forth to come in so we're gonna do the work. We should do the work if we, if we're going to do it as a community. That's it! Thank you Rebecca yeah! This is about more than just black owned businesses to me. I think we have a real opportunity, like Sondra just said, to really make something more of this and not have it be a Manhattan Board thing, but a cb8 thing, because right now, while we're meeting, hundreds of our community members are at Carl, Schurz Park, marching to support racial equity and justice and I think the community's really ready for change. That's not just supporting a black owned business, but it's the board having a mission statement about racial equity, injustice and the work we want to do to write past wrongs in our neighborhood, be it with zoning or transportation access or education and equity, and for the task force. What comes to mind is perhaps it's the task force where there's an employee, an appointee from each committee and that way all the communities are represented. So all the issues are there, but it's not just focused on one little niche area. It's you know. Racism is pervasive. Racism is everywhere and I say that as a little white lady, that has more privileged than some people in our community will ever know and I. Think it's important that we acknowledge that like Greg said, and we really do the gritty work which isn't gonna be easy and it's not gonna be comfortable for everyone, and you know: I've gone to these vigils and a lot of what said is you know, people of color in our community say I, don't think I belong here, I didn't think there was a place for me here. I didn't think my neighbors cared and, in my opinion, it's really incumbent on the community board as a whole, not just to say yeah. We care about black businesses, but we care in general about this issue and we're gonna. Take it seriously. So I know we're gonna recess in August, but maybe in September. We kick it off with the task force where there's representation from each committee and we have representation from black leaders in our community. So there are the voices leading and that we as white allies, we're you know just complimenting and uplifting because they think we'll take up. Perhaps too much space in this conversation and a part of is also really taking that back seat. So we can learn and grow and educate ourselves to really be mindful about the work ahead and what we need to be do that's purposeful and not just performative or for show, and certainly the goal is to make a difference. Thank You, Rita, yeah, I needed this is systemic. Just this weekend, one of our council members said there are 300 available portable apartments on Roosevelt Island and at the same time, there is a new development in East, New, York Brooklyn, and in doing a comparison of where the ami was basically only 24 families 24 out of the entire in Brooklyn out of the entire building, which is over 300 apartment, 24 people could qualify to apply on Roosevelt Island because of the ami. So what it is that we have segregated neighborhoods and when we have, we want to desegregate if to start with desegregating the neighborhoods and what it is that tax abatements are given to bigger developers and that's one desegregating the neighborhoods. The other thing is that the media I stopped watching the network 11 o'clock news, because all I saw on the news were people who were behaving badly and more often than not, they were a person of color. That is not there. It's not there, and so, therefore, it carries over as a halo effect. It carries over to other things. I go up to Harlem to buy food because I happen to like a lot of that stuff. Could it exist here? It's not a community board. It is. It takes everything. This is just the icing on a cake, we're I'm talking about the cake. We have to bake the cake first before we ice it and that's you know, that's why I want to see it start. We can start, we could do it. That's my thing. Thank you. Thank You, Laraine, Brown, Miss Brown. You may have to push a button on your screen to confirm. Thank you, mrs. Brown. Firstly, I have just checked my filter. Secondly, I want to thank Sharon pope Marshall for the comments. I agree with you 100%. Thirdly, I'm going to be succinct and saying that everyone on this call and on this board needs to self-audit, do a self audit to a place of discomfort and ask if you want to be on the right side of history. This is not a black issue. This is our human rights issue and if you want to do the work, I'll participate, but if it's just lip service, no of the same shame on you. That's all I have to say thank you. Thank you. Hey Barbara, I'm gonna skip to Sarah and Jack because they haven't had a chance to participate. Will we join you? Sarah you're, a muted hi I, just want to thank my colleagues so much and for raising this issue and being open to it and for this broad energy that that's moving on wanting to take on this issue. I, just I'm, remembering back in the day, I think taina and Elizabeth were part of about 10 or 12 years ago we were having a discussion about the J rec complex in I, think 68 and second, and whether or not the school would be raised to be replaced with a research center for Hunter and I was really surprised and struck by some of the comments from the that I heard in the course of those community board meetings and at one point, someone from the community stood up and said these kids don't look like us, they aren't our children and so I. It was something that was really painful to hear and I've held on to it all these years. But the great news is that I think that our community has changed a lot. Are we see it at Carl shirts and we hear it among all of us, and so thank you for the energy and the desire to do this work. I would just say that, as someone who works for us all, just social justice organization and who's gone through these implicit bias, trainings and who, with my colleagues at work and we've, done a number of these different kinds of trainings. It's really painful, and it's really hard and it's something that we need to work on or quite sometime and so. I hope that this task force is a start and that this isn't something that we spend a few months on and move past, but that it's something that we really integrate into the work that we do and into the frame that through which we do our work. So thank you, everybody for being so open and for being so thoughtful about taking this on and I really hope to be a part of it. Thanks. Thank you. Okay, jack, oh yeah, we did yeah I mean I just wanted to share I'm, just we're having this conversation, something that I'm I've learned recently through conversations I've had through my school throughout the year. We've had some race issues at my school and we have a lot of conversations about how we can address that. How we can how we can fix it, I mean in our efforts to listen. We I have learned that some of the african-american or people of color people in my school feel that sometimes people put too much pressure on them to educate us on what we're doing wrong. Instead of we just educating ourselves, they feel as though it's not their job to educate us on our pre justices or our racism, and they feel as though it's uncomfortable for them to be the only person in a room I'm talking about race and everyone turns to them and expects them to speak up when they don't want to speak up. So I welcome the conversation, and it is important to listen. It's just also important not to cross the line, we're forcing people to speak, so we can listen, but rather simply just listen. I thought it was just something: I could share Thank You Marco. Thank you. I would like to say that small business, especially restaurants, I, don't think we have in America know even a minority both of them. There are different country owners because are very simple people. The end of that have good quality side, Marcus Samuelsson, one of the biggest chair in the war. He preferred to go to a 125th. He doesn't want to be in the Upper, East Side and he's right and I respect that the other point I would like to raise is social equity, many time in the community war they coming to us, and they said we wanna feel more for more of your area and we want to put our affordable housing in the Bronx. We should be here in our community. It is a shame. I have nobody said. Anything I think has been fighting a lot for that, because any floor area that give it to the developer is not gonna. Give you to the Bronx so create like with a set celebration, especial simulation, and that is wrong. That's what we have to stand up against that and another issue is affordable housing how the affordable housing has to tackle as a as a as a minority. So it's a corner with the income. Obviously, in that group there is a lot of african-americans and Latinos too. So if we tackle in that direction, we can create a difference in our community. Second, another point that I have is the program 421a. This 4021 eight is just only to make Richard the developer. It's nothing for the community. No any community benefit for that one, because it's very simple: they give you just only twenty years, the developer, to have an arm very limited income and, after that become owner of the whole development, so them the developer that is very rich and beginning become richer after 20 years, because the program 421a this evaporate and now become a rental array, are a regular rental. So there are so many injustice that we cannot tackle in our community. I think the best thing. If anybody can read the statements of the community or one, the first issue, the race right, there is affordable housing and in our community we don't clearly attention in the direction and we are seeing that the developers, what they doing is demolishing at all the affordable housing to bring luxury housing which basically I'm not posed to be loved luxury housing. By the way, the only thing is they try to remove all the minorities and put outside of our community and create a bigger disparity by income in our community. Indeed, ice I did them a survey that in 12 developments for every affordable, new housing that is created, 7426 is demolished. So it's right there. We don't need to do create no programs. No special groups is right. There. We can see every single date and I has been mentioned all the time. The same numbers and apparently I'm talking to the air, sometimes because it should be allowed, are mean for all of us that in this case it should be for the minority and that's included all the races in the part, because those people that have less fortune, they have less possibility to have a PC and only an honest site or house to lead and I. Think that is wrong and I think we can do if we can do something better. What are they doing in 92nd, Street development and I? Think it's completely outrageous how they throw the money from FEMA to destroy the last chance to create affordable housing, because in our community we don't have a single lot to build, affordable housing. Unless you are willing to pay a wall Adam book, she told me that, yes, there is enough for a lot available in our community. 19 million of dollars for aha for 188,000 is poor feet so basically to create affordable housing community is zero all minorities, the only chance we have is to increase, affordable housing in those are under development sites, such as a I set and homes Tower. This is the only place, and this place also is in jeopardy. Sooner many will come a very strong weather condition and they will be suck all create all the kind problems and these problems in the situation. Maybe they put in the street 536 families with children's, because they don't know what they do and what they cannot be. So the issue is right there. This team has said: affordable house is the main issue, so let's go talk of them: affordable, housing, yes, I, do have a problem by the way, because this is what I mentioned in the direction. Thank you, Oh Marco. You know that we are trying, with height limits, to get special districts to protect the tenements and we're doing some work to try and figure out how many affordable housing units we've lost and that we are always asking the city for affordable housing and have been, as you pointed out, ignored, and that is a huge root of a problem- is to not have enough of that you're absolutely right, but it's not something that we've ignored. It's something that I believe the city has ignored, that we've been asking for and pushing for and, as you point out, a lot of the city and state policies are very benefit and, as Rita pointed out, are very beneficial to certain developers and not to the communities. I see Peter has raised his hand, will yeah I just like to say very briefly: I mean I, endorse and support just about all the comments and we've only begun. The conversation, certainly housing is fundamental. Education is fundamental. Availability of jobs is a fundamental criminal. Justice is fundamental, although that doesn't impact our community as much because we're mostly white but there's no more in just part of our society, I believe that our justice system so calls and so I'm simply gonna say if this is just conversations for tonight. It's gonna evaporate, so I definitely endorse the idea of having some kind of you know ongoing task force to look at this more holistically. Thank you. Thank you. Bret. Are you cut out for saying who are you Aleta? We lost your sound, alright Greg and Barbara rudder. Okay in that order. Sorry so this is. This is Greg I'll, just jump in very quickly to say, I think that this conversation has been useful and thoughtful. I also think during the course of I, also think during the course of this conversation. There have been a few moments of times when we might benefit when it's clear that we might have benefited from implicit by it. Biased training there's been some, maybe microaggressions, and some of the comments that folks have made specific to people in people of color and I just want to sort of flag that to say as a listener. During the course of this dialogue and of itself, while constructive and I think thoughtful, there have been a few moments where I think, just amongst ourselves. We have some serious learning to do in terms of how we think about black and brown folks in particular, but I just think I just want to sort of flag that and identify it without getting into any specifics. I think this conversation of itself demonstrated a need for some additional training and reflection in terms of how we speak and how we think about racism, how we think about race, ethnicity, etc. Thank, You, Barbara, my writer I agree with everything that said, but I will say: I've been on lots of zooms about this eye and spoken I do read books with it. I strongly suggest between the world and me Coates is just the most enlightening book and I. Think Sarah Chu knows my feeling about just mercy with Bryan Stevenson that would bring tears to your eyes and so on, but I'm afraid that our community board I don't want it to be personal, so I'm trying to be very careful and I've thought of it, but I think we have very good words and I think we don't necessarily follow through and what's brought great emotion on. A couple of different levels about the protests that are going on is how successful it is and how laws are changing. I do not believe that will make any real progress until laws change and that may be uncomfortable for us. So yes, it's housing, which may mean that we have more integrated as a yes, it's health, which means that some of our taxes may go up to either have universal health care or more supportive, have other types of hospitals, and so on. Yes, it's jobs. That may mean that we want the minimum wage to go up. That will be uncomfortable and I am quite truthfully. Sat here, some time and I may be guilty also I'm, certainly far from pure, but where, if it's not convenient, if we argue against it, we all have wonderful words and I. Think we all mean it so I agree with a task force, but I would love it to go on a more granular level. I'd like to repeat again, I would like to meet with my plan on writing to my committee tomorrow. To say what can we send as ideas? Certainly, health, even maternal health. You know: what's there different services that are not given as well foods and security, that is more of its poor generally, but the poor usually means that and we need something more granular than just a task force. Robert Fullilove I was at the meeting that I held and then again is somebody. If you look at his YouTube talks about the history of why there was such discrimination, so we can all be enlightened, but until we do something more than that and change laws and say yes, we are going to provide good health, I'm. Sorry, but I know that others are focused on housing. I focus on elf, until we do more than that, I think it's won't get more than nice words and I. Think we, as a community I, always felt that one of our powers of a community board is to convince our elected to change the laws or enhance the laws or to listen to what we said and we have been successful to some degree. So I hope we go beyond task force and I hope that the committee's and I hope it's okay. If I work on my committee, not instead of a task force but ideas that I have been mulling over for a long time, I'm working on for a long time going to lots of meeting social justice environment. As I said, these are just such major topics that unless laws have changed, it wasn't until. If you read that book, what your eyes don't see, it wasn't until Flint changed laws that their water got better. But meanwhile, the black and brown children have had a couple of years of drinking lead in their formula and we need to change this and understand it more than feel-good type of things and for mrs. Brown. When you said, if you don't take part I wish I could have taken part in those I'm too scared to take part of the protests. I just feel I'm too vulnerable and I didn't take part, but my kudos for every single person that went out and protested and got something amazing done and changes will be made. I wish it was me 20 years ago. It was me so well just write your mission statement for your committee. Do the work talk to people about it am I still my minute now talk to people about it. Barbara and the goal is definitely to try and invoke some kind of change at various levels and as much as we can Billy. Okay I wanted to propose a resolution. If one is appropriate necessary to create a task force on this board to address these issues, but I wanted before a leader, you jump in I, do want to say: I, don't want to step on the toes of the committees. I think we should empower the committees to take on these issues with their expertise. What I'd like to do is borrow an idea that Rebecca lamort mentioned, which is that this task force should be made up of representation and the various committees to make sure that the expertise and what those committees is working on is being reflected, but I do think we need some body that brings together all these areas because they do intersect. You can't talk about transportation and not talk about housing. You can't talk about policing, you not talk about cops in our schools. You can't have those conversations separate, so I think we should have a body that brings all this work together and with I. Think an end product is what I put in this resolution an end product of a effectively as sort of a district report, community district report on systemic racism and racial injustice in community district 8. So I'd like to propose that resolution see if anyone a second Billy, we don't. How can we have a resolution to the board asking the board to do something that the resolution is saying? We don't need a resolution to create a committee or create a task force or ask the committees to do any of the things that we've talked about tonight. So I, don't really understand. Yeah I just want to make sure that we do. We do something that this conversation doesn't end here. I, don't think it has to be addressed. I understand if it's a wave of the hand and boom a task force is compared. There certainly seems to be enough sentiment to be able to move in that direction and do something like that. So I, just I, don't know, but let's see what Sharon has to say: Sharon, oh I'm, sorry, but I was just seconding Billy's resolution. However, I do understand that we may not necessarily need one but I agree with Billy sentiments that we should not conclude this discussion without having some type of framework in place. So we don't necessarily have the resident have to have a resolution. You know it's fine by me, but as long as we have some clear next steps, I'm good with that are you? Are you good with that? Billy I see it some other I, don't know if you can see him but he's raising his thumb. Okay, it's great. Thank you sure I, really like the idea that believe would forth about a passport I think we should maybe allow the committee to work a little on doing some things first before a task force, because a task force is a smaller amount of people and they don't meet as much and the committees would allow a lot more people to gather information and go back and forth thoughts and then eventually a task force to be used. All those ideas that the committee came up with and work with that on another level, I'm, not sure what all the differences are. But the goal is to have an develop that our understandings, that are, mechanisms that are rude right and to be able to create some force for change I'm, not to be another Hill in committees, yes, I able to make recommend to be able to on all committees for the local issues and if you're talking about the systemic racism, lack of social justice, then something that could that could look at that in a broader way. There's certainly been a lot of a lot of ideas raised and a lot of things that we should all be thinking about. So we should be thinking about them, stores, recognizing stores, supporting stores, I'm, not so sure that I agree. It's a low bar I think it's not the bar, but it's there it's more like spokes of a wheel that feels like we should be doing things to support people individually, because that is a means to certain changes in their lives. Perhaps and I think we should be doing a lot on a local level on a borough level on every puss on every level and, of course, our impact changes, depending on what we're doing and judging by the abundance of hands. I'm, probably saying the wrong things, but there's lots of stuff to think about and absorb and to try and really create an opportunity and a means for change. So I that that's all I could say: let's go to mrs. Brown Lorraine will did you unmute her? Yes, I'll ring you're unmuted, mrs. Brown I was just unmuted. Thank you, I believe I'm, the oldest person on this board I'm 88 years old. I sat on counters in the 50s and 60s in the south part of the Freedom Riders freedom fighters, I've gone to jail by been hose, I've been beaten for civil rights, fair housing, voter suppression, and so when I hear comments from a fellow read member, referring to some of the comments that were expressed by the people this evening, as micro, aggressive I, take exception to that where they're confused with passion and therefore I suggest strongly that everyone look at the word racism and do that self-audit and these types of comments under that umbrella. We have to I'm sorry with somebody commenting that was just me, I'm sorry, I thought you had finished but go right ahead. I'm sorry for interrupting I took a breath. Thank you, I think. At this point a leader I will allow you to make your comment and ask well to keep the mic open. Should I need to respond. Thank you, no Lorraine I'm. So sorry for having interrupted you, please continue we're not going to share something with the board. It's not! It's not I heard the comment differently, but I want you two to speak because I wasn't the one who said it was just my might and I have it's really silly for me to continue. So you go right ahead. Please I! Think at this point, we've all said: I know and I don't need to respond to anything anymore. Everybody hasn't has kids of her own interpretation, but once again it's about doing the work. It's about the self-audit, where it places us at a point of discomfort. We have to start there that that's critical. Thank you. Well wait before you go I know that you talked about doing the work I'd like to know what you think avenues that you think we should be going down or the work that you think we should be doing and that's not to say that you need to respond now. But I would like to hear what you're saying about that. I will be more than happy to send to you my plan, my strategy, because I'm at a point with stage in my life, where hope is just the tease, it's I feel that it's used that it's designed to prevent us from accepting reality. So now, I think in terms of strategizing and planning, so I will send to you a plan or strategies. Thank you. Okay, Thank, You, Billy, I, think I thought I got cut you off again and I'm. Sorry Billy well, I want to first thank mrs. Brown for sharing she just shared and I hope. Whatever we do. Next, you know isn't formed in part by you know the strategies, the ideas you know, mrs. Brown and others on this board. I take to heart what Jack said, because I think for many of us there's always this tension about. You know the balance between trying to lead and trying to listen. I think we all ought to be doing a lot of listening, but my the one thing I want to communicate is I feel very strongly that we could very easily leave this meeting and have no real plan for what to do next and if we just give it to the committee's I'm, worried that there will be no structure to what the committee's are doing. One committee is going to come up with something detailed and thoughtful another committee, maybe just does something at a surface level, so what I think we can do going forward is have it if we do have a taskforce and formed by the ideas and strategies of members of this community board. That task force could then begin to lay out what each committee should be tasked with, and that will actually give us a structure in a direction going forward and some deadlines and expectations. And last year, two years ago we had charter revision task force that met in August, and so you know, I don't know about others. I feel there's a fierce urgency to these issues and I think if people were up for it having this task force begin to preliminary meet, even in August, to discuss these issues so that we can give something to the committee's that when they resume in September I, think that would be appropriate. So I just wanted to put that on the table, because I think we could very well leave this meeting without a direction and I want to make sure that we've got some sense of where we're going as a board on these important issues. Wilma, I, love to and then would a passionate about. Hearing this ground strategy. I mean a very certain as to what she said and the history that she spoke about and I feel that I would love to talk to her I'll try to find out discharge. I don't want to wait for tomorrow. December I want to meet with her tomorrow. As far as the past for Billy I think it's a very good idea. What you're talking about I think that, with everything that you have to say about how you want to do this or why you want it right away, I think it should be done right away. Billy I, don't think she wait too many votes on it to do it. They think you could do when I'm out at got one, but I am extremely Oh, can't wait to hear of his birth of faith, because it was very sensitive, other things that she said night really you I see which he was talking about and I just think that I could be helpful on a path for I could be helpful kind of any response coming from on how I can share my these people, the things that I would like to see them or have done- and you know I just think that is good- help us work together, I, try to figure out something and all because walls Court, which is said tonight. It allows little ways and we should just not talk to each other and try to meet and work up from being moving forward. Yes, we should move forward and maybe what the material that Lorraine brown is preparing could be prepared or sent in a way that it could be distributed to the board members. Dara I'm sorry did someone Lorraine did you won't? Was that you, we started to say something or you're, muted, I guess it was someone else wanting to say something about me did well not did was at you know, Oh Wilma, I, think the boy as she can received a guarantee, because it's really getting late, and we have a lot to think about okay. Well, there are two other people who have raised their hand, so Sarah and Craig Sarah hi, here unlimited hi, since we're talking about next steps, I like to suggest that, just echoing what a number of my colleagues have said, that the task force integrates people from the community affected communities and community leaders, because they could, they would be our advisors on how to move forward and that we that that's that that's part of doing that listening and these advisers can help enable us, as we move forward and put plans into action, and that may be this task. Force can also can also develop plans on how we can on what we can do. What resources we might have to build on and do the work that mrs. Brown was talking about. And so it could be a strategy for us internally in terms of our development art, and it could be a strategy for how we move through the work that we're doing through the committee's Thanks Thank You Craig again so I'm, not thinking about how we can formulate a pathway forward and be able to hopefully move on even tonight. So my thought is, as I mentioned earlier, I think a task force would be very beneficial on a on a local level and if we can get something started right away, that would be great, but especially considering the interest in having this be more broad-based and reaching all the different committees. I guess my thought is if we can have a dual hybrid approach, whatever you want to call it where we have a task force. That starts to think about these issues immediately and I. Don't know if we have a land-use meeting scheduled for September, but if we don't to devote that second Wednesday of the month or whatever Wednesday it is I know it's a little weird with Labor Day in September, but to have a meeting that is entirely focused on this, where each committee presents a five or ten minute report on the issues that they identify and hopefully at that point a task force will have also identified and can gone through the list for each committee and brainstorm this - what they view as potential issues as well. So we can then come together. Have that all laid out where we hopefully have a common understanding of how of the issues that are a hand for each committee that the task force can then move forward with, and we can come up with strategies as to how to address them beyond September. This way we're taking immediate action, we have homework that we're doing and we're getting the process started, but we're still including everyone and not at the expense of certain committees that may that may otherwise get left behind. Okay before I go to Marco it's 9:40 and anyone who wants to leave this is not required. So I, don't the people who stay are obviously welcome, and we could continue talking about this. But for anyone who would like to leave as I said, it's not a required board meeting Marco. Thank you, I think Craig. He I don't know. If I'm on scratch-off me you are, you are I'm. Sorry, thank you. I think Craig. He raised other good points each committee. He has its own expertise and no extra committee can create another way of thinking or lay out the general guidelines. It means each community has its own speciality and there are the best people they can come in with some ideas and they put it on the on the table. Let me tell raise another issue that last year about the charging Commission. For me with all respect, that was a joke because already was said they the guidelines established and we will just only discussing without no sense we reach a conclusion in none of the our accommodation reaching the real point. So let's go stop bureaucracy. Let's go stop and let each committee work by themselves and come with also proposal and from there we can move forward, because each committee has some speciality and no better than them can do anybody else and I think I strongly recommend it should be each committee coming with some ideas, whatever it is and presented to us, and then we can discuss each Camellia offer an idea exactly how they perceive to tackle decision. That is my point of view. Thank you. Thank you, okay, so anyone who's interested in being on the task force should email. Me I'd like to ask the committee's, as people have suggested, to come up with a plan to look at to tackle the issues pertaining to the committee that relate to social justice, racial inequalities in the community and then we'll organize a task force and have it take us down roads that we should be looking at and should be. Thinking of that may be hybrids with committees may be beyond the committee scope, as we've seen it right now and will help address, and maybe part of it is education or resources or learning or inner exploration opportunities for board members or members of the community. And if you have ideas about other people who either can advise or it could be on the task force, then please email, those suggestions as well, because the time is right and we are leaders in the community and in this and in the borough and in the city, and we should be doing something or many things so and for Loraine Brown. Please obviously there's a lot of interest in your ideas and for anyone else there is as well. Collaboration is critical, I've always thought so. Let's I know I am I'm just thinking as I'm speaking, which is always not necessarily a good idea, but let's see how much we can accomplish in a thoughtful manner. So thank you everyone and is there anyone else who would like to say anything before we finish? Okay, I, don't see, Oh Rebecca, Dan, Gore, you're, I, appreciate everything. That's been said, and this might be kind of nitpicky, but I would prefer it to be its own committee than a task force. The task force, it seems to suggest the time is kind of limited and this issue isn't going away but I'm happy that we're taking action. Thank you. Okay, Wilma green without food I agree with that. I really think that at this time not a task force, I think there's going to be a lot of work to be done in their community committee and I. Think we should do that for now and maybe a task force and the future than that laughs. Okay, anyone else. Okay, then, let's leave bye-bye thinking. Oh Sharon, can you hear me? Yes, I agree with Rebecca. Okay! Thank you, okay! Well, let's leave with thinking about this and email with your inclination to be a part of this and ideas that you have for other extra beyond the community board, membership advisors or a membership, and something will be structured and organized and we'll be able to move forward. Okay. Well, thank you. I know. You've had a lot of really good ideas. A lot of interesting suggestions, so I'm always ears for everything. You guys are all soft, fall and concerned about doing the right thing. So have a well we'll see each other next week right at the full board meeting motion to adjourn from someone motion, Rebeca second excellent, add in Vanessa I, don't see them, but I'll take your word for it. Okay, so meeting is adjourned and thank you have a good week. Stay safe, bye.
