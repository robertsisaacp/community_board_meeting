And we'll be joined if we have not already been joined by the Manhattan borough, commissioner of Parks, William Castro, without further Ado Council member, just to give you a little bit of backstory, which I think you already know, But of course we were all very concerned about open space , we're so proud that you have helped champion this issue during your tenure.
In our community and then, if you could give some kind of specific thoughts on Rupert One of the commitments I made when I got elected as I wanted to start a neighborhood association or Conservancy, or partnership for every Park and Muslim volunteers has been an amazing partner for Rupert, which has been hard to get had been hard to get off.
You were still present to the Knickerbocker Ta Tenants Association, yes, and so we work together to make sure that ninety first was designated a place treat by the Department of Transportation, and she is pretty much her and David Rosenstein who I missed terribly Many of you, Do work together with Lisa La Jolla to make that place, treat and so Rupert has been a park that has needed a lot of work.
Many of you joined us to break ground on three point: three million dollars to rebuild Carl Schurz Park playground, which I am hoping But I'm hoping we can have it open in September, because the kids will need it.
We have John Jay Park, where we've been able to secure funding with the parks and where we've opened completely new basketball courts, working with Greg Davis and the kids there, and then we also recently.
We have John Jay Park a senior space that this committee did a lot of the public hearings on that we need to move forward with and so for.
A lot of the dog runs, are not where people live, so we have one in Carl, Schurz Park.
And I think the board had been opposed to taking down the fences and the gates, because there are already there may already be an individual who sleeps in the park at night, and we did not want to make it easier for people to just come.
We want more seating areas throughout and do we want to set up instead of having the hill as it were, having a lower level and an upper level with the youth programming up top and the passive space down below, But I'm, hoping that with at least a half million dollars, They bring up hundreds of people to try to improve the park.
I'll just say the other big challenge we have is just no matter how much amazing work the Muslim volunteers do in terms of the plantings we end up at having all that get torn up very soon thereafter by folks who are not being good neighbors and are letting their dogs off the leash Then the dog ripping things up.
Anything in construction is continuing, so Carl Schurz park playground is continuing, but the John Jay, Park seating area and even the East River Esplanade project that I funded with the mayor have been a contractor is close to being selected they're ready to do the contract award, but the city has placed a hold on any of these new construction.
See mark sicarios on the pole and we brought them up with Wesley, but there is a lot of vandalism and the southern part of more attention to that area, since more and more people are using it Since there's such a dearth of public state in the area and the waterfront of so beautiful here, You're talking about exercise equipment in John, Jay and one of our next project, because we've got a lot of requests for it to put exercise equipment in some form on some part of the Esplanade.
Now that people will be exercising outdoors because I know, there's Jennifer Yes, their exercise equipment farther salad, I'm, not including East River Park, because that's a whole different ballgame, but on the Esplanade between Montgomery, Street and Brooklyn Bridge.
Let me know that the parks Department, you know- will work with sanitation and others, Something that you may have heard about in the city and that I tweeted about today is that one of the reasons I voted no is because they've been cutting random things that we did not want them to cut.
It really is not the best ground to put a park in of this kind because of the slow, causes, erosion as I'm sure most people know, but I think that's the initial thing that we should do The September's doing a major planting throughout the park.
Think parts for the kinds of changes for small changes, we're talking, hundreds of thousands to millions for the big kinds of changes that I think the park actually needs in terms of a major overhaul where I believe parks is saying.
I was about to get when we finally reserve resolve the some of the issues were discussing I'm back in the Ortz, where the councilman was talking about the Community Board got together and formed a 197, a plan which told the city how one wanted to use the various areas.
Isaac's playground need the attention And, I, think finding for the money And Then also just trying to figure out the future of the park.
I mean those are excellent pieces of equipment, but the other equipment that was put in there had Lots of moving parts are not useful pieces of equipment, they're easy to break, which is really what happened, but I have seen other equipments in other parts in other parks in the city that are very functional, So you were talking sounded like there was the possibility of adding additional equipments on the squad further down, but no one from the Upper East side is going all the way down to Chinatown, with a lower Eastside to go.
Hopefully, like my October, is our next event on the calendar and hopefully by then you know, situation would have changed and we would be able to bring in and invite everyone to come- And you know clean the park and also to launch new paths for the next season.
Let me get together and moving on this, and let's really work on this Since this was technically questions that people had raised their hands with, regards to kind of a broader scope of parks, I think we can continue.
You know there are lots of water spots where there's small little areas where people can do chin- ups or whatever they want to do.
And, it would, you know, be a great location for people to use that kind of exercise, equipment and would certainly be able to help coordinate.
What I wanted to ask you is everyone is complaining about the conditions that you heard just a while ago and John Jay with the dog feces and with all the money and the wonderful things that were done for the other parts of the children's unit and the basketball courts.
Do not hold me to that number, but that's roughly what it is, but so that and other people who we usually have available have not been reporting in as much as we would like, and there are some real, legitimate concerns of people who have health conditions, who you know, have difficulty coming in and need to stay home, it's very important that they take care of themselves.
And I've asked them to look at locations where we are having problems because of use primarily for litter, where we found this to be true at Carl, Schurz, Park and other parks throughout the borough, where people go out because they're going nuts inside and that makes sense, they want to get out.
I, just I want to talk about the funding and parks and the frustration that every Community Board has acrosss New York City When we gather funding for jobs in parks, especially, we do not really see by the time to get design.
Cuomo announced that New York City now on parks projects up at 1.5 can do design- build Because, like a dog one or tree planting, I.
Is moving first We really could not do anything without the collective support of the community and the Upper East Side to help with Rupert Bart I know the parks such as beginning to open up and in this current Covid-19 environment, I'm.
You know we currently have planned our fall planting for Rupert Park, which is the big planting in the fall that we do I'm just wondering as far as going to provide all the necessary PPE, Etc to make it a safe event for us to invite volunteers and participants to come and work in and city parks.
If you want to go ahead with a resolution that can't hurt- And, it's always good to hear from the community boards about what they think is important.
I have another call where we can maybe all come up with ideas and discuss how we can play a role, so You know the borough president and the council, member She they can play such a role and maybe allocate some money at the Rupert Park events.
And I think that somewhere, where Commissioner Castro can mention that over how many years does this kind of money need to be collected or like would be needed and again then, maybe having all of us on a call where we have kind of part of it in detail which parts of the quadrant how they can be worked and with various ideas.
The time is really hard right, now, but some of them the buildings around there whose residents use the park, maybe there's something possible there, but I was just thinking.
I know that there's nothing quite like it really close by and near it, and a lot of people use it, who can't get to Carl shirts and with their dogs, or just to go and sit in, So there are a lot of stakeholders just outside points of view and getting all those stakeholders at the table and making sure you have the right.
Is it possible for community board to maybe send a small form to all the neighbors, and then they fill it up and say what would they like to see in Ruppert, Park,, Think that would also engage people because it would, they would feel hey, we.
They do not want a dog, Iran and obviously Commissioner Castro can mention the technical aspects and play a big role here that whether it should even make sense to us, But I just feel like, if weakens us, since this is something a part, is something that belongs to the to the local community, to the people.
I mean we go through the community board to get their recommendation whenever people want to put in a dog run, and it works very well.
If I'm wrong, the Parks Department has meetings with the community one two, three four, So I- think a small committee, maybe to put some ideas.
There I think it's a community board chairs, The, Parks chairs or the committee can put a letter together and write to all of our electives asking them to support this project, and please give funds They do not come to the Community, Board and they're designated for Rupert, Park, and I.
What the broader community wants to see for this for this space in the future before I start to because I guess I just do not see how I'm can justify saying, give me a million dollars without a more concrete proposal in place of what I know that I should go.
I think that I can't do it without the broader community's input in this, and so I would like to suggest that we use August and September to solicit people.
And I'm, sorry to keep bringing this up the dogs, and if it's not part of you need to have the parameters, as Rita pointed out of what is impossible or what's not ideal, because if people are all talking about how it should be 90% a dog park and that can't be done, then you have to be able to deal with it.
There is a Parks committee in each of the community boards in the city.
We can create that before the before August recess, Barry and I will work together on creating a survey and that will go out to the broad community asking for their thoughts on River Park and their and what they think a large redesign would look like and what it should have and what who it and how it can meet the needs of the most stakeholders will share those will and then in September we will hold both a subcommittee meeting and a Parks committee meeting to have a subcommittee work on looking at those pictures that Rita have said and looking at these designs and looking at the feedback that came in And, then we'll address it at our September meeting as well.
You I love your idea for what to do in August and September of the only thing I again would reiterate: We've had so many conversations with New York City Parks, where they've talked about the almost impossibility of having a dog run.
And I'm going to read this because that's the way it's written, Elizabeth Ashby community board member had brought up two items regarding Central Park traffic signals not being a DA accessible meaning when people new wheelchairs came up to try to push the button on the light to change the signal from goddess to stop.
I would like to bring to your attention that was mentioned earlier, that some 500 people have signed petitions to have the pool at John, Jay Park, open, I'd like to suggest.
If you want to just mention on that in that as well, because they are also at a stakeholder right like they are also involved, then that would be another way of reaching more people in the neighbourhood.
People told us you should you should call on the parks Department to open up the playgrounds, and we said that when it comes to a matter of public health that we that we had to trust the people who were in charge and making those decisions, because we do not feel equipped to do so.
