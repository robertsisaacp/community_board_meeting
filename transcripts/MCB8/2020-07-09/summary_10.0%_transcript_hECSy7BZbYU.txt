We have a easy, it's simple agenda, but it's very packed with stuff, and we knew we appreciate your joining us by a zoom First item the discussion of the Rupert Park, the current state and look into the future, we're going to limit that discussion of 45 minutes and we'll be joined if we have not already been joined by the Manhattan borough, Council member, just to give you a little bit of backstory, which I think you already know, but of course we were all very concerned about open space We, particularly we're talking about rupert parts for and the future of this park funding We need to do in terms of advocacy on our end to ensure that there's money in the budget to go to a redesign of rupert and over and over again, we kind of just said.
I also want to acknowledge that I see Rita hopper on this committee, Rita I was known as a troublemaker on community board aid until Rita, joint and and so we work together to make sure that ninety first was designated a place treat by the Department of Transportation, and she is pretty much her and David Rosenstein who I missed terribly Many of you do work together with Lisa La Jolla to make that place, treat and so Rupert has been a park that has needed a lot of work.
I've been cooking dinner, so I'm going to step out for one second The, chairman of community board, a talita cab has joined us salute leader Thank you and thank you to the co-chairs of the parks committee, and so some of the money that we still have is We have John Jay Park a senior space that this committee did a lot of the public hearings on that we need to move forward with and so for.
Since more and more people are using it since there's such a dearth of public state in the area and the waterfront of so beautiful here, you're talking about exercise equipment in John, Jay and one of our next project, because we've got a lot of requests for it to put exercise equipment in some form on some part of the Esplanade Now that people will be exercising outdoors because I know: there's Jennifer farther salad, I'm, not including East River Park, because that's a whole different ballgame, but on the Esplanade between Montgomery, Street and Brooklyn Bridge, and that's particular section of exercise equipment.
The limits of technology becoming amazingly started in mark did a fine job, so I don't need to elaborate, but I just wanted to My staff has probably let the parks department know about it, as well as the appropriate agencies in terms of the vandalism will work the Department of Sanitation to try to clean that up So. One of the reasons that it's important to have, conservancies or friends of or neighbors groups is so that there is somebody paying attention to that.
and I'm just very disappointed in this year's budget, and we have another question from another member of the public, so I just want to get them first, Thank you for making this time for Rupert Park in particular, so glad that you brought every all the players in question in one forum, so hi Ben, hi, Commissioner, Castro, wonderful to hear from you after some time A volunteer group that you know serves as stewards of the park and they're very grateful for this collective support.
It really is not the best ground to put a park in of this kind because of the slow causes, erosion as I'm sure most people know, but I think that's the initial thing that we should do the September's doing a major planting throughout the park and I'll work with the councilmen, as we have in the past, to see how we can do any capital renovations.
If we want to see some of the big changes, I think parts for the kinds of changes for small changes, we're talking, hundreds of thousands to millions for the big kinds of changes that I think the park actually needs in terms of a major overhaul where I believe parks is saying six to eight million That is so that doesn't happen without money from the borough president and even perhaps the mayor's office, and there may be a million if I can Should we be starting to gather petition Starting now to be writing letters to the mayor's office What can we be doing to really start advocating hard for those larger funds that, if I may jump in here, that's the point?
We got money from the from the borough president from the seven state assemblyman from the state, senator carolyn, Maloney We Bailey, a federal funding in that Park I, don't know that federal funding be appropriate for the part we're talking about Rubert Park now, because that was multimodal money In any event, the point is we have to organize ourselves and get moving toward a concentrated effort to raise the six to eight million dollars from the various stakeholders who we can call upon to fund this The way we did and who has well Green, ten or twelve years ago and the money but bothered when the money doesn't come to the Community Board we decide.
The money went to the parks department through a conduit, and it worked perfectly well and I think that the community board can start the campaign now I Don't necessarily think you need petition so much as resolutions is bringing other elected officials to this floor and be It is across the street from Rebecca C Wright's office.
The East River Esplanade parking who, as we agreed, was on the highway It was technically multimodal money and actually I was working for something being when he allocated $300,000 they had to has concrete park, pays to a It fondly so I think that if the assembly members each did half a million I could probably do another million, and if the borough president kicked in a million now we're talking about three or four million dollars.
It's been mentioned as an issue in Rupert part, but it's also concerned to many parents in John, Jay Park, there's a cabal of dog walkers who like to bring their dogs into the kitty playground and also on the ball court area, which some years ago recently was renovated.
Good mark has heard about the signs and, regarding the swimming pool, we're going to be deciding we're gonna pick that up under new business, hopefully, like my October, is our next event on the calendar and hopefully by then you know, situation would have changed and we would be able to bring in and invite everyone to come, and you know clean the park and also to launch new paths for the next season.
You know there are lots of water spots where there's small little areas where people can do chin-ups or whatever they want to do pull-ups, and it would, you know, be a great location for people to use that kind of exercise, equipment and would certainly be able to help, coordinate I think it sounds wonderful and what I think draw more people, so the Esplanade I was wondering if Commissioner Castro could or mark could speak about the possibility.
and I've asked them to look at locations where we are having problems because of use primarily for litter, where we found this to be true at Carl, Schurz, Park and other parks throughout the borough, where people go out because they're going nuts inside and that makes sense it's very important for their mental health and physical health Is it's started to have an impact on your local parks, whether it's grass areas have become worn as a result of this other things that you're seeing people using them in ways that they and been, as one gentleman said earlier this evening, or it's been an increase in some of the uses.
In my own, There was for the past three or four years there were exercise classes done regularly at the park paid for by been in East 79th Street Neighborhood Association because of people at that time preferred to have the ability to stop and rest a minute, and that was very successful The name of it, but that was causing problems, and so the manufacturer had it removed, have you removed, but we should get the money back, for that was one of the things I did want to mention, but the other issue had been voted.
I just I want to talk about the funding and parks and the frustration that every Community Board has across New York City is when we gather funding for jobs in parks , especially we don't really see by the time to get design chairman.
The design-build Cuomo announced that New York City now on parks projects up at 1.5 can do design-build, but I know that design-build takes a shorter time and I'd like to see with some of the smaller projects, because, like a dog one or tree planting, I, think there's six or seven people on this phone call I can design and build that It's, not that hard of a reach.
So right now we took a big cut with the Ranger program or not park enforcement You want to go ahead with a resolution that can't hurt- and it's always good to hear from the community boards about what they think is important- I think we should make a pretty resolution on the floor or urging the council to provide additional budgeting for the top offers at this time.
I'm, a neighbor, my name We can also have you know like a pool that can be created for rupert part where people chip in and give some resources as well, so that we do have the financial resources and I think that somewhere, where commissioner castro can mention that over how many years does this kind of money need to be collected or like would be needed?
If it's worth talking to someone from the school from the urban planning school, an outside point of view, who can who can look and maybe have some ideas that they'd be willing to share about how to get community buy-in to the idea of what ultimately is done with the dogs about the dogs, because that is so central to all of this, it just seems like and then for the funding and I do first Street I , don't know no gone, because maybe there's some not a private public partnership, but maybe there's some fundraising that could be done with local The time is really hard right now, but some of them the buildings around there whose residents use the park, maybe there's something possible there, but I was just thinking it's it.
I mean we go through the community board to get their recommendation whenever people want to put in a dog run, and it works very well so I like to hear from the community board first as to whether they thinking it makes sense or not.
If I'm wrong, the parks department has meetings with the community one two three four, whatever is needed in the planning stages, So I, think a small committee, maybe to put some ideas together, is good, but I think we should let the parks department do their job What we can be doing now is asking our elected officials for money, because Steve Simon gave us a price for between six and eight million dollars to redo this park.
So, no matter what the design is, we kind of have a price range for what we have to start range raising So, while a small group may be talking about what they desire to see there I think it's a community board chairs the parks chairs or the committee can put a letter together and write to all of our electives asking them to support this project and please give funds They do not come to the Community, Board and they're designated for rupert park and I.
We can create that before the before August recess, Barry and I will work together on creating a survey and that will go out to the broad community asking for their thoughts on River Park and their and what they think a large redesign would look like and what it should have and what who it and how it can meet the needs of the most stakeholders will share those will and then in September we will hold both a subcommittee meeting and a parks committee meeting to have a subcommittee work on looking at those pictures that Rita have said and looking at these designs and looking at the feedback that came in Very good move the agenda, if I find they interrupt and Ryland discussed the rules in Central Park, which is on the agenda, which I don't even want tell it means Even, though I am co-chair of this committee Have you any updates for us on the status of proximate community district 8, as you all are pretty much aware, we're opening everything we can at this stage of the game.
You know that section so and that section wasn't actually funded in the next round of funding that we have We have to just talk about Central Park for a second, because I think Elizabeth Ashby was waiting to hear about Central Park, yes right, but I just wanted to say that this is extremely frustrating, because I sat in person listening to parks, talk about which was what was funded not six months ago and I said that it was bad that we didn't fund 76 to 78 Street I told our the committee and the full board meeting we need to advocate, for this is not good, that this isn't funded.
