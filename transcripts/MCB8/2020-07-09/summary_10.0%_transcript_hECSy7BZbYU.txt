My name is Barry Schneider co-chair of the parks committee of Community Board, a this is a July meeting.
Council member, just to give you a little bit of backstory, which I think you already know, but of course we were all very concerned about open space, we're so proud that you have helped champion this issue during your tenure.
You were still present to the Knickerbocker ta tenants, association, yes, and so we work together to make sure that ninety first was designated a place treat by the Department of Transportation, and she is pretty much her and David Rosenstein who I missed terribly Many of you, Do work together with Lisa La Jolla to make that place, treat and so Rupert has been a park that has needed a lot of work.
We have John Jay Park, where we've been able to secure funding with the parks and where we've opened completely new basketball courts, working with Greg Davis and the kids there, and then we also recently.
We just reopened a new ad, a ramp at if I believe, 82nd Street I mentioned the Carl Schurz playground and then from 99th 90th Street to 88th Street, one of the first money I ever secured 35 million dollars in my first three months in office went to that and that is actually already open.
We have John Jay Park a senior space that this committee did a lot of the public hearings on that we need to move forward with, and so for.
And I think the board had been opposed to taking down the fences and the gates, because there are already there may already be an individual who sleeps in the park at night, and we didn't want to make it easier for people to just come.
We want more seating areas throughout and do we want to set up instead of having the hill as it were, having a lower level and an upper level with the youth programming up top and the passive space down below , They bring up hundreds of people to try to improve the park.
So anything in construction is continuing, so Carl Schurz park playground is continuing, but the John Jay, Park seating area and even the East River Esplanade project that I funded with the mayor have been a contractor, is close to being selected they're ready to do the contract award, but the city has placed a hold on any of these new construction.
See mark sicarios on the pole and we brought them up with Wesley, but there is a lot of vandalism and the southern part of more attention to that area, since more and more people are using it Since there's such a dearth of public state in the area and the waterfront of so beautiful here, You're talking about exercise equipment in John, Jay and one of our next project, because we've got a lot of requests for it to put exercise equipment in some form on some part of the Esplanade.
Now that people will be exercising outdoors because I know, there's Jennifer Yes, their exercise equipment farther salad, I'm, not including East River Park, because that's a whole different ballgame, but on the Esplanade between Montgomery, Street and Brooklyn Bridge.
Let me know that the parks department, you know, will work with sanitation and others, Something that you may have heard about in the city and that I tweeted about today is that one of the reasons I voted no is because they've been cutting random things that we didn't want them to cut.
It really is not the best ground to put a park in of this kind because of the slow, causes, erosion as I'm sure most people know, but I think that's the initial thing that we should do The September's doing a major planting throughout the park.
The community board got together and formed a 197, a plan which told the city how one wanted to use the various areas.
Let me get together and moving on this, and let's really work on this Since this was technically questions that people had raised their hands with, regards to kind of a broader scope of parks, I think we can continue.
You know there are lots of water spots where there's small little areas where people can do chin-ups or whatever they want to do pull-ups, and it would.
What I wanted to ask you is everyone is complaining about the conditions that you heard just a while ago and John Jay with the dog feces and with all the money and the wonderful things that were done for the other parts of the children's unit and the basketball courts.
Don't hold me to that number, but that's roughly what it is, but so that and other people who we usually have available have not been reporting in as much as we would like, and there are some real, legitimate concerns of people who have health conditions, who you know, have difficulty coming in and need to stay home, it's very important that they take care of themselves.
And I've asked them to look at locations where we are having problems because of use primarily for litter, where we found this to be true at Carl, Schurz, Park and other parks throughout the borough, where people go out because they're going nuts inside and that makes sense, they want to get out.
We use that it's senior equipment I want to just thank Mubeen and all the Muslim women of New York Do, an incredible job at Ruben, Park, I We only met outside and my daughter-in-law, who is not afraid of anything decided to walk the dog in the area where it's a dog area.
I, don't know why we stood for it so long, but ed Lerner saved the day and the pooper-scooper law came into effect, And, it's still in effect, as is the park rules and regulations, They all seem to do a pretty good job of it, And. Then we empty the cans, but we can't as park workers to go in and clean up other people's dogs do, and the fact that this is happening is terrible.
I'm glad that we have the money and the inclination, and also to moving in her Muslim group that looks after I'm, sorry, I'm, so bad at names that looks after the park and takes care of it because I know what he's talking.
I, just I, want to talk about the funding and parks and the frustration that every Community Board has across New York City When we gather funding for jobs in parks, especially, we don't really see by the time to get design chairman.
And I'd like to see with some of the smaller projects, because, like a dog one or tree planting, I, think there's six or seven people on this phone call I can design and build that.
You know we currently have planned our fall planting for Rupert Park, which is the big planting in the fall that we do I'm just wondering as far as going to provide all the necessary PPE, Etc to make it a safe event for us to invite volunteers and participants to come and work.
You want to go ahead with a resolution that can't hurt- It's always good to hear from the community boards about what they think is important- I think we should make a pretty resolution on the floor or urging the council to provide additional budgeting for the top offers at this time.
You know the borough president and the council, member She, like you know they can play such a role and maybe allocate some money at the Rupert Park events.
And I think that, somewhere, where commissioner castro can mention that over how many years does this kind of money need to be collected or like would be needed and again then, maybe having all of us on a call where we have kind of part of it in detail which parts of the quadrant how they can be worked and with various ideas.
And I'd like to suggest that we get names of those folks who think they shouldn't be a part of this group within the parks committee, and we will put our heads together.
The time is really hard right, now, but some of them the buildings around there whose residents use the park, maybe there's something possible there, but I was just thinking.
I know that there's nothing quite like it really close by and near it, and a lot of people use it, who can't get to Carl shirts and with their dogs, or just to go and sit in, So there are a lot of stakeholders just outside points of view and getting all those stakeholders at the table and making sure you have the right representatives.
Is it possible for community board to maybe send a small form to all the neighbors, and then they fill it up and say what would they like to see in Ruppert, Park, I?
I mean we go through the community board to get their recommendation whenever people want to put in a dog run, and it works very well.
So I like to hear from the community board first as to whether they thinking it makes sense or not.
If I'm wrong, the parks department has meetings with the community one two, three, four, whatever is needed in the planning stages, So I think a small committee, maybe to put some ideas.
There I think it's a community board chairs, The parks, chairs or the committee can put a letter together and write to all of our electives asking them to support this project, and please give funds They do not come to the Community, Board and they're designated for rupert, park, and I.
What the broader community wants to see for this for this space in the future before I start to because I guess I, just don't see how I'm can justify saying, give me a million dollars without a more concrete proposal in place of what I know that I should go to.
I think that I can't do it without the broader community's input in this, and so I would like to suggest that we use August and September to solicit people.
And, I'm, sorry to keep bringing this up the dogs, and if it's not part of you need to have the parameters, as Rita pointed out of what is impossible or what's not ideal, because if people are all talking about how it should be 90% a dog park and that can't be done, then you have to be able to deal with it.
There is a parks committee in each of the community boards in the city.
We can create that before the before August recess, Barry and I will work together on creating a survey and that will go out to the broad community asking for their thoughts on River Park and their and what they think a large redesign would look like and what it should have and what who it and how it can meet the needs of the most stakeholders will share those will and then in September we will hold both a subcommittee meeting and a parks committee meeting to have a subcommittee work on looking at those pictures that Rita have said and looking at these designs and looking at the feedback that came in Very good move the agenda, if I find they interrupt.
And I'm going to read this because that's the way it's written, Elizabeth Ashby community board member had brought up two items regarding Central Park traffic signals not being a DA accessible meaning when people new wheelchairs came up to try to push the button on the light to change the signal from goddess to stop.
Other item I would like to bring to your attention that was mentioned earlier, that some 500 people have signed petitions to have the pool at John, Jay Park, open, I'd like to suggest.
If you want to just mention on that in that as well, because they are also at a stakeholder right like they are also involved, then that would be another way of reaching more people in the neighbourhood.
I think that Rupert Park and The Esplanade, and the fact that the Esplanade connects three or three or more different communities with very different populations of people that you that use it Maybe we can talk about this a little deeper in September and the fall.
