So, oh, let's see foreign this! Thank you! So, okay! So it's 6:31! You want to wait a few more minutes, or should we get started Anthony like another minute or two yeah, maybe just another minute or two: that's: okay, there's still a few folks who are signing in through the forum so great you so I think you guys are good to get started. Okay, do you want me to give my little spiel about the muting and unmuting yeah raise hands yeah, so for anybody? If it's your first time at one of our community board aid virtual meetings, virtual committee meetings, you'll notice, that you're muted and that you're not able to unmute yourself the way that you will whenever we open for questions and comments, the way that you'll engage with our co-chairs tonight is through the use of the raise hand, button that you can find in the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. So right now, if you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll see a little button that says: participants has the number 33 next to it. You'll click that button a box will open up with everybody's names in it and at the bottom of that box, you'll see a little icon of a hand and it says raise hand. You click that button. We see your name pop up on that list and we'll call on you whenever the time comes and if you're on the phone, it's star, nine to raise your hand and star six to unmute. Whenever we get to that point, and if you have any questions about the software, you can always chat through the chat. But that's all it is for is tech, support all right, Sandra and Andrea go ahead. Okay, well, greetings all and welcome to community board. Eight very first Social Justice Committee I am Sandra I Coleman, one of the co-chairs of this committee and I would like before we continue for the our other co-chair to at least introduce himself before we get started on the agenda. Oh okay, Anthony, Cohn and I'd like to welcome you all. This is a good turnout, especially for a new, first-time run-through of a new committee, and it the committee's genesis, I think had its the committee had its start or its genesis in a virtual meeting. It must have been in July and it has taken us a while to get ourselves organized and find dates, and here we are and I think Sandra is going to start with the our first agenda item and, as a new committee I think we have a lot of kind of organizing to do especially tonight. Yes, so once again, thank you all for joining this very first meeting. The first topic on the agenda is defined in social justice and listing some examples so defining social justice. Some may think the definition of social justice is simple, but it has many parts. It is a broad topic for advocacy. I will provide you with a very simple definition of it, as well as share with you some examples of social justice which may help spark insight and see that what we can work on at a broader you know, spectrum of it. So social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities. Social justice is about fairness between individuals and our society, so that is a very limited, but not a full, because it's like I said social justice is so broad, there's so much work to do when it comes to Social justice, it's under just so much in these United States, as well as for our community board. So examples can include, but not limited to voting rights, climate change, health care, homelessness and housing, crisis, racial injustice, income gap, hunger and food insecurities. Those are just a few that I listed, but, as I said, it's never ending what we see as a society that is unfair and unjust, and we want to tackle it. That's when social justice is birthed, so it's like I, said it's never ending until we have equality throughout this, not just this community board area, but in this state and in this country and hopefully in the world. We have a brief film that we would like to share with you. It does not highlight all forms of social justice, but I believe that this selected six minutes minute footage will actually be a segue and to sparking some thoughts, as well as understanding to the importance of this committee. In such a time like this, with so many disparities plaguing our local community and beyond, will can you share the footage we sent you? Thank you one second and we'll get it. Thank you. I remember the day when the March on Washington was all over, we went back down to the White House President Kennedy invited us back down and he stood in the door of the oval office and greeted each one of us. He was like a proud, beaming father that everything had gone so well for months. After that, we just all really harvested the emotional joy of what we had done. The joy that we took home with us out of that arena inspired us to start thinking about what could we do beyond what we were doing already and the lesson is not to stop not to give up. If you asked us back, then that Barack Obama would be in the White House today, we would say no way when people left as Dr King suggested. We went back home back to the heart of the deep south to intensify efforts to gain the vote to get a civil rights bill passed, but 18 days after the March, it was the turbo bombing the church in Birmingham, but full of girls were killed on a Sunday morning. It was a sad and dark hour for the movement, but it said to us that we had more work to do it's hard to say, but it encouraged us more. These people are reacting this way against us because we're being effective and so we're going to keep on doing it, we're going to do even more. If we can, we won't let this stop us. We won't let this turn us around. We did get the civil rights bill. Eventually we did get a vote and right side, but the quality of life for many people remained the same for many years. One of the ways to really stop a movement is to kill off its thinkers and they killed Dr King and they killed Medgar Evers and they killed Bobby, Kennedy and John Kennedy. All this was in one fell swoop, eliminated after the civil rights movement, which moved into the anti-war movement. Other movements were gaining enormous energy, so the women's movement, the environmental movement, took shape the anti-apartheid movement and the will and the belief that they could be successful emanated from the remarkable ability of the civil rights movement to progress. I recognize very quickly that the young people and other people who were in the Occupy Wall Street movement. They were the Stepchildren of Martin Luther, King Jr. They were the stepchildren of the March on Washington. They were trying to raise the consciousness of the country to the inequitable distribution of wealth opportunities very much in the same way that he was trying to do it. We need people to lead to get up front on some of the big issues and to be a headlight in order to align and people. Speaking of today for immigration, reform for gay rights, control of the proliferation of guns that are showing some clearance, the action of the Supreme Court five in gutting, the essence of the voting Rights act, it's an enormous reversal. It's been one of the most successful pieces of legislation in modern history. Enormous change takes time and you have to continue to battle. You don't win a lawsuit or win getting a law on the books and then fold your tents and go home. Oh no, you know the struggle continues. I was part of this mobilization that has never been duplicated again and I. Wonder why I'm not blaming young people? Well, yes, I am, but they ought to be doing a bit more I really thought that feeling around Obama was so important to know that it existed I in retrospect, wish that we'd managed to keep him up from running for office because he could have run a movement I think he would have had a better chance at making social change happen. If he had approached it- and you know the way, king did what I say to a lot of young people who speak about the fact that the civil rights movement is somehow a thing of the past I said, let me paint a picture for you. Almost all the movement in that period, almost all critical thought. Almost all critical decisions were made by the young, and if you want to take a look at John Lewis and where he was 18, you take a look at Julian bond. He was 18. If you take a look at Diane Nash, she was pregnant and then leading a movement. She was the one that designed the freedom rides and none of these people came with political design and with clear thought. No. These were simple ordinary folk. When young people said where do we find our leaders? Where are the Dr kings? Well, look where Dr King resided and where he was found in the first instance, and maybe you'll find that there's some more Dr King's there I credit the fact that I got schooled I got brought up in the movement in the civil rights movement. To give me the perspective that March laid the basis for the modern battles for human rights all across the globe, it can not be underestimated. The fact that individual ordinary people from across America made up their minds. They were going to step into that movement and step into the streets and come to Washington to raise their grievances in the finest traditions of american democracy. Thank you will for sharing that it is I hope that actual footage would impact your thinking about social justice and hopefully help you decide that maybe this is some work you would like to do in this committee and beyond, is so needed. So that was a video we selected. We collectively agreed to use it for today, and it touched me when I first viewed it and came across it so and I hope you all felt something sparked in you for that. We would like to pause now. Does anybody have any questions or comments before we move to the next piece on our agenda? So I see one hand has come up mark. Welcome. Mark you'll have to push a little button at the bottom of your screen to confirm unmuting hi. Can you hear me yes, hi yeah? No, thank you to the co-chairs for organizing I was wondering you mentioned. The genesis. I was wondering if you could speak to that a little bit. Where did the idea to form the committee come from? Was it a specific event? Was it a discussion? I think a few words would be great. If you could thank you, I'm trying to remember in July we were actually you Alita I hate, to call on you. But do you remember exactly how this started out, because I know it was at I think our regular board meeting in July or it might have been yeah? Was it regular? No okay, I could, if you want I, can speak to the gym, yeah. Okay, all right so in June I believe it was Billy and I reached out to try to get a committee or task force formed and it just didn't take place, and then in July we had a big meeting and we had the conversation and people actually agreed. I was I spoke about it that basically, this type of committee and this type of work can not be done effectively in other committees. It needs its own committee to actually do the work and take on some of these issues, whatever we decide collectively as a board to do, instead of you know putting it onto other committee, so then in July it was agreed by our chair, Elita Camp, to form a committee and it didn't jump off. Yet it didn't happen, but we're here now, but that's the basis, was Billy Freeland and myself, so I have to call you out Billy. If that's okay, we actually were trying to form something in June before it even came out bro. So that is the actual genesis the birth of it. Yeah can I. Add to that yes sure. So there was obviously the black lives matter, movement and a sense that things needed to change. I had wanted to do something like start with an implicit bias, training to bring the board to a way of thinking about things and more knowledge about ourselves and the community, and it was a land use meeting that was originally going to be the basis of a conversation with people in the community, and we were just going to listen so that the community board would begin to understand what other people were thinking where we could begin to see, and we weren't going to be responding just really in my vision, really just listening and then it evolved where we didn't have so many people from the community coming. But there were an awful lot of people on the board who had wanted to establish a committee and from there everything that Sandra said is right, but the time came where and we do so much work in so many different areas that trying to create a more just, a more equitable environment in society, seem to be a necessary time. So thank you for allowing me to speak now. Thank you, looks like no more hands. I can't see, but I don't think so. Not at this time, no right: okay, oh actually, yeah, Rebecca, Dangor, okay, I just wanted to say that I'm happy it's a committee and not a task force, which is something we also discussed at the full board. So I and I. Think part of the decision about that was that tasks task forces generally have a kind of are intended to have a limited scope in terms of how long they run. Second Avenue Subway Task force separate from the transportation committee, but obviously, once the subway opened it was less critical to continue to have task force meetings. I think the same thing with the task force on the charter reform. It was the same kind of issue and obviously, once the charter was after the election passed, there was no longer a need for the charter reform task force, but I think something like the Social Justice Committee is ongoing and in fact the work of the committee will probably never be done and is that are we good yeah? Okay, so yeah go ahead? Yeah, let me just add to too it was originally racial. A racial Justice committee and the reason is social justice is because we didn't want to be limited in the work we did and, as you know, as racial justice, you could only deal with a small component of social justice. But if you open it up to social justice, it's not that limited at all. So I just wanted to add that piece in as well: okay, go ahead, Anthony and so oh, it appears. Cos has his hand up. Okay, oh yeah, with the Social Justice Committee. Will you be doing anything? Or will this be a separate committee concerning the police reform that the governor has asked for early next year? We will actually be dealing with you all who's going to be a part of this committee to see what areas and we have that on agenda potential areas of focus, which would be three so where we can start it, at least for now, a few we want to try to pick up, but I don't want to go ahead of myself, but I can't say yes or no, but that's open for discussion on some of the topics that or issues we will take on. Okay, sorry, I jumped again. No, it's okay, I! Think that part of the work of this committee is helping work with other committees that are nominally involved, in particular issues like the housing committee, just picking an example, and so it's not necessarily divorced from other committees or having just its own programs and meetings. It's really trying to help focus what we do on issues of social justice, which is not to say that we're not doing that now. But the idea is to try and if there's a group dedicated to it and we're jumping up and down and waving our arms I, think that helps or potentially helps all of the work that we do in the community board and outside of it and one of the things which is the second item. If it's okay for me to jump ahead on the agenda has to do with a statement of purpose and I. Think that this comes out of my belief. Maybe I'm I hope I'm not the only one that there are two general types of committees within this community board, and there are oversight, committees and the oversight. Committees have a very specific role in a very specific relationship to, in fact, specific city agencies like landmarks or zoning and development or street life, for that Matter, Street, Fairs transportation parks, and then there are other committees that are more general and almost informative in their and in some ways, participatory in their makeup and I. Think this is one of those committees. It's not an oversight committee, we're not charged with making sure the landmarks laws is followed or that the zoning is. The zoning of a particular project is what it should be, and so, as a consequence, I think that this kind of committee really needs a statement of purpose and because of that, those of you who are here tonight and those who couldn't make it and wanted to it would be great if we started to get a sense from you of what the purpose of this committee is. What do you either as members of the borders? Members of the public, see as the purpose of this committee in the broader context of the community board and of the community as a whole, should have made rising voice to make that more of a question. So anyway, I'd like to go ahead and open that to hands up if people are- and this is not like we're- gonna write something and that's it. It's just it's an ongoing process, but I think we need a good place to start to think about. Why we're here, aside from believing in social justice, I hope so Lynn has her hand up if you want to start with Lynn and then Rita has her hand up after that. Okay, so I was involved earlier this year with helping to facilitate a black lives matter. War March on Roosevelt, Island and I am proud to say it was one of the better attended events that we've had in the community in a long time and I was very proud of my community for wanting to listen and wanting to be open, and it was organized by some 20-something community activists, which was another piece that I thought was so valuable about that programming. But what I would like to talk about us doing is addressing some of the things that I've just recently been learning more about and that's institutional racism and controls that were premeditatedly put into place and I've been personally horrified. The more I hear and read about it and I know. Billy and I have had some opportunities to be learning some great things this year recently and we there's a book called the new Jim crow that really talks about some of those issues and how they have impacted our society and our framework, and the other thing that I didn't realize was an outcome of some of the laws that engendered unfair rules against people of color was how it impacted their voting rights and that's something that I think that we need to address and maybe put on the table as far as the importance of making sure that people have a voice in our society. And then the last thing that I'd like to do is I posted, something in the chat to will that I'm hoping that he can send to everyone and what it is. Harvard has set up some racial, biased tests that you can take that help. You get an understanding of how biased are you and I think that that's something that I challenge each and every person here today to take a look at and get a sense of where they are and I know I've taken the test and I strongly encourage other people to get an idea of how much they're aware of and how much they're, not aware of, and so I'm hoping that you'll all agree to. At least let will post that to everyone so that if they'd like to take a look at it, they can give it a shot. But those are my comments. Thank you for your time. Thank you. It's in the chat for everybody to check out. Thank you. Next is Rita and then Patrick Boblin I think could mispronounce his name the other day. Sorry about that I want to thank you for forming this committee. The importance of it is infinitesimal. What happens is that the iron gets hot and we March and then we disappear, and hopefully that this committee will keep black lives ladder matter alive and prejudice is alive and up front we're making strides slowly but surely I mean we don't have a woman in the press in running for president, but we almost were getting closer, so I, just it's important that we keep our eyes focused and not relent one bit and I. Thank you for starting this committee. This is really excellent. Thank you, oops Rebecca, now no Patrick was an excellent Patrick. I'm sorry hi everybody I have my video off, because my signal is terrible today, but I really do appreciate that everyone has put the work into this and you know I know Sandra very well and I'm very happy to see her at the front of this and Anthony Great to meet you for the first time. Maybe but I shared with will a document from a group called bed Stuy strong, they wrote really beautiful, guiding principles and one of the things that you know I think is challenging in writing. Principles like this is to make sure that what you write is has some accountability and some actions and consequences for you know internally for those principles, because it's really important that we all you know what's going on. But how do we express logistically and concretely, you know what the issues are and hold ourselves accountable. How can we look back on this in two years when the chairs have changed hands and know that despite the people at the top being different, maybe like the movement will continue? That's the I think the overall problem with movement, work and I was also you know, going to say that you know I happen to also be working with. You know, starting up a mutual aid group with some people in the neighborhood and I find that to be a very good way to have a one-to-one relationship with your social justice and your actions, so I think things like that could be, you know, could be something as part of you know, social justice, whether or not you support whether or not you know the community board supports a given effort to support neighbors. You know, especially during Covid-19 or other times of crisis. Thank you, Rebecca hi again, so in terms of a statement of purpose, I would like it to include both external and internal elements. So, for example, you know two parts of social justice are access and participation. How do we increase diverse participation in our meetings when we meet again in person? Does that mean maybe trying to find multiple locations that might increase certain participation for full board meetings? So I'd like there to be an internal element to the statement of purpose as well and then zoom with the digital divide, but that's kind of more I. Think in the part three so I don't want to jump ahead. I think that's a very I think that's actually a very good point. Thank you and very useful. Ah, what do we have with Billy hello? It's great to see this committee getting off the ground? Thank you Sandrea and Anthony and Elita for pushing this. You know I think I'm sure we'll have a lot of discussions about what our purpose should be and I'm really excited to hear what everyone thinks. I just want to offer my two cents, which I offer with some kind of reservation, just because I don't know that this should be the purpose, but here's what I was thinking which is you know ours and apologies for the sirens. In the background, if you can hear that, but ours is a neighborhood with some very you know significant inequities. We have a lot of segregation. We have a lot of wealth disparities. We have injustices on racial gender, religious lines, I mean just I- think, for example, about some of the anti-semitic hate crimes we've seen in the neighborhood, but also some of the hate crimes and hate directed toward the vigil at Carl Sher's park, which has been such a I think integral part of our community, and so one thing I'd like to see this committee endeavor to do is to take stock of those inequities as they exist in our community district and every year we put out a statement of district needs and I. Don't know this is something we should do or must do, but I'm just putting it out there. I'm not trying to create work necessarily, but to do some form of a statement you know of social justice needs or equity needs. That is a vehicle for taking stock of those in equities every year and figuring out. What more can we do? Should we be doing I? Think that's a way to, in a concrete fashion, discuss how far we have to go as a community district and perhaps more largely as a city. So we could you know if people don't like that idea, no problem, but that's a conversation we could have over the coming months and last thing I'll say, is I. Do think we need to start building a foundation of common terms, mutual respect. What exactly is the problem we're trying to identify? So maybe this isn't exactly statement of purpose, but I do think bringing in speakers who can educate us because we all come at this from different. You know experiences. Some of us know very little. Some of us have lived every day of our lives facing injustice, and some are in between so to bring in speakers to help situate us as to what social justice really means and then specifically, what it means within our city, I think, can be very useful. So those are some preliminary thoughts I wanted to suggest to the group. Yes, we will have speakers eventually. Yes, no doubt yes, thanks. Billy I think that I again I think that the statement of district needs is a kind of good taking stock point taking stock of where we are and where we should go and I think, since it is a an annual ongoing document that goes up the chain to the city. So I think that that's I think that's actually a very good idea and we have oops Romney sequel. Oh there, we go yes, so Billy I, I'd like to add on to you with that and I my thoughts, exactly especially with that statement of district needs. I believe that, while our district needs to do an app, an exceptional job of addressing the issues that face our community as a whole, they may fall short of addressing issues as minorities face in our community. Marginalized groups, and just people who are who do face. Social injustice are throughout our community and I. My school has phase my school, which is in city district 2. It has a real district name, but district 2, which does encompass our neighborhood as well, has faced hate issues in the past, and we set up a task force to deal with those issues. And while I'm not saying that this committee should be a task force, I do believe that, as Andy pointed out, Anthony pointed out. I do believe. There are some things that we can learn from the way people respond to hate incidents such as Billy mentioned, setting up groups and safe spaces, as and as well as norms that we can all fall back on. And that also includes norms for our community committee, but also for our community and just a way that we can respond to hate incidents in our community and what resources can our committee bring as a community board committee and as a board as a whole to protect our community, especially in the wake of hate incidents such as the most recent anti-semitic attacks of vandalism in Karlsruhe's park, as well as more specified issues in our community communities such as housing and healthcare disparities, and we so what my school did, which I believed was a very good example of what we should do when something happens in our community and also to be proactive, is to bring in groups such as the defamation league, which did a training with us about how to teach about hate incidents and how to lead small groups. Southern poverty law center is also an amazing resource and just groups that center around hate, but also groups that center around social justice and promoting just promoting a better America. So that's just my two cents there thank you. Rita you're up again I'd like to tag on to Rebecca Dang, more Daniel, suggestion by saying that this is really such a big deal, and that would just as a thought would it be possible to get the borough president to have this light committee in every community board, because there are different things in each community board and the only way we're going to learn of what we don't have is to hear what somebody else has so I just wanted as a thought in the back that this is bigger. I understand tonight is you know, we're just wrapping our. We can't even wrap our arms around it. It's so big, but just something to think about and I again, I think that that's an interesting point I know that at least one of the other community boards. A number of other community boards have similar committees, but we will undoubtedly try and reach out to them, but I think a more an even more general approach might not be a bad idea and I. Think Elita is up next, there's actually I think someone from the public, if you don't mind going to him David Comet Kamenetz, wait thanks. Anthony, no problem, I see him now hi, so I just want to say thank you for making this committee I think that it's really impactful and I just I know it's been touched upon a little bit, but one thing that I want to really emphasize I. Think that, like the a primary purpose of this committee should be like educating the public social injustice is just such a complex issue, and there are so many different ways to tackle it, and what everyone else has said so far is completely valid, and these are things that should be done and like to add on to what everyone has said. I just think that, like all of us here like we're members of our same community, and we have a primary goal just to combat social injustice and I, think that you have to just tackle it by the roots and that, if you like, remove bias and like things like that from people in society and like you need to like educate people in order to like avoid these social injustices from happening in the first place and I. Think that educating people and I think that we definitely have the means to do it and the resources like whether that be through the community board website or just getting more participation. I think that 45 participants is really incredible for the first meeting. I think that there's definitely very like plausible ways to educate the public and teach people like about. What's going on for some people like I'm, not even like fully educated I, try to educate myself but I use the resources that I have available to me. I think that this committee could be a very good resource for the public to become educated, about racial injustice and social injustices of all kinds. Thank you now, there's someone else who is not a community board member and so we'll go to him. First Tido Gonzalez. Oh there you are hi. This is my first community board meeting, and this is really amazing. I want to thank everyone for being for creating this I think that a huge portion of a huge portion of what we should be doing and focusing on would be well trying to improve the material conditions of the most marginalized in our communities and also trying to create more opportunities, whether it be you know, work working with, like the housing community or the Zone Zoning Committee, to try and provide more opportunities for affordable housing. For so other people can come into the community and try to share in with the vast amount of resources that the community can have to spread around. Thank you now, okay, now elite. Thank you. I just want to suggest outreach and trying to be a listening arm, as well as an educating and informative arm to hear what other members of the community have to say about various issues and to try and enlist other members of the diverse community that we have in teaching us what matters and what things look like from other people's perspective. Thank you as always, Peter once you're, unmuted, yeah I, just want to touch on I mean I thought about various pieces of this, and what I have is a kind of a somewhat long list of areas that I think we may want to touch on with the thought that, where we put our focus and energy is going to be a function of kind of the interest in where our natural, personal and group commitment shows up, but it includes health, education, housing, jobs and employment. To me, criminal justice is a huge arena. There's a racial component of all these there's a racial, I'm sorry, religious component of them, in addition, I think of gender equity for both women and Lgbtq I. Think of generational equity. What's fair for young people and what's fair and looking out for seniors and the environmental area just as well, obviously, I have an interest in education, but another area that I've had some exposure to is the criminal justice area where I think there's actually maybe one of the larger areas of injustice and one component of that is offender re-entry so-called. When people are trying to come back to the community and have a life and be supportive and having access to jobs, access to you know, places say access to a network and so on. I think that's I. Think yeah I think that's a very important point. Thank you very much. Peter Craig appears to be next on the list and then Laurie Good evening. Everyone and thank you very much to everyone. Who's been involved in this effort and bringing this group together. I think this is going to be a very exciting and meaningful process for all of us to go through one of the things that I have been thinking about, and this let me try to just put forward what I'm thinking and providing a little context is anything about it. From a community board perspective, obviously we're always looking to put forward resolutions and to take actions and I. Think one of the things that gets really complicated about social justice and thinking about equity and inequity is how do we assess the policy positions and decisions that we make as a community board and what do those mean from a social justice perspective and how do we knowingly or unknowingly make decisions that really have social justice impact? So let me give you an example and I don't mean to choose something controversial, but it's just what comes to mind and I'm not looking to start a debate, I'm just looking to open some eyes and to further explain what I mean. So, let's take one of transportation's favorite topics, bikes bike lanes and bike infrastructure and the reason I bring this up is there? Is it's pretty clear and evident that if you look at how New York City is trying to build out its bike, lane network there's a lot of discussion about how it has tended to go into whiter, wealthier, neighborhoods, and there are issues. There are definitely concerns that have been raised by communities of color that have not had the infrastructure improvements to the same extent as places that are whiter and wealthier, and that is a legitimate complaint. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't not pursue them. But how do you take that in the context of the entire city, because we are one community, but the community? That's part of a broader neighborhood and obviously what happens here is important to connect in terms of connecting communities to our north, to communities to our south and over the bridge and even other boroughs and along those same lines. Then you get to the issue of the users of the bike lanes and we've had many discussions about bike safety and e-bikes, and such and many people recognize that the users of e-bikes, which we have fought very vehemently over time, are people who are often immigrants and people of color and people who are generally low-income workers who are really depending on being able to use bike lanes like restaurant workers who need them in order to be able to survive. So it's a very complex situation in the way that we think about this, but these are things that don't necessarily always come up from a social justice perspective when we're discussing them at committee level or even as part of the community board and I, don't know. If perhaps we want to have some assessment or this committee be used to do a deeper dive into how committees and community boards positions on various issues, not just transportation but across the board, really have meaningful implications in terms of social justice, either positive or negative. And how do we bring those to light? So people can understand what the implications are and how and perhaps allow us to be able to better understand what we're doing to try to be more cognizant of the of those decisions in the future. Does that make sense? Yes, it makes a lot of sense and in fact it's one of the no really and it in fact, I think it's and not to pick on bikes and bike lanes, but I think that that's a great example, because I will just confess that I hate, e-bikes and I understand exactly why. They're necessary for the people who use them, and it's not so much an issue, and so there are lots of issues and it is a complicated. It is complicated issue and I. Think that and all of the decisions that we make as a board and I guess, that's part of what we're kind of talking about tonight is the ways in which we can begin to look at all of our decisions through that lens of social justice are we in are is what we do moving toward a more just and equitable city, and that's and I think it's very important to think that it's very specifically about that. So thank you. That was great. Thank you and worried. Unmuted there you go hi I want to thank both of you for heading this committee and I think that it's amazing that there are so many people coming to a first committee meeting and I just have kind of like some random thoughts. You know I had a long career in journalism and one of the things that we always abided by was follow the money, so I think that so much of the social injustice is because there's incredible inequity in this country, but in the city as well and I, think that is something that needs to be addressed like on every level but especially in our community, because we really, we have you know some of the wealthiest people in the world and we have some of the poorest people in the world and we're both existing. In the same, you know space and trying to thrive so again, I really I. Thank you for doing this, but I am all I am always I'm sure that many of you know that I'm really into communication and I think that communication will, you know, solve the world's problems. If we just you know, talk to each other and listen to each other, and so I would like to invite the two chairs to come and do a CB8 zoom with me, because then I think that you'll get publicity and hopefully there'll be more. You know people who come to the committee, both you know with ideas and to educate us, etc. So I just wanted to offer that well. Thank you, Valerie I think is next. Yes, okay, hi good evening everybody. This is really exciting. To have so many people here, I just wanted to echo I think this committee can do a lot of different things. A couple of things number one I don't want to forget the disabled in social justice. They are a group that is often really overlooked and they need a lot of representation in what we're doing and I think this. Obviously, what Craig says is true. This goes against not a good. It covers all of our committees in every way, and another example of that was when we were looking at New, York City links, and we were saying that there weren't enough link stations in the parts of our community that didn't have a lot of Wi-Fi access. So, in a lot of ways we were thinking about these issues even before they became more popular in that sense and I also think the community board can do a job, a good job in highlighting the various groups within our community who are fighting for social justice and have been when Peter mentions criminal justice. There are a lot of faith-based organizations that are working with re-entry with people from the criminal justice system back into society, and we do have very active churches and synagogues in that area. So I think part of the agenda or the mission of this committee should be highlighting where those groups are so that people can find their place into working towards a more anti-racist society and helping others. So that's all I'm going to say thanks, Valerie, okay, who's. Next, there is, if you could identify yourself, sir, yes, 939, 5001, etc. That's your phone number, I guess: you'll have to unmute yourself. There you go you're unmuted now go ahead, hello, everyone! This is my first meeting. Welcome and I said: I was gonna, sit back and listen. You know you touched on a lot of good points. You know- and you know make me have a little hope in society- that a small group of people are focused on change. You know I'm an african-American I lived in New York, all my life, you know, and I've seen the ups and downs here you know and I'm growing to have a level head about racism. You know I'm not a perfect person, but you know I through this here thing going on black lives matter. You know gave me some hope. You know because I see people other than myself didn't. Look like me was on the front lines. You know and I really felt good about that. So you know I'm a learning person and I'm just glad to be in just glad I made this meeting. That's all I have to say thank you we're glad you're here. Actually his name is George. Brown I, don't know if he introduced me. Oh I'm! Sorry! It's okay! Thank you for coming joining us all right, Elita again, then Patrick then Rebecca. Thank you. I! Don't know how broad you want to be just a suggestion is looking at public-private partnerships which, because they involve an element of profit, tend to go for certain areas to perform essential services. Valerie reminded me of that, with the link NYC and how hard we worked and pushed for internet access in areas that don't have it in apartments and that's not the only example of the failure sometimes of public-private partnerships. They may pertain to NYCHA housing, for instance, and other areas, so it's just something possibly if you're looking for broad systemic issues to think about that just an idea. Thank you. That's a good one! Thank you! Patrick again, wherever you are hey there, thanks again for having me to speak again, just real quickly. I'm hearing a lot of people talk about the importance of criminal justice reform and having those conversations, but I'm wondering what role this can this community Board committee will play in you know making those hard calls and having those hard conversations with our very own 19th precinct, because we have to be honest in as much as there is inequity in our neighborhood part of that inequity is protective or is a projected. Is an external projection that we project to other people in other parts of the city, a lot of my black and brown friends who grew up in Brooklyn or the Bronx. They don't feel comfortable being. You know, walking the streets that night on the Upper East side, because they don't want to have a negative interaction with the police in our very own neighborhood. Despite how you know welcome, they would be by any of the 50 people on this call. The reality is people really don't feel comfortable around our very own 19 precinct police? So what role does the committee plan to have and what you know? What way what powers will it have to make statements or make direct action responses to our very own police here at NYPD or in the nineteen precinct? Also, you know I'm hearing a lot of people say we'll have these we'll wanna make these statements? You know if something happens in the community I wonder if there should also be something in the workings of this system. That includes the ability to make a direct action, because you know, if something bad happens, you don't want the meeting to have passed and then to not be able to do anything about it for 30 days or say anything about it for 30 days. Do you know what I mean yeah to the second point and I know exactly what you mean? There are lots of times where a committee will meet and then three days later something happens or something is scheduled to happen and we are kind of then behind the eight ball and behind the curve. I don't know personally and Sandra. You should talk about this too I, don't know how I don't know how to react really to the 19th precinct. I kind of I have to admit that I feel uncomfortable around the police and I'm probably the least likely person or among the least likely people to be profiled. So it's I think that it's kind of a back and forth with the 19th precinct in a way talking to them about our issues of policing within our neighborhood I mean we can't all we can really do is kind of talk about to the police, about ourselves as a group and whether or not the community board as a board wants to make that kind of statement. I think is something that probably remains to be seen. I think. From our end, we can push for better dialogue with the police department, who do come to community board meetings and make presentations. You know this is what we're doing this is if you have a problem. This is what you this is, who you should talk to and I think that that's helpful I, don't think we often enough, then ask them or tell them what it is that we feel we need that we're not getting from the police department. That probably said way too much, but yeah all right, they'll dimension the public safety on Roosevelt Island too, but go on sorry fundraising. It's okay! Well! For those who don't know, I come from law enforcement, I'm retired a retired supervisor within mypd for 24 years, so I've seen the disparities even in the department, I guess for us for this committee. I know for myself: I'll speak for myself. First and foremost, as an activist and organizer I will have my ear to the streets of what's going on in our community and bring something back to our chair at that time and as well as the committee. If something we need to address, if we need to gather a quicker meeting plan, something or something like that, I know we did do a statement, I believe it was in May or June. Billy, probably remember I think it was either may or June. We did a statement regarding George Floyd I was part of crafting that statement, and one of the things I did ask was I, don't know how long everybody was on the board. I wanted to know has the have. Has this community board ever done? Something like that and I? Don't know, maybe a leader or some other people that before then, because there was a statement done with George Floyd's death, but was there a statement done with Eric Gardner's death right here in New, York City in Staten Island some years ago? So this as we know, this committee is new, we're here we're starting we're, building our foundation, we're looking and listening to ideas. Of course this is on YouTube, it's taped, so we're taking notes as well as we will be reviewing it, and we want to be able to serve this committee and this community the best we can in impacting social justice, whatever topics or issues we decide to take on. As I said from the beginning, we can't tackle everything. We know that so that's part of why we're having this dialogue with you all to get some feedback into how we will steer the work that we will be doing collectively. So I, don't know if that quite answers it, but as for the police, Department Anthony shared, he feels a little fearful and that's honest and I appreciate him making that statement, and then there probably are some people here that don't see a problem with how policing is done, but that was one of the reasons we used the video that we used to open up to kind of prick your hearts in this committee in the beginning to get you to you know, spark your thinking if you aren't thinking about social justice, so I'll leave that at that, and we will definitely whatever we need to do in this committee and on this community board we will try to impact this community and beyond. Definitely now I'm going to skip Rebecca we'll come back to you, but Barbara I, don't think has spoken yet and so, let's turn on Barbara's mic, which you've done yep I did. Thank you. This is very good I. Just would like to say what has been done: no I, don't believe. We've ever had a statement in the past, I think you're, absolutely right. Andrea I think that what happened between everything sparked and so I am with Rebecca Denegor Co-chair of the health senior Social Services Committee, and we took on to try to address some inequities. It's very nice to have big ideas, but it's hard to have a meeting about big ideas and get something done so we're working in two ways and by the way, our committee, it was included when Nick Vs left the board to take over what was called public safety, and I'm now calling it judicial justice because I think the role of the police we realize has changed tremendously and we did have a meeting with to discuss, bail and choke reform, and those I worked unbelievably hard to try to get the police to get a balanced point of view. We had Liz and Keith. It is such a emotional subject. I can not tell you and we're hoping we're doing something on health, our mental health. You know just health equity for racial justice on the 15th, we're hoping to have an overall committee about what do we do next and so on and the same thing with justice and we are committed to have the polls come. It doesn't mean that you can't I think that having multiple things, but it isn't like we haven't done anything and I wish more people would come, and particularly from this committee, to listen to some of the things that we've done we've we have tried to talk about all issues of health inequity, which is so important and judicial justice. So we will be doing more. We did hear about bail reform. We didn't come to a conclusion about whether it's right or wrong or what it should be done next time somebody comes, you could certainly be more. You know. Maybe more of a resolution would come or something like that. That's what I'd like to say can I speak to the bail reform aspect, I believe with the barrel reform aspect. It depends on who's, the messenger with that and what facts are they giving and providing? So that was one of the issues, because there was some fear-mongering with it as well. I just wanted to point that out that if you heard Keith and Liz, you would have agreed with them, I believe: okay, no I didn't know how to scale was weighed with people. Because that's what you said you didn't I wanted to scale it both ways and I. Couldn't the police said if they're coming we're not coming it was I've tried through many backdoors. I talked to I could not get the other point of view because I believe in hearing balance, but what we heard was and if you want to know my personal point of view, I, don't unders I, don't get why anybody would be against bail reform I, don't understand it, but and I spent lots of time on it. I spoke to lots of different people, so I agree with you, but I do want to know that we from individual committees we can also address- and maybe this committee would be more of an umbrella and I would love to work with you on our committee. That's not housing, it's not environment. It is health, Social, Justice senior issues and so on. That's our committee yeah, and that makes a lot of sense. I'm also very connected with someone that was involved with bail reform and I would like to just share, and one of because I'm a public housing resident I live in Isaac houses, one of our resident Association meetings. We had someone come his last name is Solomon, come and speak to us, he's related to the district leader, the husband and he works for I. Believe the district attorney is something like that office and he came to our meeting and it was really fear-mongering and what was really problematic with his delivery. Was he kept saying that they used a poster boy? He said this several times they used a poster boy to get bail, reform done and after he spoke, I raised my hand and I stood up and I turned to him and I said the poster boy you referring to has a name is Khalif Brower and that right there just to come into a meeting and use. That label was horrible to the to my community that I live in and I'm directedly impacted, and then there was an imbalance in the meeting because of the demographics of race in our meeting as well. So I just wanted to share that with you. So, like I said it's sometimes it's about the messenger, but you know we all have to do our own research too, to really get to the facts, because we don't want bad information. We want accurate information, so I just wanted to share that. Well, this was both on the state level and the local level, the city level, people that worked on these different reforms and talked about it, and we heard the difference between the two chokeholds and it's something that brought certainly I learned and I had been. I've been studying it because it's my committee I, spend a lot of time. Reading those articles and talking to people and trying to get both as a community board person I believe we should try to get two points of view. I, I'm it's different than when I do other type of activism, but I think that we have to be somewhat balanced and I couldn't be balanced. I have to couldn't get the other side to come and I think they will come, and we and I hope that we all that you comes Andrea and others do too and hear what they have to say and argue with them. Yeah facts matter. That's all I'm saying facts matter. We definitely want that. We're worried about lack of politeness and I hope that it's a polite meeting yeah. Thank you. Okay, now, Rebecca and before I say what I was going to say. I would encourage anyone who's interested to read the minute. From that meeting, we were very careful to try and bring things back to their most basic definition like what the actual purpose of bail is, which is not to keep people off the streets. It was it's solely to try and get people to come back for trial, so taking things to their kind of simplest definition, to kind of open a dialogue, that's more based, in fact, but so I encourage anyone to read the minutes. What I was going to say is I think we should also discuss how we want this committee to function with other committees, as Barbara said we're tackling some of these issues. I know as a co-chair of a committee. I would love to partner with you guys as a committee, but I'm not sure if you guys want I think you can also. This committee can have their own meetings as well, but I would like to see you guys kind of be involved when topics come up in other committees as well, so I think we should think a little bit about how that would work. Yeah and I think we should talk about that. I agree. Lynn is back up, so Rebecca just used a really important word that I want to talk about, and that's read and I Billy. Just let me know that one of the other community boards has a great reading list on this topic, and I would like to encourage this committee and our community board to also curate a list or a reading list that helps people get informed about some of these topics. I'm just finishing reading a book called the new Jim Crow about mass incarceration in an age of color blindness, and it actually put on paper in a really constructive but hard to read way, something that my mentor Al Lewis, who formerly was a Roosevelt Island resident and a state advocate for decades for prison reform and for justice used to talk to me in regularly about how unjust the whole system was and how it and he used to visit prisons and encourage inmates and do some amazing things around this state and I have to say that until the last year or so, I really didn't understand some of the things that he'd been talking to me about all those years ago. But some of the reading that I've done in the last three four years has really put into perspective the full complement of all the work that he was doing. He single-handedly changed the Rockefeller laws here in New, York state. It's one of the things that I'm so proud to say that I knew him that he was my mentor and all the work that he did to change prison reform here in this state. But those are things that I'm afraid will get lost unless we do things like create a reading list that really helps encouraging encourage people to delve deeper in some of these topics. So that's something I'd just like to encourage the committee think about great thank you. Okay, I think we've fortunately or otherwise gone into the rest of our agenda, and so I guess we're now at the point where we want to know. If there's go ahead before you jump in yes, yeah, okay, yeah can I jump in for a bit before you go to four okay, yes, I was going to say we kind of covered the potential areas of focus. What I would say a statement is fear is what will hold us back. You know. I've heard a lot on this in this meeting when we, you know, ask for feedback from you all that are here. You know the broadness, how you know different areas of tackling or what we should tackle a lot of great suggestions. You know, and we do have a homeless issue in this city and in our area you know we have a housing, NYCHA public housing. We have a crisis in public housing. You know that is a major folk. I mean people, it's like it's systemic, it's definitely systemic issues in public housing. We know we have health care disparities, even with childbirth, from a black woman to or a black and or asian woman or spanish woman, as opposed to a white woman giving birth. You know the death rate, so there's a lot to look at. There is a lot of education. We need to get involved in and learn, but we also want to be able to focus, get us in a focus and get everybody activated. That wants to be a part of this community to be possibly on the right side of history and be change, agents and change makers. So one thing I would suggest before the next meeting, whenever we have that one which will be definitely next month, right, Anthony or next month, one of the things I'll suggest is for those that were looking for something if you have not done or if you have not I know people talk about reading, but if you have not visited, call shoots park Ues for Blm the gathering, that's there the vigil at 7:00 p.m. Every night, since June 2nd it's been six month months, I, don't know who all has been have been there. I know. Russell has told me he visited a few other people, I'm sure have been by there, but that's something that there's a lot of learning there. We've learned so much about just different things that are going on: we've shared so much information. Yes, it is regarding black lives and police, violence and death, and so forth like that. But if you have not visited it been to one of those gatherings, I urge you to we're out there every night, I'm one of the organizers we're out there every night I urge you all to stop by at 7 pm and stay we're out there about an hour. There's a vigil, there's 8 minutes and 46 seconds and there's also a mini March. So that's something that I urge if anyone hasn't been, if you can I know the weather's getting cold, but I urge you to stop by there and just visit it on the weekend. Maybe whatever works for you. That can be a start point for you. If you don't have a start point to engage and be a part of social justice, that's it! Thank you. Barbara has her hand up again. I just again want to say two things that I would love to work with you in the committee. We did have a meeting less two months ago. I forget now two months ago that we one of the major topics we talked about was more maternal mortality and there is work being done and it's very interesting to hear homelessness. I actually had what I considered too fluffy of a meeting about three years ago on homelessness. It was what our community is doing. I would love to do more work. This is a major issue, maybe the roles of hotels with homelessness or some of the other vacant departments and all of that, something that deals with land use, possibly one of my pet peeves as I was sitting in back of Anthony and as I was saying this at a meeting, I saw him shaking. Yes, we have these people that these developers that get rid of all of the people in these walk up apartments. They get rid of the stores and they keep those apartments empty. For ten years, the one on eight that goes from 86 all the way over to 85th street between second and first is a perfect example. I, don't know what those apartments look like, but why couldn't we? Why couldn't the city take over and do it I would love to work with you? That is part of our committee and I would love to work with you on that. It's a very important issue. Thank you and it also overlaps with housing and zoning and development and I, don't think so. I don't know Sony, but certainly housing, right yeah. No, it does because one of the things that the this is really semi off topic, but one of the things that really affects that is that developers are allowed to demolish without any approved plans to build and because of that, but not even demolish it's not they don't know, I understand that, but things that are vacant but there's no reason why they should be allowed to demolish I mean it's bad enough to warehouse. It is such a major thing for me, and it really does I mean we need to do something with the homeless population. It's just heartbreaking. Elita. Thank you, I, just really briefly in terms of equity and health care and some other social justice issues. Look at the website of the New York Academy of medicine, they're doing quite a lot of work and research around the world around the country in the city, about issues of equity and fairness and how certain populations have suffered a lot, not just from coded, but for maternity and other issues. So I am on their email list and I get a lot of information from them which I put in the updates, but it can be really helpful and give you a good jumping off point for certain discussions or certain research thanks. Thank you. This has been a very actually a very idea-rich meeting and now I think our task is to kind of try and consolidate it, meld it into a thing and work on a course of action for this committee and for the community board for going forward in 2021. Yes, yeah. Thank you all for coming out and joining us and all the suggestions, and it's great that this is recorded. So we can always go back to whatever notes we missed and you know we're definitely and we definitely took everyone's comments and we receive them and we will see how we can. You know, however, like you said because out Anthony said consolidate whatever we can blend, we definitely will have speakers down the road, some types of some presentations and you know so forth. So any suggestions you have, of course, my email and Anthony's email. Anything you suggest if you come across, possibly a speaker that you might want to engage with us at one of our meetings, reach out to us and we'll see if we can lock them in, for whichever meeting that would be and we're still open to suggestions- and this is our new. This is our first. This is our first meeting as you know, and you all have made it very pleasurable and also engaging which was very important. So it wasn't a dull meeting, pretty much everyone that needed to say something spoke shared their ideas said what they wanted and that's great. We had public and community Board member participation. So it's appreciated. You can close us out. Anthony, if I don't know, if anybody has no all I was gonna going to I was going to ask. If someone wanted to make a motion to adjourn right, you do have one hand up left if you want to get to it before. Oh okay, hang on one second guys, Patrick hi. Thank you so much I'll be quick. Thank you for letting me speak so much very excited about this. I guess I just wanted to say: I have a suggestion, because you have new business on your list here. So I have a suggestion for new business. I've had a lot of conversations with the people at the Crossroads Park Conservancy, and they do strongly support the vigil in the altered location, the signs and everything at the park very much so, and they have experienced a lot of destruction recently and I would love to see a statement would of course be nice, but if there is any way to work with the parks Conservancy this committee to say, hey, how do we make this a permanent fixture or something you know because they're hitting their 200th day, I think correct me. If I'm wrong Andrea very soon, so it's going to come up on a year real fast and clearly the community supports this yeah. Very good. Thank you. Can I jump in on that? I'm sorry! Thank you, Patrick for highlighting that I was at not the last parks and recreational meeting, but the one before I requested an application for us to work on to see if we can get approved to have that site designated with the area where we do the vigil at as a memorial site or whatever they will allow. So I'm still waiting on an application. Maybe a leader you can help me I reached out to my cousin at them parks, departments and I. Don't know if Trisha's on I don't know if she obtained it yet so I have yet to receive it. But that is in the works of trying to get it approved. You know fill out the application get it approved and hopefully they will and then we can work with the people at Ues, the attendees and organizers as well on one of them to see. If we can designate that section where we gather and where we have gathered since June 2nd so I just wanted to highlight that, thank you Patrick. Thank you. Okay, now, I think we can go back to Rita. Having raised her. Having made a motion to adjourn, she has done so is her second Billy. Okay. So if there's no objection, we're going to will adjourn and thank you all for coming and we will see you- hopefully all of you and more next month, yeah stay Covid-19, safe and well. Thank you.
