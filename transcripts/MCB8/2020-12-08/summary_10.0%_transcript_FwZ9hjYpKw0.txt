It's your first time at one of our community board aid, virtual meetings, virtual committee, meetings, you'll notice, that you're muted and that you're not able to unmute yourself the way that you will whenever we open for questions and comments, The way that you'll engage with our co-chairs tonight is through the use of the raise hand, button that you can find in the participants menu at the bottom of your screen.
And I, think Sandra is going to start with the our first agenda item and, as a new committee I think we have a lot of kind of organizing to do especially tonight.
I will provide you with a very simple definition of it, as well as share with you some examples of social justice which may help spark insight and see that what we can work on at a broader you, know, spectrum of it.
It does not highlight all forms of social justice, but I believe that this selected six minutes minute footage will actually be a segue and to sparking some thoughts, as well as understanding to the importance of this committee.
And, you know the way, king did what I say to a lot of young people who speak about the fact that the civil rights movement is somehow a thing of the past I said, Let me paint a picture for you.
I hope that actual footage would impact your thinking about social justice and hopefully help you decide that.
It needs its own committee to actually do the work and take on some of these issues, Whatever we decide collectively as a board to do, instead of you know putting it onto other committee.
I had wanted to do something like start with an implicit bias, training to bring the board to a way of thinking about things and more knowledge about ourselves and the community, and it was a land use meeting that was originally going to be the basis of a conversation with people in the community, and we were just going to listen so that the community board would begin to understand what other people were thinking where we could begin to see, and we weren't going to be responding just really in my vision, really just listening.
There were an awful lot of people on the board who had wanted to establish a committee and from there everything that Sandra said is right, but the time came where and we do so much work in so many different areas that trying to create a more just, a more equitable environment in society, seem to be a necessary time.
Oh, actually, yeah, Rebecca, Dangor, okay, I just wanted to say that I'm happy it's a committee and not a task force, which is something we also discussed at the full board.
It was the same kind of issue and obviously, Once the charter was after the election passed, there was no longer a need for the charter reform task, force, but I think something like the Social Justice Committee is ongoing and in fact the work of the committee will probably never be done and is that are we good.
A racial Justice committee and the reason is social justice is because we didn't want to be limited in the work.
I, think that helps or potentially helps all of the work that we do in the community board and outside of it and one of the things which is the second item.
Zoning of a particular project is what it should be, and so, as a consequence, I think that this kind of committee really needs a statement of purpose and because of that, those of you who are here tonight and those who couldn't make it and wanted to.
And, I, know, Billy and I have had some opportunities to be learning some great things this year recently and we there's a book called the new Jim crow that really talks about some of those issues and how they have impacted our society and our framework, and the other thing that I didn't realize was an outcome of some of the laws that engendered unfair rules against people of color was how it impacted their voting rights and that's something that I think that we need to address and maybe put on the table as far as the importance of making sure that people have a voice in our society.
And I find that to be a very good way to have a one-to-one relationship with your social justice and your actions, So I think things like that could be, you know, could be something as part of you know, social justice, whether or not you support whether or not you know.
You know, I, think I'm sure we'll have a lot of discussions about what our purpose should.
Sher's park, which has been such a I, think integral part of our community, and so one thing I'd like to see this committee endeavor to do is to take stock of those inequities as they exist.
I'm not trying to create work necessarily, but to do some form of a statement you know of social justice needs or equity needs.
We could you know if people don't like that, idea, no problem, but that's a conversation we could have over the coming months.
Some of us have lived every day of our lives facing injustice, and some are in between so to bring in speakers to help situate us as to what social justice really means and then specifically, what it means within our city, I think, can be very useful.
By saying that this is really such a big deal, and that would just as a thought would it be possible to get the borough president to have this light committee in every community board, because there are different things in each community board and the only way we're going to learn of what we don't have is to hear what somebody else.
And I think that we definitely have the means to do it and the resources like whether that be through the community board website or just getting more participation.
I think that this committee could be a very good resource for the public to become educated, about racial injustice and social injustices of all kinds.
I. Think that a huge portion of a huge portion of what we should be doing and focusing on would be well trying to improve the material conditions of the most marginalized in our communities and also trying to create more opportunities, whether it be you know, work working with, like the housing community or the Zone Zoning Committee, to try and provide more opportunities for affordable, housing.
I mean I thought about various pieces of this, and what I have is a kind of a somewhat long list of areas that I think we may want to touch on with the thought.
When people are trying to come back to the community and have a life and be supportive and having access to jobs, access to you, know, places, say access to a network, and so on.
Think, one of the things that gets really complicated about social justice and thinking about equity and inequity is how do we assess the policy positions and decisions that we make as a community board.
It's a very complex situation in the way that we think about this, but these are things that don't necessarily always come up from a social justice perspective when we're discussing them at committee level or even as part of the community board and I, don't know.
And I think that it's amazing that there are so many people coming to a first committee, meeting.
And I, think that is something that needs to be addressed like on every level but especially in our community, because we really, we have.
I. Think this committee can do a lot of different things.
I. Don't want to forget the disabled in social justice, And I think this.
It covers all of our committees in every way, and another example of that was when we were looking at New, York City links, and we were saying that there weren't enough link stations in the parts of our community that didn't have a lot of Wi-Fi access.
There are a lot of faith-based organizations that are working with re-entry with people from the criminal justice system back into society, and we do have very active churches and synagogues in that area.
So, I, think part of the agenda or the mission of this committee should be highlighting where those groups are so that people can find their place into working towards a more anti-racist society and helping others.
I'm hearing a lot of people talk about the importance of criminal justice reform and having those conversations, but I'm wondering what role this can this community Board committee will play in you.
If, something we need to address, If we need to gather a quicker meeting, plan, something or something like that, I know, we did do a statement, I believe it was in May or June.
This is on YouTube, it's taped, so we're taking notes as well as we will be reviewing it, and we want to be able to serve this committee and this community the best we can in impacting social justice, whatever topics or issues we decide to take on.
And I appreciate him making that statement, and then there probably are some people here that don't see a problem with how policing is done, but that was one of the reasons we used the video that we used to open up to kind of prick your hearts in this committee in the beginning to get you to you, know, spark your thinking.
If you aren't thinking about social justice, I'll leave that at that, and we will definitely whatever we need to do in this committee and on this community board.
Andrea I think that what happened between everything sparked and so I am with Rebecca Denegor Co-chair of the health senior Social Services Committee, and we took on to try to address some inequities.
Now, calling it judicial justice, because I think the role of the police we realize has changed tremendously and we did have a meeting with to discuss, bail and choke reform, and those I worked unbelievably hard to try to get the police to get a balanced point of view.
We have tried to talk about all issues of health inequity, which is so important and judicial, justice, Maybe, more of a resolution would come or something like that.
I agree with you, but I do want to know that we from individual committees we can also address.
From that meeting, We were very careful to try and bring things back to their most basic definition like what the actual purpose of bail is, which is not to keep people off the streets.
Topic, and I would like to encourage this committee and our community board to also curate a list or a reading list that helps people get informed about some of these topics.
I mean people, It's like it's systemic, it's definitely systemic issues in public housing.
If, you don't have a start point to engage and be a part of social justice, That's it, I just again want to say two things that I would love to work with.
This has been a very actually a very idea-rich meeting and now I think our task is to kind of try and consolidate it, meld it into a thing and work on a course of action for this committee and for the community board for going forward in 2021.
