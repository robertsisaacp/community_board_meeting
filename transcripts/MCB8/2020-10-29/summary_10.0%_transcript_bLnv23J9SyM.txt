I'd like to think about what we can do as a community and community board to be supportive of our parents, you know, and students, and also our faculty and our administrators, because everyone's trying to navigate this situation, which is obviously you know new to all of us.
Actually a couple days, ago, and Some highlights that were recorded just to give a little bit of a snapshot at the extent that that's useful, which is that 48 of the students are now doing blended learning the rest are doing just remote.
It is a defined period of time in which you know, parents and students can make that transitional choice to blended learning, because the system needs to adapt to the different numbers of people who are adopting each approach to participating in our schools.
So they're, still working on trying to you know, bring that site up to a strong and functional level , they're, still working on ensuring that all rooms meet ventilation standards they do have and have put in place a third day supply of PPE and cleaning supplies at at all.
There's, also an issue in terms of as more parents Opt for blended learning, that there may well be a need for more teachers and the Department of Education is working ongoingly to try to make available enough teachers to address that issue, and the last point I'm just going to mention is given that the scheduling issues for children's there's a question of how students will get food They simply require a request that there be a report on anyone, not getting food.
On, I almost do not even know how to say this, but I do want to be sympathetic to the challenges that everyone's facing students, in particular teachers, in particular families and parents in particular, and administrative staff.
It's in Union, Square district, two public high school If anyone remembers what I spoke about last time, just as a follow-up to that, not much has really changed in the past month or so pretty much the past three months since back to school started, it is almost November, and so it's in theory that getting used to coming back to a remote school has passed.
We're seeing at my school not much of a policy shift from where we were at last year with a with an emergency pivot to remote learning and so, and so that has a few effects.
Are you struggling in the class too, and that is something I'm seeing across the board, And I I'm involved with student government with my school We're also seeing that through student government is, is just a lack of outlets for students to vent or to to just state what is going on with classes , what issues they're having Those, who do not have access to Wi-fi, those whose DOE computer is not working very well.
Those who are struggling with in-person school the hybrid approach and who are having problems with just sitting in class for sit in a classroom with a do with the door locked for six hours a day.
Will there's a short-term effect, which is that schools have to restructure their entire hybrid setup surrounding the number of kids that and that who initially signed up for remote and are now signing up for in-person and that's going to happen sometime around November Then there's also another effect of what is going to happen three months from that deadline from when that form is due and students who stuff comes up at home and their parents.
What is going to happen for those kids who need to go to in-person school in three months, but do not have the option to do that, and Definitely a lot of aspects surrounding both hybrid approaches and a remote approach that have caused issues that are a being overlooked by Central Dle, because part of it is it's not their job to manage that.
But, then the other part of it is what can a school do from a school perspective or what can me, as a student, do or me as a person who is in student government, do to help those who are not being vocal or not being advocated for so , there's a material difference or how you might characterize or try to characterize the difference between what you're experiencing as a fully remote student and what the hybrid students are experiencing, which I think is leveraging the same technology, but I'm, not sure so.
How are we going to keep students safe in the building so and the deal we put out three or four cookie cutter programs that a lot of schools adopted?
They kept the schedule of the DOE release, so there's different cohorts or pods or whatever you want to call it in my school They have a two week cycle in that they go in probably twice every two weeks and when they do go in it, 's pretty much remote learning from school.
Some are some are live but or virtual within a physical classroom that you're trying to manage and again where I, where I'm coming from, and the tone I'd like us to continue to adopt, is appreciation for all the challenges that both the parents and students, as well as the teachers and administrators are navigating in this.
Would you like to give us a perspective of somebody trying to you know oversee the operation at a particular school Thanks for having me, I am a cba resident, but I work out in long island, great neck, I'm, actually a principal of a private school there, so we're running it a bit different than than DOE We do not actually have to follow all the New York state regs as much as a DOE school might have to.
We, have our own committee of Health, which we hired two medical doctors and a couple parents to help us navigate through some of the new policies that almost come out every day, That the different policies for different schools and they're all they're cookie cutters, but we are able to make it our own when we have to.
Second graders or youngest kids would have the most trouble with wearing masks and being in this sort of cubicle, but it turns out that our middle school kids are probably the most effective affected out of all our students.
They, can't sort of be close to each other, where middle school students typically learn the taboos of life through social interactions.
They set up five machines in our school to be able to test not just our own students, but anyone in the community that wants to come in and test a rapid test.
One problem with the rapid test is that the only way you could get tested is, if you're symptomatic at the point at that time, which is good and bad because now we're inviting we do not allow parents in our building whatsoever, but now we're inviting the public to come to our school and get tested.
Now, our tuition assistance works very different, because parents who apply to our school in November we actually just opened up November 1st-is our application, the start of our application.
We shut down 24 hours and in 24 hours, I had to school back up remote learning fully for all 800 students, including our pre-k through eighth grade, and that was a huge Come to us and say: well.
When you get knocked down to get back, up, and I mean that absolutely literally and the other was I was assistant, editor of my school newspaper and the best part of that and the most memorable Then we'll worry about the rest of the story, which only to me underscores how important the out of classroom and extracurriculars are and that one of the things I'd like us to think about ongoingly as a community is what we can do to support our schools, and maybe it will be in some fashion, supporting you, know, out of classroom extracurriculars now, next speaking, elita thanks Peter thanks will hi.
If you're letting people into the school and at the same time you're a testing facility, it seems and knowing what's going on in Europe, it just seems like a recipe for a shutdown with a lot of people being sick, and I assume that people have grandparents.
People have parents, people have other others and from what I read in the times that it's even small events like small reunions, not even reunions, play days that schools, open and people feel that okay.
We actually literally call them up the next morning and say we need to see the guest list, because you know, if there's any, of our parents that are on that guest list and their children are on that, went to the event we automatically put them on quarantine for two weeks, whether they're, positive or not, whether they've been tested or not.
So I'm, going to throw on the table a suggestion that perhaps the schools should have centers where they have the kids come in with internet, where they can come and be socially distanced, but still have the ability to use computers and have the access, because even if you have a computer, you know if you do not have internet, it can't work.
I'm concerned about this lost generation of this Covid-19 sly generation that it's going to take us a couple years to catch these kids up to where we want them to be and what we need them to be And, then the more they they're quarantined and get kicked out of school or are hybrid right.
Let's talk about the New York's, the DOE hybrid situation, where kids only go to school twice a week in real life and then the other time they're at home, doing zoom, right and adding on to this point that and to your point, charity is this pod thing is that the way my school works is that the pods are six to eight kids, with a teacher and they're, not part of my school safety program.
If one, if that pod shuts down for my school, that's not a huge impact, because those kids can just do remote learning from home It's not much of a pivot, but for his school, on the other hand, you're losing you're losing a hundred percent of in-person.
You can agree that you will read the same book and have a phone conversation every day or every week the real, I think you know They come from families, where the focus on education is fairly strong and parents are engaging their kids in those kinds of conversations.
I did not know what it meant until I went to walk my dog at 7:30 in the morning before my son had to be there There were literally hundreds of adults as Rami mentioned Mommy's dad mentioned no social, distancing, No masks and the children had to walk through those lines to get to school and the staff was out on the street trying to help students get into school and How. Do we in the time where not only is there a global pandemic, but we have to worry about the safety of our children.
Do we address this because early voting does not need to be at Wagner Middle School , I can actually speak on this, so from both a student perspective and a political perspective.
This year, which is outrageous but so wagner, is also very special, because it is the number one point number one, most voters assigned to wagner middle school in all of New York City, so 108,000 people are assigned to vote at Wagner middle school for early voting and election day.
He was unsuccessful because the effectively the DOE had approved early voting sites with the board of elections sometime in the first half of the year, and I do not know exactly when it was whether it was entirely pre-covered or if Covid-19 had started.
That is going to be the issue, and I am sure that there are excess, other accessible sites throughout the city where accommodations can be made, but that what really happened was it's just that the sites had been selected and the board of elections in there infinite capacities were not able to pivot I appreciate that it was pretty close, but in the light of gun violence happening in our schools all across the country.
Does the city think it's appropriate for children to be sitting in school with strangers and staff walking in , like you got to see the principal on the street of Wagner on Monday morning, trying to separate the crowds to make a pathway through the hundreds of people for children to enter the future?
Schools are simply closed on election day and the reason that they are closed is so that we can use so that the city can use the buildings as polling sites for early voting.
Are we allowing people who we do not even take I d from to enter the school And I'm all for early voting?
They want the access of all the people to enter, and then why would the principal be told she can't go remote for the entire week of early voting to make sure the staff and children were safe when the board of Ed is making her go remote on election day, like?
She has 1500 kids in that school day when and when it goes back and when it goes back to being No Covid-19 God hold willing soon that you know when we have the democratic primary elections and early voting for the mayor.
Our kids are going to be in the middle of that too, and I do not know how contested those are start, putting pressure on the DOE in the board of elections now, so that you would not be an early voting site in the primary First of all.
