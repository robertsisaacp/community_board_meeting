Hey Marcus I, see you're here, I see Craig's here. Marcus is everything good on your end? Really well, what'd, you say Craig. Can you hear Marcus very well or is he very quiet? I thought I heard him like he was a hundred miles away. Hey guys, I, don't hear anybody Marcus! You can't hear us. Okay, no I, can't I, hear you Marcus, but you sound quite faint. Okay. Can you hear me now a little more get in there? Is there something sitting on top of your microphone? Maybe it's possible, I'm still sounding muted a little bit, but what about now? Still it's not ideal. Interesting! All right! Let's see test speaker microphone, you hear speak okay. Why is my mic not now testing microphone 2? Let's try this any better yeah that was actually much better. Okay! Craig did you think so too? Yes for sure great good, oh Chuck's, here Jack, you should be able to hear me now. Yes, okay, good, bye, hi, chuck hi, I'm in a different places. How are you Marcus, I'm fine, sir? Still here good? Are we ready to I, don't know how many are people here at this point, yeah our team is I, think I believe our team is here. Yeah we've got a. Maybe we should call a meeting to order. Will is everybody we have about 60 people. It looks like I agree with what Craig said. Okay, why don't we start it up? Yeah I want to welcome everyone to the December meeting of Community Board Aids Transportation Committee, I'm Chuck Warren, Co-Chair and Craig later my other co-chair, and we have a number of items on our agenda today and the first is the New York City transit presentation about the 68th Street subway station ADA project and we're happy to have Marcus Brooke who book rather, who is our liaison from New York, City, Transit and Marcus Welcome? And why don't you go ahead with your presentation? Okay, Chuck! Thank you! Richard! Can you just let me hear your voice Richard Weatherby, but she'll just have to unmute. Okay, thanks very much. It was professing me. Can you hear me all right, yeah I just want to make sure you're here and I can hear you. Okay, good so good evening, community board eight, so we're really glad to be with you again and we're especially excited tonight to provide you with an update on a long-awaited ADA project in your district, the 68th Street Hunter College ADA project. As many of you are aware, when we first presented this project back in 2012, we received significant input and I would say: slash opposition from stakeholders regarding a proposing stairway on the southeast corner of East 69th street. So in response to that feedback and a fairly long negotiation process with affected stakeholders, including Cooney New York City transit, is now prepared to present a plan that we believe will address the concerns of our stakeholders, as well as some significant engineering challenges that we encountered with the project and its direct impacts on our most affected stakeholders. So tonight, what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce you to my colleagues who will be presenting and answering your questions tonight. You know who I am Marcus Book New, York, City, transits government community relations with us is Richard Weatherby our environment with our environmental team, who will go through the presentation with you, and we also have, in addition to Richard our design team, headed up by Nandini Sengupta and Jeremy Parnas from our service planning division. So I will now just ask everyone, as always, to hold your questions until the end of the presentation and then we'll be happy to address those questions at that time. So now I'll introduce, formerly Richard Weatherby to go to the presentation he will need to screen sharing our rights will yeah. He has it and just really quickly before you get started, I want to give everybody if it's your first time at one of our meetings, you'll notice that you're muted you're not able to unmute yourself whenever Marcus and his team is done with the presentation. We'll take questions through the use of the raise hand, feature you'll, find that through opening the participants menu at the bottom of your screen that menu, it says participants, and it has a little number next to it like right now. It says 80 and you open that a box will pop up and you'll see a hand. Button that says raise hand, click that don't just wave at us there's a lot of people in the meeting. We will not see you, so you have to find the participants button use the raise hand button if you want to be called on. The chat is just for tech support. No questions will be taken through the chat Marcus if Craig and Chuck are ready for, you can go ahead and go and the screen share should be available for rich, but yeah go ahead: Marcus, okay, Richard and Ella okay, Richard you're on okay, I've put this the presentation up. Can everybody see that yes, Sir, okay, great and so thanks very much Marcus, I'm rich Weatherby and before I get into the slide deck and present the project a little bit more detail. I wanted to provide a little bit of background on the project, just to get us all kind of current on what the status is back in February of 2016 MTA prepared an environmental assessment for this project that was submitted to the Federal Transit, Administration or Fta, and they approved the project on July 28 2016 when they issued their finding of no significant impact. Since that time, the MTA is engaged in property negotiations and has advanced the engineering design work. But, as mark has alluded to during that design work, it was determined that there were some significant structural modifications that would be required to install an elevator within the footprint of the Hunter College East Building, and that's the building located on the southeast corner of 68th and Lexington. Those structural modifications included re-supporting the structure redirecting loads and changing a floor elevation. So as a result of those structural engineering challenges, the MTA looked for an alternative site that could accomplish the project goals and they determined that by relocating the streets to air and elevator improvements from the southeast corner to the northeast corner. At the intersection of 68th and Lexington Avenue that they could avoid those structural concerns, so in the new proposed design, the stairs on the southeast corner of 68th street, which is located within CUNY property. That would remain unchanged. However, the MTA is, would very much like to see those stairs widened and continues to have a dialogue and discussions with CUNY to see if that can be accomplished. So with the exception of that relocated, elevator and the illumination of the widening of the stairs within the Hunter ecology's building footprint, the project's basically unchanged, principally unchanged from what was proposed in 2016. MTA, is currently reevaluating. The project with these proposed modifications in accordance with the national Environmental Policy, Act or Nepa, and they expect to submit the re-evaluation to the Fta for their review later this month. Results of the reevaluation indicate that the proposed modifications to the approved project do not result in new or more significant impacts than those that were identified in the 2016 environmental assessment. So with that, why don't we go into the slide? Deck and I can show what I was describing in a little bit more detail. All right, so here we are. This is a street level plan that illustrates the existing conditions. Can everyone see my cursor okay for orientation purposes? The north is to the right side of the page, and so we have Lexington Avenue here running through the center of the page. 69Th is here towards the right. 68Th street is to the left. This sheet presents the plan as approved in 2016. What we're looking at here is a new street stair at 69th street west of Lexington Avenue, a new mid-block entrance stair on the east side of Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th streets. That would be housed within commercial space in the imperial House, a reconstructed stair here on the northwest corner of 68th and Lexington Avenue, a reconfigured and widened stair here on the northeast corner of 68th and Lexington, and then here within the Hunter College East building the footprint of it. These stairs were proposed to be widened and reconfigured, and a new elevator that would take passengers from the street level down to the mezzanine would be constructed again within that building footprint. So the new proposed design retains many of the original projects features, principally the entry on 69th street west of Lexington Avenue, the Midwalk entrance in the imperial House, the reconstructed northwest stairs those all remain unchanged. As we look to the east side of 68th street or to 68th street on the east side of Lexington Avenue. We see there's some modifications here. The stair and elevator that were proposed within the footprint of the Hunter College East building would not be constructed. Instead, the elevator relocated here to the north side of the street, and it would be constructed within a curb bump out that would extend the sidewalk into what's currently the parking lane here on the north side of 68th street. Additionally, the current stair, that's on the northeast corner of 68th and Lexington Avenue, would be relocated a little further south than what was originally proposed. And what I'm going to do here is I'll go to the, and this really helps to illustrate it as we can see the existing conditions, the design from 2016 here in the middle panel and the new design all side by side. As you can see, the reconstructed steer on the northwest corner remains unchanged from what was originally proposed. Back in 2016. We can see that the Northeast air, the stair here at the northeast intersection, was originally proposed to be relocated, further east and reorientated, so the entrance and exit would come from the eastern side. That remains the same. However, the stair is now widened and it shifted a little bit further south than what was originally proposed so that it fits in that curve bump out. Lastly, the proposed modifications to the stairs within the Hunter college building would not be made and the elevator location would be relocated here to the north side of the street. This slide here illustrates the existing conditions, some photographs, existing conditions on 68th and Lexington, some renderings of what was proposed from 2016, and then what we anticipate the new design to look like. So, as you can see here in this upper left image, the stair entry to the mezzanine is located in a is recessed within the building footprint of Hunter College. That stair was proposed to be widened and the passenger elevator constructed there that the new design presents the elevator here within that curved bulb out. That's been constructed in the parking lane with the entry stair located a little bit further east, as you can see here, and that would replace this stair here located right at the corner that enters provides access right onto Lexington avenue, in addition to the street level, changes there's a couple of modifications to the mezzanine at 68th street, and so these graphics are also orientated where north is to the right. So you have Lexington avenue over the mezzanine here, 68th street over the mezzanine through the center portion. Here, as you can see in the original plan, there were modifications in the northwestern portion of the mezzanine associated with that reconstructed stair. There was a rehabilitation of the stairs from the mezzanine down to the platforms for both the southbound and the northbound sides, and then we have elevators that take you from the mezzanine down to the platform level for both sides that work that was proposed in 2016 remains unchanged with the new design. Really, the focus of the new design would be here in the northeastern portion of the mezzanine, where there would be some reconfiguration to accommodate those new stairs and the elevator here within that bulb out. That would be on the street level above. The work that was proposed within the Hunter college footprint would not be constructed for the new entries on 69th street and in the mid block within the imperial House. There would be no changes with this proposed design change for the elevator. They remain the same as what was presented in 2016. Similarly, at the platform level, access right now is presently afforded through stairs that take you from the 68th street mezzanine down to the platform level, both the southbound and the northbound, as was presented in 2016. There are no changes, so you'd still have the access from 69th street on the west side of Lexington, bringing you to the southbound platform. The existing stairs would be rehabilitated and the new elevator placed from the mezzanine down to the southbound platform. Similar modifications would be made to the northbound platform as well as that mid-block entrance, but those are unchanged from what was presented in 2016. and so here, just to recap, as a summary of what was presented in 2016 and what's changed now in the new design, as I indicated, the entrance on 69th street west of Lexington Avenue is unchanged from what was previously presented. Similarly, the mid-block entrance located within the imperial house that's unchanged and as a result of the efforts of the MTA to secure that property, since this was originally proposed in 2016, that's allowed them to eliminate any potential consideration of an entrance at 69th street east of Lexington. That wasn't something that had been contemplated back then, but that's no longer under consideration will not be constructed at the Hunter College East footprint building, as we talked about, we originally were planning to widen those stairs. That work would not be done, but we would continue to work with CUNY to see if that can be performed separate from this project. Additionally, the elevator that was former that was proposed to be located within that footprint would be relocated to the north side of the street. Also on the northeast corner of 68th and Lexington, we talked about the stair that presently exits right on to Lexington Avenue, as proposed in 2016. It's going to be relocated, it's just going to be slightly wider than what was proposed, and it's also going to be located a little bit further south than the original location which will take it off the Imperial House building on the northwest corner. Those stairs will still be re rehabilitated, as was proposed in 2016, and the only difference or distinction I want to make here is that the construction that work of rehabilitating the stairs would be performed during phase one of the construction period rather than in phase two and then. Lastly, the connection work between the mezzanine and the platform level, the elevators and the stair rehabilitation that was proposed in 2016 is unchanged now in the new plan. So the next steps for the MTA at this point are to complete the proposed design for the elevator at that new location on the northeast corner of 68th and Lexington. The MTA is working with agencies such as the New York, City, Department of Transportation and Federal Transit administration to obtain approvals once those approvals are in place that will allow for the construction contract to be let to a design, build contractor and construction to be initiated. As we look at the we have a schedule that illustrates the principal project components. It may be a little difficult to see, but it's a 36 month, con overall construction schedule. It's anticipated that the construction contract would be awarded in late June of 2021 and I want to just call your attention to a couple items here: the more intensive street level construction work is anticipated to be performed over about a 22-month period that would begin October of 2021 and wrap up on July of 2023. the. After that, much of the work would be done. Basically, within the station itself. It's going to be work associated with the elevator machinery and equipment, the testing and commissioning of that equipment. So you really wouldn't have much of a on-street presence during that portion of the construction phase, and so with that, I'm going to wrap up the presentation and Marcus I'll turn it back over to you so well. I. Think that at this point we would turn it back to chuck to do the Q&A right. That's the way you handle it sure yeah, okay, so the way we normally do things here is that we hear from the public first and those members of the public. Who would like to ask questions on this. Please, as will said, indicate the on the bottom. There's the raise hand function and raise your hand and we'll call on you. As we see your hands, you see, hands will I do so. You want to start with the public first and then public first yep, so you have Judy Schneider from the public. Okay Judy, why don't we unmute Judy I have two questions: what is the size? The first, what is the size of the elevator and I'm assuming that it will be ADA accessible and you will be able to get and a wheelchair in there without a problem? That's question: one bendini will: can you unmute Nandini, please yeah or Richard I, don't know who wants to take that question? Yes, certainly to answer the latter question, the elevator will be ADA compliant. That's the intent is to provide a path of travel for from the street level. All the way down to the platform level, both northbound and southbound platforms in accordance with the ADA I. Believe Nandini. Are you unmuted at this point? Yeah? Okay, do you want to speak to the dimensions of the elevator? Yes, dimension will be about 8 feet by 10 feet and it will be ADA compliant. It's a pass-through, elevator, okay and update a wheelchair it'll, definitely accommodate a wheelchair down to the platform level. Thank you and my second question is about the stair. You said on the original location in the South East corner that would be done separately from this project. Does that mean that hunter would be paying for that or would that be part of the MTA contract to widen that stair or correct that stare? So I think right now that would be separate from this project. I, don't know that the funding for that work has been determined between the MTA and CUNY, but that's a I think a part of an ongoing discussion between those two parties. Maybe you can get back to us about it because we've been hearing about that corner for, however many years this has been going on, so I don't mean next month, but whenever you have an answer to that question, maybe you can get back to the chairs and let them know how that's being handled understood. Thank you are any well. Is there any other public mem members of the public that want to speak? No, everyone else is a board member or public member. Okay, I see Laurie Boris. Why don't we unmute Laurie? Can you hear me? Yes, hello? Thank you very much for this presentation and I just want to be clear on the number of elevators that will exist when the project is completed, how many elevators will be servicing each side? You know I know some sometimes elevators service, both sides and I can't picture in my mind the station at the moment. But so that's my question is how many elevators will there be there's one elevator which will be from the street to the mezzanine, and then there will be two other elevators one from the mezzanine to the northbound platform and the other one will be from the mezzanine to the southbound platform, the three elevators all together, okay and so, and the one that services both the third one services both. Is that correct both means there will be one street to mezzanine elevator the street elevator, which you are seeing on the? Maybe you can go back to the plan. The mezzanine fan: yes, okay, so you see this. If I go to the plan b, you can see there's one which is from street to the mezzanine and then two other elevators each going to the northbound and the other one goes to the southbound platform. Okay, all right! Thank you very much. I'm just I'm concerned about backup. In case you know the elevators go down, so that seems to be okay, good! Thank you. Okay, I guess, I see Trisha Shimomura, as next is, can we unmute Trisha Thanks Chuck I? Just I'm sorry, if I'm, if I missed this at the beginning, but I'm confused for the. Why the change in the first place. Can you just clarify why it seemed that you guys had a good plan to widen the staircase underneath that mezzanine and it was attached to hunter, and so people getting out of the elevator would automatically have some shelter if it was raining, I'm just confused as to why the change at all sure, I think the change is really driven by some engineering challenges that were determined based upon the design development. So the Hunter college building, as you noted, sits over top that stairway and in order to get the elevations to match because we're making that stair an ADA compliant stair. There would be some fairly significant structural concerns associated with that building. That would come into play as you were, reconstructing those stairs and by installing the elevator, and so as a result of that, it's been determined that relocating the elevator outside of that relocating, outside of the footprint of the building, would eliminate that potential. For those structural concerns, okay and then the other piece. This is I, guess two connected questions. You mentioned that the south side, sidewalk of East 69th street, would no longer be touched or adjusted. Can you show where that is again on a map? Oh sure, bear with me for just a moment: I'll get to let's go to the direction, and so what was what we were referring to there was that, in the original plan, was to construct an entry here at 69th street on the west side of Lexington Avenue and to construct the mid-block entrance here within the footprint of the Imperial House. As a fallback, there was an alternate plan that had been contemplated to install a stair here on the east side of Lexington Avenue at 69th Street, and we received a lot of feedback from the community on that particular location, which is why the preference was to construct it here within the imperial House, because the MTA was able to successfully gain access to that property. That's eliminated any need or consideration of a of an entry here at 69th street, on the east side of Lexington. Okay, and thank you- and my last question is just about you had mentioned being in negotiation or being in discussion with hunter about widening the staircase on the southeast corner of 68th street I. Guess I'm confused as to why that's not a part of this as well, and why we aren't why this isn't just included in the project or and I guess. Maybe the bigger question is like who's funding. This is this all coming from I forget where the funding is coming from for this project sure well yeah. It's Marcus again. Over these many years, we've been in constant discussion and negotiation with Cooney on the way to do that. Right now we have not been able to come to an agreement about how that will be done and incorporate the structural challenges that are involved and where to deal with. The capacity is part of the reason, in addition to the elevator, we're adding additional stairwells to the station to address the capacity issue, but we'll keep you up to date on those discussions with Cooney. Regarding that South East stairwell I mean I, guess my response to that is I would like to be I would like our community, be to be included in those discussions instead of just being updated on them, and if we could I mean, it seems to me like the easiest, and most like common sense thing to do. Is that if we're talking about increasing accessibility and capacity that we do all this construction at one time, and so it makes no sense to me to like continue to go move forward with this project, but not widen those stairs at the same time. If that makes, if I'm making sense here so I guess, I would like to know whatever we can do to encourage that. The widening of that staircase I understand the engineering issues with the elevator, but if we can do more to push for the widening of that staircase, it seems like if we're going to, if we're going to commit to accessibility, we should just we should commit to accessibility and make sure that all these entrances are, you know as accessible as possible and can take as much capacity as possible. Okay, next now do you have a public person from the public who's raised their hand? Do you want to sure who who's that dead, then Rita, Saulfield, Rita you'll, get a message at the bottom of your screen. Please unroot on Rita yeah, it's not Ria, it's Charles Soutfeld, but Charles, okay, so, okay, Charles! No, the stairway, that's being relocated on the south! Sorry on the northeast corner. Where is that located in relationship to the garage that opens up on 68th street sure it is before the garage it's between the garage and the and Lexington Avenue, so we'll not obstruct the? No, it won't obstruct the entrance to the garage. No, can you tell me approximately how many feet it is away from the curb cut I would say about eight to ten feet away. Okay, thank you. Will any other public hands? No, not at this time? Okay, why don't we go to Valerie Mason in a new Valerie? Thank you very much a couple of questions number. When we're looking at this new rendition and plan b of the elevator, it looks like where does that elevator open onto the sidewalk? Is it between the stairwell in the elevator or is it right off the corner? No, it's between the stairwell and elevator. Well. Can I ask you about that. Isn't that going to be hard to navigate if you're in a wheelchair, wouldn't it be easier to be able to access that right off the crosswalk, no I? We believe that this is better because it's away from the crowd crossing the street there's enough space between the elevator and the stairway about I would say 12 feet. So it's a lot of space in between and okay who's going to be responsible. Are you going to use a snowmelt system when you do this so that we don't have to if people are going to be in wheelchairs and trying to get into the subway that they're going to have, they were not going to have to rely on somebody coming out and cleaning in between those that area between the stairwell and the elevator there transit, usually Marcus. Do you want to answer this I think I, don't believe in, and the design team can tell me for more I, don't believe we're using a snowmelt operation for this. We will handle this elevator as we handle all elevators throughout the system, meaning someone I hope, not sure it's clean sorry I had to you gave me that softball Marcus I had to take that. That's the only thing I haven't gotten yet about snow or preventing access to an elevator. Well, I asked for the snowmelt when we're doing the 72nd street entrances on Second, Avenue, Subway and I think you know I. It's been okay, but I. Just think when we're talking about you know only one elevator and we're you know in this project. At this point it's something to consider. The second thing is in terms of I, think I understand what you're saying about the crosswalk I. Just wonder what the turnaround radius is between coming out of that elevator and then the back up to the stairwell and then my other question is how why is that I understand you're going to build out into the street, but to the gentleman's point about the garage? Aren't you going to have a lot of people that may be coming out and walking into a car? That's turning into a garage I mean there's a lot of people that come out of that station and you know the dispersing onto the corner, with everybody being able to go in different directions and there's always a log jam there. I'm just wondering about you you're having a face going east and that sidewalk is not that wide and I. Don't think it's even going to be that much wider with you even expanding the sidewalk. So I'm wondering about crowd there. We do have safe distance between the stair and the garage as I mentioned about 10 feet. Well, 10 feet isn't really a lot of feet when you measure how many people come out of that stairwell. Even now. It's not that wide Jeremy Parnez Jeremy. Do you want to do you have any comment on that Jeremy pointers if you could or I'm unmuting the thing the one thing to consider is that, with the addition of the two new northern stairs, one in the Imperial House and one on the southeast southwest corner of 69th and lex, those are going to divert a lot of people who currently use this stair away from this stair. So there will be people using the stair, definitely, but the hope and intent is that they will be pulled away. Many people will be pulled away to the new entrances. Okay, I have just two more questions on the northwest stairwell. How wide? How much you didn't say anything about widening the sidewalk there are you widening this air because again it's a really narrow sidewalk and if you're crossing there you're there's always a smash of people coming up and then trying to go through using the sidewalk. The North West here is not stair. S3 on the northwest corner is not being widened. It's the same width and the sidewalk is not being widened. It's unplugged, okay, so I, don't understand the gentleman's point that the people are going to be dispersed because it wouldn't be any more people that could go through that stairwell. No, we are talking about the new stair on 69th street and the Imperial House there. So people from the platform can exit on the 69th street and through a mid block exit. So that's why the passenger like count on this chair with a little less all right. This is about money when this project was first proposed in 2012, it was costing what and so how much is it going to cost now, and is this project really provided for in the cap budget coming forward? Yes, it's provided in the current capital plan and I'll have to get back to you on it on exact costs and the differential between what it was going to cost eight years ago and how much it's going to cost us now. No problem, I'm sure it'll be less thanks. Very much thanks! Okay, Jordan woke is next: can we unmute Jordan, hi I, think I have four items. The first is I think that there's an elevator at the South West corner of 68th street and Lexington Avenue, which provides access from street level to the mezzanine. Please correct me: if I'm wrong, no there's no elevator at the South West corner. Are you absolutely certain that it's not in the hunter building? Okay, if you say there is no elevator there, then that's fine I've seen one but I don't know. Maybe it goes into the hunter's building, but we don't have one okay, but it is access from street level to mezzanine number. Two, a comment was made that the new elevator will be something like pass through, and my understanding is that if you enter with a wheelchair to get out, you do not need to back out or you do not need to turn around. That's part of the idea of the elevator on the northeast corner. Is that accurate? Yes, okay, now going to s6, where we are now? If I'm entering and I get to the bottom of the stairs, is there a toll that is there a fair barrier there? Yes and can I then go? Can I get to the southbound side by let's say turning left and going back? Can you go to the platform level plan, the platform level plants? Okay, so see the stairs you're coming down, yeah and then they're fair array, and then you go down to the platform level. Where is the mezzanine there? This is the mezzanine. When you come down, one slide down, you'll have a mezzanine and then you take another stair down to the platform, so it provides access only to the northbound to and from the northbound. Is that correct? That's right and then there is a mezzanine. But apparently this is not going to connect to the existing mezzanine pity. A similar question on the elevator on the southwest corner of 69th street I gather there is a fair barrier somewhere, possibly on a mezzanine. Yes, there's no elevator, there's a stair and then there's a fair barrier and then it and then another flight of stairs take you down to the platform level. Okay. So if you arrive southbound and you want to come up inside the imperial building, you have to go to the mezzanine at 68th street. Come upstairs. Go across go down to the platform on the northbound and then climb up. It would be a little bit awkward to do that. I didn't get your question. Can you please repeat? So if you come on the southbound and you want to use the imperial building, what you need to do is go to the south end of the southbound platform climb up to the mezzanine, possibly P3, or something like that. Then you can cross from there to P4, go downstairs to the northbound lane and then climb all the way up at p5. That's the route one would have to take. Is that accurate? Yes, I can't imagine anyone wanting to do that. You can just exit the station at 68th street and just walk half a block to the location, okay and the same thing for 69th street. If you came on the northbound, there's no reason you'd want to get to the 69th street stairs. Okay! Those are my questions. Thank you very much. Thank you! Jordan Peter, Borock or other public member or Peter Un, unmute Peter, please great thanks! So much I, just some of you know. I've talked for my day job, I'm gonna turn actually represent MTA real estate, I'm in a lot of development projects like this, so I'm not particularly working on this one but I do know this. One is particularly complicated and I think the MTA is actually doing a great job, especially I, know I. Think dealing with CUNY has been difficult, so I, just obviously asking some good questions. I. Think the MTA team here that's here today and the other folks in the real estate department, doing a great job, so I just wanted to kind of acknowledge that this is not an easy project. So that's it! Thank you Marco Tamayo. Can we unmute Marco? Oh thank you first I have to say thank you so much for the presentation. I think it's a good idea to have an entrance. An extra interest to the software I think and the mid block also is a very good idea, and the proposal that you did before- and it was approved I think, is an excellent idea. I, don't know where you're coming from they saying that there is a structural damage. Do you have a good structural engineer, make a good assessment of that, because I don't think a new year present a solution. I know that it was at the entrance by the way so I was coming in and out and the stairs on whether they propose they. The elevator are wider. Already it's good and never have a problem. So my concern is you want to prefer to put this bulky ugly glass outside rather to put inside of the premises and I think it makes more sense. If you put this bulky next to the entrance stairs well, usually, probably I, should you the people from the MTA? They should visit all these projects that you have like. That is collection of garbage, and this is people urinate outside. So it's no very smart idea to put it on the sidewalk and that sidewalk Valerie she's right. This is a narrow sidewalk. So you wanted to strangulate the pedestrian circulation from this technical point of view for the street escape. It makes no sense at all and I think that your original proposal inside of the Hunter college premises, it makes a lot of sense and if you find a challenge of the structural part, please hire and spend more money but hire a proper instructor and engineer to give a solution. There are plenty new Ucd capable to do this kind of job. Thank you, sir. It's not just a structural challenge, it's also managing to discuss and do this in a way that's suitable to both the MTA and which is a whole different ballgame. We will continue to update you on the stair widening on that corner, but this is definitely something that will get this project moving, but the. But to put the I understand the point I understand later it is benefit for the students is very few for them. If the most people that benefit in that part is the students and CUNY can object, something that is benefit for them. On the contrary, it should upload, it should say: look you welcome to this place and you make nicer and I think your proposal that you did before I upload that, but, while you're coming with these changes, I think is wrong. Thank you mark. Thank you. Marco Felice Farber is next. Can we unmute Felice thanks just a couple of questions, so the you're building an entirely new boss, bulb or bump out to fit this in so the as I understand it. The amount of pedestrian space remains unchanged from what it is now. Is that correct on the sidewalk of 68th street, the north sidewalk? Yes, it would actually increase a little bit relative to what you what's currently there and let's see if I can get to the slide. Just to help to illustrate that point, so the existing condition is here. We see this the street side, this exit onto Lexington Avenue here what was originally proposed was to widen that which is to offset it move it further east, with the with widening of the sidewalk by constructing that curb bump out, there's actually going to be a little bit more sidewalk for pedestrians to walk on this side of the street and I. I'm not familiar with what the parking regulations are right over there, so how many parking spaces are removed so that this area right here this parking lane is right now regulated, so that it's only authorized parking for police department vehicles. We estimate that three to four of those parking spaces would be taken by this, but our analysis shows that there are other locations for the police department to park their vehicle in the general vicinity and they can park wherever they want. That's true, and when you take the elevator down, is there currently a new a fair barrier over there? Or will you have to construct a new fair barrier by where the elevator lands? You no it'll be the existing fair barrier, which is meant to go into the battery yeah it'll go to the through the existing fair barrier and then take the platform mezzanine to platform elevator to go down to the platform level. Okay, so you're, not you don't have to walk for or and be in a wheelchair to go from one end of the platform to the other, to get to a fair barrier. Okay and then my final question, so the Mta's eye on the future now lists this project at over 50 million dollars. So it's a substantial design build project. The Mt's fiscal situation has been well documented in the newspaper with the capital program currently on hold is June 2021 a realistic time period. Do you see other issues in moving this forward to construction within that time frame? No, we don't because this is part of the previous capital plan. The capital plan that's on hold is the 2025 I believe, okay, yeah, so I thought most of the capital projects weren't moving forward, but this so this is in the last capital plan. Yes, okay, thank you! Michelle Birnbaum is next. Can we unmute Michelle? Thank you. This was a very good presentation, easy to understand so I. Thank you for that three points on the 68th street going east that is across town bus street. As you well know, the bump out will be just opposite: the bus stop on the southeast corner and on that street, traditionally east of the bus stop. It is traditionally lined with fruit vendors. They themselves are on the sidewalk, but their inventory trucks are more often than not parked right near their stand in the street, given that street will now be even more narrow because of the bump out. I'm just asking that you alert you know the precinct they're only on 68th street, but they're, really not in the habit of enforcing those kind of laws, but with this I really think that the alert should come from you rather than the public complaining about it, because it's going to be very important to keep that street free. There's no parking on that south side, but it's going to be very important to keep that lane open, because it's a bus lane cars will be trying to pass the stop bus and, of course the street is narrower. So that's one thing I ask that you actually notify them they're sick of hearing from us. The second thing is, and then I have three things. The second thing is: will there be any disruption in train service during all this construction? Richard? Do you want to answer that question so I wouldn't anticipate that there would be any significant train disruption during construction, but I'm sure that at some points as we can see, the original project did include some work at the platform level, making improvements to the platform edges and things of that nature. Typically, that work is done off hours, nights, weekends that thing if that work did require there to be some modification to the service that would be advertised well in advance of when that would be when that would be required. So at this moment you don't necessarily anticipate disruption, but we could have disruption. Okay, that's fair! Okay. The third thing is: if you go back to the west side of 69th and lex, if you have the slide, that shows that it would be. Would it have been possible, or did you look into putting that staircase inside the Thomas, Hunter Hall, Building and Danny? Did we discuss that I think no? That was never discussed. That was never requested either. Well, I'd like to request. It just seems to me that if you could do that because 69th west of Lexington, there are also residences, you know and you're right across the street, from residential building I can't totally visualize the street, but I'm pretty sure that going west there are residential buildings there and it would really be to are you constructing that bump out specifically for those new widened stairs? Yes, so wouldn't it be better to put that staircase inside the building not have to have the bump out which Michelle I can just say right off the top that you know negotiating with Cooney has been an interesting prospect from the beginning, but putting it putting a subway entrance inside of a historical building is a totally different, ballgame and I. Think that people at this stage would like to see an ADA project happen, and we will absolutely I will take it back and make it part of our discussion, but I, don't think that that's really feasible so not feasible, because it's a historic building or because Cuny's so difficult, because that shouldn't be a case of the squeaky wheel. Getting the grease. You know, there's a whole neighborhood of stakeholders, both residential and commercial, and just because they can't make as loud a noise as this institution. Really that shouldn't be the reason for the deterrent. If you had structural issues, if the historic you know breaking the facade of a historic building, I would be very sensitive to that because that's of you know preserving our historic buildings are of tremendous import to me, but you know it shouldn't be because Cuny's hard to deal with, let's put it that way. So if nobody's looked at it, I would just ask that you do, and if in your next update to us, you can give us an answer. Tell us about the responses. True, okay, terrific thank you, Michelle Craig! It will be difficult for to modify a historic landmark building and it's very old structurally also. It will be very difficult. I can say that yeah, okay, we'll get back Craig I know you wanted to say something Craig, yes, I had two things. One first I just wanted to thank the whole New York City transit team for a great presentation. That's very clear and easy to understand. My two questions. Going back to the bump out on 68th street I was actually going to suggest if it hasn't been considered as long as it would be otherwise feasible to move the bus stop to the southeast southwest corner. Just because this way we can hopefully avoid some of the potential congestion or issues with. If there's, especially if there's a bus park, I know, there's more going to be more space on the other side and there's a bus pad already in place at the current stop. I would hope that we can consider moving it to hopefully ease some of the congestion issues that may take place. That was I'm sorry that was considering. We've been working with D.O.T and I. Don't think that the D.O.T I won't speak for them, but I don't believe that was their preferred location, turning traffic and things, but it probably will end up there during for a period of time, temporary relocation and we'll take a look at what's going on there, but that's the location of that bus. Stop is something that can be considered along the way, but I don't think that was a preferable location for the bus, stop as it relates to D.O.T, but we will constantly pay attention to that. Yeah I can understand that from a turning lane perspective, but I do have concerns about how it's going to play out on the east side of 68th street and then the other question I had was just going back to the new stair stairs. Well, I was wondering just how wide the stairwells are and how many turn styles are going to be I. If I understand the turn styles, the fair barriers are going to be at platform level, and I'm just wondering how many there will be, how why they are and how it's going to accommodate crowds that are exiting and entering at the same time, Jeremy the turnstile app the new turnstiles on 69th street there'll be five of them and the turnstile. Can you go to the slides where it shows? Is this not this one, the platform level? Yes, no, this one yeah the platform level you'll also see yeah. So you can see there are the turn styles here. The turnstiles will either match the capacity of the stairs or on the uptown platform, will slightly exceed the capacity of the stairs all right, very good. All right. Thank you very much. Lynn strong Shinozaki is next. Can we unmute Lin, then you just have to confirm it on your screen. There you go. Thank you I again want to thank the MTA for what I thought was a really clear, concise presentation, greatly appreciated, I appreciate living on Roosevelt Island. How long some of these projects take so I appreciate that we're moving this forward and one of what I'd like to talk about? Are the issues relevant to the Hunter, College and I? Don't know how many of the other people here on this call actually used that stairway and used that entrance to the subway back in the day to the from Hunter College, and what I can speak to is that prior to 9:11 there was pretty ready access and Hunter College was pretty open after 9:11 and some other serious issues about breaking and entering into the college. They got very challenging about letting outside people use that entrance and I know that the Hunter College has made it extremely difficult. More recently t I, don't I think my understanding is that they had actually closed that entrance and even their students were having to go outside of the school and so I know for them. It's a real safety issue. The acts having access into the school and around the school and I know no. One has spoken to that point at to date about some of the issues with hunter College, but I do know. That was a problem in the past and having been somebody that had small children at one time that really appreciated having the access inside Hunter college I do understand the difficulties that it creates for the school with having access within the school to the public. So I just wanted to talk on that point and that I'm just really pleased to see that they are going to have an ADA elevator available after years of wishing, that could happen at that site. Thanks so much sure and a couple people haven't talked: have the Rita Popper next. Can we have unmute Rita hi I just have a question after going through the Second Avenue Subway construction, what happens on 68th street when you have construction equipment? Is there any plans for reroute re-routing the bus, the crosstown bus? So during construction there will be a minimum of one lane on 68th street preserved to through traffic. There are no plans at this time to reroute the crosstown bus on 68th street. Thank you. Okay and now our board Chair Elita Camp, has your hand up, and can we unmute thanks? Chuck I just wanted to ask, and I'm really sorry, if I miss this, why you are widening the stairs on 69th street, because I was thinking about what Michelle had said and if you don't use those stairs, then there's no issue because they're already, if I count correctly four staircases, which is all that we have on 86th street, which is also an express stop. So again, if I missed it just say: I missed it and I'll go back and listen to the tape. No worries just to clarify your question was you was your question pertaining to the 65 entrance here? Yes, so this is a new entrance, it's unchanged from what was proposed in 2016. So it's the same size and configuration as what was it was originally proposed back in 2016. These there's no design change associated with that right. But why do you feel that that's I guess I'm just responding to Michelle asking you to put it in the building which I could see why you wouldn't and agree and by the way? Thank you for a very clear detailed presentation. I was just wondering if that's even necessary at all, but you've already made that decision from a few years ago so never mind and thank you again for the quality of the presentation is: does Jeremy Parnish from city transit? Does he did he want to say something? I don't know if he I saw his hand up yeah my virtual hand and real hand were both up. I mean I, think the question was basically covered. It doesn't get to the exact points. A couple of people have made in terms of street side versus inside the building, but the point one of the points of putting additional stairs new stairs towards the north end of the station was to spread the load to alleviate some of the load, that's currently at 68th street, and to take pressure off of those stairs there. Okay, thank you. Jeremy I want to move on now. I know there were a couple of people who had spoken before who still wanted to speak, but I think we've been at this for over an hour and I'd like to move on. Now to our second item and I appreciate, we appreciate the presentation from the New York City transit folks, as others have said, it was very clear and I know it's been on for a long time and we're hoping to see this project come to fruition on the time limit that is in your chart. So thank you. Sir have a great evening. Everyone. Thank you very much. Our second item is it was the Roosevelt Island Bridge and bike safety issues, and this is a joint item with the Roosevelt Island Committee and we're happy to have Lynn strong Shinozaki here. The I believe the one of the chairs of the Roosevelt Island, Committee and Lynn brought this to our attention and it's an important issue, and then why don't you go? Why don't you go and please on Unmute Lynn and why don't you go and explain the situation, as you explained it to us so as clearly and concisely, as I? Can the Roosevelt Island Bridge is a metal bridge that there's a walkway on the bridge, but the bike path itself is on a metal open metal surface and it when wet or it can be even on not wet a very slippery surface for people who are biking on it and we identified it as an issue several years ago and when we started addressing it. What we found was that the Roosevelt Island Operating corporation were not the ones that oversee the bridge. It's I believe it's the D.O.T, I'm. If anybody knows better, they can clarify this for me, but it was out of the purview of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, and they started some conversations and unfortunately, some other things took priority. And what really took priority was that at one point they tried to open the bridge and it got stuck, and the bridge is a critical transportation piece, particularly when they need to shut the city waterways down particularly the side of the East River, that's the closest to the east side of Manhattan, and so what they do is they open the lane and they open the Roosevelt Island Bridge for boat traffic. So it was super critical that we had a functioning moving and it's a bridge that raises up, and so the priority then became to fix and make sure that part of the bridge was running and running well. And so it's my understanding that is now and we've also started some just general conversations with the Roosevelt Island operating corporation in terms of doing a couple separate things that have to do with bikes. One is a bike ramp that comes down separate, then the street helix and then a bike path. That's on the West side of Roosevelt, Island or I should say I'm sorry on the east side of Roosevelt Island and then potentially a fully encompassing bike passageway throughout the entire island. One of the things that we ran into a problem when we were investigating that is currently beneath where the espionage or the walkway are currently on the west side of the island is steam. Tunnels that create a problem with converting that directly into bike paths, and so the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation is trying to vet out the situation of the steam tunnels, because currently they can't have something built on top of them, because they're not sound, and so in part of building the structure around the island to be more sound. They have to do that first before they can address the bike lane issues and some of these other things, but we can still get the bridge fixed in the meantime and I know that they're looking into that currently I, don't know is Carl is Colleen Chatter Goon here, I, don't know if she, oh yes, I see her Colleen, hey, chuck, it's Colleen, so I mean I will have to confirm with our bridges division. If we maintain that bridge, it's likely. We probably do that. So let me find out I mean I. This is new to me in terms of you know, issues safety, issues with the you know the bike. Pat you know the bike path in that area, so I mean I. Think you know this is something that I will raise with borough. Commissioner pinkard tomorrow in our conference, call and see you know what. If we've looked at this in the past, and I'm not sure if we have to be honest with you, okay, we should yeah. We should that's good of you to do that. Colleen and we'll see. I, don't know Lynn whether you want it well, we'll have some further discussion and I saw that there was a member of the public I guess who had his hand up I think it was Mr Quickler who had his hand up on this. Yes, thank you very much Chuck, I'm here, because I'm trying to get as much support as we can to get this surface covered I call it an industrial cheese crater. When you ride over the surface on a bike, it feels like you're being shaken to bits and your bike's going to fall apart. It kind of makes dramatic, I'm sure, but when you drive over this, you get a very big rumble and when you ride over it, it's very bad for bikes. It can be very dangerous. There are signs up there saying that it's very slippery when wet and the reason is very simple: it's not just a simple flat surface. It's a jagged surface to the bridge! That's why cars rumble and that's why, when you ride a bike on it feels very unstable. I've fallen over twice doing it. I moved into Roosevelt Island back in July. I. Have been riding across the bridge for many years before that, but since I've been here, I've been talking to a lot of people and trying to get a lot of support to get this fixed I, don't think it's very hard to get fixed. I'm not a structural engineer, I'm not a DOT person, but I wanted to update you on where we've got to with the people that we've spoken to and before I. Do that, first of all, a lot of people who ride bikes don't actually ride their bike across that bridge. They walk it on the walkway. It's one of those stupid things where we have great cycling in Roosevelt, Island, great bike paths in Queens across there. But then you have to walk between one and the other, it's kind of stupid and since July I've been campaigning a lot getting a lot of people to support this I. Don't want to speak out of turn here, but I had very positive comments from the offices of both council members, chaos and Van Bramer. When we asked them to support this, when all the work was being done around getting their support for the Queensbridge, southbound or south side bike lane, they also apparently agreed I, don't want to put words into their mouths. I've been speaking to somebody in the last few weeks at the queen's Department of Transport, I'm not going to use his name on this call now, because it's not fair to him, but the last thing he said to me was that right now this is further along than it was even two or three months ago. So apparently, some people there in the queen's D.O.T are paying attention to this. I'm very grateful for that. I'm not an expert here far from it, but it doesn't look like it's an expensive thing or a hard thing to get done for those of you who live nearby. If you go to the sidewalk on that bridge, the sidewalks covered by a very thin surface on the metal looks like half an inch of something which basically is laid down piece by piece and again, not being an expert I can't for the life of me. Imagine why something as simple as that can't be done not for the whole metal surface, where the cars go just for the two parts where the bicycles are I know that in D.O.T language, it's not an official bike lane and there's some bureaucratic issues around that it's just because there were some bollards put up to make some safe that space safe for people there you go so those bollards are put up there, so we can be safe riding. If you can see the surface, you may get a sense that it's not very much like a grill cover to a sewage train which is flattened and you wouldn't get a bump in it. You might be able to see that it's very jagged, this edge and people don't like riding across it. It's awful so where we are is I, don't think it should be expensive. It's only about 50 yards or something on each side. So I'm hoping you guys could support us in this I think we have support from the politicians, elected officials I. Think there's some good will of the DOT I just want to get this over the finishing line before winter would be great I doubt it, but it would be great. So thank you for letting me talk. This is New York, City, Paul, so we'll and we'll see it we'll see. If we can be helpful, I'm sure I saw that there were a couple. I saw that there were others who are there any other members of the public. We have some board members who want to speak. Did you see any? Will I didn't see any no Colleen? It's Colleen, I'm going to put my email in the chat so that Paul can send me. Those slides, I, think that would be helpful. Okay, good! Thank you. So much Peter Borack had his hand up Peter. Why don't we unmute Peter yeah thanks so much Paul for presenting this to us. I think this is a great idea and I would make a motion in support of this. I would just note that in you know, Billy's not here today, I, don't think, but in the past couple meet, oh hey, Billy we've been this committee. Has been championing, excuse me helping to create traveling over the 59 main street bridge touch bridge much easier for cyclists, and so it doesn't quite make sense if you're trying to go from the Upper East side to road island and now we're going to make it easier to cross into Queens from the 59th street bridge, but it's still very difficult to then get that final leg into Roosevelt Island. Because of this issue, these greats and I've run over these greats before it's extremely uncomfortable. So I think this is a great idea. It doesn't seem that expensive and I would I make a motion in support of this all right, we'll get to that Peter Billy Freeland is next, so why don't we unmute Billy speaking of the devil, hello I am here, I am so I'll, be brief, I mean I, just I think it's maybe been said, but in case it wasn't. My understanding of the latest from council member Kayla's office is that D.O.T has said they're looking into what type of bike friendly materials are needed for this metal grill section of the bridge and so I think there's definitely interest from the council member and from D.O.T to do something here so I. My point is also now kind of you know moot because Peter made it but I was going to say I do think we should, as a committee, pass a resolution in support of both funding. You know this type of effort and asking DOT to try to get it done as soon as possible. This is you know not an easy ride. I've written it before it is. It feels very treacherous and unsafe and I think at a time that we're trying to encourage people to take alternative modes of transportation. It's particularly important and at a time when you know just to get back and forth from the island, it's not always so easy I think we should be trying to improve that one bridge that does connect road island to the Queens. So just want to echo what Peter said and say we should probably take up a resolution if there's an appetite to do so, yeah I think that was the sense. Thank you, Billy Felice Farber. Can we unmute the fleece I just wanted to briefly add that I've I too have biked over that bridge and it feels very unsafe and you kind of feel, like you're right in the middle of traffic, almost even with those bollards, so anything that could be done to improve the bike. Safety of this would be a great thing to do. Okay, Peter, you wanted to make a motion. So what? If you will you want to raise your hand we'll just and so Peter's made a motion? Is there a second to that motion to support this Marco? Did you want to speak, or did you want to Billy Freeland is seconding it and do we have some people I just want to take the motion. Okay. Second, the motion- okay and I- saw Rebecca too, so that's seconded any other. Anyone else want to speak on this motion at this point. Okay, so what we'll do is we'll assume that everyone on the committee- and we have everybody's name I- think here is for it if you're, if you are against it or you want to abstain, just raise your hand and we'll call on you. Yeah can I just make read the list and make sure that I sure, yes, absolutely Craig, make sure you got everybody here. There's a lot of people here, yeah so I see myself, you chuck Laurie Elita, Barry, Cause, Police, Jack, Jordan, Lowell, Lynn, Marco, Michelle, Peter, Rebecca, Stangler, Rebecca, Lamorte, Rita, Trisha, Valerie and Billy. Yes and Michelle. You have Michelle right, I did get one and I did get Michelle, okay, yeah and Rita. Oh yes, I do have Rita. Okay, we have a yeah. We have a quite a crowd. Okay, so seeing no hands raised, so the motion passes unanimously and then we thank you for bringing it before us and it'll be coming up at the meeting in a couple weeks. I really appreciate your time and for you guys putting this into your schedule. Thank you. So much greatly appreciated. Hopefully we can get something done and Colleen's going to talk to Mr Pinkar. Okay, thank you, Colleen. The next issue is a request. Yeah go ahead, Craig, sorry, I, don't know if you saw the message but Valerie had on the par item regarding 68th street, possibly wants to propose a resolution and we, oh okay. You know if we want to give her a chance to just speak sure. No, if she wants to do that, we could we can go back and do a resolution. I'm sorry I didn't realize that so I just want to say some stuff. Do we have well I guess, there's a someone who I want to speak on this, a Paula Bernstein. We normally we it's been done and we normally don't go back. But if Paula Bernstein wanted to say something on this, then why don't we Un Mute Paula just for a minute hi, I'm a representative of Chef David Burke, but I'm not sure I'm on the right topic at this moment we're talking about the bike lane on 62nd Street. No, that's not the right topic! Sorry! Okay, we'll wait! If you want to do that, that'll be old business or something you know, okay, so go back to salary and yeah. Let me go back to Valerie yeah. Sorry, we missed you Valerie before I didn't realize you had it. If you wanna, why don't we unmute Valerie? She has some wants to go back on her I guess our previous item. If she wants to offer a resolution well, I just after everyone was speaking, I just thought that there was a consensus that perhaps I mean it was a great presentation and what I was thinking was. Perhaps we might either do a letter or a resolution to ask CUNY to be a little bit more responsive to the requests of the MTA I mean Trisha mentioned it, and other people did as well, but either I don't know what the group, if a letter is better or a resolution, and then I wasn't sure. Marcus isn't here anymore, whether this is CUNY buildings or is it Hunter College itself that we should just say that the community board? This is a great project. We want to get it done as in the best way possible, and we would like to preserve as much of the sidewalk as possible and if cue and since a large majority of the people that are going to be coming out of the station are going to be utilizing the college. We would hope that you know CUNY would be. You know interested in working with the New York City Transit Authority. So that was really what I was going to propose. So Valerie can I suggest that I'd like not to do that here after they've gone from, you know, New York, City transit, and maybe we can. We could put them on notice and when we come to the full board, you know we can. Then you know if you want to. If you want to do that, I would perfectly happy to. You know recognize you to do something like that when we get to that okay, we have. We can take that up at the full board, because I'd like to have them be here to comment on that because it has to do with negotiations with CUNY and stuff like that and I. Don't know whether so thanks okay, my bad I, should have put something in thanks. Chuck I should have put something earlier in the chat that said that that's it right, yeah right! That's! Okay! That's all right! Me too! Do we have any we I, don't know what these comments are. We have Peter Bark and Michelle Birnbaum I, don't know if there we've I, don't want to go back and discuss things that we've already discussed, because we have you know we have another item that we need to take up. First is so what is what do we have here? Michelle? Why? Don't we mute Michelle I'll just be extremely brief, because okay, all right go ahead. Peter I'll just be extremely brief, so especially because I'm not on the full board, so I can just speak to you know. I really do this for a living, I negotiate. These deals for the MTA with property owners. It is extremely difficult and what I would say is that you know CUNY is not just another stakeholder here, it's their building, and so what the MTA has to do is to basically call a building owner and say we want to build something in your building and there are some inherent rights through some easement agreements that exist, but the right to rebuild and to change. What that looks like is extremely difficult and the Mtca always has the power of eminent domain. That's extremely complicated, extremely difficult, and so you know I would just say in reality. You know, although it might make sense from our perspective, and it would be best for the Mta's perspective to put this in that hall. That's in reality. It's just not it's not going to happen. Okay, thanks! It's just not so, and that's just for everyone. Yeah all right now, I appreciate that perspective. Peter Michelle, a new Michelle short comment here and then yeah thanks, chuck, yeah I as much as I raise the issue. I, don't think that it's really appropriate for us to even intervene here. I wouldn't want to see a resolution and I. Don't think I'd like to see it discussed at the full board. I think this is something that belongs at the committee level and they won't necessarily representatives won't be at the full board either so to open this up to a full board discussion. When we really haven't had a consensus in this committee, I, don't think that would be a good idea, they're going to come back to us so with updates. So let's try to get those updates more often- and you know- and maybe continue to raise the issue with them then and then also at that time. Hopefully, we'll have answers to our questions, because, while he didn't think that was a feasible thing to do on the west side of 69th, he did say that he'd bring the comments back. So I would suggest that before we take any action, letter or resolution that we wait and hear what the response was we'll have an opportunity. The project isn't even starting until June 21, so I don't think we should rush into a discussion or a decision here. Okay, I, don't know if Valerie, you know how Valerie feels about that. But that makes some sense to me certainly, but we can so we'll. Why don't we see? What's right, because actually we don't when I think about we don't really have a resolution coming out on that. That's going to be discussed at the full board. So normally we wouldn't have any discussion at the full board, but we'll you know we'll clarify that. So thank you. Michelle I appreciate that. Okay item number three, and this is a request for a temporary co-naming of second avenue between 81st and 82nd, as Derry Rowe and I just want to say that normally this committee and this board really doesn't entertain requests for street renaming generally. This is a temporary one, so we said all right, we'll put it on we'll put it on the agenda, but there are a lot of issues and Craig and I. You know discuss this a little bit because there are a lot of issues that really are involved here and there, and you know if it's dairy row are there other people involved, but we wanted to have a discussion and I. Don't know if there's anyone here who wants to you know from the public who have suggested this I know there was a gentleman Mr Berman who had suggested this and I. Don't know if he's here and wants to speak to it, yes and he's here, okay, and why don't we? So why don't we have him talk first and then we'll see if there's any other members of the public and I know they're members of the board? Who may want to speak on this too. So why don't we unmute Mr Berman to start with, so he can make a presentation here of this of his thoughts. This is Jeremy Berman, yes, correct hi, my name is Jeremy Berman I live in the area, so dairy road was an idea I pitched internally within the four freedoms. Democratic club is just a fun idea of a way to draw publicity and bring attention to the district, especially going into the pandemic winter. When small businesses are struggling. We have this one block, which bizarrely has six different places on one block selling. You know frozen dairy or gelato or things of that sort. So it could be just a fun kind of dumb way to drum up publicity. Somehow three different news articles were released about this idea, including one in post and in the post article. The reporter seems to have found out or reported that the first step in any renaming would be going to community board eight, which I had no sense of going into this. So I think it could be a fun thing. Just a temporary co-naming, you know have a little opening ceremony, maybe get a few more news. Articles get some people in the area. The ice cream gelato on the block is good, but I, don't know what the procedure is and I don't know. If that's something that community board 8 does at all, and if it's not something community Board 8 does that's totally fine too, and there might be some other way to jump up publicity without an official co-naming. So I'm just interested to see what the procedure is and if there's any appetite within the community board for doing anything about this well I know: there's appetite for soft ice cream and gelato, but I don't know about the renaming. So we'll have to do. Are there any other members of the public that want to speak on this issue before we get to the board? Do you see any? Will any public I don't, but just to remind everybody if you would like to speak about this open up the participants box at the bottom of your screen, click the raise hand button and if you're on the phone, it's star 9 to raise your hand so I do see one other member of the public has raised their hand, Patrick Baublin, Babalin, okay, Mr, Patrick Bobilen. Why don't we unmute him? So he can talk on this. Hey it's Patrick Bobelen, no points against anyone. I just wanted to clarify I read somewhere that it would I, don't know. I didn't take the time to look everybody up, but are they mostly chains because I would be like not too keen on like giving publicity to just a bunch of chains rather than like local businesses, but that was just like a little needling issue. That's you know, maybe just me well, maybe Jeremy, maybe you know who's in who they are I, don't I haven't yeah that is kind of the problem. Patrick is not wrong. It is mostly chains. The one key really so 80s appears to be a sole place. That is not part of a chain and also the Anita Del Mama gelato, which is probably the marquee and cutesiest shop there, which would vibe the best with the old timey dairy road branding. It is the only location in the United States, but it began as a chain in Tel Aviv Israel. This is their first United States location and it probably is going to be a chain. So if that was the basis for blocking this, I can't say that's a terrible reason to do so. Okay and Anita Gelato has their production facility go and also has a location in Australia or possible, multiple, possibly multiple locations in Australia. Well, you have to really like it if you're going to go to Australia, though so, okay, so anything any anyone from the public or is that it well I didn't see anyone else, I, don't think, that's it so far! Okay, so why don't we Elita Camp? Our board chair, wanted to be recognized on this, so can we unmute delete it? Thank you. Chuck I had asked if you would consider this, because the idea of a district, something that might lure people to the Upper East side, was appealing and I believe that there might be elected official support as well, just on the basis of some temporary, very temporary even a day, recognition that it's worthy of a name. However, I do think that it should go all the way up to 88th street and include Ues, which is not a chain and whose Propriet proprietor Courtney I'm really bad at names, has been a very avid supporter of Upper East side, small businesses, the community board, the Small, Business Committee and is just I think we're very lucky to have her in the neighborhood. So row is certainly better than whey. It's expansive I think on First Avenue. There are a couple of small chains, I have to say: I am interested or I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of chains. I think maybe for now for the pandemic, it's outweighed by the idea of bringing people to small businesses and having a reason that people could go up and traipse around and visit various places thanks so much chuck for and Craig for. Looking into this and considering it is something that's very novel. I wish I could think of a pun, but I really can't so it's a sure bit that you'll take do because it make due consideration. But that was a terrible pun. I didn't hear: Craig was all muffled, but it says something that got a giggle out of chuck. So that's good enough for me. Okay, let's see next is Michelle Birnbaum. Can we unmute Michelle yeah I? This idea I mean it's very: it's cute! It's charming! It's fun! It's all those things, but I think we can all imagine the slippery slope for this up in the 80s on second there's one street that has about three mexican restaurants. You know you can say that you have other streets that have more than one say: indian restaurant I mean I can just see where this is going. I think there's a way for you to use that name dairy row in inviting people to go there and referring to it when you make any public comments, but I, don't think an official renaming of a street. Our committee has traditionally frowned upon that, for the reasons that I'm just talking about and I can I think we should maintain that tradition. I. Just think that a break in that would for this at this point, wouldn't be a good idea, but I do think that there's plenty of ways that you can bring crowds to any of these streets by just referring to it. Let them put signs in their windows talking about how proud they are to be part of dairy row. You know cute things like that. I'm sure they can come with it, but an official designation, I'm not so sure about that I think I would oppose that. Keep our tradition. Okay, thank you. Michelle Trisha Shimamura is next Trisha. Can we meet Trisha hi? Everybody I think that this is an opportunity to break with tradition with all due respect. I think that it is fun I think that it's exciting to me to think about supporting our small businesses in some way and just calling or not I'm sorry, I know that's a tough term, but supporting the businesses on the east side in some fun way. I agree Michelle that something that's very permanent or and I know that it's not our general way of doing things, but I wondering if Chuck and Craig you might be able to. Let us know about other ways to recognize this, and some in some lighter temporary fashion. I'd like to see the community board push ourselves out of our comfort zone a little bit and try something a little different and I like I. Think that this is fun. I know Barry's on the call, but somehow this reminds me of us breaking with tradition when we worked together to help the cat, Sanctuary and Roosevelt Island, and it was a little fun and also serious but like but I, don't know, there's something about this- that just kind of resonates with me and I think that I would be certainly willing to consider ways that we can support this. If it's not a resolution, maybe it's a letter, maybe Jeremy I kind of wonder if this is better in or at least jointly worked with our small business committee, because I think that this could be turned into some effort just to call attention to some of our businesses in the area. But I I'd like to see us consider ways that we could be supportive and kind of engage in a little bit of lighter-hearted efforts to support some local, some business owners in our community. Thank you, Trisha Barry Schneider is next Barry. Can you meet Barry Good? Thank you a couple of comments. As long as the point isn't moved yet I would like to say I'm utterly in favor of this utterly in favor of it. Thank you, ud. Okay, thank you. Barry next is Rebecca Dangore Rebecca. Can we mute Rebecca Dan Gord? We have two rebeccas here. I have two things. The first is I'd like us, maybe an explanation of what temporary means, because I do like the idea. The only reason I might be personally opposed is because these stores also have some non-dairy desserts for those of us with food allergies, but that's moot I just want to know what temporary temporarily renaming really entails. Yeah we have to I think we have to figure that out Rebecca. In fact, you know we wouldn't I, don't think. As a committee or a board we'd entertain permanent. You know double signs there, but I think temporary. The question is it, you know, is it a couple weeks? Is it you know a few months or whatever it is that I think we'd have to work that out in some kind of a resolution? Your point is a good one. The only reference I've seen to this as like doing a temporary renaming was the bill Cunningham Corner and that lasted for a week, and it was done by mayoral decision got you Craig I know you wanted to say so, because you and I have talked about this, but I think you're. You could just go ahead, I, don't think you're, muted, I, hope, I, don't think you're, muted, yeah I lost my connection for a moment. So I guess I wanted to step aside from the chair roles. So I could speak to this. Just so I. Don't confuse my roles here. So what, as Chuck mentioned, we'd speak a bunch about whether to include this and what this would mean, and I've I have some serious concerns here and I appreciate elite. It's talking about expanding it, but then what is a row and what is whatever we want to call it, because there are still going to be businesses that are going to be excluded. Everyone can see that my screen is frozen. Yes, Craig, you may want to turn off your video and it'll helps your audio. We could just hear you can hear me okay. So as I was saying, I don't know how we can not be inclusive of other businesses, more small businesses that don't exist on that block or on the street such as well, you have Cedo and on 78 you have Van Lewen on 2nd between 84th and 85th. You have swirls I, think it's called on 77th and York, and then you have places that could also be considered in the dairy realm 787 coffee. On 88, between second and third Waldo and Hutchinson Shop on 81st right off of send so when and if we're just talking about these types of businesses, you can make arguments that there are other called rows in this community. I, always reference how each how third avenue between 81St, Street and 85th street is like fitness row, but we're not calling out those businesses. So I think this is a real slippery slope, I'm all for supporting small businesses and any business, especially at this time, where we're trying to just sustain street life and street activity and economic vitality. But I don't think this is the way to do it, because I fear that it's just fundamentally unfair to anyone that may be outside realm, especially if we're trying to recognize certain businesses and that we're going to be attracting the attention to some. But not all. Thank you! Craig Michelle, I know you: why don't we unmute Michelle? She wanted to say something again on this yeah. Well that that's true what Craig says it's one of my arguments too, is that you're pulling people away from other isolated ice cream and dairy shops that are located elsewhere and you're, calling the public to dairy row? Well, that's not really fair everybody's invested in their locations, so I'm not keen, but what I have a suggestion for how you can publicize this and not make it permanent and that is have you seen light projections on the street? You know, in other words, it comes from a projector in one of the shops and on the sidewalk. You can project dairy row so if all of those businesses got together and they wanted to do that, I could see that happening. I, don't even know that particularly needs any approval from the D.O.T, because there's nothing on the sidewalk. It's just a light projection that gets turned off after business hours, but that could be a way of doing it, but just think about all the ice cream shops that are located. You know up and down all the avenues and on some side, streets and all of a sudden dairy row gets all this publicity and those people lose their. You know their business I. This is, and why are we setting ourselves up for this? You know when. Why are we setting ourselves up to be partial, we're a community board and unless we can find a way, something that helps everybody which I mean we all know we're all for that, we're all very sympathetic to the small businesses, but this is really fundamentally not fair to give them all this excess publicity, but if they wanted to do it themselves and call themselves dairy row, fine, it doesn't preclude any other shops to do it, but for the community board to sanction it and pull business away from others, I don't think that's a smart way to go. Let me ask Jordan woke, who hasn't spoken yet and then we'll get to Trisha and lead it Jordan. Can we unmute Jordan an analogous situation that I can think of? Is the lower East side, art galleries they're, all together? If you go into one of them, you may be able to get a map to all the other low ear east side galleries. So if the ice cream people or whatever it is the dairy people want to get together, then they can join and they can have a map that they give out. And anybody who wants to conjoin it but I would be voting against the idea of labeling any part of the Upper East side, specifically for dairy road. Thank you Trisha. You want to comment again. We could understand I just want to mention Jeremy I, think that a great idea is to I mean I, think that it would be helpful to hear from the businesses or to like to hear directly from them and to see if they have thoughts, even if you had I mean not to add more work to your plate, but even if you had other businesses in the area who said that yes, this would be great, because even if it's dairy road, then people are going to eat my ice cream before eat my pizza beforehand, because it's right next to San, Mateo or they're, going to go here and get my coffee afterwards because of whatever it may be helpful to and I think that generally I know I feel very compelled when I want to see other small businesses who are coming out to this I would also I mean if the feeling is that this isn't the appropriate move for this committee to do. I would still encourage you to think about talking to the small business, Committee and I know Valerie's here, but maybe there are other ways to support this. If a resolution's, not in the cards right now for this or this way, I do just I think it's I think that we should be trying to do to support economic activity on the Upper East side in some way. If this is even if this is not as I'm getting from some folks, the right way to do it. So I would encourage that. Thank you, Trisha Elita. We can. We unmute the latest thanks, chuck and well so I understand everybody's point, but that's not to say that this wouldn't be a boon for the Upper East side in general and if the businesses would support each other or even if we, if there were something in the publicity that there are other places just because there are places that are scattered around, doesn't mean that this doesn't have a benefit in itself. I think that- and this is true for there are art galleries on Madison, there's a museum mile which doesn't include what was the Whitney and then the Met Boyer and possibly the Frick. Yet people would go to them on museum mile there's a synergy and calling attention of ice cream. Gelato yogurt places in a small area brings people up to our neighborhood, so they stop for lunch. They go into a store, they take a bus, they visit something else and they're here and they're spending money and they're supporting lots of businesses. These are exceptional really challenging times for everybody and I think if there were a way of giving the publicity to the places that Craig mentioned the places on first Avenue that maybe there's a way to do something that could still bring people in entice them. We have something that no other district has thought of, and that may just bring people up here to spend their money. So that's all I'll say about that. I'm not I! Don't own shares in any of these companies. I'm not I, don't really go out for ice cream very often, but I think I, just I really like the idea of districts or special blocks and that's what New York has always had and been well known for the theater district, the Barman district, the dairy stuff down on the lower east side, the communities and it's just really worth having something. If they don't like the gelato, they could go, get yogurt that there is some kind of energy and some kind of desire to stop into lots of places, and we don't know so I'll stop with this, and thank you for listening. I'd like I. Don't is Colleen still here. Colleen did you see? Is she? Yes, I'm still here, I'm here. Thank you Colleen. So what is Dot's policy for like a temporary street naming I? Guess it was a question of you know: would they actually put up a sign for just a temporary? You know a short time period. So you know this is something that would have to be reviewed by your local city, council member. We would not just install a client and think of installing it I. Don't believe that we would do that, no, we wouldn't it goes to the same. It applies the same with the street code, naming it would have to go through the local city council, member as well your local city, Council, even a temporary one. You mean yeah I, guess one was done, I think that will was talking about one that was done for a week for and the mayor did it yes yeah and was there a sign put up there for a week? You know as what Mil will mentioned. I'm sure there was a sign, but it was a week's period and after that it was removed. Okay, there yeah I, don't know if they're, if there's any exception that will be made because I know street code naming and temporary is different. So I'm sure the guidelines are different as well, but in any event it would have to go through your city council, too yeah. Okay, as we said in the beginning, you know this committee and this board have not really wanted to consider the street namings, certainly on a permanent basis, and the reason you know Craig and I talked about this. To put it on was that it's proposed for temporary basis and I guess. The question is whether I just asked the committee. If anyone at this point wants to put forward a resolution on this, have Rita and Lori who have their hands up chuck. Oh sorry, I didn't see that read it. Why don't we unmute Rita I didn't want to make a resolution, but I did want to propose something that within community board 8 that with perhaps with the Chamber of Commerce, that we have a unique selling proposition, whether we have what the most sushi places we to be all inclusive and make our area unique unto itself. So it takes everybody into whether it's galleries or whatever it is instead of one street. This is such an important time in everyone's marketing is to get everybody inclusive. So I'd like to see a unique selling proposition or called a Usp or community board ape other than and then call it something whether it's international role or whatever it is, but dairy role doesn't really do it doesn't do the area justice, it's just my opinion. Thank you. Laurie Boris had her hand up Laurie hi, yes, I have been trying to get an idea off the ground for a really long time, and that is a CBA, zooms and I think that we can do a really easy public affairs program. You know public affairs type program and Jeremy. We could do your idea, you know with the dairy row and talk about all of the dairy stores in you know in our district you know it's like, so we would focus on. You know the row that you're talking about, but we would say- and of course there are a gazillion other dairy businesses and then we could focus on museums. We could focus on, like whatever you know, sushi restaurants. You know whatever and I think that would be a great way to get people talking about it. You know so I offer that to you, if it's okay with Elita and that's my two cents, okay, any other anyone else on this: okay, no, okay, hearing, none so Jeremy! There are some ideas that are proposed. I. Think at this point, obviously the committee's not prepared to act on a formal resolution, but I think there's some good ideas here. Actually that were proposed- and you may want to discuss them further, particularly with Lori and I thought they were and Rita had a thought and Michelle had a good thought. So maybe there's a way to do that and if you wanted to, you can contact the board office and they and you know they can or they may be able to send some things in the board office that you can then get passed on to you. Thank you for coming and bringing it up appreciate it. Okay, the next item on our agenda is the city: DOT updates. Colleen, do you have any updates there? Hey yeah I do Alita I wanted to let you know your at last month's meeting you had mentioned. You know retail stores having the opportunity of putting out their merchandise just like similar concept with the open restaurant and we've seen that has been enacted as well, and you know I, I'm guessing that it's working out really well because I have not received any complaints in the community boards that I represent. So that was, you know a really great idea, but you know in talking with some of the bids in Midtown. You know they mentioned that you know the upscale stores would not be putting out. You know their merchandise out there for fear of it being stolen. So that's why you know a lot of the stores that are due doing. This are pretty much small stores, small scale stores, a local metro, pcs or you know- maybe a printing shoppers I, I'm just throwing that out there, but these are the stores that have been putting out their merchandise out there. So I just wanted to let you know your thought. Your idea did come to pass and it was you know: City hall considered. You know that as well. The other thing Alita you had mentioned the kind of paint that we use in resurfacing and I wanted to. Let you know that we currently do not have that high contrast marking policy for concrete boating roadways that what we use is standard. So you had mentioned that because I think the port authority uses something like that in their area, but we don't use that in our crosswalk markings for our roadway and I. Think I don't know, Valerie is still there, but Valerie I believe we got the permission to remove the benches on 72nd, Street and I. Think it was submitted to the contractor. I, don't know if they have been removed yet, but I will follow up with my colleague, but I think there was an approval to remove the benches. Just so you know okay, but I just couldn't may I just interject Chuck. Thank you Colleen. Thank you very much for being responsive both on the stores which I'm glad to see and on the street paint which I'm not so glad about, because it is really difficult and with bicycle riders without any kind of glow-in-the-dark markings with motorcycles going up bike lanes having any advantage in the rain and in the dark would be a good thing, but I really appreciate and I, don't know if Valerie's still here but I'll be bold and say. Thank you very much also for following up on what Valerie had suggested response and miscommunication between community boards and city agencies is really highly valued and productive. So thank you. Alita I know that there were Colleen. I know that some there are some old business that may be for you. So if you could hang in for a few minutes, definitely yeah I think we I think in turn. Is there any old business here you have Billy and somebody named Peter, Chola yeah. Why don't we go to Peter first? Thank you. Craig I appreciate that just I wanted to follow up on a couple things that have been raised for DOT in the past. One that Rita raised in September, which I think Colleen was not at the meeting on James Cagney's place, blocked off road because of uneven surface, which has been there now for over a year. We discus I, remember being participating in a discussion at the board in September last year about this, and then Rita brought it up again in September this year and there's still been no action on this James Cagney place uneven pavement, which has resulted in the road bed being blocked for access, which means that bicyclists and others who are using James Cagney place as the only East-West bike lane in this part of Upper East side have to take their bikes onto the sidewalk, which is a both a distraction for pedestrians and for the cyclists themselves. So it would be better to get that fixed and we'd love to have an update on that. Second, one I wanted to request an update on old business was something that the transport committee passed back in March and that the full committee passed in April I believe for the full East-West bike lanes and access through central park, and there was, as I understand a interagency task force or something of this sort set up between parks, DOT and the Central, Park Conservancy and yet we've and we and the and I, really appreciate that CBA passed a resolution asking for expeditious report back on this on these ideas to improve the cross island- and you know from east to West and West East Bike lanes. But it's been nine months and we haven't heard anything and we'd love to hear what progress has been made on that aspect of things. Thank you sure, chuck so I believe Borough. Commissioner Pinkar had a conversation with you about James Cagney. Yes, you had mentioned you were going to reach out to him. I did yeah. He was going to get back to me. He was getting back to me. He wanted to talk to Margaret for Gionee and stuff, but he hasn't gone back. Yet. I was gonna. I will remind him about that. The other thing is that we have had a conference call with the conservancy and with parks on the Central Park bike lanes and the improvements and just to let you know we are working on something we are strategizing. As soon as we have a proposal, we will come to community board seven and eight to give a presentation, so we are looking at that. You know very carefully and again as soon as we have something we'll let both community boards know and we'll come and give a presentation. Thank you, Colleen. Okay, the next is Joss Josh Rubinger. Can we unmute Josh hi good evening? Everyone I wanted to bring up some old business about the bike lane. I think this is the right time, if not feel free to cut me off some questions. Colleen just mentioned coming to community board. Seven and eight with an update, is that regarding the overall project and to give everyone a brief update on some of the status. Since our last discussion. Last month we had a productive meeting with Kimberly from the DOT and several stakeholders. We walked. The streets and I don't think it's a good use of all your time or my time to relitigate the bike lanes. I mean anyone can look and see. We've talked about this ad nauseam that it's, you know very problematic. So here are my questions. Procedurally, I'm new to this. What is the process of how the community board if they agree with our stance? It seems like the majority of people are against this. If they come to that decision, what would the next steps be and nothing happens fast in the city? Everything takes a long time. There's a lot of bureaucracy. The only thing that was fast is one morning: I got up and these bike lanes were there. So you know now it's like, oh well. We have to wait. We get more plans, but they came upon us very quickly. I, don't really think it's appropriate or I mean if you have questions I can explain why they're horrible and we've talked about that a lot, but it's just never been vetted and I'd really love to know. If the community board could be our advocate. First, we have to all find a consensus that you know you share my belief and the belief of everyone. I've heard speak, but I'd really like to know procedurally how this you guys could help what the next steps are, because we've really been just stonewalled so far. Thank you, I think I unders they put in the you're talking slightly different subject than what Colleen was referring to in central park. This is the 61st and 62nd Street bike lanes you were talking about and what happened was those were put in temporarily, as you said they did have. We did have a discussion that the board were presented, and this is a temporary thing. They want to make something permanent and I. Think the question is what whether they go forward with something like this or there can be changes and I. Think that's a discussion that we need to have with the DOT and with the bike. People and I think we're going to have that before. Hopefully, you know before they make any decisions on how you know how a permanent bike lane would work. That chuck is absolutely right. Josh before we make a decision to make this permanent we'll have to come before the community board to give a presentation we're dealing with the repercussions with this temporary measure and I think you know when this first happened: Colleen I, remember you and I spoke briefly and I kind of said. What does temporary mean, and you know you weren't sure, no one is sure and I think what I've been told is. The plan is temporary to permanent, it's not temporary, to get rid of it and out of just a simple question: if the community board does a resolution and say we are against these bike lanes, what does that mean? Can the deal say? Well, thanks? We don't care, I mean what does that actually mean? If someone could enlighten me I'd appreciate it. Let me speak to that. Josh we're an advisory board and the all the agencies can take our recommendation or not in the end, it's up to them, but I will say well, you know we we've had a good working relationship with the DOT and certain times they don't take our recommendations but other times they do so. I. Think it's a question of you know, depending on what it is and I think if I could, the way I understand and Colleen can correct me is that you know D.O.T is anxious to set up a system where you can have a continuous bike path or lane. That goes, let's say across the bridges at 59th street. The Koch Bridge goes through our area and through central park and across to the west side, that's their overall plan, and so the question is: how do you do that and I think that's what these lanes are a piece of so but the question is whether it makes sense to do it here or whether there's other places to do it. I think that's the discussion, and while we can't guarantee what's going to happen, I think you know the D.O.T has worked with us on these kinds of things and so I think it's to be determined. We have a special session just on this topic, so we don't annotate the rest of the committee with this on. Yes, probably yes, Josh I think we probably will do that, because I know that there were a lot of people. The last time we had a discussion on this. There were quite a few people and I. Think our record for our committee hearing on the zoom I saw the number and I couldn't believe it, but I think that the I think it probably will pay to have a hearing on this, because there's so much interest in the community about this. But thank you appreciate all your efforts. Thank you. So much sure thank you. Evelyn David I believe is next. Can we unmute Evelyn it's star sixth unmute on the phone, oh on the phone? Okay, I did good evening everybody. Thank you very much for this discussion on the bike lanes. I get so depressed and then all of a sudden you're talking about it again and I'm like. Oh, please get rid of these things. The doorman today said to me they're, just temporary and I looked at them and I said uh-huh. Okay, so anyway, there's nobody in the neighborhood I know that thinks this is a good idea. The traffic is backing up more and more on 62nd street, because that traffic goes straight down to the FDR, and this is between park and Lex. It's starting now. Okay, so 61st street from FDR is already backing up. You know it's impossible, okay, so we will have discussions later, hopefully there's another issue that I want to address. If you don't mind, if Colleen could last meeting, she said something about the signage was going to be changed. You know you change the signage on Lexi, between Lexin Park and between park and third on 62nd street from eight no parking, eight am to seven pm to seven a.m. To seven pm is there any way it can be re-changed I mean. Is that an impossible request, because all of us in the neighborhood who have to get out of leave to go to work now are really under the gun they have to be in the car at seven, because they're giving tickets everywhere so I mean that's an issue that is, you know any answer to that and I thought. Last meeting you said the signage was going to be changed back Colleen, no I. Didn't say that the signage was going to be changed. I put my email in the chat. Can you send me the segments of where the signages were changed? Let me look into it. Oh I, don't actually have video I'm on the phone, so I don't need a video. Just send me an email of where the signs were changed. I know, but I, don't know your email address or I'll call will I'll get it from. Will you rather, the signage was changed on 62nd Street between Lex and park and between Lex and third from 7 a.m. Okay, it used to be no parking, 8 a.m to 7 p.m. So you could get your stuff together, get out of the house, get in their car and go where you had to go because work school starts at eight or eight thirty right, but now it's seven now you have to now it's no parking from seven a.m to seven pm, so that makes us like get up at four and get out of there by seven it's insane. It's just one thing after the others made Kovac life, you know pretty unbearable. If memory serves me correct, the signage was changed because of the bike lane to allow for the ease of the flow of traffic on that core and that segment, but I will put that. Okay that that's doing nothing. First of all, I need to really pound on this two more seconds and I'm sorry about this, but I saw three bikes in like oh all of today, all right, so the bike lanes are really not being used and also I, don't see what difference it makes I guess they do whatever they feel like I, don't know it's just really inconvenient, really stressful, and if you can do anything about it, we really would appreciate that. Okay, thank you. Everyone, the Colleen, yes, look into it. So yeah we'll be I'll, be in touch with everyone: okay, Great Paula Bernstein. Can we meet Paul hi I, appreciate it. I'm representing Chef David Burke, with our flagship restaurant David, Burke Tavern, which is located on 62nd street between Lexington and park, avenues which it sounds like we've been talking quite a bit about, as everybody knows. Obviously we are the only restaurant on that street right now and given the Covid-19 restrictions, we were given the ability to move into the street for outdoor dining, since we can only have 25% capacity inside the building and as soon as we were able to do that, we had about three weeks of outdoor dining and suddenly we were shut down because of the bike lane I just I have no idea because we're coming into this plate, we didn't even know what was happening and I, don't know what our capabilities are to have that removed. It sounds like there's a lot of other problems happening as well. Obviously we do have a lot of elderly people who want to walk in the street and come to us and they can't they have no room on the sidewalk with having diners on there on our street, so it gets really congested. You know and, of course, just being able to have guests park on the street. We have guests coming in from the tri-state area, all the time to come to our flagship, there's just no place to park anymore. So again, I kind of echo. What we've heard a lot of today, which is that you know with Covid-19, adding this, is just totally it's like adding salt to you know a really open sore wound, so I just want to make sure that if you know our voice is heard and we will do whatever we can possible to have this rectified so that we can get rid of that bike lane, which is frankly not as and I've stood out there many times over the last. You know several weeks nobody's using the bike lane. As a matter of fact, people are parking their cars in it. Thank you. Paul I know that when we had the earlier discussion about the temporary lanes, there were some restaurants. That said they might cause issues and the D.O.T talked to them, and they were going to try to work that out. I, don't know if your client was one of them, but that that's we'll get that all in the mix. Yeah and I can reach out to you Paula offline. If you want to share with me your best number, where I can reach you tomorrow, yeah like you, want it now, you want to do it in the chat. That'll be fine. Okay, one, six, okay, six, three, five Mm-Hmm, 290. and Chef Burke does send his regards. He was able to be on earlier, but we didn't realize it was gonna run this late. So that is why I'm here, I am his vice president of marketing communications. I'm sorry, you said 635. What are the last four digits? Sorry, six, two, nine, eight, six, two, nine eight! Thank you so much thank you and who is speaking, I'm sorry! It's Colleen I will give you a call tomorrow. That's great I appreciate it. Thank you he's our D.O.T liaison Paul she's, the one that goes back to the department and talks to them about the issues that we raised thanks, Paula, okay, so we have next someone by the name of cost spaniletti! Oh wait! A second, no I want to take Louisa first with her iPad, because one of the member of the public then we'll get the costs is Louise's. I saw her earlier here is: can we unmute Louisa I, guess she's here, yeah she's trying to mute from her device, but you just have to click unmute there you go, you got it well. I've been listening to everybody's talk about 62nd, Street and 61st. I was also present at the last meeting and we have rallied many of us to write letters to you all expressing our problems and I'm sure DOT is aware of it this, but they may not realize the stress it puts us to, because 62nd Street has always been a very challenged street in terms of vehicular traffic because of its direct access to the FDR and the bridge. But what people might not be aware of is that it seems to surge I mean that's the only word. I can use and I do have pictures of this, because I have stood there somewhere between 3:30 and 4 o'clock. There is a surge of turning traffic from the Southbound Park Avenue Lane and the Northbound Park Avenue Lane, and you literally have cars and trucks and whatever piling up at that juncture, and it really has made a material difference in our lives just yesterday, just as a particular example, I happen to have to go on to the FDR drive downtown to the downtown hospital. Now this is a drive from 62nd street onto the FDR drive south, which used to take somewhere around 10 to 12 minutes and I know this with certitude, because my daughter lives on the lower east side. So I go on the FDR drive south all the time. Well, that 10 minute drive now turned into 20 minutes just going from 62nd and park to the FDR drive. This was at 1:30 in the afternoon. It by the way only took me 12 minutes to get down to Brooklyn bridge, so the going across town is really a big problem. The other thing is that I'm not sure if this is well known, but 62nd street is at least 5 feet narrower than 61st and I have pictures on 61st of the passing lane existing so that, if there's double parking, there is still room for West bound vehicular traffic. We do not have that luxury on 62nd Street, so for all of those reasons, I'm not even mentioning the noise etc. I think the snarling of the traffic is a huge problem. Thank you, Louisa. We, this is what obviously we're going to take this up and we've had discussions and we'll have further discussions on this. Well, will there be any opportunity for the public, such as people like ourselves, parts to participate in these? Of course, that's what we're here for okay, now the public, an opportunity to participate and we're happy to have you participate? Thank you now. Let me get back to someone by the name of cost. Spaniletti I, don't know who that is I, don't know either, but why don't we unmute them and give them a try? No, I'm unmuted. Can you hear yes, of course, good? I'm not sure if this is old, business, new business or anything in between monkeys probably but go ahead as far as the DOT and the outdoor dining. We all know that everybody is building these permanent structures on the street. There's some permanent structures being built on the sidewalk. There's few places that two or three feet of basically the pedestrians to walk on the sidewalk. Should this be I'm not sure if Colleen can answer anything tonight, but maybe we should have a joint with DOT street life and small business, because this is getting very serious. Everybody's spending, thousands of dollars on you know, building indoor on the street and parking spaces are disappearing. Traffic is being inundated, it's what is going on and there's no enforcement I mean all D.O.T has to do, is drive down up and down the avenues, and that could find thousands of violations because people are taking advantage of it there's some very respectable good people that do not take advantage, but there are some that it's you know what is DOT doing about it. I don't know. If Colleen wants to reply to that. Well, you know it's something that is getting frustrating to everybody, so I mean listen. We have our inspectors. We also have other inspectors from various agencies. That's helping us with the enforcement, if you see or if you notice a restaurant, a particular restaurant, that's building a structure that doesn't look like it's kosher or it's not in compliance. Let will know or email me and I can have an inspector go out there and we'll inspect the site to make sure that if it's in compliance it is, if not, we will issue a cease and desist and have them remove the structure. Now, it's not to say that the restaurant owners don't know what they're supposed to do. They do know, because there are specific guidelines showing renderings of what the structure should be and the build out what how many feet they have to be. You know clearance for pedestrians passage and so forth and what's required with the barricades and you're right, there are going to be some bad actors out there who are going to take it upon themselves to do what they want to do and you might feel like it's a wild west, but at the same time we do have enforcement and we do have folks that's going out there and inspecting the sites. So if you do see something you know just let will know give will the address or the quarter and we'll go out there and we'll inspect the locations. Okay, yeah, but I'm not going to you know I'm not the policeman on this and you're. Not if you know of a restaurant, if you know of a location, let us know I, don't feel comfortable doing that. But you know, as the inspectors are going down and the NYPD is driving up and down the avenues, all they have to do is look and they can see. What's you know, what's required and what's legal and what's not, and admittedly all the restaurants know what it is that they should do, but even though the major or everybody knows what it should be, a lot of them are doing are going just beyond or even further than crossing the legal line, not so much the legal, but the line that you know they shouldn't. Okay again, maybe this should be brought up at a joint three triumphant meeting. Well, I, don't know if costs. If you remember that at our last meeting we had a discussion of this when we were talking about outdoor dining and things like that, and we had people from D.O.T who were in charge of these programs, and they said that you know you have to do them in a certain way that it has to be open to a certain extent and I think now that we're getting into the winter there's, I'm sure there's going to be the feeling that you want people want to enclose it which goes against what it is. So you can't create they you don't want them. Creating indoor dining outdoors there's not supposed to be any like right, closure right, full closure right but they're supposed to, but I'm sure a lot of them aren't doing that. If we have to have a further hearing on that with, as you suggested, we can have some of our code with some of our other committees. We can look at that and they will do it. All you have to do is walk around and what they're classifying yeah it's supposed to be 50 percent open, but you walk around and as you're driving and walking they're fully enclosed. So that makes it an indoor dining which is now the 25. And what are you going to take 25 percent of what and again it's important to know the establishments who are doing this, because you know I can not stress that enough that we will go out there and do the enforcement okay, all right, Casa I think we I think we'll. You know this is something we may have to take up at some point again. I think Valerie's waving her hand on this issue. I'm not sure I see her why she says. Yes, okay, she says yes all right. Why don't we recognize that gallery on this honestly thanks I mean I want to. This was a subject that I had raised my hand, be even before cause brought it up. I completely agree with everything he is saying: I mean Colleen you're, saying like. If we report somebody then you're going to come up and take a look, I mean it is a massive non-compliance in all ways, and you know every minute of every day these structures are being built on the sidewalk in the street everywhere, and these restaurant people are spending a lot of money doing it, and you know it's like anything else. You need to have these enforcement people out there as a deterrent to be putting these things up and it shouldn't be as cause says, we should not have to be the police here. Diode I mean you know, Second Avenue, first Avenue, you know that there are tons of restaurants around here that I, you know, I, don't want to press you, but I I'd like to know, then. The last time an enforcement officer came up here. I mean the sidewalks. Are disappearing and one of the concerns I have- and this is something I was going to ask. We need to look at with the mayor saying that these structures and everything can stay out there for a really long time. I, don't know how we're going to get our sidewalks back after all of these restaurant people and I know they're struggling mightily and I want to support them once they put all this up, I, don't see how we're going to get our sidewalks back and our streets back and to that end, I was going to ask you how much money is New York City, losing every single day that we don't have parking going on? I mean that has to be a big revenue source that we're losing out on, and you know we have to be balancing, but again, I just don't see what is going to. What is the plan going to be to literally take the sidewalk back, because when you say the restaurant owners know how much sidewalk to leave? You know when you have a bike rack, a CitiBike rack, one of the circles, there's like less than three feet. Sometimes, for people to walk through if you're on Lexington Avenue there's one street and I'm not going to tell you what it is right now, where you're, literally walking in between tables and you can touch a table on each side as you walk down the sidewalk and I. You know it's been like that since July, so I, don't know how many enforcement officers you have going around, but it's not enough and I agree. We need to take this up as a an issue with small business, transportation and street life, but it's getting worse, not better, and these structures are really enclosed. Now, with the inclement weather and there I don't see any enforcement at all right. Well, why don't we? This is something. Thank you. Valerie is something that we'll probably have to take up with our fellow chuck. If I may, yeah I just want to go to Colleen's defense that, like people have called our office, we have raised several locations with DOT and with DOB, and they have gone out. They have issued violations, they have issued correction notices and DOB has issued oath summonses, so I mean we rely I. Always tell constituents who call our office, we rely. The city relies on people in the community to raise concerns so that we know that there's a problem and I. Do it myself in my own community, where I live but like we need to be a part of yes, we don't want to be the police but like if this is a problem, and it is, we should call through on one ourselves, and we should also you know, send me the locations and I'll happily raise them with Colleen, because she's done a great job so far being on top of this, and so I just want to defend Colleen, and you know, as a colleague in government that she's been doing a great job, making sure these are addressed. Thanks appreciate that Rita, why don't we have a new Rita Popper looks next here. I do have an update on a James Cagney place, but before I do that I'd like to thank Colleen and Chuck and Craig who have been tireless for and it's almost two years and the insurance company has canceled their insurance, and so therefore there will be no more community events. We had five years, including movies and sing-alongs, and people are calling now asking whether the holiday sing will take place. But you know during this pandemic: it's not such a bad thing, but there nobody seems to be screaming about the bike lane that doesn't go up, and now the bikers are going up and delivery guys on electric mopeds are going up the sidewalk because they don't want to dismount and go around the obstruction. So hopefully it'll get fixed. If it gets fixed, we get our insurance back without insurance. We can't have. We can't take a chance of having the public come and fall. So thank you all for your help. Let's see, maybe we can sell all this in 2021. Thank you, Rita I think we will I think we will Michelle Birnbaum. Can we yes hi? Thank you with reference to the outdoor dining I actually had sent Chuck and Craig, and the Zoning committee and I cc'd well I sent an email around today attached to which was an article about Cb2's reaction to this outdoor dining and will, if you have that I wonder if you can, sir, if you could send that around since you have the whole board list, because everybody should see this, we here in community board, eight I, don't think we took appropriate, not necessarily action, but we did not have a full and appropriate discussion on this issue. It wasn't a matter of whether or not there's enforcement. That's one issue, but the whole program was never really considered by us as the pros the cons and whether or not we actually support it was never considered with the zoning committee. This is a very big zoning issue. The a lot of these places that are putting in outdoor dining. They are not zoned for outdoor dining. Ordinarily, they would be fine for putting anything on the street and what does this say about those people who are zoned with outdoor dining and also have paid for that in some way that now everybody's got that benefit. I think that we need a thorough and complete discussion of this entire program with the zoning committee, the Small Business committee and transportation, but we have not given this whole program. It's just desserts. We have not discussed it. We were told that it was permanent. We all said, oh well, now it's permanent it was supposed to be temporary. Then it was supposed to go through the pandemic. Now we have vaccines, hopefully everybody will be vaccinated by next summer or so, and we still are going to have this. It is a visual blight because there's no conformity with what people are putting up and if you drive up and down the streets, it looks like a shanty town. It's a visual blight, it's an obstruction of the sidewalks. It's everything I mean it benefits that one business. It really doesn't benefit anybody else. You can say that the rest of the community at large is very much benefited by this. It's taken the parking away, it's taken the revenue away as Valerie says: that's even that's just a small part of it. If we don't have zoning, we don't have anything. The city will be chaos and at one of our last meetings we had a representative here from the city and I was last week: I, don't remember which meeting it was. Oh it was it wasn't it the municipal arts society for those of you who were on that zoom when I actually asked the question and they had. There was no answer when I asked the question about zoning and enforcement and what will happen to zoning, and will it be completely disrupted whatever he they said? Well, they really haven't worked that out yet well, you know what if will gave me a thumbs up so he's going to send around the CB2 article I suggest everybody read, it will raise a lot of issues. This is happening. They still don't have a lot of answers and we as a board, have not taken this up to the full extent that we should have so. I'm asking I wrote to the to zoning today and I wrote to chuck and Craig today, so they know about this, so I'm asking you all to get together and please set up a joint meeting with just this as a topic. Not when this comes and then we can have the public come as well and address it not when this comes as number four on the agenda. We have three minutes left. It's left to the meeting. It's very serious, so I would appreciate it if you would agree to do that. Thank you, Michelle. As we said we'll. We certainly will certainly look at doing something on this Craig. Did you wanted to comment, then I know about this or something else. Yeah I just wanted to I guess before I was before I say what I was going to say. I just wanted to I think speak generally to this whole issue and even relating it to the bike lanes. Yes, this has been a really difficult period for everyone and trying to adapt to these emergency changes to the streets in the streetscape in order to accommodate businesses or bikers whatever it may be. I just want to try to bring us back to the fact that this there are so many severe impacts that everyone one is feeling of this pandemic, and it just hurts me a little to think about the pain that so many business owners are going through or even the lives that have been lost throughout this pandemic and I. Just hope that we can all just live a little longer. I know we're all dealing, exhaustion fatigue from what, whether it be zoom meetings or being stuck inside and everything, but I would just hope that we can just be able to endure a little longer and endure that these changes that may not be appealing to everyone, but are really helping some people who otherwise this is their lifeline to be able to live their lives and we've. Seen too many lives lost to lucid fact that we need to make sure that the vitality of people's lives that we can assist are able to be assisted. I think my concern in terms of the outdoor dining, which I'm not clear about- and this is my question for Colleen. She even knows the answer to this, but I have a feeling- and this is my suspicion- that it's I'm sure Colleen has done, has been very responsive and I'm sure Dft is trying to be Respon as responsive as possible. I see, at least on the open restaurant's website, a real, detailed, a set of guidelines for what restaurants need to do in order to be able to set up structures matter, and that's really what I'm most concerned about is safety aspect is the fact that these restaurants are setting up spaces that are essentially mostly enclosed and that people, whether knowingly or unknowingly, are exposing themselves between the virus, because they may have misconception that out. There dining is safe if there's even some airflow in there, but not enough, because the air flow basically can be going in and just spreading germs all around. So I guess my question for DOT is: can you spell out the guidelines more explicitly so that reference know what the rules are because I have a feeling, as I think everyone's alluded to every you don't have to go far to find places that appear to be non-conforming, but I know that they're non-conforming or if they're, just following the guidelines and taking the liberties, that the guidelines that you should exist perhaps allow them to do because they don't see any restrictions in place. So maybe it's a matter of being more explicit in terms of what isn't impermissible, so restaurants can't bend the rules based on. What's currently posted yeah I mean I. I've looked at the guidelines. We've reviewed the guidelines and I think the guidelines are very specific. In details, I mean I've. Had some restaurant owners who personally contacted me and even our are staffers and have submitted their. You know designs and ask us: hey: is this okay? Can we do this and you know we were more than happy to accommodate them and give them our feedback on what they were thinking of putting up their structure, so I mean I. Think a lot of restaurant owners feel comfortable, calling us as well to get that additional feedback and which is what we have been doing before they go out there and construct these structures that are thousands of dollars and come to find out it's illegal and they have to remove it and they've spent so much money. I mean the guidelines. Are there and I really think that there is I'm sorry what? Where does it actually say that you must keep the two sides open and exposed? I have to look I have to look at it. I have to go back on our website and take a look at it. Yeah I, don't see it yeah, just because I'm worried about virus transmission, but especially I cringe whenever I walk down the streets and see all these places that seem to be mostly enclosed. Just for that reason, and I'm one who isn't as bothered by the no I agree with Craig in that certainly okay, camp I, think Warner. The leader wanted to be recognized, I believe elite I do say. Thank you. Craig I didn't think you're stuck sorry about that. I'm concerned about a couple of things. One is the extent of these indoor buildings I just emailed you Colleen a building with steel, framing going up as an outdoor dining spot on Lexington, which suggests that they have no intention to keep things as open or as temporary, as might be necessary. I talked a lot about the snow, there's that there's the city revenue which other people have raised, but I'm also concerned about the lack of fairness to the businesses that are not fortuitously located. So, if you're going to look into this and that it's been all done without community input and very hastily, and without considering the ancillary impact theme of opening and having this street dining and then moving to make it permanent again with that opportunity for input and I think told really early on that, we were not going to be able to have any input into this and it was all going to be decisions made by the administration, but for restaurants, and we would like to see all restaurants thrive for restaurants that are next to a bus. Stop a bike lane a bus, a CitiBike and I know that there have been conflicts with CitiBike and it stands. They don't have the same opportunities and it seems wildly unfair when the city is giving away the use of the sidewalk, the use of the street, no fees, nothing and little enforcement to have what it amounts to a penalty for the restaurants that are not located near those spots and I personally would like to see the DOT work and help these restaurants find locations close by or help negotiate. I know you don't, but the SBA might, or some other financial entity of the government might be able to help negotiate with landlords of these spaces to have the space available for restaurants that may not be approximate, but maybe somewhere close by, so that they could use space. I'm also really worried about what happens with propane heaters in these kinds of very enclosed outdoor spaces that are outdoor in name only and does the propane emit any kind of toxic fumes or does the enclosure make it more dangerous to be using those giant heaters when they're not enough open spaces? So thank you very much and thanks chuck sure yeah. Those are all issues, I, think that need to be considered as this program. You know both the mayor and the council said it was going to be extended. You know for a while here, so I think we need to get to the bottom of some of that stuff and DOT said they were willing to discuss this with us. So I think that's we're. Gonna have to set up some kind of a hearing and get them in and talk over a lot of these issues. Marco I see Marco Tamayo. Can we on Newt Marco? Thank you talking about the guidelines. I saw the guidelines when they came out and then immediately. I decided to talk with a leader and I asked the permission to go to all the restaurants over on starting from York. First second and third avenue and some section of Lexington and I went to spoke to each restaurant. Most of them was manager, and some a few of them was the owners explaining how to follow the relations of Lt. So the DOT is clear. The only problem where I perceive right here is DOT is unwilling to enforce what they create and they supposed to go and I agree with cause. Personally myself, I never ever like to complain in any building or any condition myself could either 311 or to DOV all of them. I. Don't want to do that because I think this is not our role to police nobody over there. So my point is the lack of reinforcement of bot. I. Think it does is the problem you can go outside as soon as you go outside in a vlog. You can find two or three violators or more so you we. Basically you don't need a complaint. You got to go outside and you can keep putting violation behind to another violation, because if you put violation they're going to stop to build this huge structure that they are completely with serious problems, structural problems I mentioned the other day. The snow I know, but somebody said for I think was for one of the agencies said: oh, when the truck will come to remove this knob and if they is right, there they're gonna, remove with everything. It means that it's sad, but it's true and that I think is right. But the problem is the restaurants. They know the regulations I personally, myself I said yes, they know that because I talk to them personally, but the problem is no enforcement. If there is no enforcement, they see, one is doing something, the other follow and D.O.T they don't enforce what they did and I think is the concept what they did was great with a few mistakes, but it was great and now I'm seeing a proliferate everywhere. These structures like cause mentioned very well I, don't want to go inside because I don't want to repeat that. So yes, it is true. Another problem is the zoning, but first of all myself. I don't want to raise this issue right now at this level, because we are still in the pandemic. Once it comes the solution, then we have to start discussing seriously the part that we have to. Oh probably, we have to pass a resolution as soon as the vaccine is available and they have probably two or three months: that's the period that they have to move all the structures completely and they probably will say they're going to complain that we put a lot of money in this structure. That means that these this business, apparently either the money that came from the government they put over there to waste the money or they're doing a very good business even in pandemic time. Of course, they have to do a good time because everybody needs to eat and everybody has to order the food. So even though they are close, there is other kind of the service that they offer to the community, which are grateful by the way. So this is my point is enforcement. Thank you, Margo I think look I think we all know that there are issues and the question is: how do we deal with it as it goes forward as and I think that's what we're going to look into and we're going to get with DOT and see what we can discuss and see how things are going to move forward and Craig I know why don't we give the last word to Craig here? I just want to follow up on what I was saying and we'll post it I believe in the public chat. Some of the on the open restaurants website talk about open, wolf and sidewalls. So in fact, it talks about sidewalls being open, but that is inaudible to operate as an outdoor space. It doesn't say that three-sided walls are not permitted. It just says that if so, then occupancy limits will be capped at 25 and essentially function as indoor seating. So my understanding is at least my interpretation is that the guidance doesn't prevent these types of structures from being built. It just would mean that you'd have to the only enforcement in terms of the number of people seated there as opposed to how they are built in most instances, your Craig that that's to my mind as a prescription for violations that are never going to be really looked at I mean with all I know that they look at violations. But it's going to be you know, but if you say all right, we can have the three side walls, but you can't have more than 25 percent. That's really difficult, as we found over the years in transportation. We found that you know. Enforcement is a tricky thing and you can't count on it to make things permanently changed, even though, and so you have to look at designing if it's parking, you know making the regulations such that they'll handle the situation or if it's something like this, making the guidelines in ways that don't look like they're easy to get away with, and that's what this looks like to me just as looking at it was my lawyer hat on, but anyway I think it's I think on those that we need after schedule. Let's talk and we'll have to schedule something I think with the various the other committees and get D.O.T and start talking about what this thing's going to really look like. If this, how you know how far is it going to go on and what's going to happen here, but I think at this point: we've probably unless there's anybody who has any thing that they're dying to say and I and because I think we're about ready to adjourn I, see that Patrick Bobelen has a hand up and Rebecca Dan Gore has her hand up. So in keeping with our general procedures. We'll hear from them, so why don't we unmute Patel Patrick Sorry thanks so much chuck thanks, everybody I'll keep it brief, because I know we're over time, but it is nice to see some of your faces. Hi Rita I haven't seen you in a million years, so I'm calling about the open streets. I wanted to talk about the open streets program. I talked a little bit with Craig about this, so I think it was a chaos initiative that dropped those barriers on East end Avenue, but for them to be maintained according to the open streets program from 8 am to 8 pm in every other community. It requires a sponsor group to make sure that they're replaced, and so we have no sponsor officially at the East end location, and so no one moves the barriers back when they get moved around. Even though there's safety officers up and down the street no one's moving those barriers back so I talked a little bit to Craig about making it permanent I also talked to Patrick Mccluskey, the executive director of the Karl Park Cultures Park Conservancy, and he said he would talk to the board if we put together a plan. So I'm in the early stages of the process. My goal is just to improve safety. I, don't know if anybody's walked up and down, but it gets a little hairy there. I've seen cars, treating it more like a obstacle course than you know. A place to slow down. I see a lot of parents with kids running up and down- and just you know, cars. You know not abiding by that tiny sign that says five miles per hour, so I wanted to talk to D.O.T I have to call D.O.T. Maybe I could link up with Colleen after this or maybe tomorrow, to talk about traffic calming options, because you know basically, my plan in talking to Patrick Mccleskey was that you know if we instated some traffic calming measures that people abided by and seemed cool with the community, knowing that there may not be budget for like a permanent shutdown, a permanent thing, but some inexpensive traffic calming measures could get the community to vibe. With this open space and given we're going to see another Covid-19 spike, it would be nice to have a little bit more open pedestrian space, and so you know hope, maybe in the future, this could be. You know a resolution to extend the open streets program to support pedestrianization I, don't know what the process would be so far again, I'm very early in it, but I had a great conversation with Billy with Craig with Patrick I would love to talk to Colleen and see what could be put together. You know in my wildest dreams you shut the whole thing down, but I know that's not going to vibe for everybody. So you know. Maybe we can get half of the street for pedestrians alongside the park, the Parks conservancy, you know, Patrick said he'd talk to the parks conservancy about it, so it seemed like a possibility for once so I, don't know where we go from here. Well, Patrick we don't want to. We certainly would encourage you to explore that and if you want to come back to the committee and have us you know, look at something that'd be great and I. Think talking to Colleen and some of the other people would be helpful. Sure Patrick I mean we can have a conversation about the open street and the guidelines and what you need to do. What the next steps are awesome can I chat. You my number sure awesome, I'd love to talk to you when you get a chance good, Rebecca, Dengor Rebecca. Can we unmute Rebecca Dengor I was just going to make a motion to adjourn but I think that's very appropriate. So Elena did you want to just really I. Do just really little and I know you're in really great spirits tonight, Chuck, so I don't want to put a damp on them. This is really for Colleen I urge so much for D.O.T and sanitation to do the camera. 91St Street, James Cagney way it is a resource for the neighborhood. It is the only street we have like this to lose once we get the vaccine and the pandemic ends and the virus goes away to lose that as a resource for the public is, which would just be a bad thing. So I know you've worked hard on it. There must be a way for the city to fix this problem. So that's. My last request is a great big urge. Please see what you can do. It's there's got to be a way. Thank you so much chuck and thank you so much Craig and thank you Colleen. Thank you. We'll try to figure that out, yes, I think thank you. I think we will elite. Definitely so thank you. So I think we are adjourned and I want to thank everyone for their attendance and their interest and to be continued in the new year at our next, which will be our next meeting. The first Wednesday in January, okay, take care, have we'll see some of you at board. Member.
