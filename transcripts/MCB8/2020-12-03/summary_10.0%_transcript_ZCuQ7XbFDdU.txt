, don't know how many are people here at this point, yeah, our team is I, think I believe our team is here.
I'm, Chuck, Warren, Co-Chair and Craig later my other co-chair, and we have a number of items on our agenda today and the first is the New York City transit presentation about the 68th Street subway station ADA project and we're happy to have Marcus Brooke, who book rather, who is our liaison from New York, City, Transit and Marcus Welcome.
Many of you are aware, when we first presented this project back in 2012, we received significant input and I would say: slash opposition from stakeholders regarding a proposing stairway on the southeast corner of East 69th street.
So in response to that feedback and a fairly long negotiation process with affected stakeholders, including Cooney New York City transit, is now prepared to present a plan that we believe will address the concerns of our stakeholders, as well as some significant engineering challenges that we encountered with the project and its direct impacts on our most affected.
Has it, and just really quickly before you get started, I want to give everybody if it's your first time at one of our meetings, you'll notice that you're muted you're not able to unmute yourself whenever Marcus and his team is done with the presentation.
During that design work, it was determined that there were some significant structural modifications that would be required to install an elevator within the footprint of the Hunter College East Building, and that's the building located on the southeast corner of 68th and Lexington.
So, as a result of those structural engineering challenges, the MTA looked for an alternative site that could accomplish the project goals and they determined that by relocating the streets to air and elevator improvements from the southeast corner to the northeast corner.
At, the intersection of 68th and Lexington Avenue that they could avoid those structural concerns, So in the new proposed design, the stairs on the southeast corner of 68th street, which is located within CUNY property.
With the exception of that relocated, elevator and the illumination of the widening of the stairs within the Hunter ecology's building footprint, the project's basically unchanged, principally unchanged from what was proposed in 2016.
These stairs were proposed to be widened and reconfigured, and a new elevator that would take passengers from the street level.
So, the new proposed design retains many of the original projects features, principally the entry on 69th street west of Lexington Avenue, the Midwalk entrance in the imperial House, the reconstructed northwest stairs those all remain unchanged.
We look to the east side of 68th street or to 68th street on the east side of Lexington Avenue, The, stair and elevator that were proposed within the footprint of the Hunter College East building would not be constructed.
Lastly, The proposed modifications to the stairs within the Hunter college building would not be made and the elevator location would be relocated here to the north side of the street.
That's been constructed in the parking lane with the entry stair located a little bit further east, as you can see, here, and that would replace this stair here located right at the corner that enters provides access right onto Lexington avenue.
There was a rehabilitation of the stairs from the mezzanine down to the platforms for both the southbound and the northbound sides, and then we have elevators that take you from the mezzanine down to the platform level for both sides that work that was proposed in 2016 remains unchanged with the new design.
The work that was proposed within the Hunter college footprint would not be constructed for the new entries on 69th street and in the mid block within the imperial House.
And, so here, just to recap, as a summary of what was presented in 2016 and what's changed now in the new design, as I indicated, the entrance on 69th street west of Lexington Avenue is unchanged from what was previously presented.
Similarly, the mid-block entrance located within the imperial house, that's unchanged, and as a result of the efforts of the MTA to secure that property, Since this was originally proposed in 2016, that's allowed them to eliminate any potential consideration of an entrance at 69th street east of Lexington.
That wasn't something that had been contemplated back then, but that's no longer under consideration will not be constructed at the Hunter College East footprint building, As we talked about, we originally were planning to widen those stairs.
On the northeast corner of 68th and Lexington, we talked about the stair that presently exits right on to Lexington Avenue, as proposed in 2016.
Lastly, The connection work between the mezzanine and the platform level, the elevators and the stair rehabilitation that was proposed in 2016 is unchanged now in the new plan.
The next steps for the MTA at this point are to complete the proposed design for the elevator at that new location on the northeast corner of 68th and Lexington.
The MTA is working with agencies such as the New York, City, Department of Transportation and Federal Transit administration to obtain approvals once those approvals are in place that will allow for the construction contract to be let to a design, build contractor and construction to be initiated.
And I'm, assuming that it will be ADA accessible and you will be able to get and a wheelchair in there without a problem, Richard I, don't know who wants to take that question.
However many years this has been going on, so I don't mean next month, but whenever you have an answer to that question, maybe you can get back to the chairs and let them know how that's being handled.
There was that, in the original plan, was to construct an entry here at 69th street on the west side of Lexington Avenue and to construct the mid-block entrance here within the footprint of the Imperial House.
As a fallback, There was an alternate plan that had been contemplated to install a stair here on the east side of Lexington Avenue at 69th Street, and we received a lot of feedback from the community on that particular location, which is why the preference was to construct it here within the imperial House, because the MTA was able to successfully gain access to that property.
Is, that if we're talking about increasing accessibility and capacity that we do all this construction at one time, and so it makes no sense to me to like continue to go move forward with this project, but not widen those stairs at the same time.
The second thing is in terms of I, think I understand what you're saying about the crosswalk I.
My other question is how why is that I understand you're going to build out into the street, but to the gentleman's point about the garage.
The thing the one thing to consider is that, with the addition of the two new northern stairs, one in the Imperial House and one on the southeast southwest corner of 69th and lex, Those are going to divert a lot of people who currently use this stair away from this stair.
The first is I, think that there's an elevator at the South West corner of 68th street and Lexington Avenue, which provides access from street level to the mezzanine.
If you come on the southbound and you want to use the imperial building, what you need to do is go to the south end of the southbound platform climb up to the mezzanine, possibly P3, or something like that.
You came on the northbound, there's no reason you'd want to get to the 69th street stairs.
And I think that your original proposal inside of the Hunter college premises, it makes a lot of sense and if you find a challenge of the structural part, please hire and spend more money.
We see this the street side, this exit onto Lexington Avenue here what was originally proposed was to widen that which is to offset it move it further east, with the with widening of the sidewalk by constructing that curb bump out, there's actually going to be a little bit more sidewalk for pedestrians to walk on this side of the street and I.
They're only on 68th street, but they're, really not in the habit of enforcing those kind of laws, but with this I, really think that the alert should come from you rather than the public complaining about it, because it's going to be very important to keep that street free.
So I wouldn't anticipate that there would be any significant train disruption during construction, but I'm sure that at some points as we can see, the original project did include some work at the platform level, making improvements to the platform edges and things of that nature.
That people at this stage would like to see an ADA project happen, and we will absolutely I, will take it back and make it part of our discussion, but I, Don't think that that's really feasible so not feasible, because it's a historic building or because Cuny's so difficult, because that shouldn't be a case of the squeaky wheel.
First I just wanted to thank the whole New York City transit team for a great presentation.
If there's, especially if there's a bus, park, I know, there's more going to be more space on the other side.
Don't think that the D.O.T I won't speak for them, but I don't believe that was their preferred location, turning traffic and things, but it probably will end up there during for a period of time, temporary relocation and we'll take a look at what's going on there.
I again want to thank the MTA for what I thought was a really clear, concise, presentation, greatly appreciated, I appreciate living on Roosevelt Island.
So I just wanted to talk on that point and that I'm just really pleased to see that they are going to have an ADA elevator available after years of wishing, That could happen at that.
There are no plans at this time to reroute the crosstown bus on 68th, street, Chuck I just wanted to ask, and I'm really sorry.
If I miss this, why you are widening the stairs on 69th street, because I was thinking about what Michelle had said and if you don't use those stairs, then there's no issue because they're already, If I count correctly, four staircases, which is all that we have on 86th street, which is also an express stop, So again, if I missed it, just say: I, missed it.
I know there were a couple of people who had spoken before who still wanted to speak, but.
When all the work was being done around getting their support for the Queensbridge, southbound or south side bike lane, They also apparently agreed I, don't want to put words into their mouths.
I know that in D.O.T language, it's not an official bike lane and there's some bureaucratic issues: around.
I would just note that in you, know, Billy's, not here, today, I, don't think, but in the past couple meet.
But I was going to say I do think we should, as a committee, pass a resolution in support of both funding.
Yeah go ahead, Craig, sorry, I, don't know if you saw the message but Valerie had on the par item regarding 68th street, possibly wants to propose a resolution and we.
I mean Trisha mentioned it, and other people did as well, but either I don't know what the group, If a letter is better or a resolution, and then I wasn't sure.
You know interested in working with the New York City Transit Authority.
So Valerie can I suggest that I'd like not to do that here after they've gone from, you know, New, York, City transit, and maybe we can.
When, we really haven't had a consensus in this committee, I, Don't think that would be a good idea, they're going to come back to us so with updates.
Okay item number three, and this is a request for a temporary co-naming of second avenue between 81st and 82nd, as Derry Rowe and I just want to say that normally this committee and this board really doesn't entertain.
I think maybe for now for the pandemic, it's outweighed by the idea of bringing people to small businesses and having a reason that people could go up and traipse around and visit various places thanks.
It's all those things, but I think we can all imagine the slippery slope for this up in the 80s on second there's one street that has about three mexican restaurants.
I think there's a way for you to use that name dairy row in inviting people to go there and referring to it when you make any public comments, but I, don't think an official renaming of a street.
But I do think that there's plenty of ways that you can bring crowds to any of these streets by just referring to it.
I know that's a tough term, but supporting the businesses on the east side in some fun, way.
And I know that it's not our general way of doing things, but I wondering if Chuck and Craig you might be able to.
If, it's not a resolution, Maybe it's a letter, maybe Jeremy I kind of wonder if this is better in or at least jointly worked with our small business committee, because I think that this could be turned into some effort just to call attention to some of our businesses in the area.
Is it you know a few months or whatever it is that I think we'd have to work that out in some kind of a resolution.
I know you wanted to say so, because you and I have talked about this, but I.
So as I was saying, I, don't know how we can not be inclusive of other businesses, more small businesses that don't exist on that block or on the street.
It's, just a light projection that gets turned off after business hours, but that could be a way of doing it, but just think about all the ice cream shops that are located.
I mean I, think that it would be helpful to hear from the businesses or to like to hear directly from them and to see if they have thoughts, Even if you had.
I mean not to add more work to your plate, but even if you had other businesses in the area who said that yes, this would be great, because even if it's dairy road, then people are going to eat my ice cream before eat.
And I think that generally I know I feel very compelled when I want to see other small businesses who are coming out to this.
We unmute, the latest thanks, chuck and well so I understand everybody's point, but that's not to say that this wouldn't be a boon for the Upper East side in general and if the businesses would support each other or even if we, if there were something in the publicity that there are other places just because there are places that are scattered, around, doesn't mean that this doesn't have a benefit in itself, I think that.
Think if there were a way of giving the publicity to the places that Craig mentioned the places on first Avenue that maybe there's a way to do something that could still bring people in entice, them.
Okay, As we said in the beginning, You know this committee and this board have not really wanted to consider the street namings, certainly on a permanent basis, and the reason you know Craig and I talked about this.
Going up bike lanes having any advantage in the rain and in the dark would be a good thing, but I really appreciate.
Craig I, appreciate that just I wanted to follow up on a couple things that have been raised for DOT in the past.
Other thing is that we have had a conference call with the conservancy and with parks on the Central Park bike lanes and the improvements and just to let you know we are working on something we are strategizing.
People and I think we're going to have that before.
And I think you know when this first happened: Colleen I, remember: you.
The plan is temporary to permanent, It's not temporary, to get rid of it and out of just a simple question: If the community board does a resolution and say we are against these bike lanes, What does that mean.
Think if I could, the way I understand and Colleen can correct me is that you know D.O.T is anxious to set up a system where you can have a continuous bike path or lane.
I think that's the discussion, and while we can't guarantee what's going to happen, I think you know, the D.O.T has worked with us on these kinds of things.
Yes, probably yes, Josh I think we probably will do that, because I know that there were a lot of people.
I know that thinks this is a good idea.
We do have a lot of elderly people who want to walk in the street and come to us.
That said they might cause issues and the D.O.T talked to them, and they were going to try to work that out.
We all know that everybody is building these permanent structures on the street.
Everybody's spending, thousands of dollars on you, know, building indoor on the street and parking spaces are disappearing.
But, you know, as the inspectors are going down and the NYPD is driving up and down the avenues, All they have to do is look and they can see.
You remember that at our last meeting we had a discussion of this when we were talking about outdoor dining and things like that, and we had people from D.O.T who were in charge of these programs, and they said that you know you have to do them in a certain way that it has to be open to a certain extent, And I.
We report somebody then you're going to come up and take a look, I mean it is a massive non-compliance in all ways, and you know every minute of every day these structures are being built on the sidewalk in the street everywhere, and these restaurant people are spending a lot of money.
I, don't know how we're going to get our sidewalks back.
After all of these restaurant, people, And I know they're struggling mightily, And I want to support them once they put all this up, I, don't see how we're going to get our sidewalks back and our streets back and to that end.
I just want to go to Colleen's defense that, like people have called our office, We have raised several locations with DOT and with DOB, and they have gone out.
The city, relies on people in the community to raise concerns so that we know that there's a problem and I.
You know during this pandemic: it's not such a bad thing, but there nobody seems to be screaming about the bike lane that doesn't go up, and now the bikers are going up and delivery guys on electric mopeds are going up the sidewalk because they don't want to dismount and go around the obstruction.
I just wanted to I think speak generally to this whole issue and even relating it to the bike lanes.
I just want to try to bring us back to the fact that this there are so many severe impacts that everyone one is feeling of this pandemic, and it just hurts me a little to think about the pain that so many business owners are going through or even the lives that have been lost throughout this pandemic and I.
So I guess my question for DOT is: Can you spell out the guidelines more explicitly so that reference know what the rules are, because I have a feeling, as I think everyone's alluded to every.
You know for a while here, so I think we need to get to the bottom of some of that stuff.
I, said yes, They know that because I talk to them personally, but the problem is no enforcement.
I think we all know that there are issues and the question is: How do we deal with it as it goes forward.
As, And, I think that's what we're going to look.
And we'll have to schedule something I think with the various the other committees and get D.O.T and start talking about what this thing's going to really look: like.
What's going to happen, here, but I think at this point.
I wanted to talk about the open streets.
I talked a little bit with Craig about this, so I think it was a chaos initiative that dropped those barriers on East end Avenue, but for them to be maintained according to the open streets program from 8 am to 8 pm in every other.
You, know a resolution to extend the open streets program to support pedestrianization.
You shut the whole thing down, but I know that's not going to vibe for everybody.
We certainly would encourage you to explore that and if you want to come back to the committee and have us you know, look at something that'd be great and I.
Think talking to Colleen and some of the other people would be helpful.
