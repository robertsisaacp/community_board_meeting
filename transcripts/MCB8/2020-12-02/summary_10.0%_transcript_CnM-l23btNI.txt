The Covid-19 regulations, 25 of the solvents I, Think that's a compulsory thing that everybody will be applying I will be abiding by, but we certainly plan to abide by that as well.
Okay, of course, It should be asked part of the resolution that they know all the applications we put into all these, even though they should we, but this good that we can put it in all the applications.
I tend to not want to put this in the resolution because everybody knows what's going on and.
Okay, all in favor, okay, The way we're going to do this if any of the members just want to disapprove or not go along with it, raise your hand.
Please well, There is what we're going to basically say is that we approve their application, with the proviso that they obey the Covid-19 rules.
Max, even if we don't say that they're not no longer legal or illegal, we should also make sure that the restaurants comply with the rules pertaining to e-bikes, because we all know the delivery guys are on the sidewalks and going the wrong way.
For 38, years, Massimo and Mauro have been operating Uva at 1486 and 1484 for about 35 years, they're they've been in the neighborhood for a long time, I'm sure everybody here knows them and they're.
First of all, We want to thank the community board and the members for you know for doing what you do, and you know it's been a very difficult time and there Massimo and Maro are looking to expand.
Only thing that would concern me are late hours and music, because the people who were at 1480 second avenue played loud music till very late.
303, East, 77th, street, The next item is 1482nd Avenue, so I would object to this new location only because of my concern about late hours and music, because right now there are many establishments that have liquor licenses on the block within 500 feet, 1490, 1492, 1494 and 1496, and that's just on the east side of Second Avenue, between 77th and 78th street and on the local blog next door.
Just I think that to answer your questions one at a time the address on the corner is not gonna is not.
As, you know, This would allow more seats to be available and 2020 has been a heck of a year and the main reason why we have not to say that it's an issue, but the main reason why I believe you're saying that is because we've had no indoor dining.
Of, So, I think this is quite the unique year to you, know: to.
You feel like I'm, just missing that concern, I'm just trying to explain why I think that concern will be alleviated not only with God willing, the you know the Covid-19 disappearing, but, furthermore, us having more seats.
Second time, I asked them nicer same response, the third time we called 311, because we didn't want to waste the emergency on 911, especially with you know, with the crime that has been going, on, And finally, We ended up calling 911 and the police did not come a few times because they asked what is your emergency.
We are I like to think that we run a very civilized and serious operation and definitely not about loud music.
I think the music doesn't go all the way until closing time you know, particularly if a place is going to be closing.
So you know we can stipulating an earlier kind of cut off time for any kind of live indoor music that they may have going on and.
So, you know, if the applicant's willing to say that they won't have live music.
I didn't catch the name, but a gentleman said that what if we agree to closing I, don't know no live music an hour or two hours before closing time, I'm, totally fine with that, because if someone's playing live music for that long, it's probably going to.
You're going to be, but we don't want windows and doors open if you're, playing music and really an open window past 10 o'clock is meaningless.
Yes, naturally, but I'm, but there's Al. We also have music at other establishments on the street and whose doors or windows are allowed to stay open.
Thinking of the other place, okay, I mean you're saying: Can we do 11 o'clock.
Maybe the committee might want to consider, including that, as a stipulation that if there are disputes that the restaurant or the bar will willingly participate in a program so that they can try and resolve things with their neighbors well, I think Louisades has been in contact.
I just wanted to say that it's a very friendly way to resolve things where you work out a time or you work out some kind of parameters of music or windows, or something so that it's not just the residents who are being satisfied.
It's, a voluntary program, but a willingness to participate sends a strong message that you want to be a good neighbor and that's usually I, would think well received by people.
I think we all got to see the city when it was devoid of restaurants and devoid of action on the street and I myself.
The last one I actually lived above Barney's downtown when that closed and the area very quickly degenerated and became quite a creepy and spooky environment, So I have to admit living now on second Avenue, which I've always thought had like a really neighborhood.
So when the restaurant started reopening and coming to life, It was such a resonant reminder of what a relief that is just to have those faces that you see every day, just the feeling of like somebody on the street in existence and community and when Pookie shut down, which is my neighboring property.
They are such a family, they've always looked out for me and just like nodding to their manager late at night, when I'm on the street, knowing that they're moving in to the new property I was just like.
Okay, good they've got this because I know what they are.
I have no idea what's going to happen on this block, but for me personally to know as the family business moving into that space is a huge relief.
I, think a stipulation I can support this application.
If there's a stipulation that the doors and windows must be closed at 10 pm and no music after midnight and with regard to the last gentleman who had spoke regarding some restaurants are able to do to extend the hours and so forth, and some aren't.
I would just say that it's very common for the community board to impose some kind of stipulated limitation when it comes to live music on the time that it goes.
I mean I, think live.
I mean that I think is pretty reasonable and anyway, I just wanted to make that distinction between the live, music and the pipe music and I.
Don't think any restaurants are able to stay open past 10.
And at the same time, I think you know when people are indoors and when there is indoor dining it's safer to have the windows open, right, and.
We we've got these considerations about what we're doing in terms of the temporary kind of Covid-19 related things that we have to deal with and what you know trying to tailor things to that.
You, know, I, think my preference would be to allow a kind of later time for the windows, but.
So I, think you know it makes sense to have some cut off for the windows that to me it makes sense to have it track the time for the for live.
Attorneys, always, and the situation is I, know very well, since I moved I think around 25 years ago to the community.
Mrs Brown, yes, I want to make sure I'm clear Marco made a motion to approve this application with the stipulation, correct, May I just say, one.
But I think the problem that we have now is under the Covid-19 rules, there's different stipulations, different regulations, different everything.
We've got to be careful with anything that we write that it's for two years, because they sorry well all right, so I think the basically whatever as I, understand, it.
Well, I think we all know.
Okay, so the stipulation the will be you know, approved with a stipulation of live windows and music closing at terminating at 10 o'clock, midnight, yeah, 12, o'clock, Oh, I'm, sorry, 12, o'clock, yeah.
I. Just the motion is to approve, with the stipulations that live, music and outdoor windows will be closed by 12 o'clock and to follow the current covered.
They, don't have an outdoor area, so the live music and the windows will be closed at 12 o'clock.
Very good people to have in the neighborhood and their locations have not been they're, not a bar they're, a restaurant and most of all.
And I think that anyone who's trying to do to open a new business these days should really be not only uploaded but helped because, As you all, know, we've been through so much in the restaurant industry and restaurants are shutting down all over.
This is one thing that they've stipulated to 12 o'clock, closing no music, no well, the outdoor will come later on.
I, don't know where he came up with that, but I've been a neighbor there of him for 13 years, I've been on that block for 30 years, so I just want to support him.
Well, If there's a DOB violation that goes to the building, if it's social distancing, that's something else that that's an SLA or a DOT in 311, we will have the 311 cause for the January meeting, so we will be in a better position to know what is going on with the with Ala Turka.
You know it's just that we want to find out what is going on with the 311 and.
Other thing I wanted to ask- is any possibility of waiving the 30-day notice so that I could get the application into the liquor authority as quickly as possible.
We could issue that letter waiving a 30-day notice and just know that it is a one-time thing.
Sure a lot of people know that we are a restaurant or two restaurants.
At the end of October, We had an SLA agent come in and after a lengthy inspection, we received again several violations and about a week later, our liquor license was pulled and I just again want to emphasize the fact that in the month that we've had since then, we've taken every possible measure to rectify the different violations.
I've been going to the green kitchen for 40 years on 77th street and first and then, when they opened up the place on second Avenue.
I. Think it's a good restaurant.
I was just came here to support the green kitchen because I just thought it was, You know a nice little escape and there were summertime problems, but you know living on 78th, street.
And I think it was a unique covered kind of dilemma that went on and I just wanted to give some support to the green Kitchen.
Okay, so you're still in the process of negotiating with SLA, so you've had one meeting with them: already, yes, so I just want to raise.
And I think you know there are some folks from the public, here.
Actually, My impression is that if we gave notice of the fact ordinary notice of the kind we usually do and the fact that we're going to talk about green kitchen, my guess is that we would have a lot of people coming out to talk about this, and so it seems to me that maybe we should just you know, put this off to the next meeting, and that way you know we'll be able to hear.
You know would be nice to see something in writing ahead of time about what the proposal is, that we're meant to be assessing and all that kind of stuff, so that I think that would be better.
But if we're going to be voting on it, then I think the public has a right for what we do and in this case, as Russell has stated, we haven't notified.
I would agree with Russell that we take this in January publicize it, and then we have the meeting in January first Tuesday in January, and then the public and anybody else that will come even I mean even if we say if we approve tonight the SLA isn't going to do anything for months.
You know we are only advisory, so the SLA is not going to take any notice of us anyway, especially in these days.
I, think everybody knows what's going on and everything, but at this stage I don't want to skirt around any open meeting rules and favor one side and against the other.
If you we're going to put this on over I, Think till the next meeting, I would tell you to come prepared than you are this evening.
I know that you don't want to.
You could put something along the street there on the side, like a lot of other restaurants.
