We were getting from communities acrosss the city about trash, pickup and rats, and especially during the pandemic, when people are spending more time at home, we saw in a number of neighborhoods sanitation, go up as services were being cut, and so.
In response to that, we sent this letter proposing a number of recommendations, but also asking a few questions of the department and hoping that they would be able to get a little more creative and think a little bit more outside the box, but some of their solutions, knowing that especially the time of time, budget.
They did not specifically, I do not think addressed the fines issue but said that it seemed like they were willing to work with businesses, and there are a few options that businesses can put to have trash outside of their storefronts or fronts as long as it does not block traffic, which we also know is concerned, especially with a generally crowded streetscape area.
It would be a contained area that your bids ideally would manage and then put the trash and recycles in instead of leaving them on the street, and that's something we think would would be an overall positive reform, especially freeing up a lot of that sidewalk space and hopefully helping with the rat issue as well.
I do not mean to hijack this meeting and talk about something, that's not on the agenda, but if that's something we need a sidebar and put on the end, but I do think that it does tie into sanitation, because there's stuff- That's really adding up in Carlson's park with these protests and the noise, and are we ever going to address that on this board?
The the food waste program where at the green market on 83rd street, where grow NYC used to have a lot of containers that neighborhood residents could drop off food scraps for recycling.
I live on 87th street And, I'm sure everybody knows there is a sanitation kind of headquarters, Building right on 87th in between York and First Avenue on the north side of the street, and I was just wondering if we could ask them to just have a bin put out in front of their building, where residents would happily bring lots of food scrap to them, because it's been taken away from the 83rd street farmers market because of cutbacks etc.
You know people can walk there just as easily as we used to the to the farmer's market, and they actually did that once already a couple times for me, just out of convenience, When I first was speaking to some of the guys there they're, like I, think we can ask the men, sorry, which is the institution Department of Sanitation gotcha , I, think we can do that on 87th street It's specifically for food waste, What you're, referring to exactly for food for sure.
One also pushing the city to more heavily embraced that clean curbs pilot which they said they're going to roll out, is another good step, because that would ultimately move a lot of trash and food waste off of the sidewalk into enclosed containers.
There's, a group in Hell's kitchen called check heads which is forming their own little pilot around that They're doing some organizing around that, but in general those are two kind of next steps, one being destroying the service cuts to being, hopefully embracing this bigger pilot program and as long as you're talking about corridors, I think the intersection wherever there's a subway station, because they live in the subways, too.
There's a hole in the sidewalk in front of starbucks, and they I want to ask you going back to the big belly cans that you were talking about earlier and how neighborhoods should either partner with business, improvement, districts or parks?
As a community board, we should really take up something to try to push the city to adopt these big belly trash cans, which I think are really effective, particularly around the 86th street corridor, and then one other question.
Can you just speak a little bit more on what it would look like to use some of that street space for garbage collection, So I do not know if we looked at the underground option, at least in this letter, maybe something we've looked into in the past, and I can kind of see If we've ever done any work around That, I, think kind of how they've envisioned this clean curbs program, Is that maybe on an entire block, there would be two spaces along the streetscape, which would kind of be carved.
The road have a much broader array where it's organics and other things as well included, and then that would be the kind of core space so instead of everyone putting their trash out right in front of their building on the curb that would be kind of the one hub And then you'd have the sanitation come However many spots on the block it would be, and that makes the pickup more efficient.
So I think in theory, while it might be a bigger initial outlay, hopefully over time, it would be a money- saving maneuver because of the features they're able to provide, but I'm, not exactly sure, of course, right now in this budget.
You have a question for Luke, absolutely, I, think the issue with the rats and the trash pickups.
I did not even think of the issue from the from the rats nesting inside of all the structures that people built up all over the city.
There are a lot of factors to consider, including safety, and what have you As a as a citizen, I mean it's a health issue and the more people are outside the more problematic We hear it's an issue, which is why we wrote this letter We know it is a problem, it's affecting quality of life, and we want to make sure that the city is doing everything they can to address.
We find a number of the block associations, things like that, but one of the part we get is actually for cleanup and for sanitation services in the district to help plug the gaps where, where there are not where there might be a need for additional service in the past, we've done it kind of two ways.
You want to email us or if you run a neighborhood group, you want to find ways we can try to coordinate so we'll get you details, but if it was a good time for let you know that we put 160,000 of new extra sanitation service into the district.
I introduced with my Councilmember colleague, Antonio reynosa from Brooklyn, who chairs the sanitation committee in the City Council, and it is about the organics recycling, which is composting and regular recycling, which is the stuff that many of us do in our buildings or do in our neighborhoods and before.
We are in deep and dire fiscal conditions right now here in the city, and there was ever you know, lots of things getting slashed this year when it comes to services based on the fiscal conditions of the end of pandemic and so to look at ways both to incentivize, better community composting in the city and community recycling, but also to address the possibility of cutbacks on composting and recycling in the city.
But it's also about convenience, making sure and equity Making sure that every new yorker has the opportunity to be able to do this in their neighborhood, not just our community, not just based on what neighborhood you live in or what building you live in, but to provide this sort of as a universal service here in the city, and I have to start by, as we were, there's two different.
You can bring it down, It's a really small program when it comes to how much money it costs, but it makes sure that we can do our sustainability goals here in the city If you are a good new yorker and doing the recycling and composting that you still have a place to do, it.
You know it could be any of these sites where there's a grow, NYC site or otherwise, that it would require that the city is providing funding for, but also ensuring that there are three community composting.
It also requires that there's education and outreach to educate new yorkers about how to do composting, what it is and where to go, because a lot of folks do not understand how simple it is, do not kind of get grossed out by it and maybe do not understand like the easy way to do it right in your household.
It would be required to have it so that we can start educating people in those areas about how to be able to do composting in an easy way- I mean one third of a New York City's waste stream is organic, material.
What we're looking to do and really, oh, you know, kind of standing up our goal in a cheap in a cheap and affordable way at a time in a fiscal crisis and to make sure that we are doing our job as new yorkers to be to be good, new yorkers and to make sure we're meeting our goals and just to just to talk about who's, supporting it.
What type of garbage container you have our problem right now is that we can't afford people to come and empty them, so you know making them bigger, helps and therefore emptying them less often helps, but we still have that challenge.
I had actually in a Manhattan delegation meeting with all the council members talking department of sanitation about their plans for this program, both from a community composting, side, mandatory, organics and What's.
The future of composting here in the city, which is Where, I said, I, think we should really try to affirm some of the gold here legally in law, but the there The part of that conversation was their intention to start looking at sites that could be unstaffed or unmanned on people, but to be unstaffed and to do kind of drop-.
I know I spoke to the super of our building some time ago and his concern is again the rap problem and people will drop anything in there.
And then I think it could be up to the department of sanitation to do an RFP or some other way to sort of to determine those there'll be areas where we're going to have more than three, because there's lots of folks who want to do it.
You know we can talk about a resolution on this, but I do not think we have to keep council member powers here for that.
I will say you know the legislation does talk about establishing these at least three sites and locating them, in quote a geographic area that is easily accessible, including for persons with disabilities in close proximity to public transportation, which is all good, but I think we should be mindful, of course, of you know our community district, that we have Roosevelt island, where.
If that can be worked into the final version of the of the bill, and then the third point I think, is you know, we would request that that DSNY consult with a community board about their proposed locations, because at the end, Keith was saying that that that's how they would do it that it would be sort of like a consultative, process.
If we make one that you know that we would like, we would like to say in it, And I think it's probably beneficial to the city to hear from the community boards about what's useful in and what makes sense from us.
I would not want anything going on in the park to count against our I think it's sort of a separate issue, but there's probably compost waste being or organic waste being generated in parks with people picnicking or whatever, and I think they're going to have to deal with that.
Think Manhattan island portion is pretty clear that we encourage the city to to include more than three more than three drop- off locations in each community district, and we ask that We request that the department of sanitation consult the Community Board in determining what the locations should be within the community, district, and I.
If we say we urge the department of sanitation to consult with the community boards on the locations of drop- off locations within the community, districts, I think that's also sort of generic and broadly applicable With that wording, we've still got a kind of like a city- wide application in part right And also they should consult with DOE and the parks.
I mean I sort of think that you know, like the city agencies, could sort of handle that among themselves, would be kind of my If somebody does throw in paper or something that is not organic, so You know, I'm, not an expert on composting.
I think we ought to just stick with the bins where people who are dedicated to do it would know what to do and schools where they would be lunch AIDS that would sort of be able to follow what to do.
So I think there are lots of issues in making schools collection, points.
If there are other kind of if members of the public have other items that they want to raise or just other questions that they have for And I do not know if this came up before the problems that we're all having, or at least in my neighborhood of benches, becoming trash, receptacles, and I.
If you get it, so I just want to make sure we have the information, if you're going to do it, that we have fuller information from people who know about this Is to bring in basically speakers on it and be able to ask them questions and have that inform the resolution.
