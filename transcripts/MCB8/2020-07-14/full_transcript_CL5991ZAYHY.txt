Let me know when you're ready for me to take down the agenda and get started. Okay, we're ready for you to get started all right. Would you like me to give my normal spiel about how I think I think you'll be able to recite it pretty soon? So everyone welcome to Jane and David's meeting. They will officially kick it off in a second, but I just want to give everybody heads up that everybody is muted from the beginning of the meeting, you will not be able to unmute yourself. The way that you'll be recognized is by raising your hand, through the raise hand, feature in the participants menu. If you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll see a little icon that says participants and has the number 22 next to it, open that there will be a button on the left-hand side of that menu that opens up that has raised hand. So, whenever Jane and David call for any questions or comments, you just use that feature to be recognized and then we'll go one by one down the list and unmute each of the speakers and I think that's mostly it if you're on the phone, its star, nine, to raise your hand and if anybody has questions you can always chat me through the chat box. Okay, so we're gonna start will. Could you read off the first agenda? It's on Madison Avenue, yes, 7:06, 708, Madison, Avenue, southwest corner of Madison Avenue and 63rd Street 702 and 704 Madison Avenue adjacent to the first 222 East 63rd Street around the corner from the first and they're all in the Upper East Side historic district. There are three interconnected structures: 706 708 is a neo federal style Bank, building designed by Frank Easton constructed in 1922 702 and 704 Madison Avenue and 22 East 63rd Street are designed by Paige irons, Crowley and constructed in 2014 to 2016 space Smith architects. The application is for work on the front elevation and at the roof of 706 708 Madison Avenue and for work in the front elevation and at the roof at 702 and 704 Madison and 22 East 63rd Street great. Thank you will so we're gonna get started. Is the applicant here I do see several of their representatives. There's caz this Kassar calves. You can unmute yourself, there's a button you'll have to select and cast. You can now start sharing your screen and Michael should I meet Michael. At the same time you should michelle Franck. Yes, the show I'm. So sorry, yes, okay and our mechanical engineer is with us just in case there are questions Katie tunnel. So if you want to unmute her or maybe when we get to questions, we can you can unmute her, but let me know when you're all ready for me to begin we're ready. Thank you make sure you give dimensions, measurements, etc. I will do my best and, if I forget just ask me and we'll circle back to it so great good evening, everybody I'm, kastanka, Berg, bikinis, grace bars and partners, as I mentioned Michelle frog from space smith, who is the architect of record, is on the line as well as is katie tow, henderson engineer she's, the MEP engineer, Michelle and Katie are available for questions I'm going to run through the presentation. Our clients from fermez are also on the call, as well as I said, I'll go through the presentation and if you have questions afterwards, any one of us will step in and answer questions the product is for permits who will be relocating from its flagship location at 691 Madison, one block to the south, to this collection of three buildings on 63rd and Madison. As I mentioned. This is the southwest corner of the building. Historically, a bank building at the corner and, as you noted it in the introduction, new construction dating to 2014 2016 flanking it here at 7:02, Madison, 702, 704, Medicine and 22 East 63rd Street. We will be presenting at a public hearing of landmarks, June 23, July 21st, and the scope of that review is for signage and awnings storefront and window replacement and rooftop mechanicals and railings and I'll. Take you through each aspect of the project you all may know. This is obviously you know the neighborhood very well. This is the current location of ramez's flagship, one block to the south on the northeast corner of sixty-second and Madison 1920s commercial building designed by McKim Mead white. It's actually subject to an MoU from 1984 for modification of bulk Hermes moved in 1999 and at that time, in addition to the signage that you see here, they proposed and had approved by the Commissioner by the Commission, the installation of their kallu, a which is an emblem of all their flagship stores around the world. This was approved, as I said, at a public hearing by the commissioners and in the permit for this installation. The CFA notes that this sign, or this sculpture on the roof, would be in keeping with historic advertising methods and was being keeping with a commercial character of Madison, Avenue and I point this out, because, as this store, when this store closes and the other store opens, we are proposing to install a similar statue on the roof of 706 Madison a bit of history. This photo on the left of 1923 shows the bank building the Bank of New York building as it was completed in 19:22, flanked by row. Houses on this on the south on Madison, as well as the west on 63rd Street, the 1940s tax photo shows a changing scene. These this facade was replaced in 1930, with this commercial frontage and as well by 1940. The row house on the west side had been demolished by the bank and they had taken over the side yard. 1980S designation photo from the Landmarks Commission, showing that the commercial building had been also demolished that in 1940 and replaced with a two-story extension of the bank, and then you can see this brick wall in side yard, on the 63rd Street side of the of the Bank building fast forward to current day just to look at the current conditions of the building. So again, this is the historic building at 7:06 Madison, and then this is the four-story commercial building to the south, at 702, 704, Medicine, the certificate of appropriateness and the permit for this construction designed by Paige Cowley included the demolition of that extension, construction of a four-story building, new storefront, infill signage and construction of the building on 63rd Street. One significant thing to note, which I'll come back to later in the presentation, is that this proposal has approved did not include any mechanical equipment for the entire complex. The idea was that the architecture was approved and that when the building was tenant, 'add the mechanical systems would be designed and proposed as part of that future work. So that is part of what we are presenting to you this evening, turning the corner on 63rd Street, again, the original historic Bank building and then the 19. Sorry, the 2014, 2016, 5 story, building filling in that one yard: a 1, one-story fence and side yard storefront and fill in polished brass here on 63rd, as well as on Madison Avenue. So turning to our proposal, this is an existing photo on the left and then a render view on right and just to give you a sedative bless. You a view of the scope of work at 702 704, replacing the existing infill, a storefront in filled with new infill matching the detailing and configuration, but in a dark painted metal and signage of the sign band. Installing awnings of the second floor here and around 706, replacing the entry door at 7:06 and replacing the replacement wood windows at the ground floor of 706, the installation of a cabaret at the corner, and then mechanical equipment and railings that are not visible in this photo we'll get into details of each of those. In just a moment. Looking at this existing photo and then an elevation sort of similar scope, I'm not going to spend much time here. Most of the changes are occurring at the ground level of the storefronts and the entry, as well as the rooftop mechanicals, and then, of course, the Kelly on the roof 706, the 63rd Street elevation again, as I mentioned, replacing the windows replacing the door here, the side, entry on 63rd, a new storefront infill at the base of the 63rd Street entry here, I'm. Turning to the details of the main entry, as I said to 706 Madison currently has a wood door. This door dates to the recent rehabilitation of the building. It had been shorter when there was a step here that step was removed for accessibility and that door was reconstructed, and so this is a new door. The proposal really for transparency and visibility into the store is to replace the wood doors with a paneled glass paired door. So you can see these are actually beveled glass panels set into a set into the Leafs and then a kick plate at the bottom. So you see it sort of in rendered elevation for line drawings and then in plan. These are the swing doors here and then an interior vestibule, which will provide security for the store on the interior. We're also proposing to remove these railings, which served a function. When was a step here, but now no longer serve a function. One thing I want to just go back just to point out that I neglected to mention and I think it's clear in these photographs. Currently, when you look at this photo, you can see the windowsills are at about five feet. So one of the reasons that we're proposing to replace this opaque wood door with a glass door is to allow for views actually into the store from passers-by on the street, and so you can see this person walking by on Madison and then similarly, here on 63rd, just given the height of these sills, one doesn't see into the store from the sidewalk, so there's a desire for improved transparency at the main entry on Madison and on 63rd Street, the other piece of the work at the entrance. Presently there is a sign that says the Bank of New York carved into a horrible panel. The proposal is to put a new marble panel in front of that not removing the historic sign, but actually installing a new marble panel with stainless steel letters 7 inches tall. These letters are not illuminated and set on to a panel a little bit of detail on that. So the existing sign panel here and the new paneled sign sitting in front of it, and you can see it in section with dimensional letters not eliminated continuing to the storefront work on the base of 702 704 Madison. Presently there are brass polished, brass, storefront infill. The proposal is to replace that with painted metal, storefronts matching the configuration of the existing in a dark charcoal black finish again: 7 inch tall, non-illuminated letters in stainless attached to the sign bands above each of the storefront panels, decal signage as well, on the storefront doors and typical installations in that regard. Turning to the 60 the base of the 63rd Street side of the building. So presently again the polished brass infill, that's the existing, and this is the condition and then in clan you can see. Presently there is a an egress door here in a partial wall which is set back from the window, given the needs for security and also marrying the needs for egress. Our proposal on the interior is to create a security office here off the side, entry of the building and in doing so we're proposing to shift of this wall forward and create a vitrine. So this will be a display with immense scarves in the window and it will be a sort of an enclosed between so that one doesn't see into the sort of egress corridor and security area, but we'll have something actually attractive to look at so and then a metal door solid. There were again to preclude views into this egress chord. The transoms will be back painted again to mask some of the systems and things that are up in the ceiling above this part of the interior sort of back of house area for building turning to the windows, so the windows at the base of 706 Madison. Again, these were replaced in the page cally scheme. They are wood windows. At present, we are proposing to match the configuration, the profiles, the color and dimensions of these wood windows, but in steel, and the reason for that is for security. It's very important to provide a secure security at the base of the building, and these wood windows do not provide security as required that the steel windows do. We have a series of details. These have been updated from what we sent to you previously, but you can see now properly drawn in section we're matching the brick mold here. This is the existing on the left that proposed on the right dimensions are nearly identical. The muntins or 5/8 of an inch they'll go up two by a quarter. Inch to 7/8 meeting rail two-and-a-half is just slightly larger than the two and 1/8. The other important element is that these windows will be positioned in the openings in exactly the same plane as the existing windows, which is very important, given the scale of the building and the fact that we're only proposing to change the windows at the ground floor and not. This is a planned section now looking sort of down at the windows. So this is the existing window on the left and the proposed window on the right again, you see the trim, the muntins and dimensionally. This is very close to the existing to the existing window. Other elements at 7:06 Madison at the corner building is the installation of fabric awnings with loose skirts. We are proposing a 4-inch four and a quarter inch tall logo on the flap of the skirt, and this would be at the second floor of 706 Madison, but also at the second floor of 702 704 Madison. Turning to the roof now of 706 Madison, this is the existing condition. There are two scope items to discuss at the roof. The first is, as I mentioned, the positioning of the cat lace statue at the corner, same position as at 62nd Street at the existing store, but now facing northeast as opposed to the other that faces southwest. So it is the installation of the statue and then also is show you details in a moment, the installation of a new railing taking the place of the existing the existing glass railing inboard of the ballast rod. So first the cobble yay. So you can see it stands on its own base, inboard of the stone ballast rod. There is no impact to the historic material. It stands in board and above that ballast rod. This is a photo as I showed before of the Calvi, a on 62nd Street. So, basically the same statue, because the store at 76th Street will not open until it's complete and sorry. The store at 691 Madison will not close until the one at 7:06 is ready to open. You know it is likely this will be a new statue and not a relocated version of this one. The other element is just a simple iron railing inboard of this low ballast rod and I'll show you a detail of that on this sheet. So this is a view from the roof. Looking out toward Madison Avenue, you can see an open ballast rod that doesn't meet code. For a few reasons, one the spacing between the individual ballast rods is greater than four inches, but the height of the railing is also six inches short of the code required three foot six. So the proposal is to remove the glass railing. That's there presently and install a simple iron picket railing inboard of the ballast rod and shown here so six inches taller than the top rail of the ballast rod and then just set. You can see in plan here and here inboard of the existing. The final element of the proposal is the rooftop mechanical equipment and, as I said at the outset, the current building and the current approval from 2014 anticipated rooftop mechanical equipment, but it did not include any rooftop mechanical equipment, so our client is had to sort of figure out a way to fit the equipment first within the existing roof plan and then realizing that there were some deficiencies in that an updated roof plan so showing you the existing, approved roof plan with a series of new skylights here and then some ductwork I don't know. Hopefully you can see these six points. These are structural elements meant to receive dunnage for the mechanical equipment, so the concept have been that the mechanical equipment will be in this zone and it would be to the south of the skylight, so Madison Avenue is running here. 63Rd Street is running here. This is a large elevator bulkhead and a stair bulkhead here, so this was sort of a natural place to put the mechanical equipments as planned six or seven years ago. It's on the taller portion. It's on the new construction and putting the mechanicals here allows us to not put any mechanicals on a low roof of the historic building at 7:06. One of the deficiencies, though of this plan, was that it did not account for the six-foot clearance, that's required by the fire department for mechanical for clearances around mechanical equipment. So you can see that the damage is here and the skylight is here. You didn't have six feet to circulate between the equipment, the future equipment, the skyline- and that was one of the main hurdles for the design of the mechanical equipment as part of this project. So our proposed roof plan is shown here on the right and I'll. Take you through a few components. The first and foremost you might notice. Is it's a different skylight and because of this clearance issue, we are required to actually reconstruct these skylights to allow for the proper six-foot fire department clearance around the mechanical equipment. So you see a low-slung skylight, not visible from the street, but it roughly in the same position but smaller to accommodate that clearance. The equipment there are a few component parts that are part of this review. One is a large package unit, a mechanical unit here, which is basically a whole series of air conditioning units, air handlers that are combined into a single enclosed unit, and this unit incorporates acoustical deadening and to quiet the noise. It's a single unit instead of individual units with a large acoustical screen to hide it. It's all a single packaged unit that lives here and it's pushed as far to the south as it can be, there's a taller building directly to the south, so this is sort of a logical place for it. There are smaller units here. These units serve the seller across all three buildings. This unit serves 45,000 square feet of all the above ground, first floor and, above all, the mechanical air conditioning equipment for all those floors. The ones over here just serve the cellar. There are low units here that are not visible from the street and then there's some flus and things back in this corner also not visible from the street I'll just point out that there is a catwalk here and they were quite the reason that is there is the ductwork, for this large unit comes out to the north, not visible out of the back of this unit, and it's necessary to have a catwalk over that ductwork in order to sort of get up and over to this roof level. This level is depressed at the roof levels. You don't see this, but I just wanted to sort of explain that and then I'll take you through a series of visibility. Studies where I can illustrate to you, sir, what the what elements are visible. This is just a simple drawing -, showing the new skylight three feet in height above the roof, slab, so very low profile and, as I said, not visible from the surrounding streets. So turning to the visibility of the equipment, the good news is that there is no visibility of any of the equipment directly across the street on Madison Avenue. This view here there is the tiniest point right here, and hopefully you can see with my cursor. That is the front edge right here of this large packaged unit here and then we've rendered it here. So it's just going to be a sort of medium gray, enclosed unit. This can be painted any color because of this sort of metal cladding around the unit, so we'll be painting it just a neutral, gray, color, and then you can see this historic addition on top of this row house. This blocks views from the south of all the of all the equipment on the roof. This accent metric is just illustrating sort of the different component parts and I'll. Take you through it quickly. Here's the skylight, here's the package unit, here's the elevator, bulkhead and stair bulkhead, and then the Lowe equipment on this roof and the equipment here that you don't see so I'll, then take you around the building on 63rd Street, there's a the smallest amount of visibility here. This is one of the units that serves the cellar as you move to the west. Looking back at the building, there is no visibility of mechanical equipment from this area. Turning back to the core, so now we're standing on the northeast corner of 63rd and Madison. Looking back at the building. This is our mock-up, and this is the visibility of that package unit over the parapet of the recent recently constructed building. So, as I mentioned, one of the goals has been to locate all the mechanical equipment on the new construction so that we didn't have any visible mechanical equipment above the historic pillar, heading up, Madison Avenue, looking south and southwest to elements you're, seeing here the front edge again of the packaged unit, and then here this is the equipment serving this seller so a little bit of that unit and then the rendered view obviously seen with taller buildings behind it, not silhouetted against the sky and somewhat visible, but not over the historic building and then. Finally, the last visibility study looking south from 64th Street, a long exposure here with a shorter building and the foreground. What you see here, basically, is the side of that package unit here. The catwalk that I mentioned is down here. You see a little railing on the catwalk, but this is all sitting up here. It will be painted a neutral, gray, color and hopefully will fade into the background with the taller buildings beyond and then. Finally, just a final rendering I think one thing that's important is with the scope of work, this historic building, this simple, neo, Federal Bank building, remains a distinct element in the composition, with changes really at the ground, floor windows and the door, the introduction of the cafe at the roof and the railing and the signage, and then the changes at 7:02, 704 Madison and at 63rd Street for storefront changes in signage and the rooftop mechanical equipment. So this is all now sort of bringing life into this earlier approval, and we think that, with this simple approach, we found an appropriate solution and we hope that you can curve. Thank you. Thank you. So that's your presentation. That is my presentation. Yes, thank you. Is there anyone from the public who wishes to speak to the application I'm just like from the reminder that is found through the participants menu at the bottom of your screen and you'll use the raise hand feature to ask a question: do you see anyone will from the public? I do see one and Wendy and Michael on you again. Michael was the other presentations yeah Michelle Frank? Yes, no problem like to add one item to ideas. Oh sorry, my name is Michelle Frank and I'm, the architect of record for the renovation and we've been working with Cass on this presentation. I just wanted to add one item is that there is an existing flagpole. The flagpole has been on the building for a number of years in general, MS has no use for flagpole or for the flag for itself, so we'd like to ask the possibility that the flagpole also be removed as part of the design for this for this project. Thank you. That's your only comment. It is my only comment. If there's no one else from the public, well we'll go to the community board and there's one yeah Wendy I mean I, ask for any turn yet I thanks! Well, it's a beautiful presentation. I am curious, though, about the removal you identify yourself. Hi, Wendy, Mac refer, I, live on the Upper East Side and in fact, as a child I had used the bank that had existed there, which was the original Bank, was founded by Alexander Hamilton. At any rate, it's a lovely building and it's a lovely presentation, but I am concerned about the complete removal of the historic signage designating where the bank was and can that be preserved and just moved even over to the side and a plaque something to designate part of our history. It's a very important part of our history in the nation's history. Thank you very much. That's that said she made a comment: we're gonna go to the community board members alphabetically, we'll all right. First one would be Elizabeth, Ashby, Elizabeth I do think this is a very fine presentation, I think getting rid of the flagpoles a great idea. It gets out of the sticking there for no purpose. My one regret is that the is the change of the multi pane windows. I, understand the reason and I probably will support this, but I would prefer the look of wood windows there's, particularly because this is such a great building here, but otherwise I think I'll support this Thank You Elizabeth next big Kilburn, yeah I, agree with Elizabeth I think it was an excellent presentation. I am also concerned regarding the multi paned windows. I understand the need for a retailer to be able to ensure that any possible clients or patrons can see in at all and I also am curious as to whether or not there's any way that a wooden window can be made as secure as a steel window, because I believe it was security as the reason why you were changing from wood to steel. Correct yes. Indeed, if you could respond to that, I'd appreciate it Michelle do you want to say I'd like to address the sort of detailing issue, but Michelle? Do you want to speak to the security issue? Yes, the MAS stores very often subject to vandalism or as evidence over the last few months in New York. Unfortunately, that is the case and also break-ins. The MS company has takes very great pride in the security of the buildings and in all the locations where they tried to break into the buildings. They were not successful during these last right, except in Boston, where they managed to push in the entire window. The glass didn't break, but the entire glass the glass and frame were pushed into the building. So we have a lot of experience, races and we have learned that steel windows do need to be anchored into the brick building. There is no wood window that could withstand the pressure and the threat of people throwing or even thieves breaking into the window. So the only way that we really will be able to provide a safe space is to have an a steel window or essentially a frame, a glass that is all encompasses with the steel frame that is open, like the adjacent building 70 to 74, but that it would not be in keeping with the building so we're trying to do the best possible thing by having a steel window that is essentially mimicking the existing wood frame as much as possible and maintaining the mullions in the same appearance by using wood frame. I see just address the detail. Sorry just to address the detailing point, I think I certainly understand the committee members comments about wood versus steel, but I think what's important is to remember is that these are you know these windows are four years old. They are you know recent construction. They have applied montón grids, you can I, don't know how. If you can see this clearly, I can zoom in you know they have insulated glass and applied muntin grids on the front and the back- and that is you know the detailing is very similar. The profile of the applied mutton that we're proposing we'll also be installing a spacer bar actually between the front and back applied mounted, so it actually reads like a true divided light from a distance. Sorry from close up so I think well, there is a definite difference in material. The finish for these two windows will be the same finish as the wood windows on the second floor and I think just understanding sort of how these are not 1920s wood windows. These are 2015 wood windows, so I think the Delta between the existing wood window and the proposed steel window actually will be quite modest. Thank you well, I'd, like to add I'd like to add sorry that the existing wood trim, that is on top and bottom of the window at the existing on the Left. We are maintaining that or replacing that on the top as well, so that the aesthetic appearance of the of the frame of the window and as the window as it meets, the break is going to be identical to the existing window and there will be wood. So yes, thank you. Thank you. The other question that I had deals with the mechanical equipment- and you said weather was from the southwest or any of the visibility would be very small. How do you define that if we're standing on Madison right at what point does that visibility line stuff so I just rather say, there's a tiny bit of visibility here, but when you stand across the street there is none and then similar on 63rd Street. You know this is I, don't know if we would characterize this as minimal or not, but this is pretty limited. This is just the front edge of this enclosure and remembering this you know pretty much. All of the air conditioning is handled by this unit for the entire complex. Almost you know 40,000 square feet as you move up, you know again, I'm, not sure this seems pretty modest or minimal. As you get to 64th Street. There is more visibility for sure, but then I think you start seeing this sort of in the context of the city beyond, so it has less of an effect on the building. So does that answer your question? It does. Thank you very much. Ok, very good, that's it Jane, Thank, You Gail next would be Michelle Birnbaum, so I lost all dishes. Thank you. A couple of questions. Can you tell me how much were you where you say when you get fourth Street and you see the most? That's the point where it's most visible, how many feet or inches is actually visible above the roof line or above the fencing, so notice. How much of this are you? What is that? How would you it's about half of the size of the unit and the unit is about a total of twelve feet or eleven foot? Six, so I would say it's about. Half of that, so we'd be looking at about six feet above the fencing. Well, if I may add, is that the more the further back you move up on Madison Avenue, the more the building behind the 702 704 would become apparent, and there is a wall just adjacent to our air conditioning unit. You can see in the axonometry of the yellow box there just next to that unit, there's an existing building that is taller, then our as this yeah we talked about when you're going north right. So you swell do that piece. Yes, this is this. Is the beginning: what's that seen to that building? No but I! Think as you get north, what happens is you'll see a little bit more, but eventually this line will eclipse the building. So yes, that is true so at its maximum. What are you looking at about eight feet? Yes, I would say so. Okay also you're talking about awnings on the first and second floor. Can you tell me the dimensions of them? What kind they are and what fabric what color sure? So they are there they're just a fabric, they're a fabric, wanting the. Let me go to the awning details, so it's called trol. It's a. Can you see this color okay, so it's just a sort of beige with a little logo on the on the flap. These are detailed as unframed balances, so they'll be loose. The lots of emotion to them and the logo is, it's called that it for it a four and a quarter inches at night, but they're not retractable. No they're, not it works. Okay, yeah retractable warnings is that they housing to hold the retractable. Yes, bigger gets huge, so these are various. You can see how slender these are painted metal. So on the facades of the building, can you just go back to the rendering where we see how many windows there are on both the Madison Avenue and the 63rd Street side, because okay, so now, if you're, starting from the southernmost building the ones south of the bank and you're going to have awnings on that building, plus the bank building and around the side of the bank building and on to the new building on 63rd Street there no awnings on 63rd? Oh, so that's counting about what two four six or so there seven eight nine and then there's about another five. So you got about 13 or 14 windows on the second floor and if each of them are going to have awnings and each of them is going to have a logo as well- yes, that's I mean I, love, awnings, but I'm just thinking, that's an awful lot of warning and an awful lot of logo. How deep is that awning again from the end to the brick three foot, two, all right and notice, there are no sides on them and you're having it on the first floor as well correct mornings on the first floor as well. No none! Oh just the second floor. Yes, okay, nothing! On the first floor, all right. What are the question when we go to the windows on the first floor that you're replacing to become steel? They are remaining multi light. What are they 6 over 6 or 8 over 8, 12 or 12 over 12, but you're? Keeping? That is that correct? Absolutely, yes, you're, keeping that okay I! Think! That's probably it all right! Thank you very much, Thank You, Michelle, oh I, know. Excuse me one more thing. I happen to agree about the bank sign. Although I recognize that you're not destroying it but you're, putting the Hermes sign on top of it, if it's feasible is when I looked at the overlay, the Hermes sign looked as though it was a different shape, a different dimension than the bank. One like. If you look at the Hermes, it looks less elongated. You know the horizontal measure looks smaller than the Bank of New York. Horizontal measure is that true, yes, that would be true and the MS logo is consistent throughout there, their branding right. So then, how do you cover the Bank of New York? Sign with that, because they say there is a new piece of Marvel that is placed in front of the you're gonna cover it and then put the new one on top of it. Yes, is there any way you can move that Bank of New York I understand you want your logo above your front door. That makes sense, but it's such a wonderful historic sign. Is there any room above it? Is there any room on the side? If you go to the full front picture, we can see what the distance is from the Bank of New York sign to the first floor window. The other thing I will say, having worked on you know with Marvel material in New York City is that Marvel not a very good building material for the city, and while it's you know it's only a hundred years old. You know the idea of removing this and it's unclear how it's built, but removing this I would be afraid that it would actually fracture but I think you know what we're proposing is not eliminating. This sign. I think you know we, the team actually talked quite a bit about this and we all felt it was important to keep it and perhaps someday your meds won't be there I, don't know that the Bank of New York would come back, but that sign will always be there and that's important I think as a sort of I appreciate that. But of course no one will know, but it will be there. I was trying to figure out a way for somebody to know and actually see it. So if you can examine that anywhere else is on the building, I would I would appreciate that also I mean it won't change. My vote on the on the project, but I would like to see that happen and also about the flagpole I feel a little differently than some others. I would like to see you keep it I think everybody recognizes it as a flagpole. Everybody recognizes that at one time or another that may or may not have been a flag there and I think it belongs on the building and I think it would be a shame for you to remove it. Is that it Michelle? Yes, it is. Do you have any thoughts about that? The application is to remove it. I understand, I'm, asked well I'm asking for some input on a reconsideration casts. You have any comments. You know this is a preference entity on the part of our clients, so we can speak to them about that, but I think at the moment the proposal is to eliminate it. Thank you. Well, we can go. Thank you Michelle. We can go to the next board member. That is our board. Chair Aleta Campion, thank you first I know page Kali I've had dinner with her, so just as a I, don't even know, if that's a disclosure second I would expect Hermes to do something, refined and elegant, and they certainly did I like it. I, really like the doors as well and I understand about the windows a little while ago. There was an application at an or remember if it was this building on one further north, where they put snow removal into the sidewalk. This is the building. This is the building with the snow removal in the sidewalk snow melt. Yes, all right, so you'll be dealing with all of that maintenance right, yes, okay, yes, okay and then I do think it's a little bit visible from 64th Street I, it's hard for me to judge about it, blending into the skyline and I trust that you would pick as neutral, whether it's gray or something else that just blends in somehow to the building that it's that it's next to and I also agree. I have to say, with the idea of some kind of historic plaque, I like to read them when I see them, so maybe the space on 63rd Street, it looks like there's more brick, I, don't know how Hermes would feel about it, but it would be a nice thing, given the historic value of the of the building. Thank you Cosme. Would you please go to the elevation of the sixty sweet side. I mean those dark, I, don't know historic value, I meant of the building, but just of the entity itself. Not yes, there isn't. There is a sign over the 63rd Street door that we were planning to keep. Thank you. So this is so this entry here. Let me see if I can zoom in here. Sorry give me just a moment, while my reasons it's hard to see in this, but this also has the same signage s. Oh yes, yeah and you're. Not changing that and putting we're not changing that one okay. So then for me that would work I still like historic plaques, but I appreciate that you're keeping there. Thank you yeah, and we understand the need for maintaining it and that's why we, as cars mentioned, we plan on leaving the existing one within the wall and putting our new one in front of it and in the Madison side, you're like to say Bank of New York. Okay! Thank you. Yes, thank you, a leader, thank you. So after Aleta is Anthony all right, four things in no particular order. The flagpole, unless I miss, remember, does not appear in the 1939-40 tax photo. So it is a relatively new addition and I think it's fine to lose it. The eye I think it would I think having the sign. Excuse me on the side. Street is perfectly appropriate and maybe that makes the whole issue go away. I think that leaving the doing something with the existing sign in front would only Mar the original design which adding a piece of marble over it really doesn't. I do have I think the visibility of the mechanical equipment might be upsetting for a week or two, but is not I, think not significant and certainly has nothing to do with the real historic building the and then. Finally, a question are the new windows fixed sort of like fake one over ones at 12 or 12, right I think they can be operable, but I don't think they will be operated because they correct for air conditioning purposes. We don't need them. No I understand that it was actually a question. Curiosity! Okay, that's it! Thank you. If I may just read the sign on 63rd Street, it does have some signage over it and the text a cast I sent I emailed this you the image also- and this is what it says this building was erected by the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company ad 1922. That is what the 63rd Street sign says. So I suspect that the 60 that the Madison Abbey sang was Alta to say, Bank of New York rather than New, York trust, and actually we've done some research to the bank and the trust company actually merged. In 1922, so that explains the two different signs and the information. Thank you well, who comes after Anthony, Marco, I, think it's how that you know I'm sorry but I Sarah's, not here today. Okay, thank you, oh well. In general turn, the application is fine. I, don't think it's something he tones. Is the union a hundred tons 400 tons? Okay, thank you. The situation. What I? Let me call my attention, is the entrance door, if you see the entrance or on Madison Avenue you're, replacing or glass to keep transparency for your business, but on the city. Third street des moines, painting the consistency of a black door, which is basically I, think that's right into the oil, but that made me feel a little bit uncomfortable that part. Only the rest is pretty much you'll, be there a very good job, I mean that kind of sales. Anything more about, except that part. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Marco will, after Marco is Christina Davis Christina. Thank you. Thank you so much well, thank you for this beautiful renovation and your contribution to the elegance of Madison Avenue. We really appreciate it and for those on the committee possibly will understand the importance of the security of Hermes. If they didn't see it on the news mhm, they should look on YouTube for the incredible vandalism against their building, and the group of people in the one young man who had a crowbar it appeared to be who kept beating at their window would walk away and came back again and again, it's the most extraordinary thing, so one can fully understand, unfortunately, necessity for their security and their attention to it and I'm delighted to that you're moving to a bigger space, I love shopping there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Christina and when they Kimberly's away the one question I have overall I'm in favor of this presentation and I echo. Most of the comments that my colleagues have made the last page that you showed that had the full rendering I. Maybe it's my lack of understanding, but does it reflect that metal edition? You are going to add to the railing on top or is that simply not visible at all? From this perspective, I think it's imperceptible. From this perspective. It's inboard and it's dark I, don't think you notice it from this perspective. It's only six inches taller than this, so it's close in I, don't think you'd see it it's. It looks like the light blue that your elected there I'm not painted black yeah I'm, not sure. Okay. Thank you for answering my question. Nothing else, Jane Thank You Kimberly. Thank you is that everyone will. It is well I want to speak to I'm gonna even go for the metal windows, but I cannot go for the covering up of the original Bank of New. York saw how many windows are there along Madison and along 63rd Street? How many are needs and their signage also on the adjacent building on Madison there's the logo that will be on every single awning there's the logo is going to be on the new, transparent glass doors with the beveled glass that Bank of New York sign there plenty of buildings, old buildings, reused for other purposes that have the original signage and just keep it. The discreet, original signage I just cannot support covering up that Bank of New York sign. Given the history of that Bank, Alexander Hamilton and the beauty of Madison Avenue and as Aleta athelete said, everyone is kind of interested in what these buildings used to be. So that's my only comment and I'll defer today, but now I just quickly pick up the ones before I get to the sign. I think the awnings are okay, I, think the repetition is fine. It's decorative and I have no problem with I could remove the flagpole as Anthony explained, I, don't see any reason for it and a flagpole without a flag on it. I think is a mistake. I, like the mechanical to be a little bit less, but I think, as Cass pointed out, eventually we'll just get used to it. Unless it was Michelle. Is that two weeks old two weeks and we all notice it- you bring up a good point about the sign. I keep thinking about the sign and I probably won't have a decision until it's time to vote. But let me say this would be nice to keep the sign, but it wouldn't preclude my voting in favor of the project if the sign is covered. Since we do have the other sign- and this other sides of secondary elevation now I understand, there is a secondary on the other side of the coin is no matter how you cut the cake. This is now our mess and it's not the Bank of New York anymore. So, yes, it would be nice to keep it, but I don't feel Jane as strongly as you do that you know. For me, it's covering the sign is okay. Ramez was happy with leaving the Bank of New York. That would be nice, but I'm not going to vote against it because they're covering the sign I have one last question of the applicant on that North facing side where the visibility of the mechanicals is more apparent. Is it I know Michelle raised the issue? Is that six feet or eight feet above the roof line when it's at its most visible I think we're estimating eight feet? Okay, that was my question. I'm not gonna fight, City Hall on the signage I think ermes is so well known all over the world everywhere. I certainly feel that people would know it was air may is without the air may sign above the door, so I'm going to have to abstain on this application, but I think it's a move to approve. Can we have somebody introduce a resolution? Lolita has her hand up. Actually it was it's not to formulate a resolution, but to ask, since there seems to be a lot of sentiment about the sign, if we could have it be separate from the rest of the application to preserve the original sign. Are you happy to do that? Aleta? Thank you. So we're gonna divide the resolution into two parts. It's all the work to be done. That's outlined in the application, except for the signage above the door, the existing signage to be replaced or to be covered over. Does anybody want to introduce a resolution I'll introduce the resolution to approve the building, with the exception of the sign? Second, so I think we can call the roll. Will. Okay, give me one second to get the vote sheet up, so everybody can see it yeah quickly, go through and I'm mute everybody. So as I do. Please just confirm it and now read the roll yeah Elizabeth Ashby. Yes, thank you, Gail Baron, yes, Michelle is probably still muted, Michelle, yes yeah. This is on the first part you're talking about this is an approval for the vault for the whole project, with the exception of the sign. Yes, okay, yes, okay, Aleta! Yes, thank you! Anthony! Yes, David! Yes, Jane! Yes, Marco, yes, Christina, yes and Kim! Yes, okay, unanimous! Thank you! Well! Now we can move to the second part just and which is the signage. Does anybody want to introduce a resolution about that? David? How about you Bobby, Thank You these days, you sign remain visible and not be covered. Zero. Second, thank you. Hmm all right I'll go back down the roll just for item one disapproval of signage. It's okay, I! Guess you could put it that way! It's that with that the week we the applicant, retains the original signage visible. Okay, it's not a matter of retaining it. It's a matter of keeping it visible is that in the resolution yeah retaining visibly original signage. Okay. This is just for our internal clarify, yes, so Elizabeth! Yes, thank you, Gail yeah, Jane, I'm, sorry, Michelle, yes, David, yes, Jane, yes, Marco, yes, Christina, no and Kimberly yeah, who may have missed herself again, Kimberly, yes, I'm! So sorry, that's! Okay! Now you can remove yourselves we're coming up the side of Mount, believe it that's for Jane David to decide. Thank you well! Thank you. Everyone! Thank you to the applicant for a lovely presentation. Now we can move along to item two I'm just going to remute everybody for a second and that I'll find the applicants for item two all right. The applicant is being represented by Brian Conley correct. Can you hear me? Okay? Yes, David you have to unmute as well. Okay, here you right now David push the button on your screen to confirm I'm, very happy to let you read it, but if you want me to I, do not mind an 83 Albany 89 to 90 of streets, expanded Carnegie, Hill, historic district Jeffrey, our car Ogden I've been Condon LLC, Brian, J, Connelly architect. Those are style townhouse designed by Turner and Killian, and built in 1901 o2, with significant alterations by optic Todman in 1913, 15 application to installed a low wall and railing at the front of the building. So we're ready for your presentation just confirm your serum you're seeing the shared screen at this moment. Yes, we are okay, so my name is Brian Connolly, the architect of record for the property at 1083 Fifth Avenue. The proposal is for the creation of a new limestone wall railing with the view to creating a typical transition zone that you would normally find between the public realm of the sidewalk and the private realm of a. In addition, we're playing to the Department of Transport to replace the defective and discordant sidewalk in the course of this presentation, we're going to walk you through several examples of this type of feature in front of townhouses, on Fifth Avenue and in the immediate neighborhood, and we're also going to sort of show how the proposed encroachment onto the sidewalk it's significantly less than we're. Seeing and many other adjacent townhouse property is on Fifth Avenue I, just like to mention briefly about the format we initially submitted this to the Department of Transportation. The first few sheets are in the required sequence that D-O-T requires. They asked us to take the project to landmarks, who in turn, asked us to take it to you. So the second group of sheets are those required for the landmarks presentation. So we'll just ask you to bear with me if I have to toggle back and forth, occasionally between the initial Department of Transport sheets and the land sheets, you say: are you saying that DRT has accepted? This D-O-T did not give us any comments. They said that the first step was to determine whether or landmarks will find it except altum Utley. We need both it's similar to going to the DOB the deal. We won't review things that have a zoning implication until landmarks review. Things do be signed off in this case. Dod wants landmarks in first and keep in mind that D-O-T will give any approval only under revocable consents. So, even if they approve it, they could ask for it to be removed at some future date. So at this point, they're merely looking for aesthetic input from the two agencies, so I just want to say a few words about the typology of Manhattan townhouses, as I mentioned earlier. Typically, they have a transition zone in front and that's often in the form of several steps. In some case, it's a full-blown stoop. In other instances, it's a low wall, and/or railings, certainly planting is common. In some cases, it's a combination of some or all of those things, but there's typically a transition zone that allows some sort of sense of security and some graduated phasing from the public to the private realm. This particular property had a transition zone and I'm going to show you that on other slides at some points the building was converted to a carriage house, at which point they lost the transition zone to allow vehicular access. So what I'd like to do, as I said, I need to move back and forth between some slides, but if we could go to page 9, we'll see the history first, so I'll go to this ninth sheet, just waiting for it to load. Okay. So on this page we see the various iterations and evolution of the 1083 5th Avenue. Building in the first photograph on the top-left 1083 is the one on the extreme left. The building on the right of that photograph is 1080. The next ones are 1081 1082 and 1080. 310, 81, 82 and 83 were all built together. At the same time, by the same architect, all three had transition zone, enclosures of the form of railings and masonry walls. They also had three steps up to them at that stage. The initial first, the first floors were originally slightly higher than the street levels, and you can see a slightly better version of that in the second photograph which I'm zooming into you can see the railings and transition zones all three of those properties, the next photograph and window over to is from about 1915. This was after Ogden, Codman renovated, 1083 Fifth Avenue. You can just barely see on the left of that photograph that the transition zone was eliminated at that stage. The reason that was done was that 1083 Fifth Avenue was physically connected to 3 East 89th Street. Both properties together form an l-shaped residence with two distinct entrances, the owner. At that time, Archer Huntington. He used the 89th Street entrance for pedestrians and visitors. He used the Fifth Avenue and, as a carriage entrance I'm gonna move down to the tax photograph from 1940 and in this photograph you can see the entrance, as was modified by Ogden. Codman Carlin did two things at the stage he created the wider entrance that was used for carriages at 1083, Fifth Avenue to facilitate those carriages. He eliminated the walled enclosure in front of 1083. Well, you can see that they still existed on the adjoining 1082 building. The other thing Coughlin did was he eliminated the steps that led into 1083, because he lowered the first floor to sidewalk level to facilitate the carriage and the next picture to the right of that is the building. As it looks today, Archer Huntington deeded the buildings to the National Academy of Design who've, been using it who had used for several decades until about two years ago, when they sold all three of the properties in this area. The crew during the National Academy of designs, residency in the building. They modified the first floor. In particular, they sort of changed it to a commercial storefront, there's a metal and glass storefront, and they also dropped the windows on the left and right side. The nature of this proposal is to turn 1083 back into a single-family residence that work is currently underway on site with DOB and landmarks approval. This is the first application we're making for work to the exterior of the building. Hence we're coming before your organization, but 1083 is no longer connected to three East. Eighty nine they're, both now separate properties. So it's important to restore this building to one that has a dignified residential entrance rather than the commercial entrance. That's there now part of the work we're proposing is to change the doors out to replicate the historic doors that were on 1083 when Ogden Codman redesigned the building. We found those drawings at Avery library and the intention is to replicate those wood doors that the wood door application is a separate application. That's not part of this particular work, but the other component of restoring this building to a residential is to give it the transition zone that residential buildings typically had in today go back to page 1 and we'll largely go through the drawings and sequence from here, just waiting for the okay. So, as I pointed out, the building today has a commercial entrance and it no longer has the transition zone. If you see in the middle photograph on the right, you'll see a planter on adjacent co-op, building, 1082 lower photographs show the adjacent planter on 1080 Fifth Avenue from two angles. We're mentioning that, for a couple of reasons is because we're using the projection of the 1080 planter as a starting point for some of the work that we want to do. I'm going to move to page 3 and page 3 shows the existing conditions on the sidewalk in front of 1083. The sidewalk is 25 feet wide. It's currently free of obstructions, except for a security lamppost down here in the lower left-hand corner, but for the most part the full 25 feet is there, except for the projecting bow front of the facade, which is an allowable encroachment on to the sidewalk. It's been grandfathered since the building was built. I want to draw your attention, in particular to this shaded area, where my cursor is and that's the footprint of the cellar space and vault below the street. We believe that's also the location where the original transition zone, low wall steps and railings occurred and that they rested directly on that and not to mention for that vault space below and the presumed mention of the transition zone above is reasonably consistent with other buildings. Nearby I'm going to go to page four and page four show us what we're proposing the new proposed work is in red, so you can see that what we did is. If you look at my cursor, we took the projection of the planter at the adjoining co-op 280. We moved across and used that roughly as our starting point for the new enclosed area, then we offset that seven feet, eight inches off the existing curve and return this back to the wall. We did that for a number of reasons. We felt that if we came out to this line here, where my cursor is that's, where the old reeling was, we felt that an encroachment that size standing on its own would seem intrusive. It worked fine when it was part of a series of row houses, as happens further down Fifth Avenue, where there's multiple houses with encroachments that align. We felt in this isolated condition going out that far or would seem unusual, and it would seem like more of an intrusion. So we set it back to the next pavement line where my cursor is now and then to easily rectangular. Like effect of it, we followed a curve of the building that brought us back to the level of the adjoining planter, so the encroachment appears relatively minimal in plan and that's done by the curved shape, rather than a rectangular shape, and it's also done by setting back approximately one full paving pattern from where we believe it was before. The other thing we did in terms of design is, we maintained the height of the railing quite low, so walking down Fifth Avenue or up Fifth Avenue in the vicinity of this building. You are, for the most part, still looking over the proposed features of the transition wall and that's much lower than some of the larger railings and definition defining zones around Marymount College, for example, in a number of other buildings in the area which still have their walls and railings. The height of the stone I can show you a more detailed drawing as we go through this, but to the height of the top of the limestone is about 30 inches and then there's approximately I know there are 11 inches on top of that, but keep in mind that between the 30 inches and the railing on top it's transparent, so the metal railing feature on the top is quite light and you can see between it and the limestone below, and then the obscure, opaque portion of limestone is about 30 inches high, which is a little lower than a conference table which is about 32. The other thing we're doing here is we're proposing that there would be loose planters behind the railing and the reason we're doing them loose is that we don't want to physically do anything hard up against the original Codman elevation. If of transport approved, the encroachment it'll be done on the revocable consent, in which point the owner would have to remove it. So we don't want to leave any scars on the landmark building at the moment and we don't want to put in physical planters that might have soil up against the building. If you look down at the plan I'm, where my cursor is, you can see that the proposed new wall and physically touched the building, there's a small gap of a few inches away from that. So if it was ever removed, it won't leave any marks on the limestone or sort of granite water table at the base of 1083 right now, I'd like to go to page five and page five I'm going to zoom out. That shows you the view that we've been talking about you can see. The Thiele proposed low wall is lower than the windows of the building. The railing gives some additional height, but it doesn't add a lot of visual both to it and the way the design is curved eases. The apparent projection act infront of the doors, which is the further point. It eases it back towards the two adjoining building. So, to achieve two things, one is to be a good sibling to the curvature of the building itself, but also, more importantly, to minimize the apparent physical impact on the street. I'm gonna go through a couple of pictures on the next page, and mainly these were done for Department of Transport requirements to sort of show comparable installations and how much of the street remains available, and what you're going to see in these photographs coming up is the degree of free sidewalk on the neighboring buildings. In many cases, in a few cases, I should say it goes down as low as about four I. Think a four foot, six in one place it's commonly around eleven or twelve feet. In a few cases, it's larger in a couple of cases, it's small or what we're proposing to do is leave a minimum of fifteen feet in front of the proposed low wall. So, even looking at these pictures here, cooper-hewitt, which is on the next block, the sidewalk averages around ten feet and there's a couple of locations where it goes down to seven, where there's light fixtures the adjoining building at ten eighty Fifth Avenue there's some points. It's choked down to twelve point five feet. If we move down further down Fifth Avenue at 87th Street, we can see there's instances of 12 feet, 15 feet I'm going to move on to the next page. These are showing a number of instances where there is a choke downs as little as 11 9 foot, 10, 8 foot, 6, 9, foot, 6, 5, foot, 9, four foot 6 at one location. There we have some 8. Some nine is showing up on the next page, there's a five foot: nine at Marymount College, there's another 5 foot, 9 further down moving down near the Irish American Historical Society, which we believe is one of the last fully projecting area waves, encroaching that deep onto Fifth Avenue at the planter that goes down to five foot nine at the sidewalk. It's nine foot, eight, as you can see in the lower left picture, so going back to my drawing we're proposing leaving 15 feet at the apex of this curve here and we're going to have 1710 at the two corners, so we're generally much greater than the average of the three sidewalks further down Fifth Avenue, as you saw in those pictures. If I go on here now to the details of the railing and low wall, we're proposed and replacing the gold and ochre colored sidewalk that was put in, we believe sometimes around the 40s and 50s I'm, not sure whether that falls under your purview but we're intending to restore the sidewalk to a color that closely matches the sidewalk on either side and getting rid of that aberration of the pattern. And then here you can see close-up details of how the wall is proposed to be built. It's going to be solid, limestone, obviously assembled in multiple pieces, but it's going to be cut line stone, not a veneer. The globes that appear at the end of each section would be solid limestone where my cursor is we're proposing a brass railing between these pictures on the next page before and then finally, on this last page here, these are a number of precedents that we identified in the immediate neighborhood. The majority of them are actually on Fifth Avenue somewhere on the side streets. In this picture, I'm showing here 1991 Fifth Avenue, that's the Irish American Historical Society. We believe from Sanborn maps that that's the original sidewalk encroachment, which came out quite far. You can also see the pattern here of using low walls with a short railing on top and curvature of walls. In this case, it's a convex. Sorry, a concave curve against a convex building facade we're proposing a convex wall against a convex facade. The next picture over is also 991 Fifth Avenue, the Irish American Historical Society, and you can see how far the encroachment is into the sidewalk we're looking to do an encroachment less than two thirds of what we're seeing at the Irish American Historical Society 973 5th Avenue is one of the color it's building beside the French Cultural Institute. They are also out about 12 feet into the sidewalk moving down onto the next row of slides here, we're just demonstrating a number of precedents in the area where curved steps, low masonry walls, low railings of top, are used in some cases. Over here on the right you'll see there was a little wall and a little stone balustrade, which will see curvature of steps in front of a curvature on a facade moving down to the next row of photographs, again low walls, plantings behind them design in the low wall. Over on the left, no photographs again, a low wall panel is limestone construction. The next one over on the right. The low wall would have catalyzed limestone design curved steps. The last low walls and plantings behind the last two are on Fifth Avenue, where there's low walls with low railings and plantings. So again, the idea is to do something that recalls the features in the neighborhood that restores a feature that was originally on a townhouse in this area and brings back the transition element. Do you expect between the public realm in the private realm in a Manhattan townhouse I, just like to add also that we worked through a number of iterations with staff at landmarks and also with the director of preservation, Jared Knowles, that took a particular interest in the project. The version we're showing to you was the one that we concluded our work with the Landmarks Preservation Commission. They have said that they intend to support it at the public hearing before the commissioners and we're looking for your feedback. At this point, I separately had submitted a letter of testimony from the architectural historian, Frances Maroney, who wrote a new to say that, in his opinion, also, the importance of a transition zone between the public and rival from public and private realms is an essential feature of a residential townhouse, and that happened. We are restoring this from commercial use back to single-family residential use and we believe the proposed addition is appropriate. For those reasons, thank you for very thorough presentation. Will, let's see if there's anyone from the public would like to comment? If you are wanting to comment on this, please raise your hand through the participants feature located at the bottom of your screen press star 9. If you are on the telephone, if it three more seconds- and it appears there is not anyone from the public who would like to speak to this I actually really quickly low. Were you trying to wave me down for this? No okay? So let's go to the committee. Let's do it in reverse order this time and we will start with Marco Tamayo, and you know you want to do the public or the public members afterwards right. Sorry, alphabetical order, starting with the regular members and then public numbers afterwards, yes, I think there. The application on the proposal is very nice. Well done very thoughtful Wow. It was I wish that I can see more joy, rather than the way that you that he, the applicants first verbally, but both. What was great. The only comment that I have in the application is from the encroachment of the sidewalk you compare with so encroachment and corrective on Ron so time most of them they the transition zone, all of them have stairs. In your case, you don't but to enhance with this transition area. I think it looks nicer beautiful, but it's too intrusive with the sidewalk. That's the only part of a fund. That is my comment. The rest is perfectly fine. Thank you. After marco, we have Anthony. Hi I am, in fact, unalterably opposed to this proposal for any one of a number of reasons, all of which I will happily enumerate and I'm. Sorry, if I'm going to take up a lot of time. First of all, I do not believe that what has become part of the public way should be removed from the public way in order to benefit a single householder. That's just sort of a basic thing. Second of all, while I am sure that mr. Connolly and his team made very thorough and complete investigations. I am absolutely not convinced that this entrance was a carriage entrance. When Ogden Codman redesigned this house, the house around the corner on 89th Street clearly has a carriage entrance was always intended to be a kind of subsidiary space to this house on Fifth Avenue. It kind of surprises me beyond my ability to accept it frankly that this was converted to a carriage entrance, which meant, in effect, that there was no pedestrian entrance to this house from the period of 1913 until it was converted to the use of the American Academy. Furthermore, one of the reasons for the projecting a fence is an area way of all of these individual townhouses, including, and maybe even especially, pertinent. The Irish American Historical Society, which is by the same original architects, was the existence of an area way and stairway separate entrance down directly to what we would call the cellar that no longer exists has not existed as far as I can tell since Ogden Codman redesigned the facade of this building, which is to say the functional purpose for extending the private property as far as possible. No longer exists and hasn't existed for a century, and finally, this is about the sort of carriage house thing there. The 1939 tax photos which predate the trans predate shortly, admittedly predate the transition from private residents to American Academy, show no curb cut on Fifth Avenue and show a curb cut in front of three East 89th Street. So it seems to me that there is something not quite right here about the entire argument and I just I just think this is the wrong thing to do. Having said that, it's a lovely presentation- it's just you're, asking us to approve something. That is the wrong thing to do. Thank you. Can I interject just on the right you may interject for the moment. Yes, we have the original. We have copies of the original Ogden Codman drawings from the Avery library and I can share the I. Can't share them with you right now, but I'm happy to share them with you afterwards. I don't have access to them right now, but they clearly show that the space inside labeled carriageway and the pair of doors were specially designed to fold not only not only to open through 90 degrees but to fold back against the two interior walls. So there was no projecting jamb to get to maximize the area for a carriage to come through, but the plan is specifically called for it. As a carriage house and Codman lowered the floor, specifically with the intent of being able to get a carriage in because the previous prior to the Codman design, the entry level was about three steps up so both in the cogman cross section and the cogman floor plan and the names that are actually used on the Codman drawings in the library. It's called carriage house and there's an internal curb that he designs around to I, guess they could pose the carriage is down inside without the water flowing further back onto the first floor. I'll need a lengthy okay. If I may, if they let me run it Anthony, please, okay, sorry, you can come back in a second I only wanted to say that we don't need a lengthy interior description. You know, we trust you as a professional, that you say those drawings label, the carriage way that it was but I will ask whether his section actually went out to the street and showed a curb cut or not. I would have to look at that right now. Anthony I am perfectly happy to stand corrected. Obviously this was a particular interest of mr. Huntington had that all of his residences be approached by carriage and that's fine, it's still the wrong thing to do to take away from the public way. Thank you. Thank you as much as possible. We don't want to have discussion. We want thank you. Both next up would be Aleta Kim one second Aleta thank you well, I have to say, I agree with Anthony to me. Let's I'll call it a transition space and I know. This is more an issue for the Transportation Committee, it's more of a moat of removing oneself from the public way to the privacy and serenity of a house which does nothing for the public. Even the design and it's you'd be beautiful. If it we're someplace else suggests arms in folding, a house and closing off the public. Arguably, all of the other spaces you referenced are about beautifying, the street or it's another entity that is no longer a private house. There somehow is a division between a private home that is separating itself to such an extent from the public. What is it about seven feet, ten feet roughly, that you're taking up right? That's it okay, so even closer to eight feet, that's a pretty large space! That's one third of the sidewalk for nothing other than to provide the family, some additional privacy and a way to remove themselves from the public on a crowded, Avenue, a crowded part of Fifth Avenue, because it's right next to a whole bunch of museums. So I don't like the design because of the suggestion that it is very closed off other than the other buildings and I had to look because of the way this works. I had to look at my own, the materials on the website, rather than what you were showing, but they look like the walls are spreading out to allow those convex stairs and you end yours is enclosing the space there's no for me, there's no public beauty in this there's no public serenity. It is entirely a way for the public for the owner of the house to remove itself and I disagree with it on the nature of the public versus the private right of way, as well as on the design. It's just it's just very closed off and I'm having a trouble a trouble just separating. It does not seem appropriate on that basis, but thank you for obviously well documented buildings in the neighborhood. Thank you, David. Well, yeah next is Michelle. Sorry I had muted myself, okay, yeah, okay, thank you very much can I. Can you tell me where the property line is here, just your property? That's the property line, something so already. The gray that you have is already past the properly property line and now you're coming out almost seven feet now, when these come to us at the our Transportation Committee of which I'm a member I traditionally turn this down when it comes as an irrevocable trust and I am pretty much usually most of the time close to all of the time. But of course, as always, it's ending waiting circumstances. I won't say that, but I'm opposed to extending beyond the property line, I see no reason for a private owner to take public space for their own benefit. It serves the community not at all now I think that it's very attractive what you've done is, if I think it's really beautiful, but it's on somebody else's land. It's on public space, so I would just oppose it. For that reason, the other question I have is the sidewalk. Now you say that you're going to beautify the sidewalk or I know you I know there are probably cracks that you're going to correct or fix or whatever, but I thought that the D-O-T had recommendations or requirements that the slabs had to be what five by five so for that I'm not quite sure what they are, but are you repairing them in piping with the D-O-T I thought it was. Is the side part of your of your landmarks presentation? The sidewalk is part of the landmarks presentation and D-O-T presentation, so who is determining the aesthetics here? My understanding is that is that there are requirements. You know that the slab has to be a certain size and what it what's the requirement here. What exactly are you doing and who's okaying and who's proposing? Will it be different from the sidewalk in front of the buildings on either side of this one? If you look at this drawing here, we did, is we serve on either side of it? Our lines are the red ones and the church side, so there was the same grid, runs through both properties right now, and the intention is to rerun the same grid through again we're not changing the that's. The gray that correct me if I'm not wrong, but I thought that a five by five was what was required. What mandated, but aside from that, what about the pattern in the cement? Are you maintaining? What's on the rest of the block? Are you keeping it all uniformed if I go back to the I? Think it's one of the last States bear with me. The intention is to restore it to if you look at the lower picture here, the adjoining building has a typical gray sidewalk in front of 1083. At some point, they put a golden coloured sand or tiny pebbles in it over time. If you look at this photograph, some sections of that were replaced and they didn't even match so there's even mismatching within the 1083 sidewalk itself, the structure below it wasn't maintained the steel rusted, causing cracks and fractures. So the sidewalk is being replaced for structural reasons over the vault and for color reasons out to the street. You can see in these photographs or Scrolls. Is that what the whole block is that gray color? Is that the whole block on either side of this? Yes, concrete? Okay, thank you after Michelle is Gail pear. Thank you. I know that you did a lot of research. I happen to have tremendous concern about not only the design but the encroachment on to the public way. I live a block and a half away. This particular block is between Cooper Hewitt and the Guggenheim Museum and normally non-endemic time. It is always extremely crowded, even though 1080 is not a particularly attractive co-op. The structure is such that it doesn't really happen to look as though, mainly because of the curvature of your building and the row house is no longer there. So you have the church on one side, 1080 on the other and yet you're coming out you're out from your property line as Michelle note it to begin with, coming out close to another eight feet and I understand that part of it is for security, knowing that building there's a way to consider having an internal vestibule which would create more security, but I just think that taking space away from the public just is inappropriate and that when this building was purchased, the owner knew that okay, here's the building it doesn't. It just looks so out of place, and so many of the other examples that you've shown have been in place. I've lived in the neighborhood for over 50 years, they've been there for the most part for over 50 years. So to me, this is just like something that you stick in the middle of two other buildings on the block and I. Just don't think it's appropriate for the either of the location or the use. Thank you. I'm after Gail is Elizabeth Ashby, yes, Ogden Codman jr. was one of the great architects of this period. He wrote on the decoration of houses with either Wharton I have three cardamon houses on my block, one of which I proposed as an individual landmark. This is very important to me. At no time does he put a fence like this in front of his buildings, you're quite right that this probably was a carriage entrance, because what he often used on his houses is that the main front door you go in there and then a very on the one across the street which he does for me, which he designed for himself. You go in with your carriage to the back of the driveway, and then your carriage is taken downstairs. The basement and the main front door is on the interior, so you get the safety in the privacy by on the interior of the building, as opposed to putting a fence on the outside. There is no fence like this in front of a carbon house. It is not characteristic of Carbon house and I think that his architecture is something that we have to respect more than great many and I think we must turn this down. The other things are not landmarks questions they may offend other people, but the fact of putting a fence in front of a cardamon house is something that I don't think we should ever accept Thank, You Elizabeth. Moving on to the public members. We also have one member one board: member who's, not a member of the committee and I do in a flag that low I did see him waving during the public session. I tried to acknowledge him, but if you want to go back to the low at any point, let me know I'm gonna go to speak unless he's got a very lengthy discussion for us, which afterwards it's good a low now or to go to the public members now. Well, he has a right to speak as a public member. If we missed him, then let's just go to him. Okay, hello you'll, have to push a button to confirm my muting towards the bottom of your screen. There will be a mute button, just click, and on that button there you go: okay, great okay, sorry, I'm technologically backward yes P did you. Did you I sent the office a photographic survey of Fifth Avenue frontages did? Are you able to just upload that and we can zip through this in one minute and blocks it's just per David's request, take a little while then we can go to the live members and then come back to lo I. Have it up right now? Can you see it? Yes? Well, what I'm trying to do is to share with everybody what Fifth Avenue frontages look like and like because I think that's a that's. This is we're talking about Fifth, Avenue and we're talking about so this we're now at 96th, Street looking north. The next slide is 96th Street, looking south and then we're gonna walk south okay, even though the historic district goes, another two blocks north we're. Okay, now we're at 95th Street and we're looking back, and this is a typical corner. This is an apartment house. Okay, next slide! Please! Now we keep going we're going from 90. Fifth, now we're gonna walk to 94th next slide. Okay, and here at the corner, is the is the is the is a great mansion, don't know Aldrich, and here we see the entrance is actually on the inside of the street, but the space, the space part of the sidewalk is a is a planted garden and that is to contribute to the public and also you'll notice, the dark, the dark wrought iron, fencing and you see that repeated okay. Can we go to the next slide? Continue on to there? You again, you see the typical pattern of the way the apartment buildings and the mansions have treated stuff too. Haven't you now we continue south next slide and once again, the next slide. We need 120 now we're at 90 third and go forward. Oh okay, now we're at 90. Second, looking back, this is a Jewish Museum. This is the Warburg mansion. There was no, there was no garden, but they did not invade the sidewalk either next slide. Please. This is the famous 1107 shift again notice: the notice that very low wrought iron fencing in the beautiful garden next slide. Please now we're at the Otto Kahn mansion, Sacred Heart School again, this exact same kind of pattern emerges next slide, please, okay! This is unusual. Here we have a narrow sidewalk. This is the Andrew. Carnegie takes mansion takes up the whole block, so we go next slide please, but it's a beautiful block. Nevertheless, next slide, please. Okay, now we're at the worth of subject block in the middle of the block is 1083. Here we see the church Church of the heavenly rest. This is directly in front of Engineers gate, and this is this is one of the most traversed blocks in Carnegie Hill. This is the way people when they're jogging or taking a walk they get to the park. This way, and it's interesting that this, the public realm has been, has been maintained all these years and have been it naturally contributed to by the church and by the corner apartment building and by the Ogden Codman building. So okay, so this, together with the next block, which is the Guggenheim forms, a kind of this special to which is a which is really an asset to the Carnegie Hill historic district. It isn't cold as such, but it's a true asset next slide. Please now we're going. This gives you a bit more detail of the Codman mansion and how it relates to the sidewalk next slide next slide, and now you see and now looking back looking back just and we see the corner of a 1080 apartment. Building next slide now we're at the Guggenheim I couldn't remove that large box next slide. Please next slide, please now we're at 88th Street. You can't see this because it's scaffolding next slide, but here again and now we're looking back from 87th Street looking north and again you see, even though there are no wrought iron fencing here, you see the planting and the very modest masonry rim next slide. Please now this is the last block, and these are more modern. These were built in the these two apartments were built in the 50s. They continue to observe the pattern: wonderful little Gardens, very low masonry and next slide. Please and then, and then these more italic fences in the middle there and in here to outline so now we're at 86th, Street and across the street, is the Metropolitan Museum historic districts and we won't go there, but go to the next slide. Please well and the next slide, okay and here and then the next slide, because here we see here, we see the mansion and that has so often been referred to the American Irish Historical Society, and we see why they needed to come out to the sidewalk so far because they needed stairs to go down. But also, if you look at it, then you're in front of this building is very open to the public and that to Gail's point and to Anthony's. Okay, that's the end of my pre education. I came along. That was very informative. Thank you. Now we're going to the public numbers, escena Davis! Yes, thank you well. I have a few questions and some comments, particularly some of the buildings that Oprah presented, were our institutions whose entrances were not on Fifth Avenue, but I want to ask for how is the landmark guiding you, because you saying Jared has become very interested in this and giving you guidance and I want to know what guidance they're giving you, which you said they were supporting and then I have a couple of questions to put it to sort of put this building in context, which I think we may have missed in some of the comments I'm just in working with them. What comments have they given to you in coming up with this sort of restrained and elegant design that you have presented, so we went through it initially as a as a notion. Would they be supportive of a planted walled area in front of the building and they were we? The second step was to present some initial sketches that were slightly different from this one, and then we worked with them to fine-tune the shape the degree of projection and the details for the materials, but in general they were supportive of the idea of a space in front of the building that they felt added Beauty not only to the building but to the street, because they felt that the building as it currently stands was somewhat denuded that it's one of the few building is in that area. That area in front that doesn't have greenery in front of this and doesn't have what lo refer to as a garden at least a green area, and their feeling was that the curved shape was more appropriate than a rectangular shape, mainly because it diminished the impact of it. And if you were to look back at some of those images, particularly the ones looking up and down the subject block, as I mentioned, the starting point and the end point of our curve are consistent with the depth and projection of the seven-foot planter in front of the 1080 co-op building. So we were starting with the same exact same way of projection, that's elsewhere on the same block and just bowing it out slightly, because if we had created a straight line at that point, it would become almost tangential to the building, and that would certainly look like an error. So this was the optimum footprint that allowed a planted area and maintained some continuity of a line that was established on an adjoining property. Yes, so here's my comment, some of the buildings that lo did mention ICP, which used to be the International Center photography, which now is a large private home. That entrance was always on the side street as the Jewish Museum and so I can understand, because in context of the building to your left is that heavenly arrest cafe, which is a very noisy place and they've spilled over with many more chairs than they're allowed now temporarily, they're allowed even more because of the outside dining. But when that wasn't in effect, they were beyond their. What they're allowed and no that's to your left to your right is not a very attractive building. Ten, eighty, it's not one of the best buildings in the city and your between those two things: a cafe a noisy cafe and ten. Eighty, so I can understand why you had to make, and now it's not a public building anymore, it's now private. So what you're saying is we are private and so you've built this sort of elegant curve around it to sort of single out now what it is, because it's changed its context, and so, while it's a very distinguished and revered architect, I can I can understand why you presented what you have, because you have to single out that building now between a noisy cafe and a white building, that is, you know not by someone that we it's not Ogden Codman, so I kept some understanding. Why the landmarks is, you know, understanding what you're trying to present and many of the buildings have larger institutions which this was and is no longer and is on Fifth Avenue, so I think we have to keep it in context. Know he's showing the encroachment of heavenly rest right, I'm showing the you know. You need to share your screen again: I'm, not getting the fare screen at the bottom of your screen is or should be green button. They're with me one thing: can you see that now? Yes, okay and this is what happens either. Customers move the tables over there. Sometimes the waitstaff do it. This was taken before the scaffolding went up recently, but it's obviously a trespass. That's hard to maintain. Thank you. I can't see it cuz I'm on the phone, but I certainly know what it looks like that's why I brought it up Kimberly subway Kimberly. Thank you, I'm, going to keep this incredibly brief in the interest of time, but I do echo the other comments about encroaching on public space in the sidewalk. So I can't support this application as it stands. No comment no comment. You do have one other board member who's here, that's not a member of the committee Billy Freeland. If you want to he's more than welcome to comment he'll comment, sorry to interrupt no way did you want to comment? You know I did not. Thank you. I would only say that it was a very well done presentation when I looked at it. I struggled with it. It's a beautiful presentation, but the other side of the coin is it is encroaching and in all deference Christina. The fact of the matter is that if they chose to live in that live in that house as a private house that doesn't give them the right necessarily to encroach into the sidewalk and I think given the Church of the heavenly just given those point about this becoming such an important public plaza. In effect those people who bought the house chose that kind of a condition, and that doesn't mean that we have to give them more privacy and they currently have they bought the house knowing what they were going to have to live with. Oh as beautiful a job as mr. Connolly did, I can't support it, so I think we'll we're ready to we. Well, we need a resolution move to disapprove. Can you hear me will? Yes, this is a move to disapprove. It is seconded by Gayle Anthony and several others before you take the vote. I just wanted. Mr. Connolly, to know that I did read Francis maroney's letter I have great respect for Francis Maroni, wonderful historian. Nobody knows the city better and if he were in the context of we're talking about an existing condition, but to create a new condition, is different, so I just want to Joan understand that at least I personally had given you the courtesy of reading that statement from Maroni. Thank you time to vote all right, we'll go down the roll starting with Elizabeth Ashby. Absolutely! Yes, all right good! This is a proposal to reject disapproval. Yes, as a disapproval, yes there's a no-kill Behrend! Yes, okay, you only brought one scare Michelle, one. Second Michelle. Yes, thank you a leader, yes Anthony, one! Second, Anthony I can't hear you sorry! Yes thank you! David! Yes, James! Yes, Marco one! Second Marco! You may have to push the button you these already. Yes! Is that a yes yeah you put a red? Oh yes, I did Sorry Christina I, think you say no and Kimberly be so you did really yes and then Billy I'm gonna. Add stain all right. That's that! Oh! Thank you! Thank you. Mr. Connolly, thank you so a presentation on three East 89th, Street and informal courtesy, presentation. Sorry, I, didn't unmute I didn't mute, everybody back. So if I didn't mute, you please thank you individual or individuals presenting 89th Street here, I see one of them, I see Christina, Pena and then Kass was here earlier today. We hear you sorry about that Cass and Christina and Jim her yes and my corpsman yep. That's us all right, but you all are unmuted or can unmute yourselves at this point. Okay, I think Jim is going to share the screen while Jim gets situated and shares his screen. I'll do just a very brief introduction. My name is Cristiano Pena and I'm here tonight, with Kat Stackelberg from Higgins quays bars, Jim, her and Mike Ormond from Raphael vignola architects, as David indicated, to share an informational presentation for the proposal for three East 89th Street, which this board has reviewed. In the past. It was presented at the Landmarks Commission and approved on June 30th, but tonight we'd like to walk through that presentation and answer any questions that you may have. Some individuals from this group did submit testimony to Landmarks Commission in writing prior to that public meeting, and we did just want to express that. We were really pleased to read in those comments and testimony that a number of neighbors continue to express their support for three East 89th Street becoming a commercial art gallery and further for the restorative work. The genie is doing for this really wonderful building, as you can imagine, of course, salon 94 Jeannie's art gallery is facing pressures, as all small businesses are confronting right now and she's really doing her best to find creative solutions amid what continues to be a really devastating time for the arts in New York City. But while a lot of businesses are closing moving online or even leaving New York City, all together, Jeannie is really remained her commitment and her resolve remains strong and she's very much looking forward to being a part, a continued part of the Carnegie Hill community and certainly part of the city's economic and cultural recovery. So she's certainly committed to continuing to positively contribute to this neighborhood she's been a Carnegie Hill resident for over a decade and she's looking to reestablish her art business here in this community that she loves so much she's, certainly eager to preserve this building. That I know so many of you are already familiar with, and it certainly needs a lot of TLC, and that is happening. We're very excited that she's taken on that we're taking on that project and certainly she's excited to realize the goal of opening this flagship gallery right across the street from the Guggenheim which, as we all know, it's such an epicenter of Contemporary Arts, not only in New York City but in the world. So with that said, I think I'll pass the mic to you, cats and we all will get started good Thank You Christiana Jim. Do you want to pull up the presentation? So what I think we're going to do tonight, particularly given the late hour? We're going to you know, go through the presentation that we made two landmarks on June 30th, we'll try and do it at a measured pace to keep moving and obviously be available for questions. Jim. Let me go to slide three, just as a summary slide, so this slide illustrates what we presented at the public hearing. My submission back in February, which feels like it was another world away, and this axial metric illustrates the overall scope of the project, including the side yard, in fills the infilling at the fifth floor and the sixth floor addition and then a section here and, as you may recall, the commissioners voted to approve the project, but without the sixth floor and their comments at that time. In terms of the program they sort of recognize the benefit of that the Atelier on the roof, and they understood how that worked with the overall program of building, but, generally speaking in terms of design, they wanted to see something that was separate and distinct and also was something that was a little more refined in terms of its design and obviously less visible. So since, following the public hearing, the design team worked with our client to develop a rooftop scheme for the sixth floor, that was smaller, it was a standalone element and would it would be more architectural II, distinctive and distinguished the setbacks are significant 10 feet from this east side of the building and then 56 feet as you'll see in a short lee from the front facade next line, we talked a bit about Christine I talked a bit about the program, it remains the same, and that is part of the modification abuse that we're proposing as part of the 74 7-eleven to allow for a commercial art gallery you can see this is the restored exhibition space. On the second floor, the GE has used before for display and then some other information. Just speaking about the way you operate your gallery and as we've discussed, the integration and collaboration between the public and the art making process is a very key component of what this project is all about, and that's a part of this proposal as it as it next one. This next slide now represents what we presented back in February and the revised proposal. So this is a one-story volume. As I mentioned, it's set back 10 feet from the east property line and 56 feet back from the front. The elevator and stair are all enclosed within this system, this volume, so it is a distinct and singular element on the roof. Obviously, the visibility is greatly reduced and will share the views of that with you too. Next slide, I'm, also to point out that the again the previous proposal and the current proposal, this two story- volume at the back that was approved by the commissioners and then has been eliminated from the proposal and what we presented at the public meeting a few weeks ago- was a slight chamfering of this side yard in fill with glazed panels to have views out to the northwest and doesn't bring some additional daylight into this interior space next slide in terms of the references for the skin of this volume on the roof. Obviously this is our property here: 3 East, 8th and 9th Street from the previous application, and from the many times we've been in front of you, I think you know the history of the building. This was built by Archer and Huntington as an extension survey and entertaining extension off of their house on Fifth Avenue completed in 1914, it became part of the National Academy of Design, complex and 1958. The studio building or annex building was constructed, and so what we've looked at is this interesting sort of cleaner equality of this later 4:19, later twentieth century insertion and the historic fabric with this diamond-shaped diapered pattern, brick and thinking about that as a as a reference and then the roof of that annex building, this sort of sawtooth skylights, the angled skylights as being a bit of a source for the articulation of the design provision and then images across the bottom of the slide. Conservatory, this geometry, the slopes, skylights and then these Victorian garden rooms, also as being a inspiration in terms of the way the lattice work works as a as a surface treatment for these spaces next slide. And then, finally, you know obviously directly across the street the Guggenheim another serve unusual, to say the least. 20Th century insertion in the in the late 19th early 20th century historic fabric, but looking at this complex skylight up at the top of Frank Lloyd Wright's interior space for the museum, other sort of diamond-shaped reference points as being sort of glazing systems for Windows and conservatories, which then obviously led Jim and Raphael to this died. Agreed I, agree system, which is a clay, enclosed sort of structural system unto itself that references. Some of those earlier images that we just looked at, but also in a very contemporary way, looks like Jim thanks Cass Jim, her from Rafael viñoly architects. Thanks for having us back to show you the updates to the to the building we, as Cass mentioned, we tried to push the sixth floor, Garden Room pavilion as far back and to limit the sight lines as much as possible. There's a few components, as Cass mentioned, that more inspirations for this vocabulary of the of the architectural one. Is this the diag red patterning of the of the glazing into this more intimate scale of millions and sashes, which will show you some details further down, as well as a skylight component which, basically, as a as a conservatory working room, covers the elevator override and stair bulkhead into one homely homogenous object, and that unifies the simplicity of the new addition and it also sits floats on top of the existing original penthouse of the of the building. And as we go through some of the view you can see. This happens to be the 89th Street View from looking from 10 85th, the alleyway, but beyond is 10834 the rotunda. And then this is what we had in February, which was which was the 5th floor library and the 6th floor artist, the residents. And then this is the new pavilion here. And then this is a picture of with the mock-up. After we did the mock-up photo and then the scaffolding you see in the front is actually as we're doing all the survey work for the facade restoration, so we're doing all the as build. So the conditioning and everything that's part of the restoration measuring for the windows and all those things as we go further to the east. 89Th Street on the left was what we previously the bulk in the massing that we had before and then we've pushed it back, 10 feet from the east and 56 feet from the front, any nice Street facade, and then this is the railing and the glazing is a which we'll talk. A little bit further is a is a low iron, clear glass, that's that is, has the least amount of reflectance that we could specify. It also has there's also insulated glass and we'll show you more details of that and then there's one slot, as we showed you in our last presentation, where the rooftop addition becomes visible here, where my cursor is in between the Guggenheim and 1080 v and on the 5th Avenue side, looking over, the cafe of the Church I've had only arrest. This is what we had before. This was the previous design, and then this is the rear edition. This is the beveled side, yard extension further back, and then this is the mock-up rendered mock-up photo and then up from the promenade up of the reservoir. The previous view on the left and then the pavilion here which basically in coping cases, the bulkheads and then this is the mock-up view that we did a few weeks ago. You know a very quick, very quick animation. So this is the view right here. You can see just the partial view, point of the of the rooftop edition in between 1080 fifth and the Guggenheim, and as we walk north and circle around the plaza condition that lo mentioned earlier to the front facade of three East 89th Street and then we'll just take a quick walk up to the to the Church of heavenly rest and see what that view looks like Beth and then going east on 89th Street, we'll take a quick look at the alleyway between 10 85th and the in the proposed pavilion there and then we're going to walk from east to west on 89th Street from the south side of the sidewalk yeah. Okay. These are, these are some details of the articulation of facade and, as you can, the on the on the right of the screen, this is actually we're. Using is a rated a fire rated shadow box, shaft wall condition along the along the lot line and the elevator override and the in the fire stair and the. So you can see that this condition within the depth of the of the glazing system behind that will be a shadow box. So this with the same glass treatment and the, and then this is the living area. Here, on the facing the South here and again, caps mentioned, we set this back fifty six feet from the street and then ten feet from the side yard. And then this sits right on top of the orig, the existing penthouse, a few details, glazed glazing details and then the jointing of the articulation of the diag rid. So the frame is reinforced and of the mullions which acts also as because the glass is actually very small. The whole wall and skylight system acts as the structure of the pavilion, and there is both translations sun shading in the horizontal and vertical surfaces, as well as privacy shades for the for the privacy of the living condition here, and then this is a section through the that happens to be through the elevator override, which shows the fire rated shaft wall and how this guy, like goes over the over act on the rear of the building we have. This is the original penthouse than the sixth floor and we removed we removed the two-story two levels of the one was the artist studio and the other was the research library and what we did. We made this side yard extension come around, so we still get the north light into those rooms into the area of the art storage, where we actually show the some of the pieces. This is for the artifacts, not for the painting. So and then this is where the research library is, and that gets the northern light into that portion of them that portion of the plant in the side yard. So, comparing on the top row, comparing the that the new floor plan to the previous plan, which is in pink, where we had on the visit, the only levels that have changed nothing else changed. We have the two storey to storey. High studio object that we that we took out place that with just a roof terrace and then the both on the fourth and fifth floors and then on the top level. This is the residents compared to where we had it before it's basically about half a little more than half the size in section. What we had before was the sixth floor residents, with the there's, the elevator bulkhead on the other side, and then the stair bulkhead on this side and what we've done is: we've relocated the mechanical equipment and then we've encased the skylight of the of the pavilion over the bulkheads of the stair and the of the elevator in and blue in the blue area, for the elevations as a comparison before and the new elevation on the rear facing north and then going working our way around to the to the West elevation. Basically, the pavilion basically just covers the we lowered they bulkhead and wrapped it around with the new pavilion and then facing the South facade is the new pavilions on the right and then on the easterly. We took off the bulk of the mass here and then pushed push everything back to where the existing penthouse is. The materials haven't really changed, that the glass is a low iron, low iron, clear glass insulated with a low e coating, and then the everything else is pretty much the same as what we had carved: limestone sills and header courses and then the fifth floor. Infill was the cement stucco and then the brick, the brick coursing, which was part of the lower part of the side, yard, extension and I. Think that's it. Thank you. Is there anybody who would like to comment? I, don't know if there's anybody in the public, because I'd like to keep this fairly quick since we're not ruling on this. If there is anyone in the public who would like to speak about this, please raise your hand through the participants feature at the bottom of your screen or hit star nine on the phone low wave of me. If you remember we're not ruling on this, don't take time unnecessarily. Okay, I just see a leaders, hand up, then, okay, so we will go to the committee and, let's just take them in alphabetical order. Okay, right now, the only person with their hand up was Aleta but she'll read it later. Everyone. Thank you. So I have a couple questions. One did the applicant receive the invitation from CBA to come back and present to us before he went to Landmarks I can respond to that I believe that we received a letter from CBA after we had been calendered for public meeting with the Landmarks Commission? Okay? Well, you could have postponed it and come and talk to us and presented to us, so that to me says that the applicant herself Jeanne is not so interested in being a member of the community or a good, maybe or you would have come back with our invitation. Second of all, what you did in your slides was compare your current design to the design that was rejected by landmarks in February or March right, so that, instead of starting from scratch, you make it look so much better than something that was already not acceptable. So it's kind of an apples and oranges situation to me. It's still a big glass box on the top of a beautiful building that doesn't deserve to have a big glass box on top of it and I understand everything else about the nature of the times and the financials of it. But this was certainly a design element that she had intended and had in fact presented prior to the virus crisis and the financial aftermath. So that's all I have to say about that, but it was really disappointing that you chose not to come back and even the nature of this presentation is somewhat misleading. So that's all I have to say, but thank you for coming back and presenting this now. I think it's very interesting to see the design I just feel. It's a shame that we didn't really have a chance to give our opinions, but thank you for appearing now. I should have started by saying that, because I do appreciate, you didn't have to do this, and so thank you for spending your time doing it. If I can just very momentarily respond, I do believe it after the request was made to appear at this hearing or this meeting pre LPC I believe we did indicate that we would be happy to meet with the landmarks committee for a presentation prior to the June 30th calendar, but it had it had it felt after you had already met in June, and so unfortunately, the calendar didn't support. That will I want to say something: I, don't know if I'm still, muted or you're good, okay, I just find that most recent explanation very disingenuous and I understand. I, don't understand the applicant simply didn't want to come back to us, it's as simple as that Aleta. So thank you for making your comments and I think we should move the agenda and I agree it's time to move the agenda again. We thank the team for coming back and explaining to us what they did and Jane I think you should take over for all business and your business. Thank you. I will as long as we're very brief. It's five after nine thank you, David, we'll we're gonna, move the agenda and go to new business. I. Think Elizabeth wanted to discuss the window master plan letter and what the next steps are. Okay, Elizabeth, yeah I meet. You have to confirm. It am I on. You are okay, yes, I just and I. Don't think we can do it now, because we haven't had any feedback from the letter but I at some stage. I thought we ought to discuss. Where do we go from here, because it's all well to get it out there? What we want them to do, too is to act on it and I. Think I assume we haven't had any response yet have every will know no response, no response directly about the letter. Okay, well, we'll probably have to meet in August because landmarks, it always seems to happen to us. Maybe we would have had a response. We can and have a more productive discussion when we know what, if anything, landmarks responds to it and then I hope we can. Perhaps we can individually make calls to into organizations and politicians who will have had it and say that we hope we can count on your support when we go before nine marks. Thank you. So your thought would be to put it on the August agenda again and just see what happens for in the intervening time frame, mm-hmm. Okay. So let's do that we'll put it on the agenda for August any other items of new business. Michelle has her hand up Michelle, yeah I have emailed you and David get just a very brief update, which would actually where Gail and I are just doing as a courtesy. It's not even necessary, but we decided we're having the forum and so Gail and I have met, will continue to meet with frequency and I just wanted to bring you up to date as to what we decided. So we have a purpose: the timing, our outreach focus and our preliminary panel and participants and sponsors. But the primary thing is the is the purpose and I'll just read it briefly, and then that that'll be the end of it. I have more to report, but I don't need to inform and educate boards and risk and residents about the importance of promoting appropriate master window plans, preserving the exterior integrity and appropriateness of pre-war or noteworthy buildings within a historic district, landmark buildings and others of the importance of preserving the historic nature and being excellent, temporary stewards of these buildings and to educate on the possible monetary benefits of preservation and repair. So we talked about when it would be Gail and I agreed and she'll comment whenever you want Gail, you know just jump in, but we agree that we would like it not to be a virtual meeting. So with that in mind, since that probably won't happen, unless we have a vaccine which probably takes us into 2021. If anything happens before that, we'll be prepared with our outline that we'd like to have it in a location that is historic in the past, when I was getting the historic district I've had meetings in one of the churches, so perhaps we can get a historic building. We want to concentrate on buildings, building boards within the historic district and individual landmarks, because we want this to be an education forum for those people who actually are stewards of buildings and can make an impact. It's not just a broad Preservation Forum that some of the elected or landlord says had, which is terrific and very educational. But our point is really to reach the people that have a say on what's happening and to stop some of the bleeding of what's happening. The abuse of these buildings, so the panel's our participants, would be you know, preservation, architects, I think our committee should have a big role here, but we'll get preservation, architects and also the sponsors of the historic. You know the neighborhood organizations, the preservation, organizations and officials, so I just wanted to let you know that we have gotten started and Gail and I will continue to meet as we move to next steps and we further define what our outreach was go is going to be and how we're going to do it and etc, and we'll just come back to you and give you updates as needed or as you request or whatever. We just wanted to keep you into the loop so Gail if I find on anything or whatever yeah. Yes, exactly what Michelle said, what we really want is to get as much input as we possibly can from the committee any board member who might be interested any member of the public, because we really it's going to take a lot of work. We have to get databases, we have to be able to identify residents in significant buildings. We have to be able to find out who the boards are, that may have a master plan, may not so any help that we can get so that whatever forum we end up with is really robust, and the bottom line is our advocacy to see what we can do to ensure in some matter in the future that master plans for Windows will be appropriate for the buildings that were addressing. Thank you, I think the idea of having an in person instead of a zoom for them I'm all for it, but we'll see what happens, see yeah. So should we put it on the agenda again for next month or just wait till you tell us to put it on. You can because we'll have you know, Michelle and I will continue to work as best we can. So we can start to give you updates. Okay, just give you will just give you updates, as needed. It'll have to do in addition to the windows. Of course, we're going to concentrate on exterior preservation, I, see a lot of people just drilling and putting security cameras on the outside of the building. I. Don't know whether or not that went through landmarks and other things so we want to educate, but we want to pinpoint we want to get to the people who are the decision-makers not just avid board base. So that's going to be the bulk of the work, but I have some experience doing that when I work for the historic district, because I had to do outreach and every one of the buildings I'm hoping those contexts it's many years now, but we'll see what I you know, what I have them, but we'll see how many of them are viable at the moment, but we'll go from there and we'll fill you in as we go Thank you Thank You, Michelle, Thank, You Gail, any other new business items alia has her hand up and Cristina Davis has her hand up. Thank you. It's not a new business item. It's a comment on the window. Master plan letter to community board so far have agreed to support us and I'm not sure what to ask them to do. In addition will and I were invited to a meeting with chair Sarah Carol from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, because we've been sending them so many letters about issues that we see and that will be at the beginning of September. So if you have anything that you would like us to raise, please feel free to send an email in the meantime and please Jane and David, and anyone else about what to ask the other supporting community boards to do and I'll reach out again to the original ones, which was not all of Manhattan. Only one thing I think the other community boards could do is send a similar letter to our letter to Sarah Carol I am: do you think that meeting with Sarah Carol should be more broad-based I'd, really like David Halpern to be there? Oh well, I will ask them if we could bring David along I. Think Oh chairs should be there. Well, if I don't love my school I, don't know what it's going to be like in September, but if I can be there David, it's you go, I will go I'll, take a sick day. I think it might be before school starts, it might be or right after Labor, Day I, don't know, but we'll see what else but anyway, just keep me informed and I would very much like to go with David to be there. Thank you, I'm is Sarah move to adjourn. You do have Christina Davis, sorry. What no one quick question a Michelle answered, part of my question: what community groups were you joining with which you you're working on that, but have we informed Gale Brewer of our intention to have this forums and she oversees the community board? Well, she's, certainly going to be. You know one of our one of the people we go to and one of the people you might consider a sponsor, so we'll certainly inform her, but I think maybe Gail and I just want to be a little further along before we reach out specifically to any elected official. But of course, she's gonna be apprised, no question anything else, Christina! No! Thank you. One thing to say: I just want to be clear that Jane and David, you were always you known far more than I do and certainly far more than will does to if I could speak for will with us headphones on. So yes, anyway, we will make the request. Thank you all right. Is there a move to adjourn move into? Second, thank you. Thank you. Everyone thank you will thank you. I just wanted to comment about 389 Street. You know they came. They made that really low in presentation, but it doesn't really matter. We were left out of the loop, it's as simple as that yeah. They know what they've got very smart people, so I didn't feel like thanking them for coming. Thank you just had to make that editorial comment, but you know in the past, in the past, with those changes they would have been sent back to us by landlords, and that is that's one of the big issues now and I would hope that one of the things you can talk to Sarah Carroll about I've written to her and I personally spoken to her asking her. If we can have the same method with the staff, as we've had with the commissioners, you know I mean I, don't see any reason wave bigger. If an applicant goes to the staff, there are usually multiple visits with the staff why the staff can't send them back to us before the staff makes their ruling. You know I, don't it's why we I'm sorry I shouldn't have said anything I think we should just move to adjourn at this point. I think we did. You are we'll see you next month, I'm sure we'll have an August meeting so to be continued maintained before you go I just want. We did send a letter to landmarks outlining it why they should come back to us. They rejected it. We did raise the testimony at their words. No I know all those things. Gail I know you and Dana leader, everyone else, so I'm going now, I'm clicking leave goodbye. I just wanted to make. You know. I know that Aleta and it's great that you did that I just didn't feel like thanking those the applicant for returning to us when they totally ignored us. You know, but I appreciate we have might be on the way so important, yeah we're on the record thanks to you a leader. Thank you. That's important, I agree bye, thank you for staying as, if that we need a paper trail for somebody might write a book about the whole thing someday. Okay, thank you very much to everyone and we'll see you in August.
