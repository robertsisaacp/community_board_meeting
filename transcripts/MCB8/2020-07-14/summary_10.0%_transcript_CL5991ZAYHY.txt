If you have questions afterwards, any one of us will step in and answer questions the product is for permits who will be relocating from its flagship location at 691 Madison one block to the south to this collection of three buildings on 63rd and Madison We will be presenting at a public hearing of landmarks, June 23, July 21st, and the scope of that review is for signage and awnings storefront and window replacement and rooftop mechanicals and railings Take you through each aspect of the project you all may know.
This is the current location of ramez's flagship, one block to the south on the northeast corner of sixty-second and Madison 1920s commercial building, designed by McKim Mead white In addition to the signage that you see here, they proposed and had approved by the Commissioner by the Commission, the installation of their kallu, a which is an emblem of all their flagship stores around the world.
And then you can see this brick wall in side yard, on the 63rd Street side of the of the Bank building fast forward to current day just to look at the current conditions of the building So again, this is the historic building at 7:06 Madison, and then this is the four-story commercial building to the south, at 702, 704, Medicine, the certificate of appropriateness and the permit for this construction designed by Paige Cowley included the demolition of that extension, construction of a four-story building, new storefront infill signage and construction of the building on 63rd Street Sorry, the 2014 2016 5 story, building filling in that one yard, a 1, one-story fence and side yard storefront and fill in polished brass here on 63rd, as well as on Madison Avenue, Installing awnings of the second floor here and around 706, replacing the entry door at 7:06 and replacing the replacement wood windows at the ground floor of 706, the installation of a cabaret at the corner, and then mechanical equipment and railings that are not visible in this photo.
These are the swing doors here and then an interior vestibule, which will provide security for the store on the interior So. One of the reasons that we're proposing to replace this opaque wood door with a glass door is to allow for views actually into the store from passers-by on the street, and so you can see this person walking by on Madison and then similarly, here on 63rd, just given the height of these sills, one doesn't see into the store from the sidewalk storefronts matching the configuration of the existing in a dark charcoal black finish: again: 7 inch tall, non-illuminated letters in stainless attached to the sign bands above each of the storefront panels, decal signage as well, on the storefront doors and typical installations.
One thing that's important is with the scope of work, this historic building, this simple, neo, Federal Bank building, remains a distinct element in the composition, with changes really at the ground, floor windows and the door, the introduction of the cafe at the roof and the railing and the signage, and then the changes at 7:02, 704 Madison and at 63rd Street for storefront changes in signage and the rooftop mechanical equipment This is all now sort of bringing life into this earlier approval, and we think that, with this simple approach, we found an appropriate solution and we hope that you can curve Is there.
That said, she made a comment: we're gonna, go to the community board members alphabetically It gets out of the sticking there for no purpose, and I probably will support this, but I would prefer the look of wood windows there's, particularly because this is such a great building here, but otherwise I think I'll support this Thank You Elizabeth next big, Kilburn and I also am curious as to whether or not there's any way that a wooden window can be made as secure as a steel window, because I believe it was security as the reason why you were changing from wood to steel Do, you want to speak to the security issue?
But when you stand across the street there is none and then similar on 63rd Street Half of that so we'd be looking at about six feet above the fencing Well, if I may add, is that the more the further back you move up on Madison Avenue, the more the building behind the 702 704 would become apparent, and there is a wall just adjacent to our air conditioning unit Yes, that is true, so at its maximum Okay, also you're talking about awnings on the first and second floor, The, lots of emotion to them and the logo is it's called that it for it a four and a quarter inches at night, but they're not retractable retractable warnings is that they housing to hold the retractable You got about 13 or 14 windows on the second floor and if each of them are going to have awnings and each of them is going to have a logo as well- and you're having it on the first floor as well correct mornings on the first floor as well, Oh just the second floor, On the first floor.
If you see the entrance or on Madison Avenue you're, replacing or glass to keep transparency for your business, but on the city, Third street des moines painting the consistency of a black door, which is basically I, think that's right into the oil, but that made me feel a little bit uncomfortable that part you'll, be there a very good job, We really appreciate it, and for those on the committee possibly will understand the importance of the security of Hermes They should look on YouTube for the incredible vandalism against their building and the group of people in the one young man who had a crowbar it appeared to be who kept beating at their window would walk away and came back again and again it's the most extraordinary thing, so one can fully understand, unfortunately, necessity for their security and their attention to it Moving to a bigger space.
If the sign is covered, That would be nice, but I'm not going to vote against it because they're covering the sign I have one last question of the applicant on that North facing side where the visibility of the mechanicals is more apparent, Is that six feet or eight feet above the roof line when it's at its most visible I, certainly feel that people would know it was air may is without the air may sign above the door, so I'm going to have to abstain on this application, but I think it's a move to approve Can. We have somebody introduce a resolution?
But if you want me to I, do not mind an 83 Albany 89 to 90 of streets, expanded Carnegie, Hill, historic district Jeffrey, our car Ogden I've been Condon LLC, Brian, J, Connelly, architect, Those are style, townhouse designed by Turner and Killian, and built in 1901 o2, with significant alterations by optic Todman in 1913 15 application to installed a low wall and railing at the front of the building.
The proposal is for the creation of a new limestone wall railing with the view to creating a typical transition zone that you would normally find between the public realm of the sidewalk and the private realm of a In addition we're playing to the Department of Transport to replace the defective and discordant sidewalk in the course of this presentation.
So at this point, they're merely looking for aesthetic input from the two agencies, so I just want to say a few words about the typology of Manhattan townhouses, as I mentioned earlier, In some cases it's a combination of some or all of those things, but there's typically a transition zone that allows some sort of sense of security and some graduated phasing from the public to the private realm and I'm, going to show you that on other slides at some points the building was converted to a carriage house, at which point they lost the transition zone to allow vehicular access What I'd like to do, as I said, I need to move back and forth between some slides, but if we could go to page 9, we'll see the history first, so I'll go to this ninth sheet, just waiting for it to load.
I want to draw your attention in particular to this shaded area, where my cursor is and that's the footprint of the cellar space and vault below the street We believe that's also the location where the original transition zone, low wall steps and railings occurred and that they rested directly on that and not to mention for that vault space below and the presumed mention of the transition zone above is reasonably consistent with other buildings.
You are, for the most part, still looking over the proposed features of the transition wall and that's much lower than some of the larger railings and definition defining zones around Marymount College, for example, in a number of other buildings in the area which still have their walls and railings I know there are 11 inches on top of that, but keep in mind that between the 30 inches and the railing on top it's transparent, so the metal railing feature on the top is quite light and you can see between it and the limestone below and then the obscure, opaque portion of limestone is about 30 inches high, which is a little lower than a conference table which is about 32 Other thing we're doing here is we're proposing that there would be loose planters behind the railing and the reason we're doing them loose is that we don't want to physically do anything hard up against the original Codman elevation If of transport, approved the encroachment it'll be done on the revocable consent, in which point the owner would have to remove it So. We don't want to leave any scars on the landmark building at the moment, and we don't want to put in physical planters that might have soil up against the building It won't leave any marks on the limestone or sort of granite water table at the base of 1083 right now, I'd like to go to page five and page five The railing gives some additional height, but it doesn't add a lot of visual both to it and the way the design is curved eases So. To achieve two things, one is to be a good sibling to the curvature of the building itself, but also, more importantly, to minimize the apparent physical impact on the street.
I'm gonna go through a couple of pictures on the next page, and mainly these were done for Department of Transport requirements to sort of show comparable installations and how much of the street remains available, and what you're going to see in these photographs coming up is the degree of free sidewalk on the neighboring buildings In a few cases, it's larger in a couple of cases , it's small or what we're proposing to do is leave a minimum of fifteen feet in front of the proposed low wall Even looking at these pictures here, cooper-hewitt, which is on the next block, the sidewalk averages around ten feet.
Over here on the right you'll see there was a little wall and a little stone balustrade, which will see curvature of steps in front of a curvature on a facade moving down to the next row of photographs, again low walls, plantings behind them, design in the low wall, The low wall would have catalyzed limestone design curved steps So again, the idea is to do something that recalls the features in the neighborhood that restores a feature that was originally on a townhouse in this area and brings back the transition element Do. You expect between the public realm in the private realm in a Manhattan townhouse I, just like to add also that we worked through a number of iterations with staff at landmarks and also with the director of preservation.
They have said that they intend to support it at the public hearing before the commissioners and we're looking for your feedback At. This point, I separately, had submitted a letter of testimony from the architectural historian, Frances Maroney, who wrote a new to say that in his opinion, also, the importance of a transition zone between the public and rival from public and private realms is an essential feature of a residential townhouse, and that happened.
Will, let's see if there's anyone from the public would like to comment?, and it appears there is not anyone from the public who would like to speak to this Let's go to the committee, you know you want to do the public or the public members afterwards right, Sorry alphabetical order, starting with the regular members and then public numbers afterwards , yes, I think there The application on the proposal is very nice.
One of the reasons for the projecting a fence is an area way of all of these individual townhouses, including, and maybe even especially, pertinent The Irish, American Historical Society, which is by the same original architects, was the existence of an area way and stairway separate entrance down directly to what we would call the cellar that no longer exists has not existed as far as I can tell since Ogden Codman redesigned the facade of this building, which is to say the functional purpose for extending the private property as far as possible, The 1939 tax photos which predate the trans predate shortly, admittedly predate the transition from private residents to American Academy, show no curb cut on Fifth Avenue and show a curb cut in front of three East 89th Street.
That's, one third of the sidewalk for nothing other than to provide the family, some additional privacy and a way to remove themselves from the public on a crowded, Avenue, a crowded part of Fifth Avenue, because it's right next to a whole bunch of museums, So I, don't like the design because of the suggestion that it is very closed off other than the other buildings.
Knowing that building there's a way to consider having an internal vestibule which would create more security, but I just think that taking space away from the public just is inappropriate and that when this building was purchased, the owner knew that okay, here's the building it doesn't This is just like something that you stick in the middle of two other buildings on the block I have three cardamon houses on my block, one of which I proposed as an individual landmark.
The residents and then the scaffolding you see in the front is actually as we're doing all the survey work for the facade restoration so and then we've pushed it back, 10 feet from the east and 56 feet from the front, any nice Street facade, and then this is the railing and the glazing is a which we'll talk As we showed you in our last presentation, where the rooftop addition becomes visible here, where my cursor is in between the Guggenheim and 1080 v and on the 5th Avenue side, looking over, the cafe of the Church I've had only arrest, This was the previous design, and then this is the rear edition.
