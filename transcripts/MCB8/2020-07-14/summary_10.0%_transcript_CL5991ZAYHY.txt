Frog from space smith, who is the architect of record, is on the line as well as is katie tow, henderson, engineer If, you have questions afterwards, any one of us will step in and answer questions the product is for permits who will be relocating from its flagship location at 691 Madison, one block to the south, to this collection of three buildings on 63rd and Madison.
We will be presenting at a public hearing of landmarks, June 23, July 21st, and the scope of that review is for signage and awnings storefront and window replacement and rooftop mechanicals and railings Take.
This is the current location of ramez's flagship, one block to the south on the northeast corner of sixty-second and Madison 1920s commercial building designed by McKim Mead white.
1980S designation photo from the Landmarks Commission, showing that the commercial building had been also demolished that in 1940 and replaced with a two-story extension of the bank.
This is the historic building at 7:06 Madison, and then this is the four-story commercial building to the south, at 702, 704, Medicine, the certificate of appropriateness and the permit for this construction designed by Paige Cowley included the demolition of that extension, construction of a four-story building, new storefront, infill, signage and construction of the building on 63rd Street.
Installing awnings of the second floor here and around 706, replacing the entry door at 7:06 and replacing the replacement wood windows at the ground floor of 706, the installation of a cabaret at the corner, and then mechanical equipment and railings that are not visible in this photo.
One of the reasons that we're proposing to replace this opaque wood door with a glass door is to allow for views actually into the store from passers-by on the street, and so you can see this person walking by on Madison and then similarly, here on 63rd.
Just given the height of these sills, one doesn't see into the store from the sidewalk, The proposal is to replace that with painted metal, storefronts matching the configuration of the existing in a dark charcoal black finish: There is a an egress door here in a partial wall which is set back from the window, given the needs for security and also marrying the needs for egress.
Our proposal on the interior is to create a security office here off the side, entry of the building and in doing so This will be a display with immense scarves in the window, and it will be a sort of an enclosed between so that one doesn't see into the sort of egress corridor and security area, but we'll have something actually attractive to look at so And, then a metal door, solid.
Above this part of the interior sort of back of house area for building turning to the windows, so At present, we are proposing to match the configuration, the profiles, the color and dimensions of these wood windows, but in steel, and the reason for that is for security.
The final element of the proposal is the rooftop mechanical equipment and, as I said at the outset, the current building and the current approval from 2014 anticipated rooftop mechanical equipment, but it did not include any rooftop mechanical equipment, so our client is had to sort of figure out a way to fit the equipment first within the existing roof plan and then realizing that there were some deficiencies in that an updated roof plan so showing you, the existing, approved roof plan with a series of new skylights here , You didn't have six feet to circulate between the equipment, the future equipment, The skyline, and that was one of the main hurdles for the design of the mechanical equipment.
One thing: that's important is with the scope of work, this historic building, this simple, neo, Federal Bank building, remains a distinct element in the composition, with changes really at the ground, floor windows and the door, the introduction of the cafe at the roof and the railing and the signage, and then the changes at 7:02, 704 Madison and at 63rd Street for storefront changes in signage and the rooftop mechanical equipment.
The flagpole has been on the building for a number of years in general, MS has no use for flagpole or for the flag for itself, so we'd like to ask the possibility that the flagpole also be removed as part of the design for this.
And I probably will support this, but I would prefer the look of wood windows there's, particularly because this is such a great building, here, but otherwise I think I'll support this Thank You Elizabeth.
The only way that we really will be able to provide a safe space is to have an a steel window or essentially a frame, a glass that is all encompasses with the steel frame that is open, like the adjacent building 70 to 74, but that it would not be in keeping with the building so we're trying to do the best possible thing by having a steel window that is essentially mimicking the existing wood frame.
Sorry just to address the detailing point, I, think I certainly understand the committee members comments about wood versus steel, but I think what's important is to remember is that these are you know, The profile of the applied mutton that we're proposing we'll also be installing a spacer bar actually between the front and back applied mounted.
And, we all felt it was important to keep it and perhaps someday your meds won't be there I , don't know that the Bank of New York would come back, but that sign will always be there and that's important My vote on the on the project.
Is that six feet or eight feet above the roof line when it's at its most visible I, certainly feel that people would know it was Air May is without the air may sign above the door, so I'm going to have to abstain on this application, but I.
Those are style, townhouse, designed by Turner and Killian, and built in 1901 o2, with significant alterations by optic Todman in 1913, 15 application to installed a low wall and railing at the front of the building.
The proposal is for the creation of a new limestone wall railing with the view to creating a typical transition zone that you would normally find between the public realm of the sidewalk and the private realm of a.
We're playing to the Department of Transport to replace the defective and discordant sidewalk in the course of this presentation, we're going to walk you through several examples of this type of feature in front of townhouses, on Fifth Avenue and in the immediate neighborhood, and we're also going to sort of show how the proposed encroachment onto the sidewalk it's significantly less than we're.
In, some cases, it's a combination of some or all of those things, but there's typically a transition zone that allows some sort of sense of security and some graduated phasing from the public to the private realm.
The first floors were originally slightly higher than the street levels, and you can see a slightly better version of that in the second photograph which I'm zooming into you can see the railings and transition zones, all three of those properties, the next photograph and window over to is from about 1915.
Was he eliminated the steps that led into 1083, because he lowered the first floor to sidewalk level to facilitate the carriage and the next picture to the right of that is the building.
That's also the location where the original transition, zone, low wall steps and railings occurred and that they rested directly on that and not to mention for that vault space below and the presumed mention of the transition zone above is reasonably consistent with other buildings.
You are, for the most part, still looking over the proposed features of the transition wall and that's much lower than some of the larger railings and definition defining zones around Marymount College, for example, in a number of other buildings in the area which still have their walls and railings.
If I go on here now to the details of the railing and low wall, we're proposed and replacing the gold and ochre colored sidewalk that was put in.
You expect between the public realm in the private realm in a Manhattan townhouse I, just like to add also that we worked through a number of iterations with staff at landmarks and also with the director of preservation, Jared Knowles, that took a particular interest in the project.
The Irish American Historical Society, which is by the same original architects, was the existence of an area way and stairway separate entrance down directly to what we would call the cellar that no longer exists has not existed as far as I can tell since Ogden Codman redesigned the facade of this building, which is to say the functional purpose for extending the private property.
I, don't have access to them right now, but they clearly show that the space inside labeled carriageway and the pair of doors were specially designed to fold not only not only to open through 90 degrees, but to fold back against the two interior walls.
That's, one third of the sidewalk for nothing other than to provide the family, some additional privacy and a way to remove themselves from the public on a crowded, Avenue, a crowded part of Fifth Avenue, because it's right next to a whole bunch of museums.
And I understand that part of it is for security, knowing that building, there's a way to consider having an internal vestibule which would create more security, but I just think that taking space away from the public just is inappropriate and that when this building was purchased, the owner knew that okay, here's the building it doesn't.
At no time does he put a fence like this in front of his buildings, you're, quite right that this probably was a carriage entrance, because what he often used on his houses is that the main front door you go in there And, then a very on the one across the street which he does for me, which he designed for himself.
The second step was to present some initial sketches that were slightly different from this one, and then we worked with them to fine-tune the shape the degree of projection and the details for the materials, but in general they were supportive of the idea of a space in front of the building that they felt added Beauty not only to the building but to the street, because they felt that the building as it currently stands was somewhat denuded that it's one of the few building is in that area.
We were starting with the same exact same way of projection, that's elsewhere on the same block and just bowing it out slightly, because if we had created a straight line at that point, it would become almost tangential to the building, and that would certainly look like an error.
Thank you, I'm, going to keep this incredibly brief in the interest of time, but I do echo the other comments about encroaching on public space in the sidewalk.
Very excited that she's taken on that we're taking on that project And Certainly she's excited to realize the goal of opening this flagship gallery right across the street from the Guggenheim which, as we all know.
This is our property here, 3, East, 8th and 9th Street from the previous application, and from the many times we've been in front of you, The studio building or annex building was constructed, and so what we've looked at is this interesting sort of cleaner equality of this later 4:19, later twentieth century insertion and the historic fabric with this diamond-shaped diapered, pattern, brick and thinking about that as a as a reference and then the roof of that annex building.
What we really want is to get as much input as we possibly can from the committee any board member who might be interested any member of the public, because we really it's going to take a lot of work.
