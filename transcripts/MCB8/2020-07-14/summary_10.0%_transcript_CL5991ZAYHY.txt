Structures: 706,708 is a Neo federal, style, Bank, building designed by Frank Easton constructed in 1922 702 and 704 Madison Avenue and 22 East 63Rd Street are designed by Paige irons, Crowley and constructed in 2014 to 2016 space Smith architects.
Our mechanical engineer is with us just in case Frog from Space Smith, who is the architect of record, is on the line as well as is Katie Tow Henderson, Engineer She's, the MEP engineer, Michelle and Katie are available for questions I'm going to run through the presentation.
Historically, a bank building at the corner, and, as you noted it in the introduction, new construction dating to 2014 2016 flanking it here at 7:02, Madison, 702,704, Medicine and 22 East 63Rd, Street.
We will be presenting at a public hearing of landmarks, June 23, July 21st, and the scope of that review is for signage and awnings storefront and window replacement and rooftop mechanicals and railings Take.
The CFA notes that this sign, or this sculpture on the roof would be in keeping with historic advertising methods and was being keeping with a commercial character of Madison, Avenue This out, because as this store, when this store closes and the other store opens, we are proposing to install a similar statue on the roof of 706 Madison.
This is the historic building at 7:06 Madison, and then this is the four- story: Commercial building to the south at 702,704, Medicine, the certificate of appropriateness and the permit for this construction designed by Paige Cowley included the demolition of that extension, construction of a four- story, building new Storefront, infill, signage and construction of the building on 63rd Street.
Significant thing to note, which I'll come back to later in the presentation, is that this proposal has approved did not include any mechanical equipment for the entire complex.
The idea was that the architecture was approved and that when the building was tenant' add the mechanical systems would be designed and proposed as part of that future work.
Turning, the corner on 63Rd Street, again, the original historic Bank building and Then the 19 sorry, the 2014, 2016, 5 story, building filling in that one yard, a 1, one, story, fence and side yard storefront and fill in polished brass here on 63rd, as well as on Madison Avenue.
A view of the scope of work at 702,704, replacing the existing infill, a storefront in filled with new infill matching the detailing and configuration, but in a dark painted metal and signage of the sign.
Installing awnings of the second floor here and around 706, replacing the entry door at 7:06 and replacing the replacement wood windows at the ground floor of 706, the installation of a cabaret at the corner, and then mechanical equipment and railings that are not visible in this photo.
Most of the changes are occurring at the ground level of the storefronts and the entry, as well as the rooftop mechanicals, and then, of course, the Kelly on the roof 706, the 63rd Street elevation again, as I mentioned, replacing the windows replacing the door here.
One of the reasons that we're proposing to replace this opaque wood door with a glass door is to allow for views actually into the store from passers- by on the street, and so you can see this person walking by on Madison and then similarly, here on 63rd.
The proposal is to replace that with painted metal, storefronts matching the configuration of the existing in a dark charcoal black finish: again: 7 inch, tall, non- illuminated letters in stainless attached to the sign bands above each of the storefront panels, decal signage, as well, on the storefront doors and typical installations in that regard.
The final element of the proposal is the rooftop mechanical equipment and, as I said at the outset, the current building and the current approval from 2014 anticipated rooftop mechanical equipment, but it did not include any rooftop mechanical equipment, so our client is had to sort of figure out a way to fit the equipment first within the existing roof plan and then realizing that there were some deficiencies in that an updated roof plan so showing you, the existing, approved roof plan with a series of new skylights here.
It's on the taller portion, it's on the new construction and putting the mechanicals here allows us to not put any mechanicals on a low roof of the historic building at 7:06.
So, as I mentioned, one of the goals has been to locate all the mechanical equipment on the new construction so that we did not have any visible mechanical equipment above the historic pillar, heading up, Madison, Avenue, looking south and southwest to elements you're, seeing here the front edge again of the packaged unit, and then here.
One thing that's important is with the scope of work, this historic building, this simple, neo, Federal Bank building, remains a distinct element in the composition, with changes really at the ground, floor windows and the door, the introduction of the cafe at the roof and the railing and the signage, and then the changes at 7:02, 704 Madison and at 63Rd Street for storefront changes in signage and the rooftop mechanical equipment.
There's, particularly because this is such a great building, here, but otherwise I think I'll support this Thank You Elizabeth next big Kilburn, And I also am curious as to whether or not there's any way that a wooden window can be made as secure as a steel window, because I believe it was security as the reason why you were changing from wood to steel.
Sorry just to address the detailing point, I think I certainly understand the committee members comments about wood versus steel, but I.
Can you just go back to the rendering where we see how many windows there are on both the Madison Avenue and the 63rd Street side, because okay, so now, if you're, starting from the southernmost building the ones south of the bank and you're, going to have awnings on that building, plus the bank building and around the side of the bank building and on to the new building on 63rd Street there no awnings on 63rd?
I do not know that the Bank of New York would come back, but that sign will always be there and that's important My vote on the on the project.
Yes, all right, so you'll be dealing with all of that maintenance, right, yes, okay, yes ,, it's hard for me to judge about it, blending into the skyline I have to say with the idea of some kind of historic plaque, I like to read them when I see them, so maybe The space on 63Rd Street, it looks like there's more brick.
Finally a question are the new windows fixed sort of like fake one over ones at 12 or 12, right I think they can be operable, but I do not think they will be operated because they correct for air conditioning purposes.
You're, replacing or glass to keep transparency for your business, but on the city, Third Street, Des, moines, painting the consistency of a black door, which is basically I, think that's right into the oil, but that made me feel a little bit uncomfortable that part.
And I probably won't have a decision until it's time to vote, but let me say this would be nice to keep the sign, but it would not preclude my voting in favor of the project if the sign is covered, since we do have the other sign and this other sides of secondary elevation now That would be nice, but I'm not going to vote against it because they're covering the sign I have one last question of the applicant on that North facing side where the visibility of the mechanicals is more apparent.
Is that six feet or eight feet above the roof line when it's at its most visible I, certainly feel that people would know it was Air May is without the air may sign above the door, so I'm going to have to abstain on this application, but I.
Those are style, townhouse, designed by Turner and Killian, and built in 1901 o2, with significant alterations by optic Todman in 1913 15 application to installed a low wall and railing at the front of the building.
The proposal is for the creation of a new limestone wall railing with the view to creating a typical transition zone that you would normally find between the public realm of the sidewalk and the private realm of a.
In addition, we're playing to the Department of Transport to replace the defective and discordant sidewalk in the course of this presentation, we're going to walk you through several examples of this type of feature in front of townhouses, on Fifth Avenue and in the immediate neighborhood, and we're also going to sort of show how the proposed encroachment onto the sidewalk it's significantly less than we're.
In, some cases, it's a combination of some or all of those things, but there's typically a transition zone that allows some sort of sense of security and some graduated phasing from the public to the private realm.
The initial first, the first floors, were originally slightly higher than the street levels, and you can see a slightly better version of that in the second photograph which I'm zooming into you can see the railings and transition zones, all three of those properties, the next photograph and window over to is from about 1915.
Other thing Coughlin did was he eliminated the steps that led into 1083, because he lowered the first floor to sidewalk level to facilitate the carriage and the next picture to the right of that is the building.
That's also the location where the original transition, Zone, low, Wall steps and railings occurred, and that they rested directly on that and not to mention for that vault space below and the presumed mention of the transition zone above is reasonably consistent with other buildings.
Us what we're proposing the new proposed work is in red, We, moved acrosss and used that roughly as our starting point for the new enclosed area, then we offset that seven feet, eight inches off the existing curve and return this back to the wall.
You are, for the most part, still looking over the proposed features of the transition wall and that's much lower than some of the larger railings and definition defining zones around Marymount College, for example, in a number of other buildings in the area which still have their walls and railings.
If it was ever removed, it won't leave any marks on the limestone or sort of granite water table at the base of 1083 right now, I'd like to go to page five and page five The Thiele proposed low wall is lower than the windows of the building.
If I go on here now to the details of the railing and low wall, we're proposed and replacing the gold and ochre colored sidewalk that was put in.
You expect between the public realm in the private realm in a Manhattan townhouse Just like to add also that we worked through a number of iterations with staff at landmarks and also with the director of preservation, Jared Knowles.
They have said that they intend to support it at the public hearing before the commissioners and we're looking for your feedback at this point, I separately had submitted a letter of testimony from the architectural historian, Frances Maroney, who wrote a new to say, that, in his opinion, also.
The Irish American Historical Society, which is by the same original architects, was the existence of an area way and stairway separate entrance down directly to what we would call the cellar that no longer exists has not existed as far as I can tell since Ogden Codman redesigned the facade of this building, which is to say the functional purpose for extending the private property.
And I understand that part of it is for security, knowing that building there's a way to consider having an internal vestibule which would create more security, but I just think that taking space away from the public just is inappropriate and that when this building was purchased, the owner knew that okay, here's the building it does not.
He put a fence like this in front of his buildings, you're, quite right that this probably was a carriage entrance, because what he often used on his houses is that the main front door you go in there And, then a very on the one acrosss the street, which he does for me, which he designed for himself.
Do not know Aldrich, and here we see the entrance is actually on the inside of the street, but the space the space part of the sidewalk is A, is a planted garden and that is to contribute to the public and also you'll notice, the dark.
Then I have a couple of questions to put it to sort of put this building in context, which I think we may have missed in some of the comments I'm just in working with them.
So we were starting with the same exact same way of projection, that's elsewhere on the same block and just bowing it out slightly, because if we had created a straight line at that point, it would become almost tangential to the building, and that would certainly look like an error.
Thank you, I'm, going to keep this incredibly brief in the interest of time, but I do echo the other comments about encroaching on public space in the sidewalk.
The fact of the matter is that if they chose to live in that live in that house as a private house, that does not give them the right necessarily to encroach into the sidewalk And I think, given the Church of the heavenly just given those point about this becoming such an important public, plaza.
We, were really pleased to read in those comments and testimony that a number of neighbors continue to express their support for three East 89Th Street becoming a commercial art gallery and further for the restorative work.
What we really want is to get as much input as we possibly can from the committee any board member who might be interested any member of the public, because we really it's going to take a lot of work.
