Thank you, Aleta, really a pleasure and thank you so much I mean you're. The leadership of this Community Board I. Think in having these important conversations is just really terrific right now, listen I'm really excited about tonight's conversation, because we're gonna actually be able to hear directly from small business owners about what they're going through what they're, seeing and, of course, most importantly, how all of us can be very helpful to them and what they're trying to do so I think, let's get it started. We have three fantastic speakers. I'm gonna hand it over to them, but I just want to remind everybody out there that you can ask questions. So there is a Q&A. If you look at the bottom of your screen. If you have questions, please enter them there and we will do our best to try to get all of those answered. So, let's get started. Our first speaker is Mick. Sorry, Michael melt, Melanie did I get that right. Michael I tried the lamb feed, don't worry you're, not the first, so he is a former chair. Many of you will know I'm the former chair of cb8, the Small Business Committee, and he's also the former owner and operator of Ryan's daughter pub. So I would love to hear your thoughts on everything that's happening where we are, where we're heading and again how people can be helpful. Well, thanks. So much Jessica and first off I'd, just like to take a quick 30 seconds to Thank You Jessica for moderating all of these sessions, which have been so valuable. I'd also like to thank Vaughn and Julianne for taking their time out of their busy day today to speak about their experiences and also their hopes about moving forward. Also I have to say huge. Thank you to community board a Manhattan will bright bill. Who is the man behind the curtain and makes sure all these meetings run a smooth as silk every single day, Sarah Chu and Valerie Mason, who have recently taken up the mantle of running the Small Business Committee, which is no small feat at the best of times, and certainly not at the moment. Considering our current situation, a leader camp, who is a wonderful engaged positive chair as well as all of my former colleagues on the board, your support, energy and collaboration in particular of tonight's presentation, is both inspiring and gives me so much hope that we can really make a difference in helping our local small businesses survive and thrive. Teresa Wu, who was our graphic designer on this project, deserves so much praise and thanks for bringing what was a couple of simple ideas really to life in a very short space of time and I must also thank everyone on the reopening task force. The East Mattel partnership, Madison Avenue, babes, Carnegie, Hill, Neighborhood, Association, 60s, Neighborhood, Association and cb6 Manhattan who've been working with us on this project at the 86th Street Association and all who have given so much time these last couple of months. Our meetings have been filled with so many great ideas, but personally they've also become something that I look forward to as a means to try to make sense of all. That's occurred these last couple of months with this pandemic. So a lot of the talk surrounding reopening local businesses has been quite rightly focused on much of the material, the legislative and legal needs of our local businesses. Of course, it is so important that our local owners have the right guidance and the tools to effectively reopen, or for some continued to do business in this age of covert 19. We need our businesses to make sure that their deep cleaning we need our businesses to ensure that staff are healthy. We need our businesses to have the right legal advice on navigating what really is a no-man's land that we have never experienced in the past. In our discussions on these programs, I kept focusing on my own former business, which was an Irish pub Brian's daughter. One thing I kept thinking of was my customers, not necessarily how I'd get him to come back? If I was in that position we sold booze after all, so it wasn't going to be too much of a problem to get them to come back and but I kept thinking how customers at my bar engage in sort of them an unspoken contract when they come in. There are ways of behaving that are acceptable and certainly after a few drinks, sometimes there are ways of behaving that are not acceptable, and this unspoken contract is what I call it dictates whether a customer will be welcomed back in the future or asked to leave the premises, and this behavior in this unspoken contract affects how smoothly a business can be run. It's an accepted part of doing business in the bar service industry. The other thing that my mind drifted to at the mention of kovin 19, was the collective response of New Yorkers to this pandemic. Flatten the curve became the early mantra. By flattening the curve, we were engaging in a community based response to allow our health care workers the time and space to deal with what was exponentially growing crisis. Flattening the curve also meant that we were allowing other essential workers, the time and space to do their essential work, whether it was maintaining and operating the public transport cleaning. Our sidewalks are stuck in our shelves of toilet paper and all the other essential needs, and of course, there are- and there will continue to be massive challenges and changes to our lives with covered, but the simple things like working from home, if you could wearing face coverings in public hand, washing and sanitizing on a regular basis, all meant that we collectively were able to flatten the curve. Not only did these simple measures aid, our health care workers, it also gave me personally and I'm sure many other people and a sense of agency ownership, responsibility and, above all, control in such an unsettling situation, which is very often not the case in time of disaster and uncertainty. So it's with the spirit of this collective effort that we began to think about what locals can do to be part of the restart. The burden of reopening with its costs, 40 con economically and emotionally, is falling on our local business owners from any. Sadly, it's already too late, as you can see, by taking a walk around the neighborhood by focusing on that unspoken contract that I spoke about earlier and the spirit that flattened the curve, and we identified a number of guidelines that people can take or leave but bear in mind by adhering to these simple guidelines, you will be making it easier for your local cafes book, shops, bodegas, grocery stores, apparel stores and even Irish pubs to navigate the uncertain days weeks and months ahead. So will, if you wouldn't mind, if you'd be so kind as to share the ad the poster and I'll speak about each of the guidelines. Briefly so here is the here is our poster that we have designed and worked on together. It's be part of the restart which is in the spirit of flattening the curve. It's important I think for people to have a message that they can kind of get behind and, as you look through it, it's quite simple: it's a number of guidelines and the first three which are really you know what we've been doing anyway. The last few months people are used to this. You know always wear a mask or a face covering when you go into a store or any place of business, and not only are you protecting the workers there and you're helping to prevent a spread. It's also the law now in New York. So you know it's something that you can do to comply with the law. We need to continue social distancing. That means try to keep six feet apart. Many of our businesses have placed decals on the floors of their business and outside to illustrate this for people and sanitize, most businesses that I've gone near in the last couple of days all have sanitizer. So that's something that you can do something else. That's quite simple! If you feel sick, if you feel ill just stay home, you know don't chance, it I know as New Yorkers. You know we feel like we're invincible sometimes and that we must accomplish everything in the day, no matter. What push at the moment is a good lesson to just stay and if you feel at all ill and also remember that a lot of our local businesses are available online, you can shop online from a lot of local businesses and a message I think you're going to hear more later on is when you invest in a local business, you're investing on in your block, you're, investing in your neighborhood, and it's really important. So if you are doing any online shopping and you can't leave the house, you can go online and another important thing to point out is you know, with the proliferation of a lot of apps, sometimes they're, not the very best for a lot of our small local restaurants and restaurants that provide delivery and take-out. So we encourage people. That's when available call up your local restaurants have a chest you know call up instead of using an app see if you can get them to deliver. That's certain that certainly helps with a lot of our restaurants bottom lines. Something else that you can do and which we're already used to doing for quite a lot of other businesses is to make a reservation. You know once our salons and barbershops restaurants reopen a lot of boutiques beauty, stores, doctors and dentists. You know they take reservations, and so this is a way that you can help businesses space out their clients. So or not. You know having too many people in stores at the one time or having too many people congregate outside on the sidewalk another thing which I've had a hard time doing. All my life is plan ahead, give yourself an extra bit of time. An extra 15 minutes can make so much of a difference to your experience. If you give yourself that bit more time to actually plan when you're going out to do your bit of shopping or running a business that you do, and that brings us to you know the final three little guidelines that we'd like people to be mind. Practice patience, remember like that. The landscape for businesses and workers has changed drastically like the rest of us and help our local businesses and the workers who work there, help them help. You know, ask the staff to handle merchandise, so they don't need to unnecessarily quarantine or have to disinfect or sanitize goods, and also this kind of it's a simple thing like when you're in a shop. You know, try not to be picking up things and putting them back down and the final one which you know I, do think this is again in the spirit of what this is all about. Just be kind and try to be flexible. I know tempers fray very easily. We've heard lots of stories of you know people getting anxious and getting into panic attacks in stores over the last couple of months because of what's going on. But you know our businesses and other customers will appreciate it, and a little bit of kindness of flexibility goes a long way when you can't see somebody's face and you can't see their lovely smiles, so I'm, making a little extra bit of effort to be mindful it is, can really ensure that we can all collectively help restart New, York City together and well, if you wouldn't mind just taking down the poster, but for now, if that's ok, so that's pretty much it for me and we'll be sharing this document with our local business owners and partners. We will be sharing it online and also on social media. My personal hope is that the owners will print a copy and display it in their premises and perhaps share it on their websites to better inform customers. Kovat 19 is here and sadly, it appears to be growing in many other parts of the country and also we had some. You know not-so-good news today, it's growing all over the world, but our experience here in New York in the last three months has proved that we can slow to spread and potentially manage it. I believe, by adopting the same responsible approach to how we conduct ourselves while shopping eating out and going about our everyday business, it will also give us a better sense of control over Hispanic and, at the same time, give our local business owners a chance to reopen grow, survive and thrive, and I just like to thank you all so much for taking the time out to come by and listen to what we have to say here this evening and I'll hand it back over to our moderator, Jessica well done, Michael. Thank you so much. What a terrific guide we certainly at the chamber are gonna push that out. I! Think that's really! Terrific I'm gonna stop here for a second and hand it back to Alito. We have some very distinguished guests here today. We can't hear you Aleta sorry, I was muted and forgot. I was on my phone. Thank you for reminding me I want to say thank you for your support and welcome to our elected officials. Borough president Gale Brewer and our one of our state assembly members Rebecca, see right. You provide enormous support for the community board and for all of our neighbors, our businesses, our residents and I. Can't thank you enough. I'm, so excited that you're here to share this evening and see how you too, is a member of the community can support all of our local businesses, restaurants and retail. Thank you back to you, Jessica, thank you and thank you for joining us. I want to let all the attendees know that if you look in the chat, you can download a copy of the guidelines that then Michael spoke about just a moment ago, so that is available in the chat area all right. So, let's move along we're gonna hear now from Vaughn Cahill, who is the co-owner of Lane farms market Vaughn? Are you Frank yeah? Thank you. Please take it away: okay, hi I'm Vaughn from Blaine farmers market little real mom-and-pop store located on 96th Street at Madison Avenue when I say real mom-and-pop store. Philly is a real mom-and-pop store. We've been there since 1977 my grandfather had it and then I don't know how I ended up with it, but I'm there we service a small community. We provide fresh vegetables needs butcher. All you know the old-fashioned stuff that people from the neighborhood were used to having it's been tough time in these times, because we've had to try to do many different things to keep our customers. So what we've done during these times is we've added email orders where you can email us your order. So this way you're not coming into this floor for the elderly's, we think all over the phone and we take their phone orders over that they feel more comfortable. Speaking to someone we provide free delivery. We even provide where, at one time we would our delivery guys are so close to the customers that they would even could step on their shops. For them, I guess are what we've been having a hard time with lately is that it was hard getting workers to come in to work, because you know they were afraid to take subways and things like that. The other problem we've had is that in this area, a lot of our customers look like they've left during that ademma con its March 23rd things all changed so who's. The people that have stayed are really the people that didn't have a place to go to. We serve also part of Harlem customers on 99th, Street I did in 2nd Street and it's been very difficult for them, but what we do for them is like they'll call over the phone and we'll send it to them. We've even added faxing, believe it or not. People are still faxing their orders. We had a point one point where we had to close the store for about two weeks. When I mean close, I meant close the doors publicly. We would only take phone orders and fax orders or emails, because a lot of customers won't really remember the questions. They would ask everybody. Okay, everybody is everybody, is anyone sick? Does any customers come into this flow that are sick, I would try to comfort them and tell them listen as far as the employees are thank God. Thank you, God, no one's sick. All of us would wear protective stuff mask gloves. We were sanitizing, our hands like it was crazy in Washington, somehow someway I was able to get a hold of Lysol spray, so we would like saw everything all the time fact we were saying I, don't think we're gonna die from the Quran. We made that from long time from Lysol we also kept a lot of the Lysol spray for the elderlies, who would honor what we did. All the time was always sanitizing and try to make the customers feel comfortable. Now what we do, we did open the doors we have posters that say must wear masks at times we do get harassed, but we try to be patient and sometimes use psychology and explain to them. It's not for just them it's worth for the employees and you don't want the employees getting near you and exhibit well. Most people have accepted it. Some people have it and those that haven't I, guess they leave and they call over the phone or I'm not sure what they do but and that's pretty much I, don't know other things we have done for them. Some people have asked us to have the food ready and they would meet us at the door. That was something else to where they would call, and you just have this stuff ready and that's what we've been doing and now we put gloves what we were worried about was people some people, customers were concerned. Well, oh, who touched the apples example because other stuff we were able to wrap, but apples and pears and peaches now or plums, can't wrap that stuff. So what we did was we put box of gloves near there I've ordered a whole bunch of sanitizers. Now that I can get it. If you get by the door, you know the cash you'll squeeze some in you or you can use some of it. So these are the new things we've put in to try to implement as far as safety issues as far as the workers they constantly are washing themselves. They constantly worried about it. In fact, even the delivery guys, you know, take the delivery up to the door. They won't go in anymore. We've asked customers to understand that we in for on doorman buildings, where they would want the little guy to go inside. We ask them to please be understanding. People take it to your door, but we can't go inside. We've even had where the hospital has placed an order, and that's why we did have a hard time, because some of the delivery guys were worried about going into the emergency room. So what we were doing would react someone from the staff if they could meet us by the door the entrance time we would keep them there, their sandwiches or food that was ordered. Believe me, when I tell you we're very anal about things like that, because we're very worried about someone getting sick. The cashier, for example, has a son that suffers from asthma, so she's super detective. The guys understood the delivery. Guys are worried so I guess I, guess that has made them more aware that, oh, let me wash my hands, let me make sure I'm clean and that's what we've been doing lately to make sure there's no prevent you know no one's getting sick or happen as far as customers that come into the store and say I, don't want to wear a mask and things like that. We politely tell them that they can't come in. Sometimes they say. Oh, you know, masks don't help. We've had a lot of medical students that have come in and giving us literature explaining you're, not doing anything with the mat and we've just told them. Listen we just this is the way we're gonna operate and that's the way we kept it and we just follow the rules also and make sure that we only have one cashier and one customer come to the register. We let everyone wait. You know about six feet away and then we take the next person. We've had complaints that oh, it's moving too slow and we're trying to explain to them. There's nothing else. We really can do at this time, but if you like to go to the phone or you can email us, your order and it'll be a little bit. The process would be much faster or less waiting. I guess! That's it I, don't that's what I have to about what's going on at Lane farms and that's how we have been going about doing what we needed to do for the community. I think the hardest thing for us as a retail and I hope that everything does go well by September, I hope so, because when school is open, business is good. When school is closed. Business is his below average. A lot of our customers have second homes, so a lot of them have escaped many week for many different reasons to be closer to their other families or they needed someone who could help but caretaking a lot of our customers that have children or younger kids don't want them just staying in the city because there isn't much for them to do so. That's been hard for us paying. The rent has been hard for us. A lot of things have been hard, but thank God we're coping with it and we're doing the best we can to serve the community. There were times I come in and I go I wonder why I do this, but you know something it's beautiful when Mrs Butterworth says thank you and says you know: I, don't know what I would do if you guys weren't there try not to get emotional, but so it breaks my heart, so I feel like. If I wasn't there, what would happen to Mrs, Butterworth or others that need us, and you should see the letters we get and the thank-you cards, and sometimes people even donate money, say please, you know give this to the delivery guy you'll give this to the cashier. You know and now I'm very grateful for that at first I said: oh wow, nobody really cares, but you know some people really do care and people have made us feel like we're important and where necessary, I always used to think I. Everybody cares for the big franchises and it's funny. The big franchises are the ones who have let them down. They were explaining to me how they used to use fresh, direct and fresh direct. Wasn't there for them and we were and I said so I thank you and I appreciated and thank God we're there for them and I hope to be there for them until death. Do us apart anyway. Thank you for asking me to join here. I'm, not the most eloquent person, but I appreciate it. I'm, a humble person and I appreciate this opportunity. Thank you all for having me. Thank you. Oh thank you. Vaughn I, listen, I want to speak for everybody, I think everybody was really moved and I. Everybody is really thankful for all that. You're doing we know this is a very tough time for everybody, but that's just really amazing I have a ton of questions for you. We're gonna get to our last speaker, but I have a ton of questions, but the one observation I would make. Is that you're, just taking so many precautions and going out of your way to really try to you know, have best practices going and I think that instills a lot of confidence for consumers and I think that that's really helpful to the economy in so many ways. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome, weave into we even tell everybody at the guys that start at least tell them. When you get home, make sure you take off your clothes that they and you know and wash because you don't know what you may be carrying to your home. I always tell everybody, be careful who you do invite, who you hang out with? Will you do because if you get sick, we all get sick when we get sick, the custom would get sick, so these guys have got a clear understanding. All the workers there, if you speak to them you'll, say I've got a very clear understanding. They are very worried. Fears is a big factor there. No one wants to get sick people have seen what's going on. We have. We know people we have lost, we have hormons, we have lost that used to come to our store. So this is a. This is a for real thing. Some people think it's a joke. No, it's for real, and especially when you, when you know someone that has passed away from this, makes you think and you go home. You know this is for real, and these were guys we were just talking to a couple of days ago. So yeah, it's important. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, hang on Vaughn we're gonna get back to you. Let's go to our final speaker, Julianne Jaffe! She here I'm here, Oh, terrific he's the owner of Jay Marco jewelry. Please tell us about the business and we'd love to hear what your what's happening with you and how again how consumers can be helpful as you start to reopen okay. Well, my name is Julien Jaffe and thank you so much for having me I'm so pleased to represent Madison Avenue I'm, also on the board of the Madison Avenue bid. So, just to tell you a little bit about my shop and then my experience so I have a store on Madison Avenue between 80th and 85th. Street I've been there for 15 years. It's interesting. Navona also is a small independent, but there are not that many of us on the avenue anymore, so I'm, incredibly proud of that, and not that my comrades I have gotten to know them actually more somewhat through code, because we have virtual meetings all the time and it is an incredible community of stores managers as well as some other owners too. So I'm a woman owned business as well. I have started the business with my husband, but I did lose him not to Cove it but sounds I'm a woman-owned business. So you know the experience actually I just want to grow back just a little bit because I buy a lot internationally to offer. My customers on beautiful goods from around the world, so we're a small but very edited curated jewelry shop and what was happening was I was no longer able to get merchandise from Italy from China factories were closing and I. Think I didn't really see that it was coming soon to a theater near me, I was like their clothes and they're, not opening and I. Don't know if I could have prepared any differently, I'm, not sure, but I think I was still even though I was hearing. These things. I was still very taken by surprise when we were closed. Having said that, I didn't make the adjust, I mean health first I mean that's the first and foremost, even though commerce is so important. Health is above and beyond all else, so closing obviously was the only way to try and get this under control. So we sent out a notice to all our customers. We do have a social media presence. We have a web presence, but we really don't do business on the web, but we do our customers love our emails and they all immediately wrote, notes and continued to write notes throughout the pandemic to us. So we have, we definitely have a wonderful customer base, but when you are on the Avenue and patrons for the Avenue, because the museums are nearby to bring in tourists and yeah I mean New, York is a tourist town and we're always looking for new customers as well. So well, we were able to do some business. While we were closed for the most part. It was. It really has been a shutdown, so it's a frightening time for big businesses and small businesses, so first of course health. First, it's a frightening time for that, and then you know how it will present, but strangely I feel incredibly optimistic, because there's no place like New York and don't want to be here. It's true my customers had, for the most part, a lot of them have moved out of the city, like my colleague before just said. Of course, we've been shipping. Of course we deliver I had coffee, because we were allowed to have coffee with someone in Sag Harbor last week and delivered earrings, so an essential item, as you might guess, during COBIT, so but I do feel incredibly optimistic. I feel like people will always want to be in New, York I feel, like tourists will come back to New, York I, just think it's going to be a slow process, so much of it is going to be dependent on how landlords can absorb and I know it's hard for them as well, but how we're able to work out deals and that's still big question marks, but I believe that customers will come back. I think there's nothing like Madison Avenue in the world. It is like no other Street and, as I said, you know it's interesting, because I would have to pop into my store to take care of things and as people would take masked and gloves and everything their walks. They always looked for me and would wave and then, when I was able to put things out last week, like everyone was like giving the thumbs up, I mean it was just so heartwarming and sweet and I know that customers that did order during this time they could buy anywhere because things get delivered all over, but it was really a matter of heart and love. Yes, it's true. I have cultivated a following, no doubt, but I do feel that it is a matter of heart. Jewelry is very tactile, so people do want to try on and see it so we have made. Of course we have lots of cleaners, lots of jewelry cleaners, we have masks, doesn't have them. Our store is very small and we are actually kind of a what you would consider a low-traffic store. So in terms of safety, it's easy I still I'm doing limited hours, but I'm telling customers I'll be glad to stay late. If that's, what you need? People are working and all sorts of unusual ways: I'm home something's, starting to go into offices, so I'm definitely accommodating all of that. So having said that, I mean yeah. We've been closed for four months and I just believe that we will weather the storm together. You know everybody is not in the same situation. I realize some people are still working, my son and his fiancee are still working, I was not able to, and then there are people that you know have to be on a breadline. So not everybody is in the exact same situation and I just think we have to have compassion for all different levels of fucking of how we are so. Having said that I'm thrilled to be here to represent Madison Avenue I know all my colleagues are starting to open now, some a little bit slowly but I believe after the July 4th, we will be back. I've got min lots of goodies because it'll leaves up at all, many places have opened, and so we've gotten some beautiful, fresh merchandise. It's amazing what you can order. You know unzoom from people, so we pass it around the world of the goodwill of our community. Thank you for having me terrific, I love, your optimism. New York optimism is there and I think that's it's infectious! So thank you. So we have we're gonna start the questions and I want Michael and Vaughn to be able to weigh in too but I'll start with you, Julian and maybe Yvonne can weigh in as well I'm really interested in the marketing aspect and how that's changed, and you touched upon that quite a bit because it sounds like you're doing some really new and innovative things, but I guess one has your marketing change just generally. So have you sorry, but also have you? Are you marketing your the practices like von talked about? Quite you know, all the things he's doing to really showcase that he's, taking all these extra precautions to put his customers at ease, which you could market that as well, because I think it does. You know, make certain businesses stand out, but anything about your marketing and how that might have changed throughout this first whack I mean I, don't like to talk about that. I mean I. Think that I understand why people do talk about that, but I'ma show don't tell so when people come in, I am masked I'm offering. You know right away to clean I'm, just cleaning the jewels, so Amma I'ma show don't tell kind of gal, so I wouldn't say that I feel the need to market. That I mean jewelry is a different item. It is such a feel-good item, so I don't feel like I need to talk about that side of things. So, in terms of marketing I will say we did slow down our marketing during the pandemic. We did not inundate people with by this now. By this note, it was really much more of we are thinking of you and your families and, of course, we're here for you. If you, if there's a birthday, an anniversary, you just want to treat yourself. You know I and I, accept lots of photos and done things that way, but really I think in terms of marketing. It has really been much more of the heart. Having said that will go back because now that people will be coming in and buying yes, we want them to see the latest, but no I. Think again, I. Don't really need to talk about that. I believe that they trust that I'm gonna. Take care of them. Our store is small, so again, safety, first health. First, every always run. What about you? Well, like she said: she's, it's a jewelry store, so it's a little different I'm selling, something that they go. To put you know, they're going to digest Annie, so I have to market that it's not something I want to market, but I do because, like I said some of you should see some of the questions when they come in is everybody. Okay, listen, I haven't seen. Timmy is here today, so I know that that's like okay, someone sec thank God. No one has been so I have to market that I have to protect the stuff that are touched. You know. Sometimes people like to touch vegetables and people like to touch this, and it's so I have to I always tell people that were always cleaning. People see that we all these are people come into the store and I always go wow. This is a clean store and I says yeah. We try our best. At night we sanitize even the baskets and even in the middle of the day we sanitize the baskets and the carts, because we will also notice people, don't even want to use the baskets or the parts they are carrying it with their arms or they leave it on the counter. The counter is always sprayed the girls. The registers are always afraid, I'm in a in a spot where I do have to show that things are clean. What have we been doing? The market? The store, that's been difficult right now, I mean we have a little sign outside. We have to tell people, we hear a word of mouth doorman say: Wayne Farms is open, I check the people that do know me. They pass the words around. We have sign on the door that says these are our new hours. These are the things we have been doing to try to market I haven't been doing anything to advertisement or anything like that, not right now, but these are the things we've been doing that market our store and yeah I understand it. It's you want to make the customer feel comfortable. People don't want to talk about this subject, but at the same time you have to make them know that you have to let them know that things are clean, that yeah I've acts. Sometimes customers, please use gloves. You know, because they start touching the Apple see if it's firm now with the summertime, so peaches and plums so they're. You know, and we back to please use gloves if you're going to so we provide gloves near the you know, the other stuff we've wrapped celery is wrapped. Broccoli is wrapped the zucchinis believe it or not. We've had to wrap it things like that. The meats are all wrapped and the other stuff the non perishable things we have to worry about, but yeah we stress caramel at this point. That's great I want to ask about masks so number one have. Has it been difficult for you two to find masks because I know that has been sort of tough for some people and I just want to sort of say that I know that the assembly member see right is doing a mask giveaway. So you might want to look into that. If you, if your so first of all, is it difficult to get the masks and then to you know is it? Has it been difficult to make sure the customers wear them? It sounds like some stores are getting into. You know arguments with potential customers who don't want to wear them. Yeah, we don't I, don't get into an argument. It's been stressful because it's me and the cashiers that are policing, because the cash is the first person that sees a customer come through it's difficult because we have it's like it's, not this stress of policing. Besides just doing business, a mask were hard to come by I had friends at Mount Sinai, and they were able to get me boxes of masks and stuff like that. Now it's not as difficult to get masks and we've had customers that make masks and they've donated it to the girls and stuff like that. Like I've got this mess, but this one I purchased, but there's a lot of mess with funny faces on it, and things like that, so it hasn't become a problem at one time gloves were becoming on low supply. That was hard, but now it's more fairly, so it that's it's easier to get that now and sanitizer was impossible, but now it's easier to get. But yes, some masks aren't a problem right now, but if they are yes, I would probably look out to this gentleman see like get some masks and as far as customers yeah we've been given customers in masks. If they don't have one and they still have refused and they don't want it and then we just say kindly that, then you can't shop in here and they leave quietly some. Don't some give me the middle finger. Some give us other gestures, and you know what I read it. I may lose that dollar or two dollars, but who knows that person might have been the one that would have caused everybody to get sick. So you know in the end you will lose more, so you know they don't want to wear a mask. Then it's too bad and there's nothing else. I can do you know and I've explained to them that it's the law and, like I've, told you I've had fun with the students. The medical students are the tough ones they're the ones telling us well. You know this mask doesn't protect us I'm saying well as for now. This is the law. I blame farms, you must wear a mask, you want to buy, wear a mask and that's what we've been practicing but I mean we've told them kindly it's not you know, but the ones who give us the middle things we just ignore him. Long ago, Michael or Julian's you wanna. You want to weigh in on the mask issue at all I'll Julianne, because she's kind of dealing with customers on a one-on-one basis, so okay hasn't been hard to find masks on and yeah I, don't I think maybe in the very beginning, but we were closed, and so it really didn't matter and we were becoming aware who was making them, but now it's not at all hard I've. Only to customers who were a little bit didn't want to wear them, but for the most part, actually I. Think customers really want to wear masks and actually, as I was setting up the store recently last week when we were allowed to open I think if people look in and like I didn't have my mask on I think they want to come in, so I went to or self-consciousness I'd rather be like I, don't necessarily wanna wear one. You know through you know all the hours on there someone's not there, but I think it's a deterrent, I think New Yorkers want to wear their masks. So I've done my mouse I like the ones you can read out easier, but I think the black ones are more attractive, so I'm trying to get used to bad what I'm wearing but I mean there are so many adorable masks where customers have had some really cute ones. So just wear your mask I mean it's not even a conversation. It's just the way it is so yeah. So I want to sort of ask you. What can consumers do to just be helpful in this moment? I think there's this. There are new rules that are being created. I've talked to a lot of restaurants. About you know with when you do outdoor dining that the etiquette now is you keep the mask on when you order, and you know you take it off when you're eating or drinking obviously, but you when you order you're supposed to keep it on. There's no law for that, but I just didn't know, there's anything that you that you might want to just sort of say: hey when you come into the store. These are certain things that you might want to think about. That would just be helpful for everyone. I think in I. Think I think one thing that's kind of important in this regard is to just remind people. You know if we can remind people with signage and which is the reason we kind of came up with that little poster and also just communicate to people what what's required, because I think you know over the last three months, a lot of people have been going stir-crazy and, of course, like people wants to get back out eating going to their favorite restaurants and cafes and bars that people want to have a sense that life is somehow returning to normal and I. Think you know by you, know subtly reminding people that they have a little responsibility and to just put your mask on and just be mindful and one of the other things about the poster. When we were designing it was we wanted to be kind of friendly, but also you know just enforcing reinforcing what people can do, because, again in this current clan, where people are going back out and they're going back shopping and they feel like life is getting back to normal they're going to forget, you know, I've walked out without my mask and I run back and I get it and I've forgotten. You know bringing sanitizer here and there because you're, obviously people are excited to go shopping again. They're excited to get back to their old lives and I've also been speaking to my sister in Ireland and this week and in Ireland. They really opened up this week and they've done a really good job up until now in many regards, but the attitude seems to be that it's over and people just aren't wearing their masks and I know from being from there. They're not like us here in New York people in New York really don't mind too much what other people change when it comes to wearing masks and things like that in Ireland people are a little bit more. You know they don't want to seem like they're doing something. That's too cool or my people might have some sort of a thing to say about them so and I think that's something that we can do is just to kind of subtly and friend, in a friendly way like just you know, reinforce the simple things that people can do, and that goes a long way because that's I believe, oh, they got us to flatten the curve in the first place, I think the young people that are the ones that don't I, noticed that a lot of my customers, they all wear, masks and they even come in with gloves. But I noticed it's the younger crowd. You know in their 20s my daughter's in Hershey Pennsylvania. She lives there. Pennsylvania and I took my wife up this weekend. Yeah and my wife says to her you're going out, you're, not wearing a mask, you saw, and it was wearing masks here and I notice. It it's that and if you go to the parks like I, go to a park and I play two-hand touch football there, and this is in the Bronx at Pelham. Bay, Park and I noticed that the only one who wasn't wearing a mask for the older players like me and a few other D young, they feel like they're Superman and it can happen to them and I. Think it's because of that. In the beginning, when this first came out, they were said. Oh, this affects people in their 50s or not so now they have. This thing always not gonna affect me. You know, look at my daughter's attitude, she's 23 years old. She writes with physical therapy. You would think he would know better and then the medical students I'm talking about they're in their twenties also so I think it's this false belief that the young are not affected. I hear governor coma when he speaks he says. Well, you may take it to your grandmother and your mother and a lot of the young people don't really live with their grandmothers almost so maybe they feel. Oh it ain't gonna happen to me. So I think the problem isn't with the whole populace I think it's the younger people cuz in my store, everyone that I've seen they all I'm telling you should see. Some people are wearing this shield covering their face and everything. So it's the younger generation I think that's having a problem with the mask and if there's no way that government or public officials can let them know it listen. This is affecting you too I. Think then you'll see that turn around and mask so I, as I said I haven't seen, I haven't had really problems with masks, although if I see cute masks in the shop, I complement them and I also I'm, trying so many different hand. Sanitizers. So I like to pass on the message of what I like the best so I say this is a great one, so we kind of just get them to use it and then buy their own I just want to address the idea of what can people do so, obviously again, I think safety, first, safety for them I think we're kind of like a doctor's office. In a way they have to trust us, so we have to take care just like if a doctor is gonna, pull blood they're going to use alcohol they're gonna do all of that. So I have to make sure my store is beautifully. Clean I have to make sure that when I'm touching anything I make sure I clean it properly. If I'm helping somebody even put something on if they really can't, but I'm also encouraging people to try on themselves, I'm really trying to just not go near people and that's a whole new way of showing things most important I think it's important to support your local stores. So either you come in to shop or call, and we do by phone or tell your neighbor about us, because in the end health first, but then of course, if you want us all to stay, it is about commerce. So we're here for you, and so we passed that on fantastic Michael. I'm gonna give you the last word since you have that great guide. Do you want to let people know again just remind them where they can get it and sort of you know how they can use it for now, and it's going to be posted I'm, pretty certain on the CBF Manhattan website and I. That's what we have a poster for now and, of course the dream would be to figure out if we can somehow distribute us eventually, but am that's not my part of the deal really like yeah but I'm, just it's yeah. If you go to the Manhattan Community Board Manhattan, Community Board a website, that's www.cpa.psu.edu, just so. People realize these guidelines. There they're just guidelines and people will take and relieve them as they will for them. Like I said earlier, like they're, very much in the spirit of what we accomplished collectively was flattening the curve. Our business owners have a massive burden. I keep coming back to that a lot of business. Our business owners are reopening after suffering tremendous tragedy. I spoke to a very good friend of mine. Ooh owns a restaurant here in the city who stayed open as much as he could and one of his chefs caught it and passed away. Unfortunately, so it's been a tough time for a lot of people, but I am you know if we want to get back to some sense of the life we once had before and bringing all the good elements of that and leave some of the not-so-good elements behind that's fine by me and by following these simple guidelines we can really. You know, help for business owners help us. So thanks very much for him. Give me the opportunity to have a few words tonight. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Michael and thank you to Julia and Vaughn. Your insights are just so and well received and just wonderful to hear and I would be up to purchase some of that wrapped celery and my girlfriend's birthday is coming up soon. So who knows I might swing by 81st. Street is now hey guys, shop, local, you know, you know, I'm gonna, tell you something the other day I was driving by Hackensack and there's this old a little Italian deli and he had a billboard outside. You know, I said yes, I read and it's right. He put I'm a local owner of a small business, I owned one small home when you shop at my store. You help me take care of a twelve-year-old daughter, I, have and a 17 year old son who goes and gets piano lessons when you shop at these other I won't mention names, you help them get a third home and you help them with other things. Maybe a BMW and all that so do shop locally, help your local store, because you know what he's there for you and you know they need you and these the dry cleaners next to me, and these other guys and my colleague will tell you with just little local people, just family people and that's all we have that's how we take care of our family and when you do shop there, you do help the family and you help even the employees that work there that are family people too. Anyway, thanks for listening to me and thanks for having me thank you well said, Vaughn. Thank you so much. We really do appreciate you Vaughn. Thank you! So much Julianne, it's all about small business. That's what makes the community so thank you all. I'm gonna hand it back to Aleta. Now for our closing remarks. Thank you. It's been such a great pleasure to listen to all of you to hear the real experiences that you have and what you expect. What you look for some customers to help you survive to help you do more than that and even to thrive. You give a lot to the community we've heard about how bond will deliver that his delivery, guys before the crisis, would stock your shelves. Yesterday, I went up to see his store because we had talked over a zoom call and he was just incredibly lovely. He mentioned to me the story about the Lysol and how he glossed over it tonight, but how he kept it for the elderly because he knew that it would matter more to them. You don't see that kind of service. You heard about Julie Ann, talking about how she gets customers to use sanitizer by talking up the good ones and how she tries not to touch the customers being sensitive to them. How excited she is, and very importantly, about her optimism and from Mick what things were like when he was running the positive experiences of his friend. Those are the kinds of stories. Those are the kinds of reactions that we see from our local businesses that as much as it may be valuable to find some weird quirky food, someplace or a brand of shoes at a discount price. It really matters to our businesses, to our neighborhoods, to our city and to be able to shop local, so I want to thank our speakers for Julie, Ann and Vaughn and Michael, who have been invaluable, I. Think in showing us the importance of how we work together. It's synergistic, it's cooperative, is collaborative some of my favorite words and it really matters to all of us. So thank you so much for everyone for being here for sharing with us and stay tuned. If we do more programs, we'd love to have you Jessica, as always you're a treasure. Thank you to everyone for being here help our businesses do their business shop, local and everything that everyone suggested and use our poster. We worked hard to make it special for you guys. Thank you so much for tuning in good night.
