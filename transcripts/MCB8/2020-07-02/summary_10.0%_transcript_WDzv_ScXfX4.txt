Our current situation, a leader camp, who is a wonderful engaged positive chair as well as all of my former colleagues on the board, your support, energy and collaboration in particular of tonight's presentation, is both inspiring and gives me so much hope that we can really make a difference in helping our local small businesses survive and thrive.
It is so important that our local owners have the right guidance and the tools to effectively reopen, or for some continued to do business in this age of Covid-19.
Our sidewalks are stuck in our shelves of toilet paper and all the other essential needs, and of course, there are- There will continue to be massive challenges and changes to our lives with covered, but the simple things like working from home, if you could wearing face coverings in public hand, washing and sanitizing on a regular basis, all meant that we collectively were able to flatten the curve.
By focusing on that unspoken contract that I spoke about earlier and the spirit that flattened the curve, and we identified a number of guidelines that people can take or leave but bear in mind by adhering to these simple guidelines, you will be making it easier for your local cafes, book, shops, bodegas, grocery stores, apparel stores and even Irish pubs to navigate the uncertain days weeks and months, ahead.
The last few months, people are used to this, you know always wear a mask or a face covering when you go into a store or any place of business, and not only are you protecting the workers there And you're, helping to prevent a spread.
Push at the moment is a good lesson to just stay and if you feel at all ill and also remember that a lot of our local businesses are available online, you can shop online from a lot of local businesses and a message I think you're going to hear more later on is when you invest in a local business, you're, investing on in your block, you're, investing in your neighborhood, and it's really important.
If you are doing any online shopping and you can't leave the house, you can go online and another important thing to point out: is you know, with the proliferation of a lot of apps, sometimes they're, not the very best for a lot of our small local restaurants and restaurants that provide delivery and take- out.
You give yourself that bit more time to actually plan when you're going out to do your bit of shopping or running a business that you do, and that brings us to you know the final three little guidelines that We'd, like people to be mind.
You know, ask the staff to handle merchandise, so they do not need to unnecessarily quarantine or have to disinfect or sanitize goods, and also this kind of it's a simple thing like when you're in a shop.
We've heard lots of stories of you know: people getting anxious and getting into panic attacks in stores over the last couple of months because of what's going on.
It will also give us a better sense of control over Hispanic and, at the same time, give our local business owners a chance to reopen grow, survive and thrive, and I just like to thank you all so much for taking the time out to come by and listen to what we have to say here this evening.
You know the old- fashioned stuff that people from the neighborhood were used to having it's been tough time in these times, because we've had to try to do many different things to keep our customers.
What we've been having a hard time with lately is that it was hard getting workers to come in to work, because you know they were afraid to take subways and things like that.
Let me make sure I'm clean You know no one's getting sick or happen as far as customers that come into the store and say I do not want to wear a mask and things like that.
So an essential item, as you might guess, during COBIT, I, feel like people will always want to be in New, York But, how we're able to work out deals and that's still big question marks, but It is like no other Street and, as I said.
You know it's interesting, because I would have to pop into my store to take care of things and as people would take masked and gloves and everything their walks.
People do not want to talk about this subject, but at the same time you have to make them know that you have to let them know that things are clean, that Has it been difficult for.
You two to find masks because I know that has been sort of tough for some people.
Think customers really want to wear masks and actually, as I was setting up the store recently last week when we were allowed to open I.
You keep the mask on when you order, and There's no law for that, but I just did not know, there's anything that you that you might want to just sort of say: hey when you come into the store.
What other people change when it comes to wearing masks and things like that in Ireland?
And I think that's something that we can do is just to kind of subtly and friend, in a friendly way like just you, know, reinforce the simple things that people can do, and that goes a long way because that's I believe, They got us to flatten the curve in the first place.
I think the young people that are the ones that do not I noticed that a lot of my customers, they all wear, masks and they even come in with gloves.
The other day I was driving by Hackensack Yes, I read He, put I'm a local owner of a small business, I owned one small home when you shop at my store.
