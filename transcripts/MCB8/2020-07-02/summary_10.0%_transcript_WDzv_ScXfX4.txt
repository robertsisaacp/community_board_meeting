The curve also meant that we were allowing other essential workers, the time and space to do their essential work, whether it was maintaining and operating the public transport cleaning, and there will continue to be massive challenges and changes to our lives with covered, but the simple things like working from home, if you could wearing face coverings in public hand, washing and sanitizing on a regular basis, all meant that we collectively were able to flatten the curve.
People are used to this You know always wear a mask or a face covering when you go into a store or any place of business, and not only are you protecting the workers there and you're helping to prevent a spread.
You know the final three little guidelines that we'd like people to be mind: The landscape for businesses and workers has changed drastically like the rest of us and help our local businesses and the workers who work there, help them help when you're in a shop, We've heard lots of stories of you know: people getting anxious and getting into panic attacks in stores over the last couple of months because of what's going on and we'll be sharing this document with our local business owners and partners.
I believe, by adopting the same responsible approach to how we conduct ourselves while shopping eating out and going about our everyday business, it will also give us a better sense of control over Hispanic and, at the same time, give our local business owners a chance to reopen grow, survive and thrive, and I just like to thank you all so much for taking the time out to come by and listen to what we have to say here this evening.
All right, we service a small community All. You know the old-fashioned stuff that people from the neighborhood were used to having it's been tough time in these times, because we've had to try to do many different things to keep our customers Speaking to someone we provide free delivery, We even provide where at one time we would our delivery guys are so close to the customers that they would even could step on their shops.
You know no one's getting sick or happen as far as customers that come into the store and say I, don't want to wear a mask and things like that, and we just follow the rules also and make sure that we only have one cashier and one customer come to the register.
Navona also is a small independent, but there are not that many of us on the avenue anymore, so I'm, incredibly proud of that, and not that my comrades I have gotten to know them actually more somewhat through code, because we have virtual meetings all the time and it is an incredible community of stores managers as well as some other owners too So I'm, a woman owned business as well.
We have a web presence, but we really don't do business on the web, but we do our customers love our emails and they all immediately wrote, notes and continued to write notes throughout the pandemic to us So. We definitely have a wonderful customer base, but when you are on the Avenue and patrons for the Avenue, because the museums are nearby to bring in tourists So, first of course health I feel like people will always want to be in New. and, as I said, you know it's interesting, because I would have to pop into my store to take care of things and as people would take masked and gloves and everything their walks.
The world of the goodwill of our community You know make certain businesses stand out, but anything about your marketing and how that might have changed throughout this first whack That I understand why people do talk about that, but I'ma show don't tell so when people come in, I am masked So in terms of marketing.
then you'll see that turn around and mask, although, if I see cute masks in the shop, I complement them I just want to address the idea of what can people do so , obviously again, I think safety, first, safety for them I think we're kind of like a doctor's office , they're going to use alcohol, If I'm, helping somebody even put something on if they really can't, but I'm also encouraging people to try on themselves, I'm really trying to just not go near people and that's a whole new way of showing things most important I think it's important to support your local stores, Either you come in to shop or call, and we do by phone or tell your neighbor about us, because in the end health first, but then, of course, if you want us all to stay, it is about commerce Do. You want to let people know I'm, pretty certain on the CBF Manhattan website and I If, you go to the Manhattan Community Board Manhattan, Community Board, a website just so There they're just guidelines and people will take and relieve them as they will for them.
So it's been a tough time for a lot of people, but I am you know if we want to get back to some sense of the life we once had before and bringing all the good elements of that and leave some of the not-so-good elements behind that's fine by me and by following these simple guidelines really You know help for business owners help us Street is now hey guys, shop, local.
You help them get a third home Maybe, a BMW and all that so do shop locally, help your local store, because you know what he's there for you and my colleague will tell you with just little local people, just family people and that's all we have that's how we take care of our family and when you do shop there, you do help the family , that are family people too So much Julianne, it's all about small business What makes the community so!
