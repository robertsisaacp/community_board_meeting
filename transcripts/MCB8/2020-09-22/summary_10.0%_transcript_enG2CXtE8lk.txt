Dr asha mcdougall is the director of women's health practice and community health at new york, presbyterian hospital, where she is committed to provide the best care for all of her patients, and she is.
What's really important to understand is the difference between equality versus equity and when we're thinking about equality speaks to the same everyone having the same thing and as you can see from the top half of this panel, everyone indeed has the same exact bicycle.
As a physician, I'm, going to give you an example of a patient, and this is just going to give you an example of how we see healthcare inequity, For me, as a culmination of many different people that I see so miss j is a 42 year old woman who lives in the Bronx As a cashier at a c-town and part-time as a home health, attendant.
Please, when we look at the demographics of the patients that we take care of more than four in ten of our patients were born outside of the united states and when we look at the the sources of our foreign-born patients, they're coming from the dr from mexico, lots of the caribbean, also from bangladesh and from colombia and china, we use interpretation services very often at health and hospitals.
Next slide, please, and one of the things that we really work hard to do, is to address the social determinants of health, and this is part of what we do in our office of population.
We need to get more upstream, and this is what we try to do when we take care of our patients, and so they asked me to talk about what a chief pop health officer, does- This is part of what we do is think about the entire patient, the entire population of patients, that we take care of.
Having and taking the best care of them that we can in the space that they are and with the challenges that they may personally be experiencing, and I, think I'll end there and save time for questions.
And, we'll talk more about cohen hospital, as well as the women's health clinic and the hemsley tower 5, to describe some of the community engagement that we participate in the services that we provide.
You know the u.s particularly, and so it's been great to work with many partners in new york, city, And, I'm, actually on the maternal mortality review committee, which has been an eye opener for me, because I'm actually a bostonian so sort of this whole new york thing It's been very helpful in sort of setting the goals that I have from my own department, one of which was to make sure that, at the very least for our patients in the women's health clinic that we have a leader who is dedicated to community health as opposed to someone who's.
That's something to take into consideration when we are thinking about health care equity is that patients are coming to our.
Another service that we provide you know in regard to maternal mortality and morbidity is a two-week telemedicine visit for all patients who are delivered out of the new york presbyterian cornell campus hospital, regardless.
You know if they are either privately or in our in our clinic a two-week postpartum visit by a provider either a nurse a nurse practitioner or one of our physicians will contact them and discuss a number of different things, including postpartum depression, lactation, support and continued care in that postpartum period, which is very important in meeting our aims for increasing our health care outcomes for patients who are pregnant and immediately postpartum.
Even in the rush of everything that has happened, this year, it was very successfully opened in the david cole, building between 68th and new york and in a in and as far as health care, equity.
You, know a lot of health care in new york city from you, know.
You know certain hospitals or certain services, because there are certain hospitals that may have various levels of care that they can provide to different patients.
I, think we're really good and getting better at taking care of women and making things safe, while they're in front of us right So, while they're on labor and delivery, while they're in the immediate postpartum stay.
All of the data shows right now that certainly you know I'll just give one like little example: Pregnant women that get pre-eclampsia or toxemia of pregnancy, which is a pregnancy-only disease of high blood pressure and swelling and can affect your kidney and your liver, but just those women who have preeclampsia during pregnancy depending on the study, some something like five to have a five to twelve times higher risk of cardiovascular disease as early as ten years after having their baby, so their you know, pregnancy, actually is probably this horrible cardiovascular stress test that you know women who are already not in good shape, then don't do well during pregnancy.
I just think in general patients come into contact with so many people in the hospital that I personally, don't like the idea of requiring this kind of bias, training.
You know help them to really achieve what they need to achieve in terms of having good health outcomes, and that's often challenging to do.
You know a term like a substance, abuser Where, as a doc, I, completely felt I was not empowered to speak at all in that space, because I did not want to say the wrong thing and offend in my just ignorance of not understanding what certain terms meant when a patient heard, it, and so I think that you know creating those types of environments and dialogues is really important and something that I hope that we're going to be able to continue to do.
How do you I apologize, but I'm, just wondering if it is something I think it is because you said social work, but how you address the various needs of patients And and how you make that health care available and and work with, to avoid or minimize the kinds of stigma that still may be attached.
You, know, sort of standardly get this same information from every patient, and since I got here, I just couldn't get people to do it in a standardized way, but we finally got it up and running right before Covid-19, and you know, I think, as dr davis said, you know, and certainly the mental health system that really doesn't exist was really.
Know, brought it home in terms of you know all the deficiencies, and so what we're setting up at the moment is because it's so difficult to get psychiatric help in the city for all sorts of reasons, probably because there's just not enough of it, but we're hoping to set up a system where there's a layering effect of social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, community health workers, who can you know, help women at where they are, as opposed to where we think they may be, and because I think many women at least my experience of having practice ob for about 30 years now, many women have elements of postpartum, depression and postpartum anxiety, but not all of the elements, and not all of them need drugs.
The situation they're in than it is the hormonal issues going on, and so we need the resources to be able to parse that out and take care of women in whatever space they're in that We're working towards is this layering system just be because thinking that you're going to have enough psychiatrists to take care of the 30 of most pregnant populations that need it?
It probably depends on the kind of insurance and is that something that varies across the patients from h and the patients at a private hospital like new york, presbyterian or wild cornell, and how the city is able to handle those disparities in in not just access, but the ability to actually get treatment.
So we have the consulting psychiatrists, who work with the social workers and even some of our nurses, where we have educated on how to do some counseling and depending on how impacted that patient might be in terms of their mental health.
You know is the multi-layer and really the need to collaborate with a number of different providers, not just physicians, so at the ht5 clinic we'll be starting group prenatal support classes, which is actually a new program that our social workers have initiated because of the results of the devastation from Covid-19.
And I'm, convinced that it that a doula program could be incredibly helpful for a wider population, and The thing I like about the doula program is that there can be many more of them because they're in the community, as opposed to midwives, which you know that's a few years of training and training up That's what I'm working on we do.
I am a donor as well as a patient to the medical department of new york, presbyterian and wild cornell as well, and I'm interested in knowing about the new cohen hospital in the coke building.
You also take patients that are not of hospital patients, but might be city hospital, patient We, don't turn anybody away we, but in general I think most obstetrical services want to take care of the people who have gotten their prenatal care in our institution, whether it's in the ht5 clinic or it's in one of the faculty practices But there are women who you know were getting their care at montefiore or one of the city, hospitals They hear about a shiny, new hospital, and so they show up and they deliver.
Senator kruger has you know just questions about what might the potential be for telemedicine to create a two-tier system of sorts, so in other words, whether some people would have greater access to in-person medical appointments or even to telemedicine, And I mean we've, definitely pivoted a lot towards telemedicine, and that is definitely one of the things that we have to be really concerned about is not creating another level of inequity.
You know it seems to me that they're so eager to get it out there, but that there's going to be a lot of problems in distribution and clinics such as you described it at wild cornell, certainly have ample opportunity to reach out, as do all the municipal hospitals, any just general thoughts on how we might get a vaccine to all these people who so need it.
I think that the next piece of that is, you know it's all about the safety and obviously efficacy, but it's also about patients, acceptance of the vaccine, So The very population that may actually need the vaccine.
I think that you know I'm actually on the cdc's work group on Covid-19.
You know, I think that a lot of I would say, probably every single obstetrical unit in this city, if not in the state, has a huge sort of group of people who do lactation.
