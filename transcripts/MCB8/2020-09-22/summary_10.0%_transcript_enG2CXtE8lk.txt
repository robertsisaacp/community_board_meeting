You will tell us what a chief population officer actually is Dr Asha Mcdougall is the director of women's health practice and community health at New York Presbyterian Hospital, where she is committed to provide the best care for all of her patients, and she is.
For me, as a culmination of many different people that I see so Miss J is a 42 year old woman who lives in the Bronx She has a primary care doctor that she sees regularly, but she has had difficulty controlling her diabetes , she's, a single mom with two children, ages, 11 and 8, and she works part- time as a cashier at a c- town and part- time as a home health, attendant.
Now I'm going to just talk a little bit about how our public health system addresses health and equity, please so at New, York, City, Health and hospitals.
When we look at the demographics of the patients that we take care of more than four in ten of our patients were born outside of the United States, and when we look at the the sources of our foreign- born patients, they're, coming from the Dr from Mexico lots of the Caribbean, also from bangladesh and from Colombia and China, we use interpretation services very often at health and hospitals.
We need to get more upstream, and this is what we try to do when we take care of our patients, and so they asked me to talk about what a chief pop health officer, does- This is part of what we do is think about the entire patient, the entire population of patients, that we take care of.
And, we'll talk more about Cohen hospital, as well as the women's health clinic and the Hemsley Tower 5, to describe some of the community engagement that we participate in the services that we provide.
But. You know the U.S particularly, and so it's been great to work with many partners in New, York, City It's been very helpful in sort of setting the goals that I have from my own department, one of which was to make sure that, at the very least for our patients in the women's health clinic that we have a leader who is dedicated to community health as opposed to someone who's.
I am a native New yorker, just so just a little bit about myself, I'm, a native of the outer boroughs, I'm from Queens, born and raised a product of New York, City, Public, School education and am so proud to have returned after living out of state for quite a bit and moving back to New York, but in Long, Island, Suffolk, County, a very different feel and really coming back home to you know , participate here in will cornell as a member of community health.
That's something to take into consideration when we are thinking about health care equity is that patients are coming to our.
Telemedicine visit for all patients who are delivered out of the New York Presbyterian Cornell Campus Hospital, regardless you know if they are either privately or in our in our clinic a two- week.
Postpartum visit by a provider either a nurse a nurse practitioner or one of our physicians, will contact them and discuss a number of different things, including postpartum depression, lactation, support and continued care in that postpartum period, which is very important in meeting our aims for increasing our health care outcomes for patients who are pregnant and immediately postpartum.
You, know a lot of health care in New York City from you know.
The focus is on how you relate and con with your community, whatever type of relationship you have with the members of your community, and you know how we can all work together to meet the needs of those who do not have direct contact with you know certain hospitals or certain services, because there are certain hospitals that may have various levels of care that they can provide to different patients.
I, think we're really good and getting better at taking care of women and making things safe, while they're in front of us right So, while they're on labor and delivery, while they're in the immediate postpartum stay.
I just think in general patients come into contact with so many people in the hospital that I personally do not like the idea of requiring this kind of bias, training.
Think many people learned lots of things, but I think that you know I'm not naive enough to think that one bias, training or even one series of bias training is going to change.
And I felt like it was an important case to present to the faculty and the nurses and the pas and the residents etc, because I think that until people recognize that this really has an adverse impact on care, they won't really change their behavior, and so I think that we're going to have to just you know present these over and over and over again, and I and I really respect what you said you know.
And I think also you know, sort of making sure that patients feel empowered enough to actually make the complaint.
You know help them to really achieve what they need to achieve in terms of having good health outcomes, and that's often challenging to do.
I think it was really one of those situations where, as a doc, I, completely felt I was not empowered to speak at all in that space, because I did not want to say the wrong thing and offend in my just ignorance of not understanding what certain terms meant when a patient heard, it, and so I think that you know creating those types of environments and dialogues is really important and something that I hope that we're going to be able to continue to do.
How do you I apologize, but I'm, just wondering if it is something I think it is because you said social work, but how you address the various needs of patients And and how you make that health care available and and work with, to avoid or minimize the kinds of stigma that still may be attached.
You know, sort of standardly get this same information from every patient, and since I got here, I just could not get people to do it in a standardized way, but we finally got it up and running right before Covid-19, and you know, I think, as Dr Davis said, you know, and certainly the mental health system that really does not exist was really.
Know, brought it home in terms of you know all the deficiencies, and so what we're setting up at the moment is because it's so difficult to get psychiatric help in the city for all sorts of reasons, probably because there's just not enough of it, but we're hoping to set up a system where there's a layering effect of social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, community health workers, who can you know, help women at where they are, as opposed to where we think they may be, and because I think many women at least my experience of having practice Ob for about 30 years now, many women have elements of postpartum, depression and postpartum anxiety, but not all of the elements, and not all of them need drugs.
The situation they're in than it is the hormonal issues going on, and so we need the resources to be able to parse that out and take care of women in whatever space they're in that We're working towards is this layering system just be because thinking that you're going to have enough psychiatrists to take care of the 30 of most pregnant populations that need it?
It probably depends on the kind of insurance, and is that something that varies acrosss the patients from h and the patients at a private hospital like New, York, Presbyterian or wild cornell, and how the city is able to handle those disparities in in not just access, but the ability to actually get treatment.
Will dr Davis Respond, also You know we do a lot of mental health care within our primary care settings and what we've done is developed a collaborative model through our, where we have consulting psychiatrists, who then work with our social workers, some of whom come through the mental health service corps, which was the thrive NYC program.
So we have the consulting psychiatrists, who work with the social workers and even some of our nurses, where we have educated on how to do some counseling and depending on how impacted that patient might be in terms of their mental health.
You know it's going to be a lot for us to manage as healthcare systems We we work to try to manage it and to expand our resources as much as possible.
I would expect that there's just going to be lots more mental health needs right, and can you hear me, so at the ht5 clinic we'll be starting group prenatal, support classes, which is actually a new program that our social workers have initiated because of the results of the devastation from Covid-19?
And I'm, convinced that it that a doula program could be incredibly helpful for a wider population, and The thing I like about the Doula program is that there can be many more of them because they're in the community, as opposed to midwives, which you know that's a few years of training and training So, that's what I'm working on we do.
We do not turn anybody away we, but in general I think most obstetrical services want to take care of the people who have gotten their prenatal care in our institution, whether it's in the ht5 clinic or it's in one of the faculty practices , that's the bulk of our deliveries, so you know, but there are women who you know were getting their care at montefiore or one of the city, hospitals They hear about a shiny, new hospital, and so they show up and they deliver.
Think telemedicine in some ways has made things you know more accessible and absolutely during Covid-19.
You know it seems to me that they're so eager to get it out there, but that there's going to be a lot of problems in distribution and clinics such as you described it at wild Cornell, certainly have ample opportunity to reach out, as do all the municipal hospitals, any just general thoughts on how we might get a vaccine to all these people who so need it.
It's going to be very difficult for me to have conversations with my patients about whether or not to recommend the vaccine during pregnancy, and I feel like it's possible that we may not recommend the vaccine for all pregnant women, but certainly the data would suggest that women with diet, pregnant women with diabetes and obesity, and some of those with hypertension are at significantly increased risk for severe outcomes related to Covid-19., in which case you might want to think about them or healthcare workers right, frontline.
I think that the next piece of that is, you know it's all about the safety and obviously efficacy, but it's also about patients, acceptance of the vaccine, So The very population that may actually need the vaccine.
I think that you know I'm actually on the Cdc's work group on Covid-19 , that's good, so I think great people on those task.
