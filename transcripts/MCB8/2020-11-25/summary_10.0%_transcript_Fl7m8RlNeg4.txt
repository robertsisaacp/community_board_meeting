What may not have been going on since then, and as an added bonus, He is going to tell us about this report that just came out last week about really important stuff that could be happening to housing in New, York, City.
They didn't cover everybody, so people could fall through the cracks and just the fact that their executive orders mean that they expire and that there's always a little bit of uncertainty, which is not what you want as a tenant or as a landlord for that matter.
In theory, It was supposed to help cover the difference between what you used to be able to pay and what you can be able to pay now if your income went down as a result, that program was almost universally understood to be too small, too difficult to access and therefore likely to leave out many people who needed it.
Broadly, not every organization, not even always mine, the three bills that the housing movement was rallying behind and those were first an eviction moratorium, which is to say putting it into law, rather than just an executive order covering everybody, residential and commercial and saying it's going to last for the duration of the pandemic, plus time to recover to take out that uncertainty and to make sure everybody is covered at this time when staying in your home is the number one key to staying.
The second was something called the housing access, voucher, program, which would be a new state, level, rental voucher.
That would operate something like a state run section 8 program and would be meant to both keep people from becoming homeless and to get the homeless into permanent housing rather than relying on are extensive and very expensive and underwhelming from the client experience, shelter system and.
You're going to have to send it back, which itself is atrocious, but the state government has not figured out a way to to spend that money on rent relief.
It can't go on forever, and that leads me to our most recent publication of the community service society, which came out last week, which is called corporate, windfalls or social housing, conversions looming mortgage crisis and the challenges or choices facing New York.
We argue that the city and state governments need to step in and stepping in means not just helping the tenants pay their rent to the landlord who over leverage their building but creating opportunities to transform over leveraged buildings into what we call social housing, which is a common phrase in Europe and Latin America and other places.
That basically means housing that is deeply affordable to those who need it and permanently so housing, where the residents have some form of control over decision making, how the building is run and housing.
They're slightly different in ways that will probably get realigned, but the idea is the city should basically and the state should give tenants the right of first refusal when their building goes up for sale and should provide support to buy the building at market value if they can keep it permanently affordable, which means something like a limited equity, co-op model or a community land trust, or they can select a non-profit to be the purchaser and operate it through section, 8, vouchers, project, base, section 8, some other form, low-income housing, tax, credit, some other form of financing permanently or long-term, affordable, housing.
Not you know, rolling, back the rent, protections, but expanding them doing things like good cause.
It's hard to do at a moment when you know our budgets are strained, but it's also hard to do at a time when land values are high and so there's a real argument to be made that it's actually in the down market that we need the intervention.
A new Mitchell Llama program could look like what we need at the city, state and federal level to achieve it.
8 buildings in the lower east side and related actually started out in that mixed for-profit, affordable, housing, model, and they seem to be returning to it now because they know that that's housing.
The for-profits, know this it's time for the city and state to take action to make sure that they're, not you know, The, future beneficiaries of the up market.
This is proper, but we need to make sure when we talk to candidates that we get some like on the Upper East side, not just in certain neighborhoods, because you know I can see.
They're, going to think land will come back and they're not going to build it on the Upper East side, which we don't do have some old butcher.
Llamas, but we need new ones and well, it's very important that they hear from the community board that you would want genuinely affordable housing in your neighborhoods, because the assumption is always that you don't, and.
So, you know for a lot of affordable housing.
You know low rent housing, that's not in an affordable housing, program.
You, know a non-profit that does affordable housing in their neighborhood and say we want them to buy it.
We've already been through this, but if we weren't our right of first refusal, if we couldn't afford to buy it or didn't have public money, we'd probably say we want.
It was at the city level, Then there you know that can be taken up more readily, but I think it was at the state.
There is a proposal, that's being talked about for anti-warehousing, saying that, basically, If you don't put your property on the market, it's going to be taxed at a much higher rate, that's being talked about by city candidates, but would require state legislation and I.
Agreement to you, know, keep the housing affordable in the long term that can be through the existing landlord if they voluntarily enter into it or it can be through a non-profit if they can't afford the building at the rents that are set right.
I did an exercise, so I understand very well what I'm talking about, because if you said oh I just want to put those people that are very loyal where the money coming from, because the lending all the affordable housing has to be subsidized but has to be subsidizing.
There said no I don't want to have affordable housing in my community.
It's because they don't understand how important it is to legislate not only in our community but in the whole entire city, because at the time when we create affordable housing, we have to create an a an inclusive, neighborhood.
I. Think a lot of people live in the same kinds of housing for all their lives and can pass that on to their children, and so I would expect the same right to affordable housing, residents, but I respect the difference, but either way I completely agree that if we don't take action, now, things are going to look worse and worse into the future and even just from a fiscal perspective.
I don't want to go off on a tangent about the way in which sometimes we talk about those folks in an affordable, housing.
Support legislation that will encourage these kinds of social housing, I think, in terms of low-hanging fruit, One thing I didn't mention is certain kinds of real estate will probably be in trouble before multi-family housing.
So, you know, as a result of what I talked about with people, making, really tough choices and still paying the rent shortfalls are not nearly to the percentage that income shortfalls are.
If we put retail aside for a moment because it doesn't really work as a housing conversion, program, hotels are a different story, There's good ways.
We should be thinking about affordable, sustainable, safe ways of transforming hotels into housing and the places that this is going to work, best.
You know the hotels that are out by Laguardia and Jfk, and that are you, know, not really great places to live, especially if you're coming out of a homeless shelter, but in the neighborhoods where people can find work where they can get supports, There's different models.
They have conference rooms, They have dining services like they have laundry services that it's actually not that big a transformation, but it also could be more permanent housing aimed at people coming out of the shelter system.
You combine two rooms into one put a kitchen into one of them, You suddenly have one a large number of one bedroom, one or two bedroom apartments, without going through the entire process of acquiring land building new housing.
We want to build permanent, affordable housing that will help people transition out of the shelters and into something long.
I think we can go one step further and turn them into decent housing and make sure that we don't have the return of the old welfare hotel model, which is really not good for anybody.
That's involved in housing, and we don't want to mix up the two, but I think that there is plenty of room to cut back on some of the things that make housing unnecessarily expensive to build.
Affordable housing brings down a neighborhood that I just want to show everybody.
So that he could have everybody come in, meanwhile, that affordable housing brought small businesses like shoemakers, libraries, schools, but.
Affordable housing is you know when you think that they're going to bring in the great unwashed of the world.
We have people who are working in hospitals who can't afford the rent they are, and we now know are essential.
So much for coming, Affordable housing is really an issue for CBA, as is it should be for communities around the city, and it's such a desperate, need.
What is the difference between the effectiveness of an eviction moratorium signed by the governor as an executive order and one passed by a legislative body, and also are you in conversation with any of the many people running for office about their positions on affordable housing and what they could do and what the city should should be doing.
I know that we're trying to do something immediately, but, I, affordable housing, is a crisis around the country, as we've seen gentrification pushing people out all over the place.
And I know that New York is unique that have tackled the issue of affordable housing in a way.
Now, the city of Philadelphia, basically just passed over a lot of affordable housing that was at risk of expiring to a community land trust which exists in perpetuity, and that's one way of getting out of that model of housing that just like is created, is affordable and then disappears, and then the next generation doesn't get to benefit from it.
We have you know a few locations in our district community district where it's, the buildings have been torn down and the land has been vacant for a long, time.
It seems to me that we have this very a system of perverse incentives where developers right now can keep lots vacant and warehoused, essentially until they're ready to build up, and I'm wondering whether you think a land value tax would be effective at addressing that thanks, Sam. So, on the first question about rezonings in high income, neighborhoods I, certainly think it makes a lot more sense than the approach that the city has taken so far, which is to basically only do these rezonings in areas where the median income is lower than the target range of the affordable housing, and so it ends up adding expensive housing and then affordable, housing.
You know whether or not this is the best way to produce affordable, housing, And I think we have better models.
Yes, The second question about the land value, tax, I think that's an old and important idea that we should be looking at now.
I believe that we have to create like a tax for those properties that profit the Second Avenue Subway, so they demolish affordable, housing.
We- had to think more as a social housing and the mission statement of this law for property almost match with the needs of affordable housing, because if you create the hvfc program, this is a failure.
Thinking is working with a no-for-profit organization with these people that understand their mission statement is to stay right here to enforce the law to enforce the housing has to.
Okay, because we want something to come out of this and I Sam. You have to help us with the wording of it, but I think we want the state legislature to convene immediately to pass, and then you can give us the language of the bills.
I think it's I would like to do it on land use.
Oh sorry, I just rolled up Marco, you call it Marco, Well, I wasn't planning to call the question, but the issue right here is I absolutely agree with the moratorium, But at the same time we had to put that Delano has to have some relief because the landlord can not hold the all the expenses of what I just don't know.
