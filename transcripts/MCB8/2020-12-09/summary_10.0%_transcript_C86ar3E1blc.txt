We found out about this meeting tonight, It will be up to you and the community board to make your voices heard at this step in the process, with your support or opposition, or with improvements with discretionary approval.
You're interested in event, you're, building or letting me know what you think of this project.
The blood center needs a new building, but rather than raise money for that, they've apparently sold their soul to a Boston developer long fellow real estate, partners, LLC and in the process they showed they don't give a rat's ass about this neighborhood.
A new building that will give them actually more space than they say, they're, going to need, take in the Longfellow Tower, and also the new building which they could build within zoning would allow them to get almost triple the number of employees they currently have.
They were honest, which would have been nice and they looked at mid-block buildings, They would have seen that this proposed tower is about as out of place as a cat and a dog park.
In other words, It's about 25 feet short shorter than the blood tower, unlike the building across the street that they highlight states that they're going to cover the entire lot from 67 to 60.
You could imagine putting the 59th street mid block in a residential neighborhood, You'll know how just preposterous and crazy this project is, but it's not just the height and width of this building.
Also, the number of people going mid block every day, They say they're, Two thousand six hundred thirty people full-time employees every day which is twenty 2400 more than they current have and almost 2,000 more than the blood center could occupy if they built a building within the zoning.
You want to take out what's already there, it's probably the top tier, but the rest of it is all new people going mid, block.
Every day, If you want another way to compare it, the three closest buildings they talk about in their presentation, All along avenues are 770 units in three apartment, buildings, 129 stories, which would be the tallest residential building in the city, summer, studios, summer, one bedrooms.
I'm told that St Catharines is the second most used park in the city based on size, so adding somewhere between 2,000 and 2,400 people across the street.
Breast imaging center is on 66 between second and first plus, All the traffic coming off the 59th street bridge and up first Avenue that wants to go to the west side goes down.
I am appearing as an attorney for the cooperative apartment building at 333 East 66th street, which is at the first day of toward the first Avenue end of 66th street, where the traffic comes and starts going.
It's probably that last item that the blood center highlighted most highly in their presentation last time, I, think incorrectly and inaccurately and misleadingly, but they are portraying themselves as being a great benefit to the community at large.
The proposed structure is grossly disproportionate to the surrounding structures, as Mr Bell indicated it's several times the size of what is the maximum permitted structure on the on this location and under the existing zoning and the neighboring properties are a lower rise and it would stand out ridiculously as compared to the surrounding buildings and not blend in any way with them, but they want to not just rezone to increase the size of the permissible building, but also they want a special permit to waive the mitigating setbacks that would reduce the shadows and other negative consequences of building a larger building, provide more light and air on the street.
I thought it was interesting in the presentation last time that the representatives of the blood center were proposing that this would somehow create an inviting environment for the people walking by on the street.
The space to be occupied by the blood center in the proposed new tower is no bigger than the space that could be occupied in an as of right structure under the existing zoning.
I haven't said we're working with this particular organization or this particular laboratory, and it would enhance our work if we were able to be in the same location and here's how they present it as a hypothetical that they would create a benefit by doing this, when, in fact, they're just going to rent out the space and if they don't get somebody who's who works well with them, they'll get somebody else, who'll pay the rent, or maybe they won't even come back into the space at all.
It's, a transverse across central park, people coming up first Avenue, who are trying to get around the traffic trying to get onto the 59th street.
Yes, people coming around trying to go up 66th street to get on to that transverse run into that traffic, exacerbating they're, going to reduce the number of parking spaces.
Okay, yes, so I've been retained by 301 e 66th street to as a planner, I'm a planning, land use and zoning consultant.
The co-chair has a copy of it, so I would ask if she could distribute it to the email list of the other members of the Zoning committee, as well as other community board members that would be great I will keep it as concise as possible.
This will create a major precedent now when the Rab zone was adopted in 1985 on the Upper East side, this was done to protect the mid blocks very specifically because what had been happening, was.
This is again something I'm going to point to in a second right, now, in fact, Thank you very much.
Basically, The city is divided into zoning districts, each with its own set of bulk and use regulations, and the blood center is asking for changes to the district designation of their property so as to allow both use and bulk, which is to say size not normally permitted in a residential, Neighborhood.
And I think that the kinds of requests that they are making rezoning of their site, rezoning of the 200,100 feet on either side of second Avenue to a slightly different zone by the way, and then based on that a zoning text amendment to allow by special permit not to allow everyone but to allow by special permit other significant changes in terms of height, setback, use.
This just reinforces kind of that shot, hills and valleys between the avenues and the mid block and shows what the proposed blood center building will look like on the south side, elevation of 67th street and then on 66th street.
In fact it's under built, they could do a little bit more, and this project would really I think set a precedent for every mid block on the Upper East side and just do a lot of damage in the precedent that it would set here, Basically, commercial, tenants and I'll turn it over to George to keep going here.
The proposed blood center tower is absolutely enormous and in fact it does compare to one Vanderbilt 10 Hudson yards, one Bryant Park, Freedom, Tower Empire state Building, And we're comparing the size of the floor plate here with these commercial towers and in fact it is much more like the commercial towers, and it is a property side.
You know it's tempting to use the zoning resolution to subsidize important organizations, but that's not how we should be making land use decisions.
All the space, as has been said, The blood center needs can be built as of right on their site right now, and if the city wants to build up this industry, it should, but it should focus in on the sites that it already as I identified, that the EDC is already identified and built in places where this use and mass is appropriate.
Entry of the building due to the blood center vehicles parked in front and all over 67th street.
We are very much against this proposal and we do not want the blood bank to expand to be rezoned, and we do agree that it sets a dangerous precedent for the entire neighborhood.
Okay, Thank you for coming through zoom to a meeting about a very important zoning issue that faces our community the next steps and will help with some of this.
That's, how you'll get called on by the co-chairs to be unmuted and speak, and then next you'll see a green check, mark Box. I also believe that we're also going to set a timer for each speaker is that right, Elaine and Elizabeth, yes.
I, Don't think it's not contextual, I think in many ways the fact that it's a mid-block building is again something of a red herring and finally, I think we really need to move the discussion away from traffic.
As Rosie mentioned earlier in 1985 Helena Rosenthal, representing friends of the Upper East side, Jeannie Rice, representing sabotage and I, representing his 79th Street Neighborhood Association met with the city planning, commissioner, because two buildings that really should have been landmarked were being torn down in the low 70s, and we were seeing then that we were going to be losing an awful lot of other buildings that are in the mid blocks.
As someone said, We didn't have any problem for a long time, but we did have a problem with 75th street a few years ago, where the there was a effort to try to go against the zoning, and we were able to stop that.
What's going to happen to the avenues, we don't have the elected officials who understand the importance of protecting the density and the efforts that we have to make to keep our neighborhood usable and good, and all those other points were very well made.
As, someone who has taught many classes in the buildings that face south anybody who lives in an apartment in New, York City knows what a different sunlight makes in your mood and the way you perceive your day and just the general feeling of getting up in the morning that building across the street would deprive the Julia Richmond Complex of all of its light for its entire day, and it would be a gloom of darkness cast upon it.
Principal Doyle made all of the important points about the traffic on the block and how the building would affect Julie Richmond as well.
But I would just point out one last thing: when you come up 67th street from first Avenue or coming down from second avenue, It is a public block.
It would no longer be residential, there's a point for mid-block zoning to keep residential neighborhoods residential and not turn them into financial centers, and this block would lose all of its character with that building looming over it.
The best thing that you can do is reach out to all the elected officials in the community, as well as the borough president, the mayor and meet with them or ask to by zoom, but send letters and emails voicing your position.
Yes, okay, one of the things I want to talk about is that the blood bank who says they want to be a good neighbor, is doing just the opposite.
Hi I just wanted to add a couple of points about the traffic I know, they've discussed it, but I actually wondered how the ambulances in this area that we live in have so many hospitals how those feeder streets that will now be more congested would affect.
And I, really thank community board 8 for organizing this meeting and for allowing the public comment.
Hi I am a resident at 315, East, 68th street and I've been in the building for 15 years.
What I want to ask is the timeline for stopping this and really what we're going to do, because I feel like we need a focused, organized effort.
I've been I've, lived at 315 east 68th street for over 25 years, But the point I want to make, which I'm not sure has been emphasized, is that the New York Blood Center calls itself a not-for-profit.
First I just wanted to thank the community board for hosting the event and allowing the public comment.
We are part of the community Board 8 catchment area, but we are further north, but nevertheless, Carnegie hill neighbors is very concerned about zoning issues and adherence to zoning in the Upper East side.
There are alternate sites in the city and George pointed to one I believe in east Harlem at 126th street, which might fit the bill, So there are alternatives.
A board member and resident at 333 East, 68th, street.
Think there are a couple of people right in the community that can help you with that, and you've got some buildings now already organizing, so I would unite with them and move to reach out again to the elected officials to tell them, and it might also be helpful to reach out to the blood center and raise the concerns on the issue.
I mean letters are great, and all of this is good and it's all going to help them, but we need somebody who that actually does this for a living and knows how to fight it.
There's a lot of people here that are willing to put in the time and the effort, so I hope the community board will listen to us and represent us the way we expect them.
Thank you just a second, I, okay, I, appreciate that and hear your frustration, and you have to know that the community board is there to listen to the community and take some leadership, and so we'll be working.
We move into the Committee Board Committee to discuss what we've heard tonight, We would like to take a poll of those who are attending who are public part of the public meeting, How many are opposed to the blood Center Longfellow Project, Will I would say, let's say if you're a pose click, no, if you're in favor of the project as it was presented previously, clicked.
You willing to take that in the chat for those people who want to share, because I know you can't just send out everybody's emails and telephone numbers, so is that a system that'll work for the moment.
You have friends, If you have relatives all over the city reach out to them and get them to talk about the zoning, because that's very important from the community board's point of view.
And I just want to say now that I hope that we end up with a very strong firm resolution out of tonight's meeting and also any information that you can circulate to all of us about how to participate in the December 15 scoping project would be terrific, will whoever you can send that out to the whole board and the public, because for the public, that's the next step, and so that's very important.
The proposal for the zoning changes requested by the blood center.
This puts R8 zoning at risk throughout the community, board, eight, as well as other parts of the city that currently have r8b zoning, and we know that the blood center can achieve their needs within and as of right.
That reminds me, and I'm only going to speak to more endemic problems to the last public speaker, The community board you're preaching to the choir you're preaching to the choir, beg our council members.
That's the real point to be made to the elected officials in this process is better information, more power to the community boards and the public to have land use decisions put in their hands.
The last time there weren't enough people to have a solid rejection of the blood center's proposal on zoning grounds, and it would have weakened the board, weaken the public to have a half-hearted attack on this and approach.
Second, This is in my personal position, which is that there is a rash of not-for-profits around the community, board, 8 and the city as a whole, claiming that, because they work in the public interest, they're entitled to change the zoning, Whichever way they want to.
I want to thank Anthony again for another great presentation of what is going to be done to the neighborhood.
You know, as friends of the Upper East side indicated, it took 20 years to get a change in zoning to protect residential blocks.
There is no public policy need for the blood center to do this, for anybody on the mid block to do this and for those who you know, don't think this affects them because they're not on that street.
But if I did, what you wanted me to do, I would have to support every community board in the city.
What I am saying to you is: If you feel as strongly about zoning as I do, and everybody else does, We can take an example for from a Betty Wallistein at East, 79th street and people did when they fought for the Rb Rab to begin with, including Elaine, Walsh and others and Elizabeth Ashby, And if we have to, we will have to take to the streets, because people need to know that you want to protect your community.
Okay, so the vote is I, think there's 15 or 16 board members there.
There are 50 members of the board and we want to get as big an approval, well, opposition to the blood center and approval for this oppo.
