We just wanted to get an update on the sanitation conditions in the community district 8, particularly with regard to trash pickup and also with regard to rat control and I.
There will be a number of questions and one of some questions about some specific items, but I think you know to start with and as further background here.
I think, there's been a lot of concern among the members of the community about the large amounts of trash that are piling up on the sidewalks.
You know people have been seeing more rats on the street and in the parks, and.
We just want to hear from the department of sanitation to get an update on what is being done in our community district and what more can be done to address these issues.
So, as I think everyone knows, we've had been hit with a lot of budget cuts over the past couple of months, and the effects you can really see in the streets and just want to put it out there.
You know every time somebody sees a rat, they probably aren't calling it, and so you know the fact is that most people, you know what we're hearing from the community is that people are seeing a lot more of it.
I, guess the condition on the streets or the Sanitation Commission is that right is that how decisions have been made in terms of where to cut services and where to add services.
I'm, just missing it, but what's the connection between Covid-19 rates and the increased need for more trash pickup service, because it's not immediately apparent to me that those things would necessarily be related.
I know some agencies aren't able to go out right now and do certain inspections and things like that, and it's all been rerouted to Covid-19 and like open streets and things like that.
So I think we will bring her in before we do will did we cover the procedure for folks raising hands and that kind of thing for questions.
So, we're hoping to hear from you about what is you know what's being done currently about the rat problem and if there are plans to step up efforts to address this issue and if you can speak, particularly with regard to our community district, that would be good.
I'm, the director of neighborhood interventions for pest control services at the health department and my team generally responds to neighborhood level complaints and concerns about rats.
We have been closely monitoring complaints throughout the pandemic, and you know I want to reassure people.
You know, had had the impact of reducing rat complaints and rad sightings.
Of course, rats are coming out of their nests at night between dusk and dawn to feed, and if there's a lot of garbage on the street they're going to feed on that garbage and be more visible.
So one of the ways that neighborhoods can address rats is, of course, by reducing the amount of garbage that's available for them to feed in terms of health department, activities.
You mentioned that that's been an issue, and so my question is, have there been efforts by your department to make adjustments essentially targeted towards the fact that there are more that there is more trash on the street.
While we are still monitoring complaints right now, we have not increased any level of service and in fact, wait times have increased for complaint response simply because those inspectors are doing the critical work that has been asked of us in making sure that businesses that are open in pandemic hot spots or in Covid-19 hot spots are getting the inspections that they need.
And, then I think that's the way that should be the owner should be responsible to especially to cover any holes in the building.
A, there's kind of a trust put in these food service establishments that want to build these outdoor structures that they're going to have to take responsibility for those structures, and we did build some rap prevention language into some of the dots outreach materials around outdoor dining for food service.
This case, it's the property owners and the businesses now for the other kinds of locations that you mentioned tree wells, retaining walls that are on city property, like D.O.T, retaining walls, parks, NYCHA developments, all are responsibility of the city and, as you said.
I mean the best thing to do is if you know the sanitation trucks are coming in the morning, then.
To put your garbage out as close to that morning, pick up as possible and not the night before we do advise that property owners and management companies know exactly when their trucks are coming.
They should know when their private carter is coming and then wait to put garbage out so that you're minimizing the amount of time the garbage sits on the curb businesses, in particular, need to work with their private carters to make sure that garbage is not out for more than an hour, and it really.
When you see rats, we always come back and say clean and that again, that often falls back on the business or on the property manager, but I think we've seen many successful models of Rad free business businesses and those are the businesses that are really vigilant about inspecting and cleaning the property.
So I know another community, organization, I think Carnegie hill neighbors had done had presented something about a Rad academy or something like that, and I'm wondering if you have some kind of video with instructions of how to look for rats in your neighborhood around your building, so that people could control them, that we could post on the CBA website or and provide or provide links, so that people could see it and maybe learn from.
But what do I know about rats by the way I think you have a pretty strong stomach that spraying around with bleach might be able to help just information like that might be really useful, especially if the population grows, but I, really don't understand why it's been.
What I can do after this meeting is just email, my nature, colleagues, and remind them that this issue is still there and that they need to continue to respond, and you know I, think they're.
I, don't think it's a very big responsibility, but at least, if you put those agent of those important agent right there on the sidewalk that leads to the school I thought.
The inspection report will detail what the inspector observed, so sometimes it might be, a rat burrow in the sidewalk and in those cases the easiest thing for the owner to do is to seal up that sidewalk.
So, you know, sometimes what we observe is actually garbage conditions that are feeding and attracting rats and in those cases.
I think there are probably several and folks on the Cag are going to be able to speak in more detail about it, but certainly I.
Think, one of the concerns is, you know.
You know less in the way of traffic of all kinds, including garbage truck traffic and that kind of thing, and so the concern is that monitoring wouldn't really be representative of the impact of the transfer station in normal times, and also just a broader concern that twice a year.
Obviously this has been a big issue on the Cag, but I think the thing that people need to understand the most important level about the monitoring.
I, I'm, pretty sure we've sent it to CBA will has sent it around, but we have an extensive report from an air monitoring expert about all the issues we see with the city's protocol and what we as a community need to see them.
We want continuous air monitoring the entire time they have declined that many times we've asked for real-time data, of which we know they are collecting their E-BAM equipment actually provides.
I do want to make sure that we're confirming the pollutants to monitor right.
It's 165 pages I worked today hard to understand all of it and as a lay person I can't it just was discussed at the Cag. There needs to be a dashboard of crucial elements and then I think we want to work with how we distribute it in the community, and actually we had talked about community board, 8 being the appropriate place to deposit that information.
So, getting these reports regularly and available to the community, since one might fear that there will be greater usage, and so the air monitoring is more crucial is an important thing that the department of sanitation needs to do.
Everyone I, just want to point out in the chat, is a resolution that we as community board 8 cast in January 2019 regarding air quality, monitoring and I.
Just want to highlight the fact that we do talk about the placements of air quality monitors and specifically call outs on the playgrounds and Isaac's houses and homes towers, and in and around schools, as well as asphalt green, which is pretty evident.
I also just want to call out the fact that, within this whole report, I didn't see any mention of the impact of any pollutants coming from the Riverside meaning from the vessels that are carrying the barges and carrying the trash out.
And I, think that would be something that if we were able to accomplish, that would be really useful to the community to be able to demonstrate what the impacts of it are, and let's also just keep in mind that we're at a time right now where air quality has improved dramatically.
Let me: ask you a question: I, don't know if you know the answer to this Craig, and maybe some of the Cag folks on the meeting may know.
This is a resolution from February 2019 and it refers to a counter proposal that was made with regard to monitoring locations, and so is that I guess is that counter proposal still the operative document that the Cag would want us to refer to in terms of what we're asking for, or is there something more recent that we should be referring to if possible.
If, you don't have it, you know in front of you, but you can send it to everybody, but I think we do need to that.
Does that mean for New York for the contracts, so I think those are some things that we need to be a cb-8 or whoever needs to have kind of on their plate and making sure that we're communicating about what is happening with that Marissa again.
Okay, I actually have another question related to this resolution, which is: does that counter proposal include the additional pollutant monitoring that Kelly mentioned so, for example.
You know, echoing again what Carol said, but we have a community issue that we're getting this data.
If it were a situation where there were no way to look at this data without some kind of an expert, then you know we can I.
I mean I, just don't know the answer in terms of the budget and that kind of stuff.
I mean I just think before the board or the Cag or anybody has to spend money on this kind of stuff.
I, think that what they're reporting is really what we need.
For several years, now, we've been very pedantic, very specific about how we need to see the data and what we want to see in layman's terms and the constant response.
We have discussed that and we've looked into the financial commitment that would take in order for the community to do their own monitoring, and you know.
We don't know the particles in the air or, what's going on with them, then it puts people at an even greater risk of danger.
I'm wondering if the budget cuts to sanitation have resulted in changes in the way, there's monitoring and in the air filters and in anything else that we need to know about such as maintenance of the trucks or filters on the trucks.
Who is monitoring that who is going to make sure that the trucks actually using the facility if we get to that, are going to be maintained and fitted with or retrofitted, with adequate environmental protections to protect the community and also I just want to underline everything that Russell and cause and Marco have said about, and the Cag people, Kelly and Carol about the need and Craig for the need.
Second thing, just generally, as you know, I, think that's emerging as a theme here is.
I was not informed that you needed someone to report back on the air quality monitoring.
Monitoring in terms of air quality also helps us to know what is causing pollution and how to reduce, it, and I'm.
We do a letter I'm disinclined to follow a resolution with a resolution in the sense that I think if we passed a resolution saying we want x, you know to just pass another resolution.
Do you think I think that makes sense Russell, because we do have the resolution, but on the other hand, there were also points that were made additional points that were made tonight that we could put into the letters such as looking at the exhaust and pollution potential from the tugboats on the river and also again to Marco's point to make sure that what is going on inside the MTA is not contributing to any air.
Absolutely I get your point about not wanting to seem weak and asking using the letter to ask what what's going on, and why are you not responding to the resolution.
Well, look I, think you know.
I, think the letter can specify you know all of the key points that we made.
I think the letter can refer to points that were in the counter proposal as well as is not because all that is stuff that we need answers to and that we've needed answers to in terms of stuff we've already mentioned and that we now have have requested so.
I think it could, especially if you look at where one of their monitors is located.
Don't, know, I, think it's a discussion.
Hence, where Catherine Garcia worked with the mayor to get this community at the top of the list to flip those but I, don't know, I, think that's an interesting question.
That is one part that I, don't think is going to impact our resolution with that or with a secondary impact in the community.
So in speaking about contracts again, then you know it's going to be interesting to see what does that mean with the city if Covanta sells.
Can, we get a report from DOT about the monitoring at the 91st street terminal, and do we even know if they do that.
And you know I think we'll also want to just emphasize the point that I made, which is these, don't seem like particularly heavy lifts in terms of what we're asking for, and.
