All right, let's just give it another minute here, I think folks are still joining. Okay, they are I, didn't see them signing yet and will so. It looks like we have Marissa Yani from DSNY here. Are we expecting others from DSNY or from the Department of Health from the Department of Health Marissa I just tried to mute. You will you tell us if anybody else is joining you from DSNY nope? Just me, okay, thank you. We're waiting on Caroline Brock Bragdon from the Department of Health all right! Well, it's it's 6:33! So why don't we get started and we can we can add Caroline in when she gets here. So thank you Marissa for joining us and thank you everybody for joining us for the first agenda item. We just wanted to get an update on the sanitation conditions in the community district 8, particularly with regard to trash pickup and also with regard to rat control and I. Think there will be a number of questions and one of some questions about some specific items, but I think you know to start with and as further background here, I think there's been a lot of concern among the members of the community about the large amounts of trash that are piling up on the sidewalks. And you know people have been seeing more rats on the street and in the parks, and so that's that's been a source of concern, and so we just want to hear from the department of sanitation to get an update on what is being done in our community district and what more can be done to address these issues so I'll turn it over to you Marissa great. Thank you so much Russell. So, as I think everyone knows, we've had been hit with a lot of budget cuts over the past couple of months and the effects you can really see in the streets and just want to put it out there. We are not happy about that at all. We would love to be back at our full-blown capacity, doing everything that we can do so we're not completely thrilled with a lot of the budget cuts as well. There was a reduction in litter basket service, which has been pretty noticeable specifically in Manhattan. We're used to have it basically every day but that's been reduced, but we have been able to restore some of the service to hardest hit Covid-19 areas in the city, which does not include the Upper East side, but we have been able to do that in Manhattan. We've also been having a reduction in manpower through the budget cuts as well so for the Mlp. The the litter patrol that used to go out can not go out as often as it was before. We've also had a couple of holidays lately so definitely been noticing any a few missed collections that have been happening as well. Okay, so a couple of questions on that so and are you able to speak to the rad issue? Also so no I think department of Health will be able to speak more to that and just any of the work that they've been doing. I can't say specifically what addresses they've been going to and where they've been doing. Some of the mitigation I have not received any rat complaints for the district from the community board or any elected official. That's in on the Upper East side, I've received other complaints, but I haven't received rats. Personally, that doesn't mean it's not there. Just saying yeah I think that's the issue we actually so we had spoken to the comptroller's office last month about the rat issue and one of the things that they had reported indirectly is that you know. Apparently there wasn't an increase in formal reports regarding rats, but you know I think as a practical matter. You know every time somebody sees a rat, they probably aren't calling it, and so you know the fact is that most people, you know what we're hearing from the community is that people are seeing a lot more of it. Even though they're not reporting it, and so it's not going to necessarily show up in the numbers, but we can wait until department of Health gets here to talk more about that. So just to follow up on the items that you mentioned, it sounds like service cuts or levels of service are tied to Covid-19 infection rates, potentially, as opposed to you know, the I guess the condition on the streets or the Sanitation Commission is that right is that how decisions have been made in terms of where to cut services and where to add services yeah previously, that was yes, correct I mean. Let me just say that yes correct, so everyone receives reductions in July and August. That's when it was really short the most and then, when the mayor announced that we could restore some service, it was to the hardest hit areas because he wanted to clean up that area a little more, so no I mean we've been trying to keep track, or at least I've been trying. The department has keeping track of a lot of where the complaints are coming from specifically overflowing litter baskets and things like that. We are advocating to get more service restoration, but because of the budget cuts, you know it's not easy and what's the connection I mean I'm not I, guess I'm not seeing it, and maybe it's obvious, I'm just missing it, but what's the connection between Covid-19 rates and the increased need for more trash pickup service, because it's not immediately apparent to me that those things would necessarily be related and you could conceivably have you know more trash on the street somewhere that didn't necessarily have a Covid-19 spike. So can you explain what the connection is yeah sure? So it was just these original 27 neighborhoods and zones in not to be confused with the brand new cluster and zoning thing that Cuomo is doing, but these original zones that were labeled as high risk and had the highest rate of Covid-19 since March, and then they decided the mayor said that those would be the areas that will receive the restoration of litter basket, service and other services to for public health reasons as the way I understand it. So I see your point, it does doesn't seem like it correlates necessarily but correct. It's not going by where there is the most dumping conditions or where there's the most litter conditions. That's not how that decision was made by the mayor. Okay, all right! Well, look I would suggest that you that you suggest that they take those conditions into account. I mean it seems to me that that hormone sanitation has the capability to make those determinations and again it just the idea that we would need more trash pickup. You know, based on Covid-19 rates, just doesn't really seem logically to correlate, and you know it should really just be based on the trash conditions on the Sanitation Commission. So that's you know, that's what we would ask. That's I think really how it needs to be done. Okay with regard to, can you just let us know how do the cuts to sanitation and the department sanitation? How do those compare to cuts to other city services that there have been just within sanitation or for other agencies to other agencies? So I'm asking well I'd actually be curious to hear within sanitation. Also, I think how do the cuts descend to the department of sanitation compared to cuts to other city agencies and then within sanitation? How do the cuts to trash pick up compared to other cuts to other sanitation services? I can't speak for other city agencies, because I do not know the full depth and breadth of where they've been cut. I know some agencies aren't able to go out right now and do certain inspections and things like that, and it's all been rerouted to Covid-19 and like open streets and things like that. But within the department of Sanitation, probably the hardest hit was our bureau of recycling sustainability, specifically with the organic suspension we've suspended organics and the e-waste collections and safe events, and a lot of these smart recycling and sustainability programs have been cut or have been reduced dramatically, so they that bureau probably received the most cuts out of any other aside from probably cleaning and collection, which is where we do the litter basket, collection, service and whatnot, but recycling of sustainability received the most cuts. Okay, do you know why that is? Do you know why the priority was to cut recycling more than everything else? No, that was up to the mayor and former Commissioner Catherine Garcia I can not speak as to why that decision was made. It was a very hard decision to make it was not done for fun or because it was easy yeah, it wasn't. Organics wasn't in the whole city, so that may have been why? But I can not speak as to the reason behind that cut yeah. This is because I'm just wondering did the DSNY go to the different communities to see what would be better cut, recycling or paper or garbage? You know on a restricted basis, or was it a unilateral decision that was more of a unilateral decision? The mayor said that cuts needed to be made and that's what was done. What about the offer that the governor has made that he would send in the national guard to help New York City with sanitation? If we were in dire straits, I can not speak to the governor's program and we haven't received any indication of what that would look like on the ground. So you could reach out to him and find out to the governor. Yes, I would have to ask someone above me to do that. But, okay, oh, you can have a pay rise tonight. So I see that the Caroline from the Department of Health is here so I think we will bring her in before we do will did we cover the procedure for folks raising hands and that kind of thing for questions? No, not yet so if it's anyone's first time at one of our committee meetings, you'll notice that you're all muted and the way that you'll get recognized to ask a question, make a comment to either of our speakers tonight, we'll be using the raise hand feature in the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. So if you look at the bottom of your screen, you'll see an image that has like two little people standing next to each other with the number next to it. Right now the number says: 18. It says the word participants underneath it. You click that button and a box will pop up, and in that box you can click, raise hand and we'll see your hand, go up on our participants list and the co-chairs Russell and cause we'll be able to call on you as you raise your hand whenever it's the appropriate time and if you're calling in from the phone it's star nine to raise your hand. Thank you so I see that we do have Caroline Bragdon here so I want us just to thank you for joining us. I want us to just hear from her first and then we will open it up to some questions. So Caroline I mentioned this. Before you got here, there has been an uptick in rat sightings. You know we're hearing from the community that they are seeing a lot more rats in the parks on the streets. There's a lot of concern about that I. Imagine it's related in part to the fact that there's just a lot more trash on the street, but the fact is folks are very concerned about it and you know one thing to note: is you know, as a practical matter, people tend not to report every rap that they see you know, and so the fact that it may not be reflected in the data and from what I understand and you can speak to the data. The fact that the data may not reflect an uptick in complaints about rats. You know we hope that you would recognize, doesn't reflect necessarily the fact that there isn't actually an uptick in sightings. So we're hoping to hear from you about what is you know what's being done currently about the rat problem and if there are plans to step up efforts to address this issue and if you can speak, particularly with regard to our community district, that would be good sure. So, I'm Caroline Bragdon, I'm the director of neighborhood interventions for pest control services at the health department and my team generally responds to neighborhood level complaints and concerns about rats. We have been closely monitoring complaints throughout the pandemic, and you know I want to reassure people I. The complaints are actually not higher and haven't been higher throughout the pandemic than they were in 2019 and that, in fact, the pandemic driving many humans into their homes. Also, you know, had had the impact of reducing rat complaints and rad sightings. We have also seen what we typically see is a seasonal uptick in rat complaints. It happens at the end of every summer and the beginning of every fall, where you know it's just the behavior and biology of rats. We see an increase in rat complaints at the end of every summer, at the beginning of every fall and regardless of what's happening in the city, this has always been true as long as I've been working in pest control. This is true because of the reproductive patterns of rats. There are often juvenile rats who were born over the summer that are now ready to leave the nest and people just see more rats. At the end of the summer. Of course, rats are coming out of their nests at night between dusk and dawn to feed, and if there's a lot of garbage on the street they're going to feed on that garbage and be more visible if garbage is left on the curb for pickup they're going to you know that we're, basically, you know, training rats to go back to those locations and feed night after night. So one of the ways that neighborhoods can address rats is, of course, by reducing the amount of garbage that's available for them to feed in terms of health department activities. At this time we always are monitoring complaints and responding to complaints, and when we receive a complaint, we are sending inspectors out if they find rat activity. We identify the owner of the property on which we found rat activity, and we send that owner in order to abate, the rat activity and abatement can include cleaning containerization of garbage. It can include hiring an exterminator or sealing up holes and cracks that allow the free movement of rodents. If the owner of the property is a city agency like a park, then we will notify the parks department that they have to take those actions, and we have a very close working relationship with our partner agencies, particularly parks, but also with other agencies that are large property owners. Like the New York, City, Housing, Authority, Department of education. We work very closely with these agencies to make sure that rats are remediated on their property. Let me pause and ask if there are any questions so far, yeah I have a question about some of the items that you mentioned in terms of what happens in response to complaints, so is I. Guess one question is: are you guys actually involved in trying to catch and kill rats? Because you mentioned you know that you'll alert the owners to abate the condition, you'll alert other city agencies to alert the conditions? So are you guys just you know, inspecting for rat activity? Are you actually, you know catching and killing the rats? It's both. Our primary job at the health department is to enforce the health code, and the health code says that property owners are responsible for responding to rat activity on their property. So most of what we do is in fact enforcement. But when a property owner fails to control rats on their own property, we may send an exterminator to apply bait, but the vast majority of the time our response is first focused on getting property owners to do their part. The health code clearly states that property owners or their management companies are responsible for taking steps to remediate rat activity. Okay, let me ask one more question: before I see, we do have other questions from the board, but I just want to ask one more question to kind of set the stage here so have there been any changes to address the fact you know? Obviously, trash pickup services have been cut, and so, as would be expected, there are now more. You know rats on the street and you mentioned that that's been an issue, and so my question is: have there been efforts by your department to make adjustments essentially targeted towards the fact that there are more that there is more trash on the street? Have you changed your approach or stepped up inspections in response to that reality? I think, unfortunately, the response is no and- and it's not because well, quite frankly, many agencies are dealing right now with having staff redirected for pandemic response, and unfortunately my program was one of those programs, and almost all of our inspectors have been reassigned to do the business reopening inspections that you may have heard about that are occurring in Covid-19 hot spots throughout the five boroughs. So while we are still monitoring complaints right now, we have not increased any level of service and in fact, wait times have increased for complaint response simply because those inspectors are doing the critical work that has been asked of us in making sure that businesses that are open in pandemic hot spots or in Covid-19 hot spots are getting the inspections that they need. There are just so many inspectors in this city and I. Think if you ask any agency that employs inspectors, you will hear from them at this time that they have all been redeployed to work on Covid-19 got it all right, let's, let's open it up to other other questions, so I see that Marco has a question. Let's go to Marco sure. Thank you so much first Carolyn. Can you give us the your phone number I know the procedure is always to call 311. but it's always very helpful is to have the phone, no your phone office, but at least somebody complained too. I didn't have any chance to have that one. Oh no sure I, I'm happy to give you my phone number and I'm also happy to give you my email address, but I guarantee that, in order to you know, generate an inspection in our system. We need that one service request. That's fine! No problem! You! It does acceptable your explanation. Well, I'm going to put and that's what I'm looking tonight you describe who origin of the rats it says either in the private property you described, is the owner and you're absolutely right and then I think that's the way that should be the owner should be responsible to especially to cover any holes in the building and that's basically coming in and out, but the poor. My point is, you mentioned the parks. What about? Let me I'm going to describe exactly the location on 81st street that going east to the river. That is the entrance to the esplanade, will start the biggest or not the big ball right. There is a big section because the street is at the end and the at the end of that part. It is a huge world retention that doesn't belong to no building, it belongs to the street and then continually to that there is a building. So I explained to you this. These. This with detail is always in the contention wall. There is some holes. I know that these holes are created with a with or drainage of the water. It is needed, but right there is a big nest of rats that cover the whole neighborhood and one day it means I was walking by and I saw like 20 people. Looking that the rock came out of that hole like maybe 12 rats was behind of the bill or the female rat, so it means is uncontrollable. This part, in an addition, I've seen all these black box with poison. So my point is: who is responsible in that case that this retention wall is not under any building? Is actually the end of the of this tree, and this complaint I put it about like four years ago and nobody releases it and that's what I'm asking the phone number and nobody listen, and somebody has to take action for those spaces. Also. Another problem is in the nature developments when they did some jobs and repairs wow. This is a big nest of rats. Why? Because they put these big containers and under the container they nest beautiful over there, and somebody if we want to walk at night is impossible over there. I usually run in that area, so this is I describe very well what's going on and also there is a container that is for those people that do some sport in the river and in the corner. Just on the 96th street. I don't want to go against them, but always I ask them. Look. There are holes under the container that they nest very well these rats. So the point is I know that there is some cuts, but we have to do something because this is this become uncontrollable. In addition to this one also I'm seeing rats on the tree pit and they make holes everywhere in the whole neighborhood and now you have this a good idea of this road sidewalk under the road they put platform to level the street, the road with the sidewalk and then obviously there is some holes and there is another beautiful place for nesting, rats and mice. So I know we had to do something nice for the for the small business in this case of the restaurants and I agree with that part. But the problem is D.O.T, they said no, not Dex and then at the end said: okay, it's probably Dex. You can do that so DOT. They encouraged to do this kind of stuff. We they shouldn't, because if there is no platform I, don't think you will have a problem. So these are my serious concern in the neighborhood and there's no in one specific place, it's everywhere. In addition to that, there is so much that is uncollected. What I think would be good would be the for the specific locations that you have provided. I think if we can collect those and will if you can pass those on and Caroline. If you can, you know if you can have folks go out and address those specific areas that Marco's highlighted as like big concentrations or basically Ness I. Think that would be helpful and then sorry, I'm just trying to move things along a little bit Marco. But if you I think the point about, do you want to just ask about the point about the wooden platforms and I? Guess you know what there is that can be done about about? That was another question. Are you talking to me if the yeah well I'll, just I, guess you that was something you mentioned. So let's just get Caroline to address. That point. Are you referring to wooden platforms that are being built by food service establishments for outdoor mining? Okay? So in those cases, unfortunately, the property owner would be held responsible for any rat activity in and around those structures. I mean the way that the health code is structured. You know it's the property owner's responsibility if the property owner is leasing space out to a restaurant that then builds an outdoor structure and there's rats harboring in that structure, the property owner will get first in order to abate from us and then they'll get summons issued if they fail to do the abatement I mean there's kind of a there's kind of a trust put in these food service establishments that want to build these outdoor structures that they're going to have to take responsibility for those structures, and we did build some rap prevention language into some of the dots outreach materials around outdoor dining for food service. They have to clean these places. They should make sure their exterminator is treating around them and they need to monitor these spaces to make sure rats don't end up nesting in and around the structures. They are highly vulnerable to rats since they are serving food on these structures. We I mean I spoke to people about this. You know and I try to embed some of the prevention language into the materials so that everyone understand, but it's really not the city's responsibility. In this case, it's the property owners and the businesses now for the other kinds of locations that you mentioned tree wells, retaining walls that are on city property, like D.O.T, retaining walls, parks, NYCHA developments, all are responsibility of the city and, as you said, these are spaces that we can inspect and then we will refer back to the owner agency. Nycha has a robust extermination staff that are all working throughout this pandemic. Parks Department has their own extermination staff. They are working as well. Dot has assisted us before by sealing up holes and cracks that were in their infrastructure that were allowing rodents to freely travel. So you know these referrals once made can often result in positive change. I do want to recognize that in pandemic times, things are taking a lot longer than we would normally expect. But please, if you have service request, numbers for these locations for 311 calls send me the locations along with the service request number so that I can look up the case and make sure it's been addressed. If they are emerging issues that haven't been reported, yet you can still send them in an email. Just make sure that it is very clear that the exact geography we prefer a street address or a tax lot to get the inspection done. Marco did you have other questions? The only thing is you just mentioned, also the people they drop garbage on the street. You know what it is, the rats they organize very well, the when the buildings they put all the bats on this on the side walk to collect, they put it the most of the building owner. They put around five six seven th, that's the time they have to be put in, but the rats usually is coming around six. Seven. Eight ten- and that is the time so it's a good. The rats are very intelligent. They know exactly when they put the garbage and they're coming out. So how do we resolve this issue because we kind of blame the building owners, because that's what they said? The revelation you have to put the garbage at such a specific time, but the rights it's coming exactly one is when legally is allowed to put the rights of the garbage outside and that's that will be the most last question and thank you. There are things you can do to mitigate the attractiveness of those garbage piles I mean the best thing to do is if you know the sanitation trucks are coming in the morning, then, to put your garbage out as close to that morning, pick up as possible and not the night before we do advise that property owners and management companies know exactly when their trucks are coming. If it's a business, they should know when their private carter is coming and then wait to put garbage out so that you're minimizing the amount of time the garbage sits on the curb businesses, in particular, need to work with their private carters to make sure that garbage is not out for more than an hour, and it really, you know it can sometimes take a lot of organizing. If you have a bid, it can take a lot of organizing to make sure we're following up and businesses are doing their part. There are other things you can do. You know some big buildings. They may not be able to pay their staff, or some small buildings may not be able to get garbage out morning of pickup and have to do it the night before. So, in those cases, what I do recommend is using a very thick garbage bag. You know one that won't rip or leak. You can spray down the inside of the garbage bag. With like a 10 bleach solution. You can also clean the garbage area with a 10 bleach solution, scrubbing down those exterior spaces, making sure that there aren't spills or food residues that may be again attracting rat activity. You know, when you see rats, we always come back and say clean and that again, that often falls back on the business or on the property manager, but I think we've seen many successful models of Rad free business businesses and those are the businesses that are really vigilant about inspecting and cleaning the property. All right, let's go to Elita thanks Russell thanks will. So this seems to be a situation where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, that getting rid of them before they make their families and leak out all over the community would make a huge difference in terms of ultimately, when you have more resources trying to control them so I know another community organization, I think Carnegie hill neighbors had done had presented something about a Rad academy or something like that, and I'm wondering if you have some kind of video with instructions of how to look for rats in your neighborhood around your building, so that people could control them, that we could post on the CBA website or and provide or provide links, so that people could see it and maybe learn from. It is one thing and then I don't know about for your outreach to small businesses. There is a hole in the sidewalk above the Lexington subway line that is very close to a national coffee chain that puts its garbage out in pretty thin bags and they pile up, and sometimes they open up and they leak. And we have some mischief makers in the neighborhood that empty trash cans pull open that round thing. So those are city things the karting is private, but in terms of what Marco is referring to, if do you have easily accessible materials on how specifically to control rodent infestations, also that we could post so that business owners could see or building owners could see what they're required to do in the best way to do it? I mean I, never would have thought, but what do I know about rats by the way I think you have a pretty strong stomach that spraying around with bleach might be able to help just information like that might be really useful, especially if the population grows, but I really don't understand why it's been I understand why resources need to go to Covid-19, but I. Don't understand, really why it's so ignored for something. That's such a patently serious health issue, and thank you for being here, yeah. Well, thank you for having me and also thank you for your plug about the Rad. Academy is a program that is operated by my team and we have had many rad academies that have been sponsored by partners in Community board eight, and we would be very happy to have community board eight sponsor a-Rad academy in the future. We are doing them remotely and we have a community outreach coordinator who is teaching Rad Academy and she I can connect this group with her and we could set one up. We also have a website and a brochure that has a lot of useful information. I have a separate brochure that is just for food service, also on rat prevention, so we definitely have the educational materials and you are welcome to link to our website. I I always appreciate it. When people look at that website and the brochures are there, you can request print copies of our brochures. There's one called preventing rats on your property and again, if you want to pass out those brochures or have them available in the Community Board office. You're welcome to do so. Thank you. Thanks, yeah I think that would be very helpful. So we'll follow up with you to try and figure out a rad academy. I think that'd be great sure, that'd be fun. It's a good winter activity when everyone's stuck at home, it's fun to talk about rats all right. That's what I mean by a strong stomach. Thank you sure. Sandra all right greetings everyone. My name is Sandra I Coleman, I'm a resident of Isaac houses and a leader in my community last year. When the work started for building of two generators on the grounds of Isaac houses. We have been experiencing a massive increase of visible rats on the grounds of Isaac houses and Holmes towers, as we share the same campus, the same NYCHA campus I reached out last year in November to council member count Ben Kayla's office, and they did reach out to the site the people that worked at the site, as well as the pest control company more traps have been placed periodically within the campus a year later we're going on a year more than a year. But a year later we are experiencing even more rats on the ground residents of both NYCHA developments actually sued NYCHA. For repairs and sanitary conditions on December 13th of last year, yet we are still experiencing the rodent infestation on our grounds: visible rat holes, even with court order, inspections and court-ordered stipulations due to our lawsuit. Also, there are two recycled areas on our grounds which people place trash at when they shouldn't the signage there needs to be replaced is very old. It's discolored and NYCHA needs to replace some of their bins at one of the recycling area. They have no wheels anymore. That's how old they, cracked and everything my ask is to the community board and those who are on this call. Can they help us to eradicate the infestation on our grounds and also guide NYCHA, to get help to replace their bins? They recycle bins that are needed. Thank you. So I'll start by saying, I'm familiar with Isaacs and Holmes and I am also familiar with the lawsuit we did hear from the lawyers involved in that lawsuit and my team did go out and inspect Isaac's and Holmes on three different occasions to help inform some of the response related to the lawsuit. So we haven't been there in several months, but my understanding was yes. There was red activity identified, as you noted, throughout the development with multiple wraparows observed, but that after we had referred that to NYCHA that had really ramped up their efforts to respond and had sent exterminators and were really working hard to make sure that a coordinated abatement effort occurred. Now, you know often when there's kind of pressure put on NYCHA you'll see a very focused response that will then dwindle when the pressure is removed. So what I can do after this meeting is just email, my nature, colleagues, and remind them that this issue is still there and that they need to continue to respond, and you know I, think they're I think that they really intend to make an effort. It's just NYCHA has a lot of properties, and sometimes they get stretched very thin, but I will follow up by asking them to double down on their efforts at these two developments in terms of replacing the recycling bins or the trash containers. That would that request would should go directly back to the property manager and, if they're not responding or if they have some barrier in place, I don't know what those barriers would be could be a financial barrier. Sometimes they wait until construction is over to replace infrastructure, but that is not an area that that I can help. Those kinds of requests have to go right back to the property manager of the development yeah Caroline. This is because can maybe the board can write a letter to them. You know it doesn't have to be officially voted on tonight. I think the board office could write a letter to them. Couldn't they will I think we could I think we could, but I think it would also I Caroline. If you could, please also, you know, contact them directly. I think that would be yeah. Absolutely I can do that tonight. That's something that I can do and and again I've put my I've shared my email address so Andrea. If you want to take my email and follow up with me directly I I'd be happy to talk to you more about it. Thank you. I already took it. Thank you. Yes, thank you. One other point, Caroline I think we've had a couple of Rad Academy that you've been there a couple of times at CBA. I vaguely. Remember that you, if somebody contacts you will go out and do an inspection am I, is my recollection, correct or not yeah generally. Yes, the answer is always. Yes. We strive to personally respond to every complaint with an inspection as I shared. You know, my staff is stretched very thin right now. Almost all of my inspectors have been redeployed to do the business reopening inspections, which means that they are in Covid-19 hot spots in Queen, Staten, Island and Brooklyn. I hope Manhattan does not become more of a covered hot spot, but they're really doing they're looking for signs of businesses, not adhering to the governor's Covid-19 reopening guidelines instead of looking for rats right now. That said, if there is an urgent or emerging situation, you know we find a way to respond good. Thank you. I have a question. I'm going to go back before we go back to other board members who have asked questions here. I want to go to Marissa, I have another question for you and at our last meeting we had heard about the clean curbs pilot program which we understood had started taking applications, and so I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on that program and the status of that clean curbs. You said yeah one second, so no I do not have an update on that program. I apologize, but I will get that information for you and send it over tomorrow. Okay, thank you all right, let's go to Marco, it looks like has another question. Thank you. Oh, this is the another problem in our community, especially I'm concerned for the sidewalks that are faced or that go out adjacent to the schools. The issues next I don't know how he works. These dog owners that come in outside with the dog they some of them they clean always not, and if that happened at the entrance of the schools, I have a friends that go to school. Exactly through sunny Stevens on 82nd between York and Arthur's Avenue, they complained that yeah I walk myself, people they don't clean because they supposed to clean one and I. Think if I understand is there is some sign that said curve. Your dog, my understanding, is correctly one run. That means the dog the owner of the dog has to take the dog to the curb, so they don't do whatever they will have to do, but then do on the carb, because those good dog owners they clean, but it's always the stain of that. So if the children's go to the schools and the step on that, just imagine how it is a nightmare for the students for the teachers for everybody and I think it does is I, don't know. This is tough for everybody. I, don't want to go against the dog owners, but I think there are some of they are irresponsible and has to take some action in that direction. This is all over the neighborhood and I think is all over the city. Thank you is anybody can't answer. Does that? Yes, either of you have a response to that I mean. Unfortunately, the dog pickup issue is not one that the health department enforces, because we don't my program in particular, we don't ticket individuals and we can't ticket individuals. If a property itself has an accumulation of dog feces, then again we would take it a property owner which, in this case, wouldn't be fair. So this is something that we can enforce that, but we would need to know the person that did it and where they live hard to find out that, so you follow them home my recommendation. It should be at least to have some enforcement agents at the entrance of schools, and that is specifically in that sidewalk at least those people. They said. Oh they inspector right here, they're going to put me a zom, but and then I can cross the street okay, do it across the street, but no in the sidewalk that God directs you to the school, because many children they take. The acai walk on I think is the south part of the sidewalk, that's the school location and I. It should be probably in all the schools and if you put an engine just only and they on that block or especially when the children is going to start class and I, think it's something like that, because it's hard to follow the owners. I, don't think it's a very big responsibility, but at least, if you put those agent of those important agent right there on the sidewalk that leads to the school I thought. That would be great because we had to do something at least the people that will be afraid that they did and do not disobey the law and I strongly recommend doing something like that. We had unlimited manpower and unlimited inspectors. I'm sure we could do that, but unfortunately DSNY is straight one. At least we can start with just one inspector for school about a week, so I still can't even do that. You know it means. Thank you. Let me ask another question to Caroline, so I just want to follow up on one of the things that you mentioned so when there are rats involved or rats at a privately owned business and you contact them to abate. The rat problem are there: can you just talk more about I? Guess what support, if any, you provide to them? I mean in connection with saying: hey. You got this problem. What it is that you provide them in terms of information or other kinds of support to help them. Do that sure. So when we will mail, a property owner a commissioner's order to abate and in that order, there's a section that just says what to do next and so what we advise generally is, first to read the inspection report. That's attached to the order. The inspection report will detail what the inspector observed, so sometimes it might be a rat burrow in the sidewalk and in those cases the easiest thing for the owner to do is to seal up that sidewalk so get some cement get some filler and just repair the broken sidewalk that may be allowing the free movement of rats. There are other things that we may be observing in an inspection. Sorry I have very loud children, I'm going to just shut my door, how the joy is of family life. So you know, sometimes what we observe is actually garbage conditions that are feeding and attracting rats and in those cases, what we advise is the property owner to maybe invest in a new garbage container or a containment system. You know the steel containers are very popular, but if they get broken down and rusty or have holes in them, they may actually become you know rat containers. We may advise simply that property owners should hire an exterminator to put out those bait boxes. You'll see those black locked boxes that contain rodenticide baits. If there's a lot of rat activity in an area, those bait boxes should be placed in 15 to 30 foot intervals around the perimeter of a building or of a park or of a construction area, depending on what you're talking about. So the results of that inspection report are going to guide the response, and if a property owner is confused about what to do, they are always welcome. To call us and someone from our office can talk them through the response. We would rather a property owner said I want to do something. I just don't know what to do and called us, then just wait for the compliance inspection, because we will go back and check to see if actions were taken. If we come back and check and nothing was done, then we issue summons. What we'd like to do is have the property owner respond so that when we go back and check, we can just close the ticket completely. My experience is on average about 50 of the time the owner takes action and we can close the case. It would be great if we could get our owners to comply 75 percent of the time, 80 percent of the time it would reduce a lot of the frustration felt in communities. Thank you, I have one last question and I think maybe we'll move on to the next item here, but I remember: there were a few years ago there was some fanfare around advanced new rat traps that they were going to be rolling out around Brooklyn borough hall, and there were news stories about it and all this stuff yeah. So I'm just curious about you know whatever happened with that. Have those rat traps been used elsewhere? You know how successful were they in the end? If you just tell us some more about that yeah. Thank you for asking that question. So we were involved in some of the monitoring around Brooklyn borough hall. They did indeed have a severe rat problem there and we also saw the aftermath of the installation of those rat traps. So what the trap was basically like a box and the rats could go inside and then they were drowned in kind of like an alcohol solution, so rats that went in that box were most certainly killed and the box was trapping rats. What I never observed was that there was any kind of rat control actually achieved at the Borough Hall location, so mainly what they were doing is kind of skimming rats off the top of their population, but the actual root cause of their rat problem was simply never addressed, which was that the area of Burrow hall in Brooklyn. It has high foot traffic and lots of food vendors, a subway station and no real garbage management plan, and there was so much garbage and so much open space in that area and so much foot traffic. You know rats were being attracted because of the density of the population and the food waste. You know the rat trap was catching rats at that location, but they weren't achieving rat control, so they were claiming- and this is the company that was marketing the trap. They were claiming that it was a very successful effort, but the underlying problem was really never addressed and we never saw any long-term control. Does that trap catch rats? Sure if a rack goes in it, the rat will end up being drowned and die, but there are lots and lots of traps that are on the market. That will do the same job and you can easily buy those traps. Any property owner can buy a trap. You can buy them online, you can buy them at home, depot and I didn't see anything special or unique about this particular trap. What we did see was that the company that was marketing the trap was very effective in marketing it in New York, but it was more of a marketing scheme than it was that it was new technology or that it was particularly effective. Got it all right. Well, it sounds like that goes back to what Elita was saying about an ounce of prevention and a pound of cure and the cleaning efforts and the mundane stuff is more effective, ultimately than some of the flashier kind of later stuff. So I think that's it for this first agenda item so I think Caroline. We can let you go and say goodbye yeah. Thank you very much for coming and obviously you've heard a lot from us and there's some items to take back. So please do that and we'll look forward to hearing more from you and we'll be in touch about a Rad academy and some of these other items that sounds great and I wish everyone the best- and you know a nice cold winter will also knock out some of the rat activity, so not to wish everyone a cold winter, but it will help us with the as the weather gets cold cooler. Thank you take care, everybody bye all right. So, let's move on now to the next item related to the monitoring at the marine transfer station I had sent around to the committee members. The monitoring summary that came out earlier this week and I think and I see that there's a number of members of the Kag on here. So welcome to you all and thank you for coming, and you know I think. Basically, the the concern that the community has Marissa is that you know the summary came out and it seems to indicate that the transfer station you know that pollution emissions around the Trans, the transfer station have not increased and the you know potential pollution around. That was a big concern of the community. You know going back some time now when the transfer station was first proposed and I think the concern with the report is well I think there are probably several and folks on the Cag are going to be able to speak in more detail about it, but certainly I. Think one of the concerns is, you know, there's summer monitoring and winter monitoring and the summer monitoring that took place this year took place at a time when the city had seen a lot of people leave due to Covid-19, and there was just there were a lot fewer people around and there's presumably less. You know less in the way of traffic of all kinds, including garbage truck traffic and that kind of thing, and so the concern is that monitoring wouldn't really be representative of the impact of the transfer station in normal times, and also just a broader concern that twice a year. Monitoring isn't really going to be enough to paint a full picture for the for the community and so I think the questions would be really. First of all, you know: can we get more monitoring and more frequent monitoring at the marine transfer station of the air quality? So can we do more than that? I will have to check on for you. That is not my department, some community affairs, but that's not my department. I, will check on that tomorrow for you, which is Bianco and see what he says and seeing because it's always been to and that's done at all the stations, so I will have to see if there's a request to do more. If that is possible, okay- and just a related question is, do you have I mean? Has there been any analysis done in the in connection with the monitoring that you've done this summer of weather monitoring results this summer? Really a representative given the you know, given the reduced traffic and the things that I described so I actually have not seen the report that just came out so I can't say for sure, and I'm not the expert on that on the air quality monitoring. I will be honest with you, so I will have to get that answer for you. Okay: let's go to questions I, see, Kellyanne Mcgunter has a question: hey guys, I just want to make sure that we get you so obviously this has been a big issue on the Cag, but I think the thing that people need to understand the most important level about the monitoring is. We can certainly request more monitors, but the biggest issue is where those monitors are even located. They are not located and we have written a report. I, I'm pretty sure we've sent it to CBA will has sent it around, but we have an extensive report from an air monitoring expert about all the issues we see with the city's protocol and what we as a community need to see them do. But on your point about monitors, we can certainly ask for more monitors and I would ask that we refer to this report and our counter proposal back to the city to get those monitors located where it really matters where it matters. Now, quite honestly, we can throw all these reports away. It means absolutely nothing as far as the impact to people or I could say. If we have bad data from there. Let me tell you it's going to be 10 times worse if they had put the monitors where it really truly would impact people on the field, people in the playground, people in the streets, but that's, unfortunately, not what is happening and Kelly I want to just clarify something. So if, in the event that we are able to get the monitors placed in a more representative location or a better, you know the re. The locations that you're recommending is twice yearly. Monitoring then going to be more reliable or oh yeah. I would absolutely look if we had to prioritize our request to the city. I. Could you know? Look we're not going to get the world and the world is we want continuous air monitoring the entire time they have declined that many times we've asked for real-time data, of which we know they are collecting their E-BAM equipment actually provides this data. The city has just refused to give it to us and look if I'm going to be very fair to Catherine Garcia. You know, I think the years we've been working with her I think in the very beginning, I think she felt very burned about. You know how we were coming at them at all these infractions. What I think we need to focus on as a community is the biggest the big picture in just answering the question: is this facility adding pollutants that are dangerous to the community's health, and especially the elderly and the children that are closest to the vicinity and that's around asphalt, green. So to me, our highest priority should be to either get the current monitors or to get new monitors, but to place them in the spots where we had. Our expert recommend that they be that to me is the highest priority. But then you know just to go along with that. I do want to make sure that we're confirming the pollutants to monitor right. We have to monitor Pm 2.5. We have to monitor black carbon, nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide, and we're still unclear is to our request and what they're going to monitor, but if I could get those satisfied and just get January and July reports, you know two times a year for two weeks: continuous monitoring for those two weeks. You know I would settle on that point to get the other points first, because otherwise it doesn't make a difference. Okay, that's helpful to know, and let me just ask you one other question there about which pollutants are being monitored for. Do you know whether the monitors that they have in place, the type of monitors that they have in place are able to pick those up. Is that something that we don't know they are okay, and so they it has that capability. As far as we know, and it just isn't something that they're reporting correct got it. Okay can I. Have the report that you all have put together we'll make sure to get that to you. I think, if will has it will, can can send that to you? Is that right? You have that will I believe I. Have it I, believe Kelly or Carol Tweedy sent it to me, okay and if he doesn't he'll get it and we'll definitely get that to you Marissa great. That would be helpful as I go talk to the chief in charge and Marissa, who is it that you're going to speak with she's the ongoing couple? Yeah? Okay? Well, that's who we've been speaking with so right? That's the right people, it's unfortunately falling on deaf ears, because you know well whatever yeah look I think having the yeah needs to push it just as well as Cag yeah, and so that's I agree. So maybe that we can do a letter actually on that and and make that clearer and and that way we can add our voice and hopefully push that along. Let me go to Wendy, who has a question when do you just have to unmute? I did see. Carol was waving her hand if you want to go to Carroll. While we wait for Wendy to unmute sure that sounds good Carol go ahead. If you can unmute yourself, hi, I'm the chairman of the Cag for 91St Street and at our last meeting, which was I, think October 22nd. It was clear that one of the main priorities of the air monitoring report was that it'd be more transparent. It's 165 pages I worked today hard to understand all of it and as a lay person I can't it just was discussed at the Cag meeting. It needs to be clearer. There needs to be a dashboard of crucial elements and then I think we want to work with how we distribute it in the community, and actually we had talked about community board, 8 being the appropriate place to deposit that information. At this point, a previous report that we were given required us that actually was asked for green to hire a professional to analyze. What that report said. That report did say that they were within state regulations and that they were measuring a pm 2.5, which is what we had wanted. It also said that at that point there was no problem, although that was when the MTA was really just starting. Now we have more data from what I can see we're not in problematic territory, but again that facility is not operating anywhere near its capacity and then we have, of course, the influence of Covid-19. So getting these reports regularly and available to the community, since one might fear that there will be greater usage, and so the air monitoring is more crucial is an important thing that the department of sanitation needs to do. Thank you all right. Let's go to the to the board for questions and I'm actually going to go. I know Craig told me that he's going to have to leave. So let's go to Craig first, so he gets a chance to ask his question before he has to go good evening. Everyone I, just want to point out in the chat, is a resolution that we as community board 8 cast in January 2019 regarding air quality, monitoring and I. Just want to highlight the fact that we do talk about the placements of air quality monitors and specifically call outs on the playgrounds and Isaac's houses and homes towers, and in and around schools, as well as asphalt green, which is pretty evident. I also just want to call out the fact that, within this whole report, I didn't see any mention of the impact of any pollutants coming from the Riverside meaning from the vessels that are carrying the barges and carrying the trash out. It highlights, of course, all the activity from the trucks, but the reality is that marine activity is not exactly environmentally friendly at times so I don't know if that's something that needs to be addressed as well, so I just wanted to put that out there. Otherwise I mean I, agree with everything that Carol said and Kelly said in terms of we need more transparency and yes, I was at the tag meeting. We talked about the need for a dashboard, I think we're all very familiar with dashboards right now, I checked the Koben dashboard on a regular basis and I think that would be something that if we were able to accomplish, that would be really useful to the community to be able to demonstrate what the impacts of it are, and let's also just keep in mind that we're at a time right now where air quality has improved dramatically. Based on our expectations that for anyone who may have seen it, there was an article today, a study that had come out that basically said that our air quality is backed by 2015 levels, just because of the reduced activity and with everything having shut down and curtail to a degree during the pandemic. That there's been this huge improvement to air quality based on compared to what would have been the case, so I think we need to frame everything in that sense, just as we've talked about not knowing where we're going to be in the future and I think. It's also important to note that we still are operating well below capacity. Hopefully, we'll continue to operate well below capacity, but, as we all know, there's always a possibility in the future that as much as currently, there are no plans to have commercial carting commercial carters, the 91St Street Marine transfer station. It is possible in the future and the city designed this for much greater capacity. So we need to just be vigilant about what could happen in the future. We don't know what future administrations and mayors may prioritize in terms of how they view Senate, how they view a city-wide sanitation plan, so I just wanted to put those things out there. Let me ask you a question: I, don't know if you know the answer to this Craig, and maybe some of the Cag folks on the meeting may know but the so. This is a resolution from February 2019 and it refers to a counter proposal that was made with regard to monitoring locations, and so is that I guess is that counter proposal still the operative document that the Cag would want us to refer to in terms of what we're asking for, or is there something more recent that we should be referring to if possible either Kelly I Kelly probably can see that he's unmuted yeah so go ahead, yeah, so that's exactly right and I will I'll grab that document and just to make sure that you guys know the document but from the Cag I'll send it to will. If you don't have it, you know in front of you, but you can send it to everybody, but I think we do need to that resolution. That Craig's talking about is absolutely referring to that counter proposal from Cag to the city, slash, DSNY and then I just wanted to follow up, because maybe we can go back to Marissa. Is that Craig brought up a good point about the tugs and Carol I? Don't know if you know the answer. I know: we've been circular circulating around Kag, but it'd be great to know if they have increased the tier for the tugs, because that to Craig's point that is actually one of our biggest concern is those tugs, but as the technology was becoming available, they were supposed to. Covanta is supposed to update the tugs. Now, if you guys have been seeing the news Covanta's in major trouble, if not filing for bankruptcy, so then the question becomes: what does that mean for this facility? What does that mean for New York for the contracts, so I think those are some things that we need to be a cb-8 or whoever needs to have kind of on their plate and making sure that we're communicating about what is happening with that Marissa again, I know you're, not the technical person, but do you have a response to that and, if not obviously we're going to want you to take all of these items back yep, I'm writing them all down and I'll talk to the team tomorrow, okay, I actually have another question related to this resolution, which is: does that counter proposal include the additional pollutant monitoring that Kelly mentioned so, for example, if we were going to do an updated resolution or something to talk about adding these additional pollutants, we can refer to the same counter proposal. Yes, the cap proposal is all inclusive and I'll. Make sure you get you guys get a copy or get it actually will do you have it right? I have an April 2018 one and I have a December 2018 one, which is the. Let me just get it I'll, send it to you. Okay, just to be sure, yeah, okay, I just want to make sure I have the right one yeah all right. So let's now go to the board members for questions so Marco Tamayo. Yes, thank you. Russell I think I appreciate that you called me, but you should call first, the two persons that they are in the community. I'm seeing there are two Achilles water and now yep. So Kelly was just speaking so I, don't the one is Wendy I, don't know, I didn't gather and when do you put her hand down? Oh okay, so is that the case I can go yeah, okay, the solution the issue is next. I was one of the luckiest one that I visit the facility before office and I have an opportunity to see how the facility were functioning and I was extremely happy, because I never have an opportunity to go this kind of facilities, especially without a starter operation and immediately I analyzed carefully that one of the biggest problems and that I think we should go in that direction. Is they have a an air conditioned the other condition? What it is are an exhaust system, they actually they pull up the air inside and through outside. So this is the will start. The contamination. What we have to do is probably a resolution requesting that the Department of health issue, how frequently changed the filters, because if they have filter, they have everything and they don't clean or they don't change periodically. So what can no sense is to have outside these readings instruments, so they don't have no sense at all. So the best way to contain the contamination is to stop in the facility, and how do you stop in the facility is to clean the futures with the filters and clean all the exhaust system more frequently, and we would like to have a report of that if they neglect, obviously the particulars outside it will increase, so I will I should go. We should go in that direction to disclose how frequently they change the filters of that place, and that will help a lot. So you the readings it will be, it will be more trustful, it will be more effective, but if we don't, if the beginning of everything is basically is that facility and the there is this exhaust system they throw outside and that create the biggest problem. So we need to control the filters of this facility, and that is the main issue that I would like to raise and I would like I'm very happy. We see we can pass a resolution requesting a disclosure over the frequency of changing of the filters, because that has to be constantly changing that part and then they we have a good control before the particles go outside. Thank you and sorry mark just to be clear. You're talking about filters for the monitors or filters for what's coming out of the no I was saying there is an excel system: okay, other side, okay, and this exhaust system they throw the air outside and on the door. The doors create inside the facility is suck from those filters and throw outside if you filter at that part, you control all the other problems. Okay and that has to be disclosed for okay, all right, let's go to Ed, has a question yeah. So I was looking at the report. Russell that you sent around this afternoon. I couldn't get through all 165 pages, but I was interested. You use, you know the first 14 I was looking at and on page seven. If anybody has it so on page seven, there's a table and sorry to interrupt your head will. Can you pull this up potentially while we're? What we're talking about? Yeah, okay, go ahead, yeah, it's page, seven table one and you know not to get really down in the weeds and really be a complete total nerd and on the spectrum or whatever, and but it strikes me some of these outliers and maybe it's to Marco's point, and maybe it's to Kelly's point. Maybe it's to the overall point, but something just strikes me. Looking at these numbers like on Sunday January 19th, you got 97 trucks and then it looks like you're trying to capture particulate matter at these four locations. Where you have these monitors that Kelly I guess was talking about. Where are you putting these monitors, but what struck me most of all is that it looks like the number is 11 and the science is above my pay grade, but I'll just use the numbers, you have 97 trucks and the number is 11. you have 45 trucks and the number is 33. and then you have 66 trucks on January 25th and the number is 18. and is anybody's catching when I'm going like you have 72 trucks and the number is eight and it seems like it's running in I. Don't know something seems as skewed to me and maybe it is just an outlier, and maybe it is just the particularities of the moment in which you're capturing these snapshots, because that's what they are but I don't know. Maybe it's to the overall methodology going back to grad school. Maybe it goes back to the methodology of how we put this together. I know: I. Guess they call it an algorithm now back then my simpleton brain. We call it equations, but either or whatever you call it I, don't know something seems a little skew and maybe somebody could elucidate it for me and maybe I'm just it's a user problem. I, don't know if it's a question or an observation, yeah I mean well. It may be that folks on the Cag have views on it. I mean to me just as a I'm a layperson also, but it suggests that you know to the extent that the concern is that the monitors that are in place now aren't really accurately capturing. What's going on. This seems the point you're making seems consistent with that and what you're seeing seems consistent with that. So that would be my kind of interpretation in the first instance. So again, obviously I don't know any more about the stuff than you do, but Kelly has her hand raised. So I think it would just be helpful to hear from her and see what she thinks. Okay, yeah I think you bring up a really good point and I think it's. We have a community issue in. You know, echoing again what Carol said, but we have a community issue that we're getting this data we're getting this re. These reports we're not going to get it in the format that we need asphalt, green previously under Carroll's leadership paid for people to really who are the experts to kind of comb through this and be able to communicate it to us in layman's terms. So without her leadership and without those resources anymore, we're stuck doing what Ed's doing, which is well wait a minute. This is not making sense. So I say that, because I have a question is that we have an expert and that's Dan Gutman who gets it very well, but I. You know I'm out of funds to keep paying for it. So is there and within CBA any coffers or anything that we can do to help hire or pay an expert to one help us understand these reports and then maybe two work with these reports and suggesting to the city how we communicate them in layman's terms. I, just don't understand the resources within the community board, yeah I think well, that's something we would have to check on. I'm not sure if we do, but it seems to me just in the first instance. You know if we can get reports that are more intelligible just in terms of what they're putting out you know before we spend money on something and if you know, if it were a situation where there were no way to look at this data without some kind of an expert, then you know we can I. Guess that's something we can look into. I mean I, just don't know the answer in terms of the budget and that kind of stuff, but but just in the first instance again I mean I just think before the board or the Cag or anybody has to spend money on this kind of stuff. I think let's just try and get the department to give us what we need and give us what we can actually use effectively. Yeah I hear that I, like it. Here's the challenge that I'm going to give you to that right. Is that let's say that they do it and let's say they give us the data the way that we want it, that we understand it then you're going to have to have a huge trust factor of the data and I say that in the sense that do I think they're going to be honest with what they're reporting absolutely I do: I think that what they're reporting is really what we need. So, for example, without our expert, we wouldn't have known that the monitors are in the wrong place. We wouldn't have known that the E-BAM equipment provides the data that we need, but it's not being given to us. So that's what that's the hard part is. You need an expert to tell you what you don't know and if it's actually being done right so I think that no matter what we do, we have that issue as a community and we're going to have to figure out how to come together and I. Think the only answer is to get an expert on it and we've got to figure out how to make that happen, but Kelly. This is because, if we had the location and a synopsis or a condensed report, we don't want to know every single hour. What we would like to know is the maximum, the minimum and the times that it was rather than you know, 20 pages of hourly reports which is useless to anybody exactly and we've even outlined for them again. If you read our counter proposal, we've outlined to your point exactly cause what this report should entail and what it should communicate to the community. So I 100 agree with you, so maybe the dsm. We can go to the DSNY and ask them specifically for that, rather than 165 pages of meaningless data to us, yes and you'll, see in this counter proposal, we've actually done exactly that. We for several years now, we've been very pedantic, very specific about how we need to see the data and what we want to see in layman's terms and the constant response we're getting back from capo. His predecessors is that this is what we're getting so yeah. It would be great to get community board eight involved and that we get a unified voice for what it is we need and how we need to see it to put the community. You know assure the community that the MTA is operating safely. Wasn't the argument of DSNY that they don't want to put the permanent stations around the place and wasn't it suggested that the temp or the mobile testing sites that could be moved around from place to place on a you know, rotating basis? No, that was never suggested if I understood you correctly cause I, understood you to say, did DSNY agree that they could move the monitors on a rotating basis. They have never agreed to that. No, oh, no, not that they would agree to it, but wasn't it suggested to them that the that they could set up mobile testing sites at different locations, because the complaint was you can't have one station set at the one location indefinitely, but we can have one at 91st one at the York Avenue on a rotating basis. I, like care I mean I've been kind of the one leading a lot of the air quality we've. Never but again, I've. You know deferred to Carroll to my memory, but we've never discussed rotating their current monitors. What we have discussed is an investment from the community to do our own monitoring. We have discussed that and we've looked into the financial commitment that would take in order for the community to do their own monitoring, and you know, certainly over time cost has come down when we did the initial look, and this was back in 2014 so six years ago you know we were looking at half a million dollars and I think a couple years ago. We got it down to maybe 250,300 000. We haven't looked at it recently, but that again that's just another community cost to do kind of mobile or rotating. If you will monitoring okay, maybe it was a transport committee that came up with different sites for testing I can't remember now: okay, thanks god, sure, okay, let's now go to Elita, who has a question unless sorry Marissa did you want to it? Looked like you were responding, potentially nope, sorry I think it's just the traffic outside my window. That's! Okay! That's all right! I saw the yellow box. I just wanted to give you a chance so Alita. Please ask your question thanks. Russell thanks will there's this particular urgency to adequate air monitoring in Covid-19, because any irritation to lungs increases the chances that an infection would be much more severe. If we don't know the particles in the air or what's going on with them, then it puts people at an even greater risk of danger. So there's that Covid-19 effect and the other Covid-19 effect is the hobbling of the resources of the of DSNY and so to Marco's point I'm wondering if the budget cuts to sanitation have resulted in changes in the way, there's monitoring and in the air filters and in anything else that we need to know about such as maintenance of the trucks or filters on the trucks. And my last question is about the carting companies. Even though private carting companies aren't going up there, and even though they're supposed to be now subject to the same I, guess environmental standards as the sanitation trucks, who is monitoring that who is going to make sure that the trucks actually using the facility if we get to that, are going to be maintained and fitted with or retrofitted, with adequate environmental protections to protect the community and also I just want to underline everything that Russell and cause and Marco have said about, and the Cag people, Kelly and Carol about the need and Craig for the need for all of this to be done, that this is just it's urgent and it's serious and the lack of usable information is just it's surprising and it doesn't help us work together to make sure that the neighborhood is safe. So I appreciate your attention. Marissa, it's somewhat disappointing that we don't have someone here who can actually answer the questions, but I know that you'll bring them back carefully. It's just. This is more I think it feels to me that it's more significant than is actually being attended to. If that makes any sense. Thank you, Kelly has her panda, so let's go back to her. No sorry, I, don't know how to turn it off. I, don't know how do I? Oh okay, that's we'll can do it we'll. Can we put it down? Okay, all right. Marco has another question: I think what Ed showed us and if we asked the disclosure of the filters of this facility to send it to us without even being an expert I am not by the way just easily. We can correlate with the number of trucks. If you have in some periods of talks more garbage, the filter has to be changed more frequently, very simple, equation, very elemental, a way to follow up without having a very a technical person in that field. You just see it the number of trucks and you see how frequently they change the field. If the filters are changed less and they have more trucks right there, it would tell you that you, the reading outside of the facility, all the meters if their contradict right there. We can prove that there's no or is no it's something wrong in the process. It's not the transparency on the process is questionable, so this is what we need exactly is the disclosure of the healers. Thank you so I think in terms of that's it for the question so I think in terms of next steps. I think what may make sense is I'm not sure that we need for Marissa to stay, but I think it makes sense for the committee to give some thought now as to how we want to proceed, but Marissa, obviously, you've gotten a lot here to take back and a lot of questions and a lot of concerns and we're going to want to hear responses to those and what I would emphasize. So. First of all, just to echo what Elita said it is frustrating that you know we don't have a technical or engineering representative here today from DSNY, because that is something that we had requested and I. Don't think it's too much to ask, and so we would you know next time we have a meeting like this and we're planning to do one next month, and we can get you information about that. It would be good to have somebody here who can directly answer these questions, so we appreciate your coming here and taking everything down and passing it on, but we you know we need to get answers, and so, if that requires a technical person, then we need to have a technical engineering person. The second thing, just generally, as you know, I think that's emerging as a theme here is, you know the requests that are being made, the requests that have been made by the Cag, the request that was in the community board's prior resolution. You know these are things that don't seem like particularly heavy lifts right, so the question of reporting data that is able to be collected anyway. That's not really asking for a lot changes to where the monitoring goes. That's not really asking for a lot. I mean these are things that are higher priorities that are not that are obviously not as difficult as something like more monitoring, and it seems like these would be things that should be very easy to implement and so I think there's a real question as to- and this is one of the other things that we want to emphasize and we really want to get answers to is. Why is it that there's resistance to doing these things or that they haven't been done and I think we just haven't even gotten answers to those that just basic question? You know let alone actually having the suggestions implemented. So I think those are really the the key points here and again I mean you know. Please take back what we've said and please do ensure that we get an engineer to address these issues at the next meeting, where we discuss this yeah I took notes on everything that you all said. I was not informed that you needed someone to report back on the air quality monitoring report. So sorry that we didn't have anybody else here tonight to speak with. All of you probably would have been better to have someone not me, but I will take everything back for everything you ask. If you have anything else, will has my email address. You can send any more questions to me. Totally fine and I'll make sure I get those answers for you. If I can just get that report that Kelly was referencing will, if you can send it to me at some point, that will really be helpful, so I can attach that when I send all my notes over to my supervisor and to the appropriate chiefs and I do want to let you know you're not totally on the hook for that the person John Capo was supposed to be here, but he had a death in the family. So we are thinking about him, but we just found that out right before the start of the meeting got it. Okay, I didn't realize that. Well. That explains why so it sounds like there isn't really any resistance to having a an engineer come, and so that's that's something. We'll certainly want and very sorry to hear about that hello and let's go to Elita quickly before we before we have Marissa. All I wanted to do is ask Marissa to please express the board's condolences on the death in the family. I hope it was not I mean obviously I, don't know, Covid-19 related either way. It's really sad and thank you Marissa for taking it back and giving this the attention that it needs. Obviously, there's a great deal of community and board concern, but you've heard all of that. So I'll stop now, but we we really would like answers and adequate testing, but there's no point in rehashing and repeating so thank you. I really wanted to ask you about the condolences thanks, Russell sure, sorry and one other item it looks like Wendy tried to raise. She used the reaction hand raise instead of like the participant hand, raised, but let's just go one more time and try and see if we can get Wendy who earlier it seemed like had a question hi. Can you all hear me? Yes, oh awesome, I kind of wanted to piggyback on an early point that Kelly had made about different places of monitoring and what it's, what the monitor is picking up. I wanted to also add that we have a problem in our neighborhood with mold, especially at empty construction sites, and this is a significant contributor to people experience experiencing breathing problems and asthma. I myself had to stop using a particular bus stop because of the very strong smell of mold, and it was affecting my own lungs. So I wanted to add that in there's always the possibility of less expensive monitors and partnering with a place like pace, university or someplace, that has a robust environmental program where they might be able to either pick up some of the costs or have the engineering expertise to help us and I. Don't know. If any of you noted that last week, I think it was Friday. There was an air quality alert, it was quite invisible. I was woke up and I was shocked to look down first Avenue to see the like, just like the 1970s. Maybe if some of you don't remember the 1970s, but I definitely do, and there was a whole valley of smog and First Avenue, so you know we're in danger of going back if we aren't vigilant and if we aren't monitoring and just like frequent testing for Covid-19 helps to reduce the rate. Frequent monitoring in terms of air quality also helps us to know what is causing pollution and how to reduce it, and I'm very grateful that you gave me an opportunity to chime in. Thank you so much sure yeah. This is cause again with regard to the mode. Wouldn't that be a department of health issue. Yes, maybe we can get them involved if it's at a certain bus stop and if it is mold, okay. Well, let's I think that can be an item that will, if you can follow up on that specific location, that'd be helpful, so I think with that Marissa we we can. Let you go and thank you very much for being here. We will we'll follow up with you. We'll look forward to hearing from you and thanks for being at this meeting, have a good night. Take care so I think. Obviously there are questions here about how we should proceed. You know when looking at this resolution from February of 2019 I guess I mean in some ways the big question really is you know: do we do another resolution? Do we do a letter I'm disinclined to follow a resolution with a resolution in the sense that I think if we passed a resolution saying we want x, you know to just pass another resolution. Saying hey, remember this: we want x, I, think it's kind of is kind of weak, I. Think a letter saying hey. We passed this resolution. We haven't heard from you and here are the questions and really laying everything out in a letter may be better. I'm curious to hear folks thoughts and just one other consideration is the resolution that we passed. There were two resolved clauses which say we support the Cags counter proposal and request its recommendations, be implemented immediately. Okay and then request expansions of areas in which the air quality monitoring takes place. So that's actually pretty comprehensive, so yeah I would say because the first one essentially encompasses everything. That's in there, so my thinking is. Maybe we do a letter first and then followed up with a resolution afterwards, but Alita. What do you think I think that makes sense Russell, because we do have the resolution, but on the other hand, there were also points that were made additional points that were made tonight that we could put into the letters such as looking at the exhaust and pollution potential from the tugboats on the river and also again to Marco's point to make sure that what is going on inside the MTA is not contributing to any air pollution. It's just they made. I was on one of those tours and they make a very big point out of how careful they are and how clean they are, but with budget cuts impacting everything that they're doing and where the sanitation standards on the street, where garbage is visible and it's causing health issues where they're not able to do that. I. Just wonder if they're going to be spending the money on something that perhaps is less visible and less noticeable. So if we could include those in a letter, then I think that's fine, but I, but absolutely I get your point about not wanting to seem weak and asking using the letter to ask what what's going on, and why are you not responding to the resolution? Okay, I think on the and folks on the cad can correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounded to me like the barge side. Pollution concerns were among the items mentioned in the counter proposal. Is that right, Kelly new issue? You know what I need to go. I mean I'm pretty 98 positive it's in there, but it's also been on part of our tag issues. You know, I know I'm going to say: I, don't think it is I think it was a separate I think it was a separate issue, so I think a leader is right. We need to have that in this kind of a sub point as well. Okay, yeah go ahead, the counter proposal, or the thing we reference talks about moving tugs from the more pollutant ones to the lesser pollutant ones when I quickly, skimmed over just a second ago, but I, don't think it talks about necessarily monitoring that exactly okay, well, look I, think you know I think the letter can specify you know all of the key points that we made so I think the letter can refer to points that were in the counter proposal as well as is not because all that is stuff that we need answers to and that we've needed answers to in terms of stuff we've already mentioned and that we now have have requested so I think we'll be able to incorporate all those Marco what yeah guys go ahead before we go yeah one question: what's the with the new with the increased ferry service at 91st? Would that have an impact on the pollution or the air quality at the MTA Kelly's shaking her head? Maybe yeah I mean possibly right. It's possible yeah I think it could, especially if you look at where one of their monitors is located. It's sitting out at kind of the corner of the dock, and let's say one of those services are going down the river and it's you know, as similar they've got the technology that the tugs do, because the technology is only at a certain level. Yeah I, don't I, think it potentially could currently where their monitor is I, think it could pick up something. So theoretically, we could also put pressure on DOT yeah. It's about the monitoring, yeah I think what it does well look I! Think it's also going to con I, don't know, I think it's a discussion. Everyone should try to have internally, because I think it's going to challenge people. If you look at DSNY right, they're, saying look, we can only own what's specific to this MTA so, like all the what was it number six oil burning in these buildings right? That was all the concern of theirs, because they're like well wait a minute we're getting targeted for the six number six oil burning in the buildings. Hence, where Catherine Garcia worked with the mayor to get this community at the top of the list to flip those but I, don't know I, think that's an interesting question and I think it could muddy the waters but I don't know I mean I'm speaking without understanding their route without understanding their technology, I'm just assuming that one of those goes down the river or even up the river and goes by the MTA with the current technology. It could absolutely pick up its pollution, so maybe we could also get Ben involved with his authority. You know get him involved in this too yeah well, Jesse sits on the Cag who's, his representative, all right, let's go to Marco. Thank you. I think we can go with the letter. I think is that your strategy is correct. We respect that I hear that the buildings will be target for the type of the energy they use. Ah now they are in trouble, regardless that, if they don't want it or not, there is the local law 79 that all the buildings, especially the buildings that go more than 25,000 square feet. It has to be in compliance with the low it has to reduce 40 percent of the consumption of the energy. So that is one part that I, don't think is going to impact our resolution with that or with a secondary impact in the community. So now they have been preparing to reduce the consumption of energy. That is one part. The other part is we can do this later and they all and also we can. We can request to disclose all the feed how frequencies change the filter daily or month or weekly, but we have done I think that I will be very happy to support the letter. I think Stephanie is good idea. Thank you all right, Elita. Thank you. Sorry, I had to meet myself. I was just wondering it's possible to parse out the pollutants coming from the tug boats versus the ferries if they use different fuel or do something or to triangulate, if I'm using that word correctly, so that we could figure out if there is an impact, I think it's a good point and we don't want to muddy the waters, but what we should know, and maybe together if there is more pollution and it's the same type, it makes it even more necessary to figure out what what's going on with the MTA that just because the ferries are there polluting it just enhances or exacerbate. That's, not the right word, but exacerbates the pollution. So I don't know. If we want to address anything else, I mean we don't want to raise questions, but we want to be able to I guess have answers in case they say anything about the ferries that cause out. That was what was useful. Kelly I mean we. We've spoke spoken about this at the Cag. Do you want to answer this or I can also yeah? I've got go ahead, I'll chime in after you no I mean basically the there's no way for them to tell where the pollutants come from, and this is it's something that we've raised with them multiple times. Basically the way that the equipment works. Is it just sucks it all in, and it doesn't say it came from this or came from that, and it just sees there's this amount of this type of pollutant. There's this amount of this type of pollutant- and you know it's a box that just sucks stuff up and there's no way that it can tell no I know that, but I was wondering if the tug boats or the MTA or the garbage trucks have well I guess would be really the tugboats use, a certain kind of fuel that releases a certain kind of part particle and the ferries. Now the ferries have a different kind of particle. It's the same. You know I'm not an interesting. Well, then we should just be aware that it's, it potentially is an issue and see, but that's a it's an interesting point. Thank you and then let me just add to that, or just also correct myself. I said earlier that we need to put on our to-do list as watching Covanta as potentially going bankrupt. That's not true what it was corrected, what it is them selling Covanta so then getting someone else to buy. It then I think will correct me if I'm wrong, but I just can't remember if we've talked about it and we asked Jesse to investigate that- maybe not! Maybe we just talked about the current contracts as it relates to building the 92nd street ramp. So in speaking about contracts again, then you know it's going to be interesting to see what does that mean with the city if Covanta sells and they have 20-year contracts, I guess now we're down to what I don't know 16 years 17-year contracts? What does that mean for the community? What does that mean for upkeep of the tugboats? What's that mean for the commitments that have been made so some to be aware of will? Can we get a report from DOT about the monitoring at the 91st street terminal and do we even know if they do that I don't know, I thought it would be EDC too it wouldn't be. D.O.T I thought Kelly said that there was a monitoring station right there. That's for the MTA air monitoring is located out and Kelly correct me. If I'm wrong the as you go, there's the place where they put all the boxes full of trash. They wait to be lifted onto the tug boats. That is one of the locations that they have for air quality monitoring based in the permit that they have from this state and Et cetera, oh okay, so there's no one it's located close, but it's not it's not there for the ferry to the best of my knowledge, the answer is no okay, all right! Well, look I! Think we have a plan of action here, so we're going to write a letter and it's going to follow up on what we said in the resolution. It's going to make the various specific requests for information that we talked about and particularly on the priority items you know relating to what they're monitoring for and where the monitors are going to go, and you know I think we'll also want to just emphasize the point that I made, which is these don't seem like particularly heavy lifts in terms of what we're asking for, and so you know, part of the question is just why, if they don't want to do these things, why is that? And we just need to get answers to these questions so and it sounds like they're opening this open to sending us somebody who's more knowledgeable next time, so I think that'll be helpful. Also, so I think that's going to be. Let's do that and we will we'll take it from there we'll see what they say: hey Maxwell, just to answer your question at least what they're telling us why they don't want to do it. The common answer is what we do for you. We have to do for everybody, so it's a standard protocol, our pushback to that has been we're the only one located in a dense population with children and seniors. So you know we're trying to compare apples to apples, we're not an apple we're in orange, we're very different and that's why we need these additional security measures to make sure that the community's safe yeah I mean look to me also. The other point is again just given what we're asking for, and maybe there's just elements of it that I don't understand, but you know what would be the big deal if you know they had to share all the information they collect with everybody if it's stuff they're collecting anyway I mean just what are the extra resources that they're having to expend to just provide information that they already have? And you know what is the extra resources that they have to expend to take monitors that are in place anyway and put them in places that are more useful. I mean that to me those are really big questions if they had to do that, city-wide I don't even really see what the big deal is, but obviously we'll hear from them, and maybe there are answers to that. I'll go back. Let's go to elite again, thanks Russell, I'm just wondering how the pollution dissipates over the course of a few blocks. East Harlem has a higher asthma rate. Maybe it's worthwhile to ask CB9 11 if they would have a resolution in support of additional air quality monitoring. They've got schools and other things nearby, and if it does and I don't know blow up there, then they would have a strong interest in supporting us on this yeah. That sounds fun to me. But to me that sounds like something: that's further down the road, because we're kind of still finding out what the I think. If once we get a you know when we get a response to our letter, you know whatever it is I think you know there will be further action. Potentially that comes out and I think that at that stage you know, if we're passing another resolution, we can ask for I guess a supporting resolution from that would be kind of my thinking on it. Okay now, but further to a leader's point, why can't we write three letters, one to the DSNY? You know with the letter that we've gone through these resolutions. We need an answer 1 to CB11, finding out from them what they're doing and would they combine with us about the air quality in their area combined with ours and one to DOT. We can ask them or get the.committee to ask for air monitoring at the 91st with the increase in ferry service. These are three different letters. The you know the DOT one's got nothing to do with the environment, but the other two are related to the environment. Okay, I mean for DOT. It sounds like it's a d, it's more like a. What will saying is: maybe it's DEP instead of DOT but but dots in charge of the ferries. Aren't they. It is years okay, so we can write a letter to them for monitoring there. I mean with the increase in ferry service at that location. You know, they've got quite a few ferries in a day sure yeah I think you know, there's no harm in asking, but that's Craig and Warren's Chuck's department. All right, we'll look, maybe we'll. Let's I guess we can touch base with the transportation committee about that third one, but for for the other items, I mean I think we can start obviously the DSNY letter. We are definitely yes yeah and we can just look. We can reach out to CB11 and see what they think and what they've done on it, and if it's something that they've given any thought to and kind of, take it from there with that. So do we need a resolution about writing the letter or we can only do it. Yeah I think there's sounds like folks. Aren't bored with the letter, so I think, let's just let's just write it good! Okay, thanks Russell! Thanks will yeah thanks everybody! So do we I think that's it in terms of the agenda, I, guess: there's we don't really have any old business or new business. So I think with that we can adjourn if there's a motion yeah. Thank you it really. It was a huge help to have you guys here to to help inform us on all this stuff. Thanks, Caroline great take care thanks, Kel.
