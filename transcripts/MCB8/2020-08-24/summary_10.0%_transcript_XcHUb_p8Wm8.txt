Since then, we've been good about wearing, masks, social, distancing, washing our hands getting tested and answering the contact tracing calls, but is that enough?
It is reasonable to want to know how prepared the city is and the hospitals and How prepared are we if there is a surge I'd like to introduce our experts for the evening?
We worked with Ps290 in the neighborhood and may have read about on the New York Post, and we said we need a nurse in every school a full- time nurse because of pediatric multi- Implant, multi- system, inflammatory syndrome, pmis and the mayor did finally agree to do those 400 nurses we've also been pushing for remote learning, using everything from libraries, senior centers and even empty storefronts, and the mayor's agreed to make a hundred thousand slots of Voya available.
If you have an idea for a slot, let us know you may have read today's New York, Post and editorial in support of, if we're doing all remote learning for 400,000 students that we could actually integrate those classrooms and get gnt to any student who wanted it.
Do we prevent a second wave and then also, I think the key thing is since the beginning, working with these experts and others to get testing for everyone trying to get beyond the painful swab testing, but to even saliva testing and rapid testing, so you're not even having to wait 10 days, but actually waiting a couple of minutes instead of hours.
I've asked Dr long from H to speak first and do a presentation So much Dr long from New, York's, h and contact racing What I want to do is talk to you about our current state of what we're doing in New, York City now to suppress the coronavirus and then talk a little bit about in preparation, for if there is a surge, what things will look like then, and everything we're doing to keep you safe and protected during that time, as well, so, starting with the beginning, new Yorkers, is something to be proud.
We have the lowest rates of Coronavirus, hospitalizations, new cases, Emergency department, visits and deaths, since the epidemic began back in March April and that's something that everybody listening now deserves: credit for.
Testing number two contact tracing and number three helping people to get through this for them and their families, either at home or in one of our hotels.
We again are a national leader in this we're doing more than 30,000 tests of new yorkers every single day, acrosss More than 200 testing locations in New York City tests are always free, and our mantra is that we want everybody in community board, eight or any community in New York City, to feel that there's no barrier to getting the tests, people vote with their feet and the fact that 30,000 people a day are coming out to get.
I. Remember back in June We were starting this program, which was not too far before I, came and talked to you all last time we did not even have a phone number for 15 percent of people that were the new cases of Coronavirus in New York City.
We want to be able to complete our intake with people so that we know that they're being able to stay safe at home.
Other thing that people then ask is well if you're completing your intake and finding contacts of which we found 30,000 contacts in New, York City, that's great.
We call take care right, now, more than seven 000 times we pair people up with resource navigators to give them what they need in order to stay at home.
We've actually planted ourselves there ingrained in the community there to bring the community out to knock on doors, to get people to come out and get tested, we're going to be releasing our new numbers on that soon, which are very encouraging.
We, were in you know a true pandemic here in New, York City The picture in the left is a place where we hopefully do not want to be that's not a picture from Covid-19 time.
But that's a picture before of what New York, City Hospi emergency departments used to look like right and certainly at capacity not wearing masks.
You know, kind of elective rashes to be seen, for example, and so some of those some of our colleagues from dermatology and all of these specialties here, you see represented actually we're folded into the emergency response system and we work side by side, other attendees attending physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician, assistants, all in the emergency department, all seen, Covid-19 patients, and they were deployed together.
Is, the E.D, safe right, and so let's talk about that first question: When do you want to come to the emergency department?
Certainly we have chairs and that are fixed, that we're going to need for a potential second wave You know where the emergency department we're preparing for everything.
So, we're not going to just throw the you know, Chainsaw off the middle chair, but we've really adhered to not putting patients next to each other, and I would say this is the waiting room, In addition, we currently at the lower levels of the amount of emergency department, patients that are in our eds.
I should also talk as every hospital does, there's visitor limitations to reduce the number of people in hospitals, as well as in the emergency departments and other things you would experience.
The point for the for the people listening are there is that there's systems in place that are extremely rigorous to protect patients and the visitors and is of course , I'm sure there are going to be testing questions that come up.
This is virtual, urgent, care, I'll talk about this on the, but just like all systems, New York presbyterian has a an app a way to see one of our doctors.
You know enough time, talking, but just takeaways here from the hospital perspective, we're certainly actively planning for the second wave.
I guarantee you that and then certain low acuity health issues, like we kind of, went through, consider using video, consider using telemedicine, and with that you know thanks for your time, guys And, we'll open it up to everyone for questions.
Another thing that I heard Cuomo in early days talk about was the idea of a more sharing of resources, rather than Mount Sinai in New York Nyu in New, York hospital, each being separate entities of more of a dialogue or a between to share equipment, ppe's, possibly even staff and beds, and I'm wondering if that's something that is a reality and can really work , I'm, going to ask you this specifically, because I think you've done a great job with pr for tracing, and I am a true believer.
As you were, saying, we've become the first major city as far as I know in the country to every single new case of coronavirus.
But that's a component of a larger piece of home care, Talking about you know, and we may not have seen things like on the right, which is the oxygen concentrator.
Barbara is during the pandemic in you, know, March, April may in New. We certainly do not want to get back there again and are taking a lot of measures from a facility and a physical plant standpoint to expand those.
We wanted to make sure, of course, that we had enough beds for the people who had oxygen levels that were 40 or 70 right, but what we quickly realized is when we followed those patients up, at least in our system.
There was rimsey and Roosevelt island, so there was a bunch of different options and it really came down to how can we as a city not as an individual hospital work together to get people where they need to go to unlock capacity for other people to come?
If you're going to visit family members that are potentially people that would be susceptible or higher risk, if they did contract The coronavirus couple things number one get tested before you see them, you can come to one of our sites, get tested.
They potentially have infected a lot of people by then, so the contact tracing may not be as effective, and one gentleman who chatted said that his question said that he gets tested every two weeks.
We need to get our testing turnaround times lower than we currently have them at New, York, City, Health and hospitals.
Then I'll turn to doctor for his review on this, too, is our sites, You can tell your friends and colleagues to come to one of our New York City Health and hospital sites, and we do.
We have several kind of more rapid testing, but we're certainly trying to make sure that the communication loop is tight and what I mean by that You know with reagents and the number of people and the number of kind of tests.
The percent of people that are being tested that come back positive is significantly higher right.
Just I asked that, because I work for a health insurer and we're actually, you know debating whether we're going to send you know an at- home test, all our policyholders, our medical, policyholders.
You know these important things that we're all used to getting, but at buildings that are not our home right.
You, know in american health care and science Within the matter of a couple months, we had turned at least in New York City.
It's not a concurrent situation and to be very careful and to practice the social distancing that I think was talked about in wearing masks, anyway, because otherwise we're taking the virus into people that are more vulnerable.
You know just things personal experience, I think certainly basic employee training, right, and that goes to doctors that goes to nurses, doctors in training, residents.
There's, certainly not only, and you know, people learn in different ways.
You know bunny suit or any of these things like hazmat suit in and out of the hospital, but certainly when I get home.
