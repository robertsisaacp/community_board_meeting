The associate director of new york, presbyterian's, lower Manhattan department of emergency medicine I agree to introduce council member ben kaylos, who needs no introduction to those in cb8 and other areas of Manhattan I'm happy to have worked with the co-chairs of cba's health seniors and social services committee, barbara rudder and rebecca dangor, both of whom are here as well.
We worked with ps290 in the neighborhood and may have read about on the new york post, and we said we need a nurse in every school, a full-time nurse because of pediatric multi-implant multi-system, inflammatory syndrome pmis, and the mayor did finally agree to do those 400 nurses, we've also been pushing for remote learning, using everything from libraries, senior centers and even empty storefronts, and the mayor's agreed to make a hundred thousand slots of voya available If you have an idea for a slot, let us know you may have read today's new york, post and editorial in support of, if we're doing all remote learning for 400 000 students that we could actually integrate those classrooms and get gnt to any student who wanted it and another key piece that we've been hearing from Everyone is about trying to move classrooms outdoors, whether it's in park space, which we really don't have in this neighborhood or even our city streets Do we prevent a second wave and then also?
What I want to do is talk to you about our current state of what we're doing in new york city now to suppress the coronavirus and then talk a little bit about in preparation, for if there is a surge, what things will look like then, and everything we're doing to keep you safe and protected during that time as well.
Tracing We want to be able to complete our intake with people so that we know that they're being able to stay safe at home and we've had the opportunity to ask them who they may have exposed to the coronavirus, which is a sensitive conversation When our when we started the program back in june, we were only completing our intake process for about 50 of people, one in every two, our goal, which all of the experts say is you have to complete intake in 75 or more to really suppress the virus.
The other thing that people then ask is well if you're completing your intake and finding contacts of which we found 30 000 contacts in new york, city- How do you know that people are actually isolating at home if you're diagnosed with the coronavirus?
The picture in the left is a place where we hopefully do not want to be that's not a picture from Covid-19 time, but that's a picture before of what new york city, hospi, emergency departments used to look like right and certainly at capacity not wearing masks.
In addition, we were able to fly in multiple emergency medicine, doctors from other states at the times when we didn't have any other states with pandemics, but this is just an idea of how we combated that at that time and probably what we would do in a potential second wave You see anything funny on here suspicious, but you know basically you're seeing that we had a lot of cases mostly focused in the southern part of the state and as you zoom in on the right of the screen, you can see where the hospitals that our group works at is located and the darker portions represent the density of cases right per capita.
I spoke to the chief of the icu today, who asked me to remind you that often not life-threatening, but certainly if you have one swollen leg, which might be a sign of a dvt or a blood clot in your leg, that would might be another reason you may need to come to a hospital to an emergency department The second question that people has not just when should I come, but what are you guys doing to keep me safe right and just a few pictures here, and this is pictures of our of our wild cornell emergency department there on the left, you can see all of our doctors, our nurses, pped up right.
The point for the for the people listening are there is that there's systems in place that are extremely rigorous to protect patients and the visitors and is of course, , I'm sure there are going to be testing questions that come up, I should say they get tested in our emergency department.
You know enough time talking, but just takeaways here from the hospital perspective, we're certainly actively planning for the second wave We just showed you what we did with the first wave, expanding square footage, I guarantee you that and then certain low acuity health issues, like we kind of, went through, consider using video, consider using telemedicine, and with that you know thanks for your time, guys and we'll open it up to everyone.
Another thing that I heard Cuomo in early days talk about was the idea of a more sharing of resources, rather than mount sinai in new york, nyu in new york hospital, each being separate entities of more of a dialogue or a between to share equipment, ppe's, possibly even staff and beds and I'm going to ask you this specifically, because I think you've done a great job with pr for tracing Do wear your mask and if we do open up restaurants and go into public buildings and to observe the rule and so on People don't wear masks in restaurants, and you know we want to feel normal in a restaurant and whatever normal means.
We do have the experience unfortunate as it was that patients who we would have a hundred out of a hundred times admitted in march and april, and the start of may, who had low oxygen if it was kind of low You, might just go home with the thing on the left of the screen with you know, just with the pulse ox, and if, for those of you know the numbers down to about 92, you would just get a pulse ox.
How can we as a city not as an individual hospital work together to get people where they need to go to unlock capacity for other people to come in We people coming with like a pod, with people from every hospital system getting their patients into the javits center, regardless of where they came from, and then we'll get to some of the questions that the public has sent just based on the oximeter Could, you just say when, at what oxygen level reading should people go to the emergency room?
If they did contract the coronavirus couple, things number one get tested before you see them, you can come to one of our sites, get tested, If, you're positive, you definitely shouldn't go, but if you're negative, then that's helpful to and reassuring for you and your family to know, but regardless of negative negative results or not, you should always still practice social distancing, proper hand, hygiene and mask querying I.
Think one of the things that we want to encourage people to do more of is, if you are going to visit your family again, come in for a test ahead of time, we're happy to do it.
Everybody should wear a mask that that's the key take home here, if you're in any scenario where you're wearing one or somebody's, not or vice versa, Even, if it's a marginal difference, everybody wearing a mask, is the solution to that question for sure We need to remind ourselves if you see I actually I hand out masks to people that aren't wearing them That's one of the single most important things we can do so.
Is it partial immunity now remember, in that case the person when they were likely reinfected, it was a much more mild course, so it was not the same as the first time That's what we're still trying to figure out in the scientific world, but everybody has a laser focus on so, regardless of factors like that, wear your mask and get your flu shot thanks and then we'll get back to the public Are we as far as the at-home test and I just I asked that because I work for a health insurer and we're actually, you know debating whether we're going to send you know an at-home test, all our policyholders, our medical policyholders, so I just want to see where we were as a city.
You know these important things that we're all used to getting, but at buildings that aren't our home right, You know in american health care and science and I think within the matter of a couple months, we had turned at least in new york city when we were hit very hard We never thought we'd be treating pneumonia on someone's couch with a portable oxygen concentrator that showed you and a little pulse ox?
Can you tell me a little bit more about I'm concerned about the flu vaccine too They both caused the common cold, but we we've known that when we swap people every winter, You just had two things that caused you cold symptoms, and so it you certainly could have in this case shingles or the flu as well as coronavirus I agree with your pharmacist, saying that in you know, april 15th, when I'd say somewhere on the order of 97 of the patients that I saw in the emergency department were Covid-19.
Think if you have, you know the ability to always have n95s on well, certainly that's the best right for that individual person, but right now what we've decided as an organization as surgical masks on at all times, you don't need to wear gloves when you're going in between doing normal work.
