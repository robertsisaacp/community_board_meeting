Since then, we've been good about wearing, masks, social, distancing, washing our hands getting tested and answering the contact tracing calls, but is that enough?
We worked with ps290 in the neighborhood and may have read about on the new york post, and we said we need a nurse in every school, a full-time nurse because of pediatric multi-implant multi-system, inflammatory syndrome pmis, and the mayor did finally agree to do those 400 nurses, we've also been pushing for remote learning, using everything from libraries, senior centers and even empty storefronts, and the mayor's agreed to make a hundred thousand slots of voya available.
If you have an idea for a slot, let us know you may have read today's new york, post and editorial in support of, if we're doing all remote learning for 400 000 students that we could actually integrate those classrooms and get gnt to any student who wanted it and another key piece that we've been hearing.
I think the key thing is since the beginning, working with these experts and others to get testing for everyone trying to get beyond the painful swab testing, but to even saliva testing and rapid testing, so you're not even having to wait 10 days, but actually waiting a couple of minutes instead of hours, and so I think the thing I am hoping for and if we can't get a vaccine anytime, We are not going to administer vaccines to people without a phase one or a phase.
Dr long from new york's h and contact racing What I want to do is talk to you about our current state of what we're doing in new york city now to suppress the coronavirus and then talk a little bit about in preparation, for if there is a surge, what things will look like then, and everything we're doing to keep you safe and protected during that time, as well, so, starting with the beginning, new yorkers, is something to be proud.
Three things number one testing number two contact tracing and number three helping people to get through this for them and their families, either at home or in one of our hotels.
The other thing that people then ask is well if you're completing your intake and finding contacts of which we found 30 000 contacts in new york, city- How do you know that people are actually isolating at home if you're diagnosed with the coronavirus?
We, call take care right now, more than seven 000 times we pair people up with resource navigators to give them what they need in order to stay at home.
For example, the one I'll give you is sunset park in sunset: Park : we've actually planted ourselves there ingrained in the community there to bring the community out to knock on doors, to get people to come out and get tested, we're going to be releasing our new numbers on that soon, which are very encouraging.
But that's a picture before of what new york, city, hospi, emergency departments used to look like right, and certainly at capacity not wearing masks.
Is, the e.d, safe right, and so let's talk about that first question: When do you want to come to the emergency department?
The second question that people has not just when should I come, but what are you guys doing to keep me safe right and just a few pictures here, and this is pictures of our of our wild cornell emergency department there on the left.
I should also talk as every hospital does, there's visitor limitations to reduce the number of people in hospitals, as well as in the emergency departments and other things you would experience.
The point for the for the people listening are there is that there's systems in place that are extremely rigorous to protect patients and the visitors and is of course, ourselves I'm sure there are going to be testing questions that come up.
You know enough time, talking, but just takeaways here from the hospital perspective, we're certainly actively planning for the second wave.
I guarantee you that and then certain low acuity health issues, like we kind of, went through, consider using video, consider using telemedicine, and with that you know thanks for your time, guys And, we'll open it up to everyone for questions.
There was an article about home care, somebody who was very sick and instead of going to the hospital, had somebody come in if she needed oxygen and so on, and she did.
Do, wear your mask and if we do open up restaurants and go into public buildings and to observe the rule and so on, and I'm wondering if even more pr as time goes on, because it worries me that the more normal we seem, the more relaxed I see it in restaurants, people We want to feel normal in a restaurant and whatever normal means.
One thing I will say in terms of this related to the issue of oxygen, as you were, saying, we've become the first major city as far as I know in the country to every single new case of coronavirus.
Talking about you, know, and we may not have seen things like on the right, which is the oxygen concentrator.
We wanted to make sure, of course, that we had enough beds for the people who had oxygen levels that were 40 or 70 right, but what we quickly realized is when we followed those patients up, at least in our system.
If you're going to visit family members that are potentially people that would be susceptible or higher risk, if they did contract the coronavirus, couple, things number one get tested before you see them, you can come to one of our sites, get tested.
They potentially have infected a lot of people by then, so the contact tracing may not be as effective, and one gentleman who chatted said that his question said that he gets tested every two weeks.
We need to get our testing turnaround times lower than we currently have them at new york, city, health and hospitals.
You can tell your friends and colleagues to come to one of our new york, city, health and hospital sites, and we do.
We need to get our turnaround times as low as we can so that we can power our tracing operation to know who is positive, get their contacts and help them to quarantine as quickly as possible.
We have several kind of more rapid testing, but we're certainly trying to make sure that the communication loop is tight and what I mean by that You know with reagents and the number of people and the number of kind of tests.
The percent of people that are being tested that come back positive is significantly higher right.
Just I asked that because I work for a health insurer and we're actually, you know debating whether we're going to send you know an at-home test, all our policyholders, our medical policyholders, so I just want to see where we were as a city.
As far as you know, doing more at-home tests, I think, from a hospital perspective.
You know these important things that we're all used to getting, but at buildings that aren't our home right.
You know in american health care and science Within the matter of a couple months, we had turned at least in new york city.
You know I'm going to be caring for 20 or 30 other people when I, when I'm on a telemedicine, visit, I'm, just caring for you, and so that is a difference that I think we're gonna evolve into as a country Is how we deliver healthcare, not bringing the patients to us, but bringing health care to patients.
It's not a concurrent situation and to be very careful and to practice the social distancing that I think was talked about in wearing masks, anyway, because otherwise we're taking the virus into people that are more vulnerable.
Luckily in new york city now, might be a great time to get the shingles vaccine right.
I know that presbyterian hospital is going to do a fantastic job at protecting people and you've outlined that.
And you know, people learn in different ways: Right, So there are zoom community kind of meetings amongst the hospital folks and among the medical college.
