I. Think it's just the two of us here tonight and the main reason we're here is to talk to you about a project that I mean city planning has been working on for years in different iterations, particularly since Sandy happened, and it's called zoning for coastal resiliency.
Proposes updates to the zoning resolution, specifically in chapter six, sorry, specifically of article six chapter four and some other related sections, and it's driven mainly because various different mechanisms have been introduced to improve resiliency, in particular, in building since Sandy happens and many of those expire in the coming years.
You may know of the East side, coastal resiliency project, which is a specific engineering.
The proposal is seeking to modify and improve the previous provisions that we're expecting to expire in the coming years, and it's doing so through a text amendment to the article 6 of chapter 4, that I mentioned in the zoning resolution and that part of the zoning resolution is called special regulations applying in flood hazard.
So I mean the different solutions that this project proposes affects various different parts of the zoning resolution as well, and the way this presentation, categorizes.
You know to the best extent, that the department can, at this point so on to the you'll, see here a series of maps, and while there are many sources of flooding that pose issues in New, York City Coastal storms present the most significant flood risk in terms of compromising human safety, property damage and business disruption.
You know almost a million new yorkers, so you know some widespread implications of this, particularly for where a lot of our city currently lives, so I- think in anticipating a logical question out of this slide that you're looking at here, I, suspect.
Probably this slide and again we'll make sure it's available to you afterwards, but there's sort of four goals, or you know pillars that this project is seeking to make changes to the zoning resolution based off of.
So, we know that, firstly, the floodplain community wants to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they are not located in what FEMA determines to be the current high-risk flood zone, especially those located in the areas that face moderate risk of flooding, and that did experience coastal flooding from Sandy.
Secondly, people also want the option to raise their occupiable space a little higher than the current flood level that FEMA projects again.
They want options like moving their mechanical equipment to higher elevations, without necessarily triggering your requirement to raise or fully fr flood proof.
We, know that we need a way for the city to be nimbler in responding to future events that might require rebuilding homes or other forms of recovery.
Zoning for coastal resiliency would expand the applicability of the current text to a broader set of buildings that are also exposed to flooding in the event of coastal storms by allowing any lot located within both the 1 and the 0.2 annual chance.
Flood plains to have access to the proposed special rules that help enable resiliency at the building.
The 0.2 chance floodplain serves as a proxy for the high-end projection of the 2050s one percent annual chance floodplain, allowing the city to advance resiliency in the longer term, as it would allow those living in those areas to proactively undertake resiliency improvements, even if they're not yet required to buy the building.
This set of rules would help promote good, long-term resilient design of buildings and would and how they meet the sidewalk through floor area.
Moving on to speaking about situations where neighborhoods and buildings may be old, and maybe they do not fully comply with our current zoning regulations, leaving residents and in those instances it leaves residents in these areas in a hard position when they try and undertake any resiliency improvements.
We learned that raising mechanical equipment is often the first step to make buildings more resilient, and so the proposal would enable more options for the placement of equipment above flood level, either atop of roofs, which is a common strategy for larger buildings or in a separate structure, which is a common strategy for large sites or smaller buildings that can not accommodate the added heavy load of equipment within their building or on the roof of the building.
The proposal would also enable different types of flood protection measures to be implemented across all areas.
The proposal would allow power systems, including generators and solar energy, systems, fuel, cells, batteries and other energy storage systems to be considered permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts to facilitate their installments.
The city-wide text, amendment that we're presenting to you today is being referred out to all community boards borough presidents and to the city Council in the land, use process.
We would like to be sure that you have a staff member on hand at that meeting, so they can answer be prepared to answer any questions that may come up at that meeting.
You know available in many areas of the city that buildings above that level put out an exponential amount of greenhouse gases that cause just this kind of sea rise and flooding.
The proposal at the moment is to increase it to the area that you saw in red on the map that I pulled up in community board eight, and really it's not doing a great deal beyond that.
And when you look at our map, you know we had significant flooding in 96th street that impeded patient access to Metropolitan, hospital.
And I'm, asking that when they come December 9th to do a presentation, particularly to CB8 mechanicals, have been an issue and new buildings being built have put them higher.
What you did not address is that, although nursing homes must now not be permitted to build in these areas, our area is filled with hospitals along York Avenue, where the flooding does not count.
Asking now, because I'm very disappointed with this presentation from a zoning perspective that Cpc come back in December and if you have a problem reach out to us and we will move to get a presentation that talks about us.
Yes, I appreciate that you go in the direction to look for solutions great, but the problem is not only that the building code, the only the floating area, is designed and is established like that.
And I think it's completely wrong in that direction that you neglect to come and propose something for our community for myself.
We need to create the different solutions and we have a problems in our esplanade that constantly collapse and they will continue collapsing, and that is why a standing pool in that direction so I strongly recommend you prepare something which is going to be very hard to resolve in a short, a short period of time.
Know, Cba has been fighting for certain height restrictions because we have no zoning height limitations on first, second, third, Avenue etc, and a lot of building developers have been using the ability to put mechanicals in the middle of the buildings as a reason to increase the height very substantially.
There have been some rules and regulations put in place that limit that extension based on whether or not there's an enclosure around those mid-level, mechanicals so number one in you're, considering of what's appropriate for CB8 I would like to ask that in fact, in order to put mechanicals above grade level, that developers not be afforded any additional space over what is absolutely necessary for the mechanicals.
They are building a building that was probably a open area or a parking lot, and they built up to raising the mechanicals, taking them out of the basement and they're putting them up above.
I believe is build a flood wall around it, the property which was also in their presentation so they're doing like two of those components.
Yet I do not know how they would have to support the roof or whatever, but the projects that I've seen that relate to this project have been flood walls and the raising of the mechanicals, and you can see that now on 96th Street 93Rd street at the Isaac houses.
And I do not know how much you flexibility you have with this, but I do think that if you're making this presentation to every community board across the city, I think it's very wise to think about the audiences for these, and particularly the in those that are not built on sand, but are built on granite.
Those, who have more existing buildings that have more multi-family kind of homes and especially for us with the FDR drive and the esplanade, and the hospitals as elaine said.
And I'm glad that our fellow board, members and Wendy raised some of these issues, because I think that overall, it's just going to be a better and more productive conversation on December 9th.
So I mean I, probably initially should address something that I think perhaps is has been lost in translation here, because I mean for this to be specifically tailored to community board.
8 would require FEMA to be issuing a specific flood regulation that applies to Community board 8 and for the zoning resolution to only specifically apply to a part of community board eight and the way this text amendment works is that it operates for the whole of the city in the same way, so FEMA issues, flood level elevations that apply to the whole city.
That were perhaps you know, shown as examples in the presentation, but regardless of what the structure is, that the building flood elevation plane that is being adopted, here, it applies in the same way.
We can certainly come back and try and answer some open questions, but I'm not sure we'll have a specific presentation for you, because this team is working on 59 community boards.
Also I, believe it was early last year relating to mechanical void, spaces, and this does not supersede that developers won't suddenly be able to circumvent the action that the city took last year to start trying to increase the height of their buildings.
I just want to thank you for the presentation, as someone who lives in a building where we were evacuated in the height of Sandy and displaced for almost two weeks.
Very much appreciate the effort that this that the city has gone through and DCP, especially to ensure that neighborhoods and communities and residents who live in vulnerable areas are going to have the ability to be able to harden their homes and their buildings and to be able to deal with the inevitable threats of climate change and sea level rise and flooding, threats that are going to continue.
Very much I just want to extend my appreciation for the work that you did and to let you know that there are some of us who are not insulted by your presentation and who think that this is a very thorough job and the impact on our community in many respects.
I think that there, a lot of questions have been raised around like and specifically since this is parks and waterfront.
Not I was having a hard time better understanding of like how that translates to the esplanade and how that translates for this, for my community so and then specifically with, like the mechanical voids piece and that sort of thing.
How that, like those pieces, that I think that a lot of folks are kind of raising in terms of just better understanding what this really means for us certainly noted on the voids there.
I mean I, do not know the building you're, specifically talking about, but it's generic.
We heard that water comes up from underneath the building, so I'm just asking since Manhattan, particularly our area, has that kind of building an already existing building.
It depends what exactly exists within the floodplain, because if, in particular, there is habitable spaces below the design, flood elevation say on the ground floor and they want to relocate.
Where say that space would be designed to flood, so you can put different things within a wet flood area such as you, know, parking or storage and things like that, but it specifically tries to ensure that those spaces are either designed to flood.
It also encourages dry floodproofing, which is more cumbersome to do, but basically that involves completely insulating the outside of the building to ensure that water is not designed to come in so that you know relates to seals and foundations, and things like that, but that does not allow for, as far as I understand habitable spaces to be under the design.
The text amendment would promote them, working with the department of buildings and their own architects and engineers and consultants to try and solve the specific issues.
It's helpful, but I think those kinds of parameters ought to be made known, because if you want to encourage buildings to do this, they have to know that they can financially otherwise, as well.
I, think my colleague Jennifer from the New York Parks Department, is going to give a brief.
It's called eternity male figure statue of Venuskinetrix and it will be presented as a public outdoor sculpture at in front of Asia Society's building at 70Th Street in the Park Avenue Median, and the outdoor component of this will be realized in conjunction with the fund for Park Avenue under the auspices of the New York Park, New York, City parks and art in the parks.
These are just kind of an image of the two companion works together, but you know we're very excited to be partnering with time with New York, Parks Department, and you know, with the neighborhood.
In terms of you know the mta's requirements that they'll have insurance and things like that art is very subjective.
I'm looking forward to going to the Asia society and seeing the triennial I actually have a time ticket for like this weekend, 19th.
Can I can I just clarify your role at the parks Department, because I think I want to talk to you about something: else, not tonight.
Projects going on throughout the districts in various parks I'm not going to go into, and we would like to encourage coming up probably next spring, but thank you to everyone who participated and we truly appreciate all their efforts and hard work as far as permits and events in the parks.
I hope it can stay like that, as our cover numbers are not going the direction we wanted to, but currently right now.
You have a word on that, but if people have any suggestions for any park, areas, I know that I believe that was a concern and an issue, a topic at one of our community board.
Meetings, specifically I'm thinking like 86th street Plaza, or how do we do something similar to that.
I just want to thank you in the parks Department for the speed in which you were able to complete the repairs at 76th street on the esplanade and deal with the sinkhole.
I think it was very much appreciated by our community, so I just want to commend.
I know you're going to speak, but I was actually thinking that you would speak right after this, so.
I just again wanted to thank cba for these very informative monthly sessions, so much about maintaining better New, York, City, Park spaces and green spaces.
I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you, trisha billy and all the other members of Community Board 8, who came to Rupert Park I.
