If you know kohler, I was not familiar with it, but it's a long air facility A program called open doors, one by run by a wonderful person named Jenny, Lee Brewster, and she introduced me to a number of people over there, including a guy named Vinnie Pierce, and a buddy of his name.
I got a request from one of my women's students who was actually from Pakistan who worked in the government of Pakistan and then come over to this country, and I discovered when I took a look that she'd actually done better than my friend in Afghanistan, and so you know the diversity of folks you get to work with Thank you all for joining us, so the conversation I will I will delve into the into the subject which is which is to talk about this.
To me, amazing and challenging issue of reopening our schools in the era of comet Kempo Amore is the director of community relations for the Department of education, so we're very sort of privileged to have her participating with us.
There are many issues to address when you're trying to reopen in this era where the health and sanitation and space social distancing issues are So. You know so relevant, so important, and I was speaking earlier about my own experience teaching and how much I both liked it.
This is with the help of Elizabeth rose- who, as many of you may know, has actually served in the Department of Education- Has, been a wonderful support and assistance to me and thinking about some of these issues that next month, on the fourth Monday, which I think is the 26th of October, we'll be having a session looking at our upper East side school , this system, you know both individual schools and as a system and what the issues and challenges are not just in the next days and weeks as we open with the issue of Covid-19 and health , that's so paramount, but what we think the issues are and what our concerns are in terms of in terms of education going forward in terms of the district going forward.
But what one of my life ambitions I've told myself is that everybody, hopefully at the high school level, perhaps junior senior years, and definitely at the college, level, have not the requirement but the opportunity to spend at least one semester focus on entrepreneurship, because in the in the school setting, we collectively you know, look to teach everyone, a basic set of skills and the ability to apply those skills in a way.
You know sort of self- conscious or feel like they did not have the right question or what have you, because in whatever arena we're talking about here, we're talking about how to make our school system successful under duress in this particular circumstance.
They were the first generation in their family to have gone to college, and I I'm thrilled by that, because to me, sort of that's one of the wonderful things about college education Is. It opens that you know the whole new business to you into your life into sort of possibly an opportunity.
20 percent of our students want chose to stay home like versed right off the bat And I'm, one of them that under no circumstances are we going to school because for Covid-19 for safety reasons for the for the fact that it's not worth my time to go to commute to school and many families have different reasonings of why they do not want to go to go, attend school or send their child to school.
There was a lot up in the air The other thing we had to think about was who was actually going to show up on the first day of school, which was supposed to be today, 9 21.
I would definitely go on twitter and look at some of the pictures that were released from the first day of school and those are our most important students because in this scenario, because those are the students that really need that in- person bond thing.
I was prepared with what I just do with the the biography that you know of our planned speaker, but I asked if you would be willing to introduce yourself and your role at the DOE and thank you so much for stepping in, and let me just let me just say, as you appreciate, and I think everybody here on this zoom, you know call Appreciate I just want to acknowledge you and the entire department of education for wrestling with, and what's been very impressive.
You know stages of the education cycle, So, just like how we're thinking, through remote learning for younger students, right, correct, One of the updates, which I'm sure you've like heard, is just this decision.
I know that the the agency is also working on just like different guidelines for families to utilize to support- You know kind of like be in sync, with some of the information that we're utilizing in terms of remote learning, and so that guidance is soon to come.
I mean I'm, trying to imagine being in your shoes and dealing with the situation and Having said that, I'm going to give you a little personal note when I was a little kid, And There was some tension in my family household, Because, literally at the age of five, I decided.
Having said: that, Stephanie I'm open to hearing, but I want to Actually I want to take one more second to look at the other side of this, because I understand that I mean how many students are there in our system, something like a million.
We were collecting interests and like requests from families that needed ipads, and then central office was mailing these out to individual families that shifted for the new year and that the policy for distribution is now being handled by schools.
Before, is actually, I think, at the request of school administrators that were like telling us like we're, not we're, having difficulty keeping track of who has an ipad who has a device since who does not, because it's all being handled by the central offices, and so that has shifted for schools in the start of the school year.
These schools should be receiving support from central to think about like additional resources or where they can like use funding to purchase more devices that they then will continue to distribute.
I know I've been talking to a lot of families during the summer who maybe were calling their school and were not able to reach anyone and part of what I mentioned in those conversations Is that a lot of administrators were not in the building during the summer, right.
At the same school, which indicates that this is a systemic problem, and what I want to do is use the opportunity for you stephanie to please take some notes and bring this back to your team, because right now, I think New York City needs to start trusting that the agencies serving families, especially when it comes to our children, are getting this right and that the messaging is consistent in that we do not have schools telling families one thing, and then families going to any of these offices and not even being able to speak to a person and on the day of orientation.
What I've noticed with the Department of education is like there's no learning from the families that you're working with, because the whole summer, the whole summer.
You know that some schools like have need additional support or have not gotten the guidance around like distributions of ipads.
And, then, if they need any additional devices to work with the central office to see where they can, you know, like utilize, different resources to purchase.
So unless, like you're hearing from like the school immediately or you're, in conversations with the teacher and need more additional support, I've shared the tech support request form right instead of there is also a number that you can call, but it's very backed up right, now.
You know with your information, the student I d, just like information about the ipad or the device, and then someone from our tech team will call the family.
You know within a certain amount of time, usually 48 hours or so to support them with, like a specific issue that they might be having stephanie.
So now, I'm, starting to sound like every other frantic parent, I, do not think anybody's hearing it and the money keeps going into the pit and the mayor and the chancellor keep talking in circles and The teachers.
Other school districts chose to reopen in a way that prioritized those students being in school five days a week full time and allowing the older students, like our high school member, rami Siegel, to attend remotely 100 of the time and, as we know, over 40 percent of students have chosen to attend remotely a hundred percent of the time, which fundamentally helps enable in- school learning for those who have the highest needs.
Why did not the DOE take this type of approach and whose needs did they think they were meeting by having every school go to a one two or three day a week in school, approach?
You know to the grandparents house, whatever it is, so Elizabeth like to be perfectly transparent and honest with you We're, one of the most diverse cities in the country with diverse needs, right I think that there clearly was a lot of room for improvement, so That is what it feels like to me that the solution that the DOE came up with above and beyond the did.
, I'm, also a high school student and luckily, like I'm in a house that I have my own room, And I'm, a computer, I'm, very fortunate to not face a lot of the struggles that I know.
Well then, it's up to the mayor, but do you think that school will be pushed back when the time comes, October 1st, because, just like it was last week Everyone is working their hardest to try to make that possible, but I mean, I think the hope is yes to start October first and to do the gradual reopening and the way that we've like laid it out, which October 1st is actually not for everyone.
