I got a request from one of my women's students who was actually from pakistan who worked in the government of pakistan and then come over to this country, and I discovered when I took a look that she'd actually done better than my friend in afghanistan, and so you know the diversity of folks.
To me, amazing and challenging issue of reopening our schools in the era of comet Kempo amore is the director of community relations for the department of education, so we're very sort of privileged to have her participating with us, and I.
Looking at our upper east side school this system, you know both individual schools and as a system and what the issues and challenges are not just in the next days and weeks as we open with the issue of Covid-19 and health , that's so paramount, but what we think the issues are and what our concerns are in terms of in terms of education going forward in terms of the district going forward.
But what one of my life ambitions I've told myself is that everybody, hopefully at the high school level, perhaps junior senior years, and definitely at the college, level, have not the requirement but the opportunity to spend at least one semester focus on entrepreneurship, because in the in the school setting, we collectively you know, look to teach everyone, a basic set of skills and the ability to apply those skills in a way.
Whatever questions and thoughts, you have are probably shared by at least the third of the people in the conversation, and so that's one facet of it, and the second part is that when you ask your question, you'll help people think about that particular issue in a in a different way than they did otherwise and instead of another perspective.
They were the first generation in their family to have gone to college, and I I'm thrilled by that, because to me, sort of that's one of the wonderful things about college education Is. It opens that you know the whole new business to you into your life into sort of possibly an opportunity.
20 percent of our students want chose to stay home like versed right off the bat And I'm, one of them that under no circumstances are we going to school because for Covid-19 for safety reasons for the for the fact that it's not worth my time to go to commute to school and many families have different reasonings of why they don't want to go to go, attend school or send their child to school.
I was prepared with what I just do with the the biography that you know of our planned speaker, but I asked if you would be willing to introduce yourself and your role at the DOE and thank you so much for stepping in, and let me just let me just say, as you appreciate- I just want to acknowledge you and the entire department of education for wrestling with, and what's been very impressive.
You know stages of the education cycle, So, just like how we're thinking, through remote learning for younger students, right, correct, One of the updates, which I'm sure you've like heard, is just this decision.
I know that the the agency is also working on just like different guidelines for families to utilize to support- You know kind of like be in sync, with some of the information that we're utilizing in terms of remote learning, and so that guidance is soon to come.
I mean I'm, trying to imagine being in your shoes and dealing with the situation and Having said that, I'm, going to give you a little personal note when I was a little kid, And I mean like five years.
Having said: that, stephanie I'm open to hearing, but I want to Actually I want to take one more second to look at the other side of this, because I understand that I mean how many students are there in our system, something like a million.
You know, sort of degree of frustration and anger, but I also want to be appropriately sympathetic and empathetic with the impossible task that the department of education has having said that stephanie.
We were collecting interests and like requests from families that needed ipads and then central office was mailing these out to individual families that shifted for the new year and that the policy for distribution is now being handled by schools.
Before, is actually, I think, at the request of school administrators that were like telling us like we're, not we're, having difficulty keeping track of who has an ipad who has a device since who doesn't because it's all being handled by the central offices, and so that has shifted for schools in the start of the school year.
These schools should be receiving support from central to think about like additional resources or where they can like use funding to purchase more devices that they then will continue to distribute right.
So, that's one thing: I did also want to share just to your point, liz about, like you, know, child care, support and It's, going to be a maximum There's, like a capacity of the students that they're that the program is going to be able to take in That's open for 3k to 8th grade students, priority given to communities that have been most affected by cova 19, essential workers in these centers that are going to be holding the learning bridges program and families in temporary housing and families that are teachers as well.
I know I've been talking to a lot of families during the summer who maybe were calling their school and weren't able to reach anyone and part of what I mentioned in those conversations.
I'm, going to say impossible challenges that you and the whole DOE team are trying to make something work that has a fundamental quality of you know when you can only have one third of the students.
The same and other things were happening to other families at the same school, which indicates that this is a systemic problem, and what I want to do is use the opportunity for you stephanie to please take some notes and bring this back to your team, because right, now, I, think new york city needs to start trusting that the agencies serving families, especially when it comes to our children, are getting this right and that the messaging is consistent in that we don't have schools telling families one thing, and then families going to any of these offices and not even being able to speak to a person and on the day of orientation.
A former public education, public school parent and I, can tell you single, Mom poor Let's work together, my office is available.
You know that some schools like have need additional support or haven't gotten the guidance around like distributions of ipads.
And, then, if they need any additional devices to work with the central office to see where they can, you know, like utilize, different resources to purchase just more ipads right, so that that's the guidance right and that's what the plan right.
So, unless, like you're hearing from like the school immediately or you're, in conversations with the teacher and need more additional support, I've shared the tech support request form right instead of there is also a number that you can call, but it's very backed up right, now.
You know with your information, the student id just like information about the ipad or the device, and then someone from our tech team will call the family.
You know within a certain amount of time, usually 48 hours or so to support them with, like a specific issue that they might be having stephanie.
Other school districts chose to reopen in a way that prioritized those students being in school five days a week full time and allowing the older students like our high school member, rami siegel, to attend remotely 100 of the time and, as we know, over 40 percent of students have chosen to attend remotely a hundred percent of the time, which fundamentally helps enable in-school learning for those who have the highest needs.
Didn't the DOE take this type of approach and whose needs did they think they were meeting by having every school go to a one two or three day a week in school, approach?
Right That, is what it feels like to me that the solution that the DOE came up with above and beyond the did they execute it in a way that enabled them to open on time that the decision itself does not meet anyone's needs quite well.
Didn't they look at those most in need of getting a problem solved and solve it for those for the youngest students and the students for whom you know trying to learn at home?
