As a little sidebar may I I've been doing. I realized I've lost track six, eight ten months almost a year now, maybe with the group over at Kohler Hospital. I do not know if you know kohler, I was not familiar with it, but it's a long air facility yeah, I'm familiar with. What did you do with them? Well, there's a there's. A program called open doors, one by run by a wonderful person named Jenny, Lee Brewster, and she introduced me to a number of people over there, including a guy named Vinnie Pierce, and a buddy of his name. Tito who've been putting on they're both quadriplegic, but they were, they were accomplished, musicians before their injury. You know from gun. Violence out on the streets and Vinnie in particular, has been running sessions to train kids in music. Now doing it remotely. He was doing it. You know, live in person, that's incredible! It's just inspiring to me and I and I tell them that I'm teasing partly, but I'm also partly serious that you know I want. I want to set a time frame say a couple years. You know to go. You know on Broadway off Broadway Carnegie hall, I'm flexible in terms of where that sounds amazing, I'm so happy to hear that music has such an important part in your life Peter, because for me it's just music. Inspired my you know activism. It inspired my interest in politics right, it's music is what inspired my parents to my mom loved hotel California by the eagles, although I do not think she was fully familiar with the context of the song itself, but she dreamt of moving to California one day and she was raised in Sudan and that's what happened she married my dad and they emigrated to California yeah wow. So music really is the reason why I'm here and we move, and I ended up moving to New York ten years ago, so it I just it's so transformational and transformative and just incredibly important and it's a shame that we do not invest more in music programs I'll. Second, that is that you courtney, is that you courtney. I know yes under Rebecca, C Wright's, I'm welcoming everybody by name, I get so excited when people show up. So I want to say hello. Sarah, I do not. I do not know that we've met, but I I thank you for joining us pause slightly. I usually start chatting even before the session starts, sort of background warming up. You know the conversation and then just so you know, I sometimes repeat a part of it when the when the sort of more formal part starts, but I mean one thing I will I will mention now and probably repeat, is I was you know, overdosed on academics way back when and I became a management consultant for at least three four decades and then about 12 years ago. I got an opportunity to start teaching and I discovered teaching is what I really like and I've been doing it at the at the college level, but I think the earlier that's where my talents are in terms of what you know something I can talk about coherently, but you know the earlier. We can support them. I think the more sort of leverage and influence we can have on their quality of their not just academic experience, but how they translate into the rest of their life, and so I am a you know, I'm a big fan and at the same time, what I found interesting was. I mean I did a lot of work with a bunch of companies. You would have heard of like Citibank and Pepsi, and I found that after I mean, depending on the particular line of business. You know after I do not know a couple weeks, I could begin being useful. It's taken me to be useful in the area of education. I think it just takes much more from me and requires much more attention to a whole bunch of areas of thinking and relating and nuance and how to convey and how to engage, but I also, I also find it you know frankly much more rewarding. So I to the extent I think, of myself as having a perfect profession. It's like I discovered a little bit later on in in my career, that teaching is very high on the list. Well, we're up to 12 that's great and it is 6:30, so I will begin a little introductory conversation. I want to welcome you all. I was just. I was just giving a little bit of background about myself, the short form, which is I discovered about a dozen or so years ago. After doing a bunch of consulting for you know decades that I had an opportunity to start teaching some college. It was actually at least one of the earlier experiences was with CUNY what they call the school of professional studies, which was an online program asynchronous and that you you'd post assignments and interact not at the same time not synchronously as they say. I want to say one of the things that really kind of thrilled me was my best student, or at least who I thought was my best. Students was a veteran who I thought was still based in Kabul Afghanistan. I did not know for sure, but the quality of his work was excellent. I mean really outstanding and you could put it right in the textbook and then, after the course was over. I got a request from one of my women's students who was actually from Pakistan who worked in the government of Pakistan and then come over to this country, and I discovered when I took a look that she'd actually done better than my friend in Afghanistan, and so you know the diversity of folks you get to work with and the quality is, is pretty exciting. Let's see I'm pausing for just a minute or two I do not. I do not see our speaker yet. As far as I can tell oh hi isabel, how are you I want to say hi to each of you, I'm not going to do it all by name, but I just want to say you know Maxwell and Tayna and Christian and Surav and Mary Cameron. I want to thank you all for joining us, so the conversation I will I will delve into the into the subject which is which is to talk about this to me amazing and challenging issue of reopening our schools in the era of comet, I should say hi to billy united around me both as well. I mean it's a large challenge. I'm pausing slightly because I find it interesting you're going to find out more about me the more time I have to talk the more you're going to find out most of it's going to be irrelevant, but that's kind of the way I. What I like to say is I is I try to prepare an advance and then I wing it you know. So whatever is going to happen this session, you know be prepared for anything, because I have not got a clue. I actually do have a few ideas. What I'm looking forward to are our speaker and I actually I need her help to pronounce her name. I want to say it's either sadie or Sadia. Kempo Amore is the director of community relations for the Department of education, so we're very sort of privileged to have her participating with us and I think she's going to lead the conversation. Otherwise we're going to talk among ourselves have a breakout group with this issue of how we, how we you know open up and the trying to do hybrid, remote versus live, is obviously a huge issue. Oh Marcos joining using welcome marco. I will say that the teaching that I did I it was it was- I did remote teaching both what they call, as I said, asynchronous, with CUNY City University of New York through the school of professional studies. Those were courses in economics beginning with macro. If anybody wants to delve into some macroeconomics, not this particular minute, but I'm just I'm just offering these little side benefits and then a little bit later on. I had the chance with another fellow to teach a program in entrepreneurship through SUNY. Stony brook and I've been very impressed at that level. With the quality of the interaction and the quality of the engagement, it depends obviously very much on the students you know to engage and you know, participate actively. I certainly think it's easier. It's an easier solution. The further one is along in one's career. I mean, I think one could do it in high school a little more well significantly more challenging than the college level, and then we go to middle school and primary school I would be. I would be a bit of a loss on how to make that all work. I'm really interested because I do not see our speaker, maybe I should have given her an extra little. I do not know cute. I just sent her the link, so hopefully she sees my email and, oh great, all good. It's a good reminder for her yeah and I invite you all. I mean I like to be very interactive, but I invite you all to think about. You know what kind of questions and issues you would have. I think my wife will pick that up. You know for her because I think that the questions and responding to our questions is, you know, makes this. It makes the session more active, brings it more alive and so on. It's always interesting when things get quiet, so I I'll, if you'll, let me interrupt for a second I'll, just remind everybody if it's their first time coming to one of Cbh's virtual meetings. I know that the borough president shared this meeting in her newsletter, so we probably have a few people who maybe are not our regulars. Everybody is muted and the way that you'll be able to you know share a comment or ask a question of the speaker is by using the raised hand, feature that can be found in the participants menu at the bottom of your screen. If you're looking for that, it looks like two little people standing next to each other has a number next to right. Now that number is 19. and if you click that button, a box will open up on your screen. That is the participants menu you'll, see everybody who's in the meeting. You'll also see a button that says raise hand. So if you just push that raise hand button, you will be brought to the top of the list and Peter, and I will see you and when it is appropriate, Peter will call on you and you'll. Be able to ask your question. Make your point that way if you're on the phone, I do not think anybody is, but it's star nine on the phone. Thank you for letting me interrupt you Peter, to give the quick little Spiel, oh good, and I do not know that I heard you say you might have, but I I'm into repeating myself anyway, so you all get used to that. One of the little tricks is when will unmutes. You also have to unmute yourself with the little a little red microphone in the lower left. Side of your screen, which would be on will be on mute until both he and you unmute yourself. In order to speak, correct, thank you and I saw Judy Schneider Welcome Judy. Thank you for joining us and I see Paige Montgomery, I'm not sure, I'm not sure if we know each other right welcome. Thank you so much for coming and Rebecca Daniel. Thank you Cosmin. I do not think we know each other again, but thank you again for coming, let's see well, I was going to speak a little bit and again I invite you even now. If you have particular issues you'd like us to cover to you, know think about that Jot down a note, but there is again I'm sure if you thought about. There are many issues to address when you're trying to reopen in this era where the health and sanitation and space social distancing issues are so you know so relevant so important, and I was speaking earlier about my own experience teaching and how much I both liked it. But how and how many dimensions in different ways that it challenged me. You know the. How do you deliver? The content is one part of it. How you engage and get the energy of the students participating is a very big part of it. They say you know. Half of half of it is the is the skill set in knowing what you want to deliver and knowing you know how to understand that from an analytic point of view, but another half of it is the I'm going to say sort of I'm not sure quite the right way to frame it but sort of the entertainment, the engagement, the keeping the energy up, keeping the interest levels and then, when I've gotten to know you a little bit I'll try to put some of that responsibility on you. So if you're not getting sufficiently entertained, then it's your turn to do what I call putting yourself on the hot seat, and you know you, instead of putting yourself making yourself a a central participant. You know in the in the conversation in this context that would that would presumably involve getting you know. Thinking of what some of the issues are that you're concerned about, I will say also given. We have a couple of minutes that next month- and this is with the help of Elizabeth rose- who, as many of you may know, has actually served in the Department of Education- has been a wonderful support and assistance to me and thinking about some of these issues that next month, on the fourth Monday, which I think is the 26th of October, we'll be having a session looking at our upper East side school this system, you know both individual schools and as a system and what the issues and challenges are not just in the next days and weeks as we open with the issue of Covid-19 and health, that's so paramount, but what we think the issues are and what our concerns are in terms of in terms of education going forward in terms of the district going forward. Ah and there's Elizabeth, I do not know if you heard me, I was just. I was just thanking you as Elizabeth for your contributions and your the thoughtful suggestions you had around this session and around engaging the schools. I I'm about to transition into teach you all entrepreneurship, which is my favorite subject. I say that somewhat lightheartedly, but what one of my life ambitions I've told myself is that everybody, hopefully at the high school level, perhaps junior senior years and definitely at the college level, have not the requirement but the opportunity to spend at least one semester focus on entrepreneurship, because in the in the school setting, we collectively you know, look to teach everyone, a basic set of skills and the ability to apply those skills in a way. That's useful and constructive, and you know in their personal lives and their careers and so on and so forth. But the thing that entrepreneurship does is it is it helps one think about. If you have an idea, it could be a business, it can be a social initiative, how you take from the conception of the idea into where and how you want to make it operational. And then you develop an action plan. Okay, what are the steps that I'm going to take to make that happen, and then you end up. The other piece you have is a road map of like targets and milestones, and so on you know. So you say you have a road map in terms of how to fulfill your initial vision and I'm finding it interesting. Let's see where we were we're at 6:43 and I'm looking forward to our you know to our speaker joining us who has a question who wants to who wants to. I do have an update from our speaker. Apparently she had not added it to her calendar and was is not at a computer right now and she's trying to get one of her colleagues to join. Oh in her dead. Yes, oh my goodness, okay, great well, okay, good! So now we're going to we're going to transition into the opportunity that this moment provides and I'm going to share another little piece of my background, which was, I had the opportunity in my in my business career to go to a large number of countries. I once counted up the number of countries I went to on behalf of Citibank and it was I remember I got up to something like 33 or 34 or 35, and you know one- third of them were all the sort of developed countries. You would immediately think about a second third: were some major countries in latin America and so on, but at least a third of them were definitely earlier. You know well ways earlier in the development you know process and one of the things I discovered. One of the benefits of that was you learn to adapt to anything you learn to you know whatever is going on, is good and fine and right, and then you find a way to create opportunity out of the circumstance. Okay, now we're going to the next part of Peter's teaching process and style, which is, and I'm not I'm not going to put you all on the spot. I only put you on the spot, romney and billy, and I'm teasing I mean it's all optional. In fact, I have a couple of mental rules, I'm doing some work also with the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House and my rule. I say that in quotes is that wherever you are is perfect and I and I mean that literally that one should not and need not be. You know sort of self- conscious or feel like they did not have the right question or what have you, because in whatever arena we're talking about here, we're talking about how to make our school system successful under duress in this particular circumstance, whatever questions and thoughts, you have are probably shared by at least the third of the people in the conversation, and so that's one facet of it, and the second part is that when you ask your question, you'll help people think about that particular issue in a in a different way than they did otherwise and instead of another perspective. As I was teaching, this came a little further along in my teaching career. I was teaching at a school that I love is a smaller school. It's not quite so well known out in Rockville Center called Malloy college, a wonderful gym. In fact, all of the teaching that I was doing and one things I loved about. It was virtually all my students were first generation college students. They were the first generation in their family to have gone to college, and I I'm thrilled by that because to me that's you know, sort of that's one of the wonderful things about college education is it opens that you know the whole new business to you into your life into sort of possibly an opportunity. The one thing I always wanted for my students was more of them that wherever they were, that they'd be willing to put themselves sort of out there. I like to say I'm good at bad analogies and one of my analogies is is being a conductor of an orchestra, and so I do not know what instrument or class of instruments you might think of yourself as, but I would say you know I whatever you are. I want more from your instruments, whether your woodwinds or percussion, or a string or you know what have you porn we need. We need more of you now you're, all very fortunate, because I there was no assignment if you're here, to listen to the presentation, we're a little surprised by the circumstance that Peter you do have a hand that is raised from romney. If you want to absolutely rob me, romney have a thought sure. So I'm a high school student and Peter is totally up to you. If you want to stop me here, do you want me to talk about what I've been experiencing at throughout the past couple days? Absolutely that would be. That would be 100 germain all right. So I go to high school called the Clinton school, it's in union square and they and so it's a public high school and it's six through twelve. So we have a middle school attached, so the it's so the way. So if you know nothing about, what's been going on recently with Covid-19 in schools, it's been totally up to schools, how they want to handle Covid-19 and their returning to school. So, for instance, the Department of Education and hopefully a speaker comes on and corrects me slash, has an official message. They are joining us shortly, great, so they submitted, so they created three plans of how students can return to the building and all of these plans included shorter school days very limited capacity and and they were based off of the five day school week. So, for instance, some of the plans had small groups of students called pods going once twice a week and then skip a week and then go back or or and there's very there's three variations of these plans that were, and the plans are confusing and not straightforward, and so but schools have the option to make their own plans, and so the requirements schools had to work around was based on the square footage of. I think it's, the average classroom size how many students were they allowed to have in the classroom, and I think the largest class size, at least in district two was like 11. Students were allowed in the classroom at the same time, and so the so the DOE also called central. It has had very little guidance on how schools should manage in- person, learning, and so one of the roblox schools were coming. Acrosss was how many teachers can I have so, if you so part of the reasons in- person learning was pushed back. If you had not heard this past two days ago, the mayor pushed back in- person. Learning was because some schools did not have enough in- person, teachers to staff their school. So if I have a, if I have a school with a couple hundred students, I might only have 40 staff members and, if nine of those staff members refuse to come to school, have medical reasons to not come to school have to take care of their families, then that school would have an extremely hard time opening. So, for instance, my school, we were short, so the number is so 20 about. 20 percent of our students want chose to stay home like versed right off the bat and I'm one of them that under no circumstances are we going to school because for Covid-19 for safety reasons for the for the fact that it's not worth my time to go to commute to school and many families have different reasonings of why they do not want to go to go, attend school or send their child to school. So and 30 of our teachers could not also go to school. So we were left with. We were left with. 70 of our teachers were able to go to school with about 80 percent of our students in school, so one so. Our principal one of the solutions, our principal came acrosss with was to hire long- term substitutes, mostly ex- teachers, teachers who had left the DOE teachers who have a teaching license but are not teaching to fill the gaps, and is that education, because we're paying we're already paying 100 of our teachers and we're buying we're paying for more teachers to staff our schools. It was. There was a lot up in the air and then the other thing we had to think about was who was actually going to show up on the first day of school, which was supposed to be today, 9 21., so so, as this continues going forward. So for my middle school and my high school, where the plan right now is to open October 1st and it's going to be limited, in- person attendance, we have four different groups, three of them will be going into school and the fourth one will be staying home and over a two week cycle. We cycle out and we inwards we're in and out of school and there's a lot of asynchronous work. So work, that's done at home, so but my school, they realized that. How was it possible to have all of our students be taught when we were short nine percent of our teachers? So so what they decided was that students that were going into school, so any student that was going in, would be have a laptop at the school and they would be on zoom calls and classes at school in a classroom with teachers and with no lunch break very limited bathroom access, because the does Covid-19 rules not allowed to leave the classrooms and to keep pods isolated from each other. And if you think about that, how does that make sense? But if I'm doing the same thing at school that I can do exactly at home in a safer way. Why would I go to school, and so part of the thing is that it's social, emotional learning so school is very important for bonding and in- person contact speaking with teachers and peers. So that was definitely something that the DOE really needed to address so, and I do think, although personally I do not 100 agree with the mayor's plans, I do think one of his good one of the best things that have come out of him. Delaying school was his plan to open in a staggered way to make sure that district 75. So today, district 75, 3-K and pre- k opened up and the pictures are astounding. I would definitely go on twitter and look at some of the pictures that were released from the first day of school and those are our most important students because in this scenario, because those are the students that really need that in- person bond thing. So if you're, if you're a pre- k or a kindergartner, you really, you can't sit at home in front of the computer all day, it's inhumane! You can't it's very difficult to do that, even as a high schooler, I hate sitting in front of the computer all day and I'm sure most of you adults also agree that it's very difficult to sit on a zoom call, and so I do think that they should that the deal we should address. So look. I have x amount of district 75 schools. I have x amount of pre- k, so I have x amount of 3-Ks and these schools are struggling. Where can I find space that has room to open up for district 75, 3-K pre- k and frankly, I think the solution is high schools, because, as a high school student, although I think it's important to go to school, I do not think high school is a priority. At the moment, high school is was one of the most successful high schools were able to, for the most part, successfully able to pivot to remote learning, and I and pre- kers in elementary schoolers need the priority there. So it was just something to think about and then, as schools start opening up as so, I believe next Monday is the 20. I do not know what the date is, but is when elementary schoolers open up, and so I speak for myself- I'm not speaking for anyone else, but I would happily give up even the opportunity to go into school if it meant every elementary schooler in below in district 75 was able to go to school every student in every grade and because, frankly, though, that that's those are the students that really rely on school, I'm fine with getting my remote assignments like and many students are too because frankly, going into school now is going to be remote assignments at school, with a higher risk of Covid-19 higher infection rate and will lead the frankly lead the city into another scenario, like we added back in March with extremely high Covid-19 infection rates, mostly based from schools and workplaces, I see hands so romney. I do not want to interrupt you and I do see. People are chatting me remember to raise your hand if you have a question, but I do see that our speaker from the DOE is here, and I want to be conscious of her time. So please Peter Stephanie. Are you there? Yes Stephanie, please join us. I was prepared with what I just do with the the biography that you know of our planned speaker, but I asked if you would be willing to introduce yourself and your role at the DOE and thank you so much for stepping in and let me just let me just say, as you appreciate, and I think everybody here on this zoom, you know call Appreciate, there's a lot of adapting on the fly and you know I do not want to make light of it. I do not necessarily want to make it. You know sort of right, but I, but I I'm always looking for silver linings and romney. I want to thank you for stepping in and offering your perspective, and so I will say I want to thank you Stephanie for stepping in. I just want to acknowledge you and the entire department of education for wrestling with, and what's been very impressive to me is that agree to which you collectively from the from the chancellor of Carranza. All the way down have put so much energy into outreach into communicating. You know letting people know what's going on. So having said that, I will defer to you know: please help us. You know, provide your perspective on this incredible transition and I'm going to do one more thing in terms of silver linings. You know in life. What did they say? There's that phrase that says you know life is what happens when you have other plans, things happen, things show up and we learn to adapt, and so I'm hopeful that, although in certain areas it may be hard to do quite as much in terms of specific skill, you know training and learning that people will be taking away a different skill set. That is also hugely valuable, which is adapting to unusual circumstances and that will carry them forward in their lives. Having said that, Stephanie I defer to you. Thank you Peter and thank you everyone. Yes, my name is Stephanie Barretolastra. I think you know my our director and Colleague Sadie Gambomod was scheduled to come and present with you all. There was something that happened very last minute and she was not able to attend. So yes, I'm happy to fill in. The one caveat I will say is that you know I do not have her presentation, so I do not I'm not as entirely prepared as she was I'm sure to give you kind of some of the more detailed updates. That's that I did want to make sure to be here and collect any kind of like questions and feedback that you're seeing on this first day of of virtual learning for everyone. So yeah I mean like I'm, I think, being that this is like a last- minute shift. I'm definitely more interested in getting any kind of like questions or feedback from you all and sharing what I know at the moment and if not, of course, following up with any information that I do not have well, I have some thoughts about things that people may want to hear. And yes, we totally appreciate that this is this is stepping in and again I think it's very much and I'm going to say the spirit of the times and again. So thank you for that. So I have you know three or four topics and then, as soon as people have questions that they want to add, you know, please put them in the chat, but the first question would be something: do not throw them in the chat. You'll call on them by raising hand, do not put them in the chat. Oh correction, as I just have to say, do not put them in the chat. I'll call you when you raise your hand, what was it was the nature of the challenge between, say. You know pre- k, then primary and middle school and high school and as romney was suggesting, but I and I had this thought myself, having done some teaching, both synchronous and asynchronous remotely, but at the college level that it's much more of a challenge in the early years. To think that you know remote learning can work and much more plausible. You know when you get into the high school years. So can you begin to share with how the department is grappling with those different challenges at different? You know stages of the education cycle yeah so just like how we're thinking, through remote learning for younger students right, correct, so yeah. One of the updates, which I'm sure you've like heard, is just this decision that was made to kind of make sure that everyone who's been 100 remote learning. All students were signed up to receive a 100, remote learning are getting live instruction every day and their the amount of live instruction is going to be going up throughout the month right, but there is kind of like a baseline that students will be receiving starting. You know today, so if you just give me one second, I'm just trying to pull up the exact amount right. So just in terms of yeah live instruction, or you know what some of you may have heard: synchronous and asynchronous, but basically live instruction. You know what we're doing right now in real time and then, in addition to kind of obviously like small projects and pre- recorded videos that are up for students to utilize, but really the live. Instruction rate is just like really helpful in like building and building that relationship and kind of like interacting live with, like the students online and so for students in 3-K and pre- k, students are going to be receiving up to 30, so as of September, as as, like the first day of classes, up to 30 minutes of instruction per day live this. We expect to go up in the coming months, obviously, as like things, get adjusted and settled, and at the school level, and then for students in kindergarten to second grade they'll, be receiving 65 minutes up to up to from 65 minutes to 95 minutes of instruction live instruction, and then students in grade 3 to 5:90 to 110 minutes of live instruction. Something that's also counted in. There is the kind of like the just a limit in like the amount of continuous live instruction. Right will be divided per grade level, so the younger students won't be expected to stay on live instruction for a full hour, because we know that obviously there's just a shorter attention span developmentally. But you know the older this they get the more that will increase. So that's one thing that I can share for sure. I know that the the agency is also working on just like different guidelines for families to utilize to support- and you know kind of like be in sync, with some of the information that we're utilizing in terms of remote learning, and so that guidance is soon to come. I think, and I'm sure we'll share it out as soon as it's finalized I did. We did get one suggestion which I thought was interesting and useful. If there are any people here on, you know, in the conversation who are parents who would be interested in sharing, you know their son or daughter, sons or daughters. You know experience maybe going back to last spring and also in this period of transition, we'd be interested in hearing from you and I do see. I do see a hand from the person whose first name is apparently iphone. So do you want to yeah iphone? Yellow, oh, is that liz? Who is that is that you just were unmuted. If you want to announce your name, Liz connolly- oh great, thank you Liz hi Peter. I must say that after the last couple of days I I've calmed down a bit okay, but the doa has aged me about 50 years. Okay seriously, I am going to give you just a tip of what we went through. I think it's the disgrace. The way the Department of Education has handled everything. The chancellor is useless. Since August 19th, my daughter, I helped raise my grandson, who just entered kindergarten. Okay was tr had registered for an ipad okay, she did it about several times the Dle finally answered on August in August telling her to reach out to the school the school has them. The principal is calling us telling all the parents to purchase our own ipads or devices and to purchase a hotspot that the Doa has not delivered anything. I call to 311. I called the Department of education, at least because I was on vacation a couple of weeks. I called them at least 50 times all the all. The response I got was I'm sorry we're very busy today. Please call back later. Okay or constant ringing, I then called the superintendent's office. All of them have the same phone number, with the exception of one and the recording I got is hi. You have reached the please press, one, two, three four or five. I pressed one two, three four and five each time and do you know what the message was press one hi. You have read that please press one, two, three, four, five, okay, I said. Maybe that's gone press two same thing. They do not even have a legitimate message: okay, not even a legitimate message. I then called Scott Stringer's office to no avail. Okay. I then called Carolyn Maloney's office just one day to no avail who she normally responds, and then I thought you know what on my way home from work, I passed Rebecca C Wright's office every day. I have no idea if she's, even in my district, I was so desperate for help. I was just so frustrated. I believe I did not even get her name right. I forgot her name, her assistant Marcia or, whatever I told her, the situation I was having and she told me that she would reach out to somebody etc. So there I was waiting for her to give me a phone number and she said no. I will take care of this myself. Do you mind if I give your email and phone number? I said by all means, within an hour and a half later, okay, the President's borough's Manhattan's office called okay with a really kind woman named Isabelle. I told her the story. I could not believe that someone actually listened and called me. Okay, within that shortest amount of time. Okay, she reached out to her superiors who then Kant and Isabelle called me back at five o'clock to. Let me know that vanessa, the director of budget and capitalism call me back at eight o'clock at night. Okay, I'm going, but these people care the department of education. Does it? Okay, you want to be good, wait. Okay, I had to go through all this waste hours and hours and weeks with you. Okay, we finally got a laptop. The laptop do not work anyway, he's using my ipad, it's not a thing. The problem is you keep canceling school you're doing this you're doing that you're not prepared? Okay, where are these people going to put their children? Okay, I had to take off work. My daughter has to take over. She may lose her job. Nobody is taking into consideration child's care. This is not one of two days. This is going on weeks and weeks and weeks, and we have to take off from work for a 30 minute lesson then you're off then the kids off an hour, then another 30 minute lesson. It's ridiculous. The learning bridge is closed down a week liz. I hear what you're saying and I actually really appreciate your you're sharing that and I'm I mean I'm trying to imagine being in your shoes and dealing with the situation and frankly, I fully understand and get your level of frustration and indeed anger. Having said that, I'm going to give you a little personal note when I was a little kid and I mean like five years old, I must have known there was some tension in my family household, because, literally at the age of five, I decided my job was to keep the family together. Now, I'm going to give you some good News, I was not successful about five years later, my father moved out about five years after that they separated and divorced and do not feel bad. For me that was actually a good solution, but I want to keep to the scent that we can. I want to. I want to see what we can find in terms of opportunities and possibilities to make things work, and I- and I do want to acknowledge both you for reaching out to our elected officials, and I do not know if you've noticed, but there's a person and I'd embarrass her. If I told her how wonderful I thought she is that you mentioned who came to your assistance and I've gotten to know Isabelle very well, Isabelle is one of the she is the woman of the year. Absolutely, and I won't. I won't, spend the rest of the session talking about how wonderful she is, but she has me thinking about how we can collaborate with community board 11 and make things work, not just in our district, but in that district, where they have even more issues around some of these things. Having said that, Stephanie I'm open to hearing, but I want to actually I want to take one more second to look at the other side of this, because I understand that I mean how many students are there in our system, something like a million. I actually do not know the number, but it's a very large number, and I recognize that as Rami was saying and as you know, and as we all know, there are they're trying to teach both live and remotely, at the same time, they're trying to deal with the fact that not everybody, even in the staff and the teachers can show up. They have a problem, that's frankly, beyond any reasonable or plausible solution. So I want to be empathetic not just with your concern and you're absolutely appropriate. You know sort of degree of frustration and anger, but I also want to be appropriately sympathetic and empathetic with the impossible task that the Department of Education has having said that Stephanie. Would you like to share some thoughts and research yeah, no yeah? Thank you Liz for sharing that, and you know, I think, I'm hearing a nickel. You know I've been speaking with a lot of parents all day and yeah. Your sentiments are obviously echoed acrosss the city right. It's been an incredibly difficult day for a lot of families, just a lot of like everything from like not having you know devices yet to like having issues and connectivity. So I just you know first want to acknowledge how incredibly difficult and frustrating that is, and so just want to hold space for that. But I also did want to kind of make sure that there are to share a little bit of background on like the device distribution in general. So, as you all know, or you might know back in March through June, you know when we had to close schools. You know close down schools because of Covid-19 we distributed. We were collecting interests and like requests from families that needed ipads and then central office was mailing these out to individual families that shifted for the new year and that the policy for distribution is now being handled by schools. Now I also want to add the schools. We've been asking schools to do a lot and so for one reason or another. Some schools have have had challenges doing this right and the reason why schools were asked to do the distribution instead of having central send out the ipads, as was being done before, is actually, I think, at the request of school administrators that were like telling us like we're, not we're, having difficulty keeping track of who has an ipad who has a device since who does not, because it's all being handled by the central offices, and so that has shifted for schools in the start of the school year. That being said, I want to 100 acknowledge that, like that has not been smooth and that a lot of families still have trouble accessing that, but I just wanted to add some context into some of the confusion that has been happening. Schools are also now doing an inventory or had been doing an inventory of both like ipads that their students had that their current students have that they received from central plus devices that they had in stock pre- covered right. So those are the laptops or things that they already had and that they gave out and part of this kind of, like guidance for them to redistribute. We've asked them to. You know, get an inventory of the ipads and other devices that they have and then prioritize giving ipads, which now have hotspots for internet to families that do not have internet right and then like give families that maybe do have a like Wi- fi connection at home, but do not have a device give them the like, maybe laptop, that they have. That does not have a hotspot. That said, I know that has not been smooth, but again, I just wanted to add some context to that. What I shared with will, which I'm sure he'll shout out in a little bit, is just like the device request form that many of you have probably seen already. I want to share that this is the general device request form it's the same, one that was being used last year when we closed in March last school year, but schools are still receiving information from that request form right. So I definitely want to encourage anyone who still needs an ipad or even, if you like, maybe you know, talk to the school about it and talk down the phone with someone but have not filled out that request form yet to fill it out. There is still, if you fill it out today, there's still going to be some delay in when you get it right, but schools are going to be distributing their yes, the guidance is that they will be distributing like devices both a mix of ipads and devices that they already have. Some schools may have already reached that capacity right, they've, given out everything that they have. These schools should be receiving support from central to think about like additional resources or where they can like use funding to purchase more devices that they then will continue to distribute right. This is all happening in real time, so I do want to acknowledge that as of today, probably all students who have requested it probably have not gotten it yet. So that's one thing. I did also want to share just to your point Liz about child care support and then, like the big need that exists in like communities and families, there is a Learning Bridges program that is like just starting up. It's gradually been taking in students and seats starting this week. There is a priority for those seats. It's going to be a maximum there's like a capacity of the students that they're that the program is going to be able to take in it's a program. That's open for 3-K to 8th grade students, priority given to communities that have been most affected by Cova 19, essential workers in these centers that are going to be holding the Learning Bridges program and families in temporary housing and families that are teachers as well. That's like are working at the DOE, so I just also wanted to share that again. It's not. It does not solve for the like. I think the just a large need that exists for like child care at this moment, but it is just a resource that I wanted to make sure that you all had and then yeah and then to the other point Liz I mean I've been talking also to you trying to communicate with districts and schools. I mean. I know I've been talking to a lot of families during the summer who maybe were calling their school and were not able to reach anyone and part of what I mentioned in those conversations is that a lot of administrators were not in the building during the summer right. So if and even now, when some administrators and staff are back in the building, remember we're trying to keep capacity. You know fairly low, and so you know the communication over the phone if it was not easy before it's like it's just even more challenging now. So what I've been encouraging, you know everyone is just to communicate via email as much as much as possible, and you know if you need contact information for the schools for your district. You know on our website. We have or find the school find my school link where you can type in like your school, your district, and you should get a list of emails for principal down to parent coordinator and District office, superintendents, family leadership, coordinators and everyone else. Thank you and I want to acknowledge at the same time that I fully appreciate and thank Liz for expressing with passion the breakdowns that she's been experiencing, which are almost beyond comprehension. I do want to it's just my nature. I want to acknowledge the I'm going to say impossible challenges that you and the whole DOE team are trying to make something work that has a fundamental quality of you know when you can only have one third of the students. You know in a classroom that you had you know six months ago there are going to be. You know breakdowns in terms of trying to develop the transition into something that works. Having said that, I see I want to begin to accept these questions. Laura Greger has a question: will you just have to confirm there? You go you're unmuted Laura yeah, so you have to unmute with a little. No she's unmuted, we just can't hear her. Oh, is that right, okay, hi, laura! We can't hear you yet. I do not know. Why make sure you have a microphone turned on if you go to your audio settings with the little box next to the mute sign, you can check your audio settings, but you may want to come back to Laura yeah. Should we go we're going to we're going to jump over you for a second liz and go to Isabelle, and I will come back to you is that is that acceptable? I do want to hear again but isabel. You had a thought or comment. You want to share and I'm going to embarrass you. I've seen the degree to each you engage and go way out of your way to unreasonable limits to support people in need because you care so incredibly- and I just want to thank you for who you are now your thought. Thank you so much! Yes, you always embarrass me, but thank you and so greetings everybody and Liz. Thank you! So much for reaching out to rebecca C Wright's office assembly, women's City Rights office. I love working with them and Peter. You know it. We we make a good team following up on issues of all kinds and Madison Thomas was the person from Rebecca City, Rights Office, who reached out to me, after speaking with you and Vanessa Diaz Lopez, our director of budget, who, I think is joining this school shortly. If she has not yet. I want to thank you liz because you called us not only about your specific situation, but you did not forget to mention that this was happening the same and other things were happening to other families at the same school, which indicates that this is a systemic problem, and what I want to do is use the opportunity for you stephanie to please take some notes and bring this back to your team, because right now I think New York City needs to start trusting that the agencies serving families, especially when it comes to our children, are getting this right and that the messaging is consistent in that we do not have schools telling families one thing, and then families going to any of these offices and not even being able to speak to a person and on the day of orientation. There should be no reason why a child in New, York City, does not have a learning device, and I do know it is one of the largest educational systems in the probably the planet. It is a segregated system. It is not an equal system. We know this. We have been knowing this and the problem that I'm having and I'm sorry, because I am a community liaison, I'm passionate, sometimes and get, and I cross the line- and I am out of my lane. Sometimes- and probably this is one of those situations, but I'm also a parent and one thing from working in communities that you must evolve with communities and you have a segregated system with a lot of single parents, single moms and one thing you learn from single moms and I think everybody that works with families. One thing that you can learn from single moms is be proactive, prepare and you're, always looking for what's on sale, when one season is about to end to save it for next year. What I've noticed with the Department of education is like there's no learning from the families that you're working with, because the whole summer, the whole summer. You had agencies and families reaching out to you and to wait for the day of the reopening for many of these families, not to have the resources that they needed for what is a human right education for our children, which is important because it has been ingrained in our minds that in this country to make it you need an education. Well for many of us, the tools are not there and it's not because we do not care about children, it's because our systems are failing. So please take note because, what's going to happen, when it's get cold, it gets cold and students are not going to be able to go outside. So I'm in the community, I'm in East Harlem, and I'm telling you that we have not we're having to chase people to clean the areas where our children are now having to spend time because we're still fighting a pandemic. We have been fighting this pandemic out for six plus months now and that we are not ready for a reopening. It's really embarrassing. So my question is: do you have a plan for when, in a large education system, when you get defective devices, you have a plan? You have a stockpile of this devices that can be deployed so that we make sure nobody is missing education, not everybody, can go and buy an ipad. I'm telling you, because right now I have neighbors who have not been able to pay rent because the restaurant, where they worked, are not open at 100. So the needs are real and our responsibility is to make sure that when these needs come to our radar, we have the resources, because we are New York City and we can do this, so we need to start being more morally imaginative and I'm sorry it's a long lecture. I apologize, but I'm a former public education, Public school parent and I can tell you single, mom poor and I can tell you this is real and it causes unnecessary anxiety. So we need to get together. Let's work together, my office is available. My colleague vanessa is available. We are more than happy to collaborate, but we need to start finding solutions with what's happening. Now and then we need to prepare for the fires that are going to come up when it gets cold. Winter is coming okay, game of thrones, but winter is coming. What are we going to do? Yeah they're going to fail? What are we going going to do? Yeah? No, I hear you and thank you for sharing that yeah. Like I mentioned earlier schools right now, there is like guidance, and I'm I hear you and I understand that guidance is not reaching all schools right, and that is something that, like has been flagged and like. We will continue to flag with, like our department. You know that some schools like have need additional support or have not gotten the guidance around like distributions of ipads. What schools and some schools have done and should be doing, is like collecting an inventory of what they have and prioritizing those hotspot ipads for families that do not have Wi-, fi and other devices for families. If you have Wi- fi and then if they need any additional devices to work with the central office to see where they can, you know like utilize, different resources to purchase. Just more ipads right so that that's the guidance right and that's what the plan right. I'm not saying that the plan is working because clearly we're hearing from a lot of families that it's not, but that is kind of like what we're the structure that we're working in right now. What I also wanted to share just in terms of like what happens if a device does not work right and like where are we going to? What are we going to do then? What I just like for basic things right like my internet, is not working like. I have not been able to like download this like application, and I know that also today, there were like a lot of kind of like technical issues, especially with was just like signing into the to the platform right. So unless, like you're hearing from like the school immediately or you're, in conversations with the teacher and need more additional support, I've shared the tech support request form right instead of there is also a number that you can call, but it's very backed up right now. So what I've been sharing primarily with families, is to fill out this tech support request form. You know with your information, the student I d, just like information about the ipad or the device, and then someone from our tech team will call the family you know within a certain amount of time, usually 48 hours or so to support them with, like a specific issue that they might be having stephanie. So let me just ask to be clear: it is this to access this tech support team. You may have, you may have said it explicitly, but I did not catch it. I assume that's is that through the DOE website, and could you would this be appropriate will to put in the in the chat an indication of yeah? So I just heard it well, I think just shared it in the chat yeah I just shared it with will a little bit of yeah, so it should be in the chat. It's also in the website. Thank you yes and so yeah, it's! You know it asks you basic information about the student. I d, you know it kind of guides you where to go, get the serial number and the icc. I d number for the ipad. If you have it, but if you do not have it that's also fine, and then you get a confirmation, email saying that, like we received your request, form you're in line to be called by one of our tech support staff. Okay, great Laura, can you can you now speak? Can we hear you there's a second furman hello? Yes, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm a single mother, but I'm also running like an it shop. I have multiple devices, so I forgot I was on an old ipad when I tried to reach out to you and I'm just on different devices right now, so you know keep in mind when they ask you to submit a request. You would need to have some kind of electronic device to submit that request and then, when they get back to you takes forever. So I'm my daughter's a high school student, I have to say Liz you're like her hero because she was crying laughing and I'm sorry, the other mother that just spoke. There is so much frustration and because the plan keeps changing, there has been no plan and then the evolving plan- and you know the mulgrew- has been pushing back about opening the schools for months and he keeps- and he has a point he said we can not trust the DOE, because the plans have not worked. The plans have not been executed. You keep changing every few minutes. You know the estimate is that for the hybrid plan that they proposed to the different schools, all of a sudden, they would need 10,000 more teachers, and where are they going to produce this? So at the 11th hour, then it's like okay, it's not going to be in person. There really is no extrapolation of what the needs are to the different plans that are evolving and yes, some students do not feel comfortable going to school and allowing all these multiple plans that are very confusing is very hard for anybody. I am a single parent, but it's fine, my daughter's in high school and we have resources, so we do not feel the pain, but I am on a board of counseling in schools. I do a lot of things with different schools. The administration, my daughter school, has been amazing, but they are exhausted. They're, not saying it they're very positive, but every few days they re- engineer a whole plan. They realign everything. They have everything they've measured every classroom. They have checked all the ventilation, it's fortunately an old school, so they have big windows. They can open the windows, they have teachers that are energetic. They want to go back to the school. They've tried to accommodate everything, and yet then they can not open against all of a sudden, these constantly changing and impossible. So, although there is this new plan, nobody has faith that this plan is going to work any better than any of the other failed plans and there's so much money, that's being thrown into it, and we see all the kids that are going to private school. I see the kids in uniform. I live acrosss the street from saying Vincent. Farah I've been begging, my daughter, can you please? Can you please go to I'll pay for private school I'll go to long island? I do not want to abandon New York City. I my family has lived here for over 100 years and gone to the public schools. We do not want to give up, but all the money that's being spent and all the people are trying to supposedly help and still nothing is really happening. So now, I'm starting to sound like every other frantic parent and it's just, I do not think anybody's hearing it and the money keeps going into the pit and the mayor and the chancellor keep talking in circles and the teachers Union has control. So that's all I have to say I do not really have the answers. I guess the only answer that I would have is let individual schools let the principals run, what they're doing, because the principals know what they're doing and the teachers know what they're doing the DOE has no clue what they're doing the chancellor has no interest in the kids. The union does just wants the dues from its members and they know that the teachers do not have to pay membership, so they've got to make themselves valuable and we are all victims of what is happening, and it's all political I want. I want to jump in for a second. I again, I admire and appreciate your energy. The word vigor is coming to mind, but maybe that's an understatement. Having said that, I also want to be because I'm trying to keep the family together. You know that's my role from the age five. I want to be sympathetic to Stephanie's position and the whole DOE team's position. I understand, there's breakdown, guess what you know in a lot of the countries where I did my work. There were always breakdowns. You know in many countries actually breakdowns were maybe at least as frequent as things work. Having said, I, what I am looking for is how we make a constructive conversation of this, and I do think part of the constructive conversation and thank you Stephanie for being willing to listen to. It is the extreme and understandable frustration of people whose legitimacy, so, how do we do it? We get rid of the chancellor get him out of here hold on hold on. You could have had enough time enough time. There's been enough time Peter. I let you register that point, but do me a favor, I got it the first time you said it and Stephanie got it the first time you said it and Stephanie can in an appropriate sense and I'm sympathetic to her situation, register the frustration and the failures. I I'm not in a position to suggest that the the chancellor ought to be fired. You might be right what I do think we can do out of it. What I thank Stephanie for being here is to register the specific nature of the breakdown right. Yes, and I'm going to suggest something beyond that. So, okay, if devices is a breakdown and clearly it is, and that was going to happen. I mean, even if you know, but Peter you realize his devices have been a breakdown since March, I'm not shocked. Are you shocked? I'm not shocked. I get that. I'm not shocked, that's why they never bother trying to get a device, but yes, since March so everybody's aware stringer talks about how much he paid on this. Yes and what I think part of the frustration is even when the assist of the DOE tried to put in some processes to solve that problem. Part of what happened was it was not up to the scale that it needed and people were set up with unrealistic expectations. I.E. You know the sense that broken promises. I apologize you. This is what you think. I have worked on a hotline to try to help other parents. So before you form your opinion, you need the facts. We're trying to tell you our opinion, we're not asking you to diagnose right now, you're collecting information. So before we spend a lot of time about what you think has happened, we can give you the feedback. We can give you the information or you can get other ways, but we can not yes, so I can tell you what happened. A lot of the devices were broken. The internet was cut off. I can tell you in a lot of different places. We do not have to do that in this call. If that's what you want, there are a lot of people that can give you that information and the DOE knows that information too Laura. Here, here's all I'm trying to do I'm just a body with two arms and two legs and one brain trying to find a way to make a constructive conversation. Out of this call, that's all I want. I do not know what that should look like. I've never dealt with a situation myself, you know so, but I again I I'm here where I'm coming from is to welcome even in what shall I say, you know it hot communications, the frustration that people like you and Liz connolly are experiencing, because I think that's useful information. I'm not I'm not sure the heat necessarily helps, but definitely the content helps and I'm sympathetic to the heat, because I'd be hot too, so I'm not going to I'm not going to you know challenge somebody for the temperature they're at. I would be probably my wife says: I'm like this until I go like this, I probably yeah than you, but I do not but yeah. I was not hot. What do you think? What do you think in like three sentences? What do you think is the most useful use of this time in terms of Peter Stephanie Peter, I'm so sorry it interrupts, because I just I only have like a couple like about 10 minutes or less right to be here. So I just I did want to quickly respond to that Laura and, like yeah, I mean listen. I think yeah. At the end of the day that frustration is more than valid and I think you're right. We need to continue hearing the issues that are happening on the ground and I can't promise you that I'm going to have the answers for you right now, but I did want to share my my email address just like if things, if there's information, that's not getting through. If there's questions that you have, if there's things that you're trying to escalate, you know you all have a bunch of resources and scenes and people that you already are getting that support for. But please include me in one of those you know and I'll do my very best to support in a process that I hear and completely acknowledge has been very confusing and not and yeah, and it has caused like a lot of the things for a lot of fun yeah and I'm not asking for help. I'm asking for the DOE get out of the way and let the schools do what they do best, because there's not any value being added and I'm not hot, I'm just telling you this is I've been watching this since March and it's my opinion and that's it and Peter, I'm not asking for help, I'm just expressing it, and I do not think that the value is there. That's all great. I appreciate that. Thank you know. I'd spend my money somewhere else. I'd get rid of a lot of the people in the doa and invest in teachers. I I'd like to know. Are there other people who have something I'd like to communicate to Stephanie before she has to leave in a few minutes? You have two people who have not spoken yet, who have their hands raised, Elizabeth, Rose and Sarah Salsman? Did you want to speak? Elizabeth I'd, be delighted to hear what you have to say. I do thank you because Peter you and I could not think more differently about this situation or the what we can accomplish on this call. So we had a member of our board, who is a high school student speaking stephanie, while we were waiting for you and he raised two very interesting things that I'd like to hear your response to. The first is the question of what are all of the teachers who have received accommodations so that they no longer are coming to schools. What are all of those teachers assigned to do so that that's the first one? Can you please address that sure, and I'd have to confirm just like additional details on this, but the last I heard the teachers who asked for accommodations to work from home should be the teachers that are supporting with remote learning. Okay, that's what I hoped the answer would be, and I would hope that all teachers who are getting paid are in fact teaching, because clearly the strong need is for staff. At this point. The second is, you know to the issues of how you know, part of the reason that the mayor has been so interested in reopening schools is to enable parents to go back to work and to enable the New York City economy to restart well, who are the parents who have the greatest needs to go back to work? I mean to have their children back in school. Those are parents of very young children for whom remote learning does not work very well. Parents of special needs students, parents whose home situations are more precarious, whether that is the homeless students, the doubled up students and so forth. Other districts have recognized that and made their school reopening prioritize five day a week. In- person instruction for the youngest students and the students for whom learning from home does not work, for whatever reason, whether that is that they are homeless, they do not have broadband access, they are very young and remote learning does not work or their home itself is small and overcrowded and have multiple students trying to learn at the same time or families of single parents where the parent needs to go back to work, and there is nobody available to take care of the child. Other school districts chose to reopen in a way that prioritized those students being in school five days a week full time and allowing the older students, like our high school member, rami Siegel, to attend remotely 100 of the time and, as we know, over 40 percent of students have chosen to attend remotely a hundred percent of the time, which fundamentally helps enable in- school learning for those who have the highest needs. Why did not the DOE take this type of approach and whose needs did they think they were meeting by having every school go to a one two or three day a week in school approach? From my perspective- and I my I am a brand new empty nester, my youngest child just left for college, but from my perspective, the Doe's choice about how they reopen schools literally did not meet any family's needs, and I honestly, if I still had a child in school in K to 12, I can not imagine how this would have worked for our kids and I do not blame all of the families who are finding any alternative possible, whether that is private school moving out of district sending kids, you know to the grandparents house, whatever it is so whose needs did the daw feel that this approach was meeting, and why did not they consider alternatives or what was the thinking around alternatives that would have prioritized in- person learning five days a week for the highest need students yeah? No, those are all excellent questions. Elizabeth like to be perfectly transparent and honest with you, I'm not. I personally do not have insight into like what those like specific the specific thought process was around it. I know that it has been an incredibly complex, yeah decision- making process and that there are but yeah we're one of the most diverse cities in the country with diverse needs right and yeah. I think that there clearly was a lot of room for improvement, so yeah, but I hear you on that a little bit. I hear that like right now at this moment, it feels like this is not necessarily answering the complete needs of any one particular group yep. That is what it feels like to me that the solution that the DOE came up with above and beyond the did they execute it in a way that enabled them to open on time that the decision itself does not meet anyone's needs quite well made. Thank you, Elizabeth really. Thank you. I thought that was excellent feedback. I do not know if Stephanie can have influence to make it operational. But having said that, I know if you still have a few minutes to listen. I think Sarah Salzman was interested in speaking yeah. I think I have time for one more question: hi, I'm Sarah, I'm also a high school student and luckily, like I'm in a house that I have my own room and I have a desk and I'm a computer, I'm very fortunate to not face a lot of the struggles that I know some of you guys have spoken about, but I feel like we have not received any like super clear answers on the DOE, because it obviously seems to be everything seems to be very flawed. So I was just wondering if you knew what the Doe's next steps were to start to improve this yeah to improve this mess. Yeah. No, I hear you Sarah, I mean, I think, there's just a lot of different, like initiatives that are happening right now, but yeah in terms of yeah we're getting a lot of feedback right and what I can promise you right now is just like the information and the feedback that I'm getting here to just share it out with, like my team and others, I think, depending on the issue, you know I can maybe speak more specifically on, like just you know whether it's like ipads or I can try to find out more specifically what the next steps are, but yeah. I think right now. The big priority is just like making sure that we have enough resources and stuff to open in person in a couple of days or weeks depending on the grade level yeah. But I hear what I'm hearing Sarah from your comments. At least. Is that like there needs to be a more and for many of you right that there needs to be a more concerted effort to make sure it's to actually include the feedback and voices of families and students as they're making these decisions. These policy decisions right. I also think thank you for that. I just was also wondering. Do you think that the DOE? Well then, it's up to the mayor, but do you think that school will be pushed back when the time comes, October 1st, because just like it was last week yeah I mean, unfortunately, I do not have I'm not privy to kind of like that kind of foresight right now. I think what I can see from my perspective is that everything you know everyone is working their hardest to try to make that possible, but yeah. So I'm not. I mean, I think the hope is yes to start October first and to do the gradual reopening and the way that we've like laid it out, which October 1st is actually not for everyone. It's depending on the grade level. I mean I'm happy to share out more of those timelines, for you will so you can share it out to everyone but yeah. I think the hope is to have that happen, but I think, as we all know, there's been last- minute, pivots yeah, thank you, but thank you all. I really appreciate kind of all the feedback, and you know I'm you know I think, like part of my job is also to hold space and to listen right. So that's primarily what I hope to come here and do I did. You know want to make sure that you all have my contact information for any additional kind of like questions or just additional feedback that you want to kind of like share with me, so I can share out as well and then you know anything. You know that I shared, but you know I've shared a lot of the links already as well, so you should have them, but I can make sure to follow up over email as well and yeah, and you know happy to come back in the other future meeting, whether myself or someone on my team stephanie I want to I want to thank you for you know, for I know you're, you know stepping into a situation as the whole department is that's very challenging. I do think the the and I appreciate your appreciating the feedback that you got because it was. It was high on the temperature scale, but I think it was also on point in the in the substance scale. I think the notion of alternative solutions such as Elizabeth was proposing are very interesting. I also recognize you know, even if you're, not the chancellor, for you or the chancellor, it would be a challenge to implement those solutions, although I think they're worth considering. Having said that, I want to, I want to thank you for stepping into a warm and candid conversation as they as they tend to say, and I and I really appreciate your engagement participation and doing because I know I I'm sure, not just you, but the entire DOE team, whether it's on target or off target and listen. We've all made mistakes in our lives. You know you do not need to hear about mine, but trust me. You know I've got I've got my list also, and this is an extraordinary and difficult situation. So thank you for you know getting there pitching in and doing what you can. No, of course thank you all for everything you're doing as well. Great thank you can have a good night. I'm not going to ask the meeting to end yet we, although probably end in a little bit, but if people want to make additional comments around me. I want to thank you Sarah Laura Liz. I want to thank, I want to thank all of you, for you know for your candor and absolutely it is as frustrating as you describe, and so I think the heat of the communications is, you know entirely understandable and I could propose that Liz, Laura and Elizabeth become consultants to the Department of education, so they rethink. You know from an approach, and I had not thought about this and I'm not trying to be hard on the Department of Education. I think the observation that it, what they seem to try to do, was partially solve everyone's problem. What they did not do is fully solve anyone's problem, and that leaves a lot of people, maybe bordering on the large proportion of people in some version of a very difficult situation. Having said that, I also want to recognize the other side, which is it is in certain measures. You know even just solving the technology and the distribution of devices problem. It's a large challenge. On the other hand, if you do not create solutions that, at least in some time frame actually solve the problem, the problem is only going to persist so the incomplete and in many cases, what turned out to be inaccurate communications and the changing rules of the game is understandably, a huge source of frustration, and I'm going to say you know, understandably and appropriately, that you would, you would have those frustrations and want to express them, and I thank you for coming and doing that beyond that, I'm open. If anybody wants to share a parting comment or thought, including what you know we on the community Board or you know myself could do. As with regard to youth in education, I would be most welcome to have your input feedback suggestions. Do I have a hand I have a, I have a hand up from liz and then a hand up for Rebecca Dagor, so Liz you want to do you have a thought you want to share hi bill? No, you know I you know, I hear you and I hear you acknowledging you know all of our views and our feedback and to be honest with you yeah. I just feel I do not feel how I voice myself or what all these families are going through, but I just feel that you can't do anything and that I just feel I do not know, maybe I'll become an advocate. Who knows what's going to come out of this, but I just feel nothing's going to come from this. I feel like you're. You do not have the passion it is to make something or bring something to the table to see what changes are. After listening to Elizabeth and Sarah, you know what the Doa did not help anybody in any situation, and you know to the money, the money that goes into the doa, the DOE I mean I can get a group of people and give us five or six months, and let me tell you: we'd, have some plan some plan. That's all I have to say, and I want to thank you, but I just do not feel very hopeful that you could really do anything. That's all thank you for listening. Well, I want to say one more thing and this is unfair to Isabelle, but Isabelle deals with unfair things. All the time and isabel is a friend so she'll. I think, take this. If you have a message I'll tell you one way to actually have an a potential impact, and yes, my voice will not do that. If you have anything three to five sentences, not more than a paragraph and a half you want to share with isabel, she will share it with gail Brewer and I think there's nobody in the city who has more passion and ability to move levers than Gail Brewer. So I agree with you because that's the only office that answered my call and got me some action within hours. The Dlc did not answer till today, since August 19th by email or phone. So you can't leave a phone message. Sorry let Peter and everyone here and vanessa is also here listening, so I want to again bring in Madison Thomas from Assemblywoman C Rights Office. She was the first person you and then she contacted me and actually she has been looked in this and I'm really happy to see solutions. But again at least it is your activism and Peter. You know this is this. Is my approach always with everything? If the community conforms to conditions that are not acceptable, then we'll never know. So first is the community that deserves the biggest shout out here for always caring and reaching out and again so there's stephanie's email. Please write it down. Follow up copy me. I will please you can share my contact and vanessa. I am going to also type in her contact reach out, follow up, because this is systemic and the more examples that we get the stronger a case to demonstrate. The system needs a review. The system needs an upgrade, communities are evolving and our institutions are not, and that is unacceptable, especially in New York City. So we can not fail our young people and our families that need the most, and so this is happening in the Upper East side. This is happening in every other community. If you see something happen in your community, I assume it's happening everywhere. So there's Stephanie's contact when you reach out to Stephanie, please copy me and Vanessa, I'm going to put my email address and Vanessa's also, and we are always happy to hear from you and to follow up and we do follow up, and you were right about President Brewer. She is a constituent oriented public servant and she really cares that we actually follow up with people so Isabelle. I do have one request: it's extended, it's feasible and I think you've got more than a full- time job and our gail Brewer has more than the full- time job. But if you could pose that question that I thought Elizabeth posed so well, which is very simply, they seem to chose to choose a quote-, unquote solution, an approach that solved nobody's problem. Why did not they look at those most in need of getting a problem solved and solve it? For those for the youngest students and the students for whom you know trying to learn at home, you know with particular needs made that the least you know plausible solution. I think that's a well posed question. We may not get a good answer to it, but I would I would welcome if you could pose that to gail and Gail could pose that to the chancellor and if he has no answer, he has no answer, but it's it'd be good. It'd, be a good learning experience for him. If I can be so presumptuous to say for him to hear that's an excellent question, it deserves a response we'll follow up. If you could, please reach out to us and write these questions and and of course, we do not always know the answers, but the good thing about our teammates- that we acknowledge that we do not know the answers, but we know people that may know the answers, and we are also happy to collaborate with people in creating the answers if they do not exist and and that's the strength in working with Vanessa, I do not always know the answer, so I reach out to her and that's the thing. You must acknowledge that you do not have all the answers, but you must be willing to find the solutions that for these real problems, that's perfect. We're about to wrap up vanessa does have her hand up. So, if she'd like to take a moment we're running slightly over but Vanessa, would you like to speak? Yes, I just want to say I think it's Laura who spoke about being in a some sort of a line being a phone line hotline. Excuse me trying to help people who had technology problems and she has some data that would pretty much tell us what happened. Then, in terms of like how much equipment was broken, maybe people who had issues with being able to connect and so on, so if law, I believe it's laura. If I'm saying that wrong, I'm sorry, I would love to have some of that information. We are I'm speaking specifically about technology right now and I'll, be very short because I know you're, you need to finish your call, your meeting, I should say so. Yes, isabel put my email address. I would welcome any emails and I can shoot my phone number as well for any further discussion with Laura or anybody else who has ideas on how to facilitate stuff. We are still working with a number of issues related to technology, as you know, fit the fiscal year. 20 funding specifically for allocations from elected officials wrestling was not released until last Friday, but we are now trying to figure out how to handle expediting getting a lot of this technology out which, as you know, is it's still going to be an issue, so Laura would love to would love to hear from you and anyone else send me an email and I can we can reconvene in any other way if there's a need or a desire for that. That's it. Thank you vanessa. So if we could, if we can find that information, maybe you can share the oh. I can yeah. I can share all the letters that we've written about this and I can share an update of what we've had. The responses are not in writing, because the oe has not responded in writing, but I've also spoken to diit about a number of other issues even related to whether or not they do not have the personnel right now to be able to get the equipment out because people have retired. They chose to retire after Covid-19, so there's a number of other issues right that are that are happening, and I can write up a little something and then send it to you guys and if you want to circulate that, that's fine, I'm more than willing to have any other conversations. And, incidentally you can send it. You can send the Community Board office, you can copy or send it to Stephanie. I'm going to tell you Mike if you know my name, which is Peter Patch and without punctuation, and at Aol you've got my email address and I would be happy to take any of these comments and look to follow up as aggressively as I can, and I will say, Rebecca and Isabelle and Gail Brewer are a fairly formidable team, even in the context of the Department of education. So I will literally follow up on those questions. And again I want to thank you Liz, and you know thank Laura and those who spoke, because you know it's hard to get our voice heard. But there are people who want to listen to our voice, who have both the ability to listen and the ability to be proactive and that's what we need to leverage so again. Having said all that, I'm going to thank you again, isabel I'm going to thank you will and thank you Elizabeth, I'm going to thank you vanessa and Liz and Laura and others for your comments and contribution. I think we're complete, but we will have another session in four weeks and if we're still experiencing these frustrations- and they probably will not have completely disappeared, I welcome you back, but again my email is Peter. Patch aol.com, I'm happy to be available until any point you need to address. I think we're good night. All thank you.
