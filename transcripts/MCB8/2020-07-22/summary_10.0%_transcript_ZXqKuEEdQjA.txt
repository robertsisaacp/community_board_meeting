Sam is going to update us on all things that are going on, including and beyond the rent assistance program that I believe and Sam Leave it to you to correct me if I'm wrong, which is still available for application until July 30., and we have the eviction moratorium.
I, think to talk about and Sam has told me that he has lots and lots of updates from Albany on pending legislation regarding rent housing and all things related to that.
So without further Ado, I'm, going to turn it over to Sam, and let him do his thing and when he's done, we'll open it up for questions So, as I said, I'm, a brand new housing policy analyst at the Community Service society.
So Ed asked me to talk a little bit about the state of of housing, evictions, the state of the rental assistance program and other things going on in Albany.
The latest statistics showed about a quarter of tenants, did not pay full rent last month, which is kind of high, given a 20 unemployment rate, since there is usually a number of tenants who do not pay, but a lot of people who are unemployed are relying on those unemployment.
It also does not cover people who became unemployed in phase four which we're in right now in New, York City.
Not yet being executed, the courts are open online for tenants filing housing part cases against their landlords for things like emergency repairs that need to be made, or harassment or illegal lockouts, which can be one roommate against another or if they're, the courts are open for pre- coveted cases where both parties have have attorneys and are seeking either settlements or to file motions.
Also, a federal eviction moratorium on tenants whose landlords receive federal funding and the clearest case of that is NYCHA residents whose landlord is the public authority, but also section 8, tenants, tenants in program in buildings that were built with a low- income, housing tax credit which is most affordable, housing and then most affordable, housing.
It also does not cover anybody who was immediately affected by this pandemic in mid- march, which you know certain areas pretty hard, pretty fast, So People who are ineligible, like I, said people who are low income now, but were not then people who were not rentward And then, but are now people who are rent burdened before and are still rent burdened, but have not lost income, undocumented households without a single citizen, who's or a person who's.
This does not include public housing, section, 8 or other voucher recipients, because they can reapply for their programs at their new lower income, and it does not cover people whose rent is over 125 percent.
Everybody, who needs it and to eliminate some of the potential spread of Covid-19 that exists in congregate, housing, shelters, which are very dangerous conditions under any circumstance, but certainly under this pandemic, then there's a bill for extending the eviction moratorium and including foreclosures in it as well.
That's s-8667, though this would protect commercial and residential tenants from eviction during the state of emergency, plus give them an extra year to recover, given that the economic fallout is going to be much longer than the epidemiological fallout and it prevents filings of and executions of, both evictions and foreclosures, and this, like I, said it covers commercial and residential homeowners and renters.
Eight zero, two s: zero, eight zero, two assembly, A10826 810826, so this quite simply cancels rents from March 7th until the duration of the crisis, plus 90 days, it is designed to be universal because there are many ways that tenants fall through the cracks So. It includes a Landlord hardship fund which is designed to prioritize small operators, non- profits and public housing authorities before all other potential landlords and landlords can basically get their rent payments covered in, but in exchange they have to open their books and demonstrate that they actually have a hardship that other programs work.
There's the question of at what rents and given the recent you know, departure of a larger number of people from the city.
You either elaborate on that or talk a little bit more about some of the other qualifications and requirements of the hdr program that you think would make it difficult for people who should otherwise qualify or seem to be in need in our particular district in Community Board aid that might make it challenging for them to end up actually qualifying for these.
Imagine that might be more of a burden in higher rent parts of the city than in lower rent parts of the city, because I do not think that it's targeted by anything quite as specific as a community district.
If you think this is way off, but it looks like what I'm reading is for fiscal year, 2020, The, fair market, rent documentation system for New, York, Hud, Metro, fair market, rent area Fmrs for all bedroom sizes, for an efficiency that is 16.65 for a one bedroom, 1700 for a two- bedroom 1951 for a three- bedroom, 2472 and for a four- bedroom.
Leave it to the experts in CB8, whether you think that's going to be an issue in your community, but it seems worth looking into okay, any you have a follow- up.
Let us know thanks sure, and thanks for getting my book, the eviction moratorium extension bill does cover commercial as well as residential tenants.
I do not think that we have much in our community This program and the second one for the landlord that receive funny- made Freddie Mac loans, you're going to have an opportunity to hold the payments in favor of the learner, which is, I think, is good, because the allowance deserves to be paid by the way: and, finally, the bad news.
I would say that the three bills that I discussed probably would have a major impact on those tenants who are paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent.
I I've definitely heard concern that very little will be passed in this emergency session, because there's so much uncertainty at the federal level, but I think there's also going to be a major push from all those groups that mobilized in the summer of 2019 around the rent, and so I would not write any of them out, and I.
The investment of millions of dollars that put the city in the affordable, housing after 30 years is gone, so we're going back to zero in 20 years and while the city paid millions of dollars to the developers just only to the developer, to become millionaires, and I suppose strongly support the developers by the way I would like- And I think they deserve to have some income.
If you lost your income, it's going to be next to impossible to do that, especially if you're already rent burden, so some of them may have left the city by then plenty will, and You know.
You know that Marco was saying we need to look out for the obviously the residents of community district.
I have a question in all the years in the state, Senate and housing has been a very hard topic to get any passage on, because so much of this state, New York City, is so different than the rest of the state than Buffalo.
I. Think that, as after 2008 there's going to be a significant amount of pressure on the single- family home stock as well in the past , we've sometimes seen those housing issues get a lot more money in terms of stemming foreclosure of single- family homeowners, rather than multi- family homeowners or the evictions of tenants that can result in those cases, and so I hope that the changing political balance means that we can address the real and pressing needs of potentially foreclosed homeowners, as well as the very real impressing needs of tenants and multi- family dwellers in New, York, City, Marco.
They say: look when you can put affordable housing in the low densities, community.
And I've done this before with the budget to talk about a millionaire income tax, how he could pay for some of these things, because I think that's what it's down to is: redistribution of wealth And we're not going to help any affordable housing if we do not start doing that, This bill, they're in orbiting, I, think that a leader, the borough board, is important.
And we have to talk to legislators outside of New York City Anybody have an idea as to you know a resolution or something that we could you know, get that get something going?
What's the how we're going to get a real, affordable housing in this community Certainly you can't do it by letter, but I really want to talk about ray how we raise money, which I seem to think it should be: income, tax and capital gains taxes or whatever you want to do it to pay for affordable, housing.
