Sam is going to update us on all things that are going on, including and beyond the rent assistance program that I believe and sam I'll leave it to you to correct me if I'm wrong, which is still available for application until july 30 I think to talk about, and sam has told me that he has lots and lots of updates from albany on pending legislation regarding rent housing and all things related to that when he's done we'll open it up for questions.
So ed asked me to talk a little bit about the state of of housing evictions, the state of the rental assistance program and other things going on in albany As. until people start dropping off, but you know use your discretion, but We want you to cover, what's important, to know everything's important right now so go ahead and then I'll answer any questions that people have I will do my best to get answers for them and get them back to the co-chairs to distribute to the committee So. The first thing is, you know, as everyone knows, that the housing situation is quite dire.
The latest statistics showed about a quarter of tenants, did not pay full rent last month, which is kind of high, given a 20 unemployment rate, since there is usually a number of tenants who don't pay, but a lot of people who are unemployed are relying on those unemployment, expanded checks, including the extra 600 which are set to expire, It's, really true, and so it's important that action be taken, especially at the state and federal level, to stop this.
The state of new york has an eviction moratorium in place until august 20th I think it was august 5th to august 20th It's a moratorium on evictions for people who can't prove that their inability to pay is directly related to Covid-19 and that's going to cover a lot of people, but there's still going to be plenty who are left out, including people who are paid under the table and might not have the ability to get a reference for their newfound unemployment.
The courts are open online for tenants filing housing part cases against their landlords for things like emergency repairs that need to be made, or harassment or illegal lockouts, which can be one roommate against another or if they're, the courts are open for pre-coveted cases where both parties have have attorneys and are seeking either settlements or to file motions So. It's also possible that the state could end its eviction moratorium, but the city could ex could continue to tell its city marshals not to act on them so that that's maybe something to keep an eye on for the future.
Also, a federal eviction moratorium on tenants whose landlords receive federal funding and the clearest case of that is NYCHA residents whose landlord is the public authority, but also section 8, tenants, tenants in program in buildings that were built with a low-income housing tax credit which is most affordable, housing and then most affordable housing.
I think it's doing its job, but if any combination of those are taken away, we could see real trouble for tenants in the future So. The legislature has passed one major rent relief program for those workers who you know it's mostly geared at people who lost some income, but not all, but it could be for people who lost all income If it's not clear, just please let me know, but it covers the increase in tenant's rent burden for march april may and June Let's say that beforehand, before the Covid-19 pandemic in new york, you were paying 35 of your income.
This doesn't include public housing, section, 8 or other voucher recipients, because they can reapply for their programs at their new lower income, and it doesn't cover people whose rent is over 125 percent of what hud considers the fair market rent standards You don't get covered, which I imagine could include some members in community board eight, even though they might be under 80 ami How you get it is you apply online from the division of homes and community renewal?
In the senate, That would provide housing vouchers for those currently homeless and those at risk of homelessness to move from temporary hotels and shelters into permanent housing, and it would cover the pretty big gap that exists between what the city is currently offering homeless and your homeless residents in terms of rent vouchers and what the actual cost of rent is in new york city So. That would be a program to essentially very quickly shelter in safe conditions, Everybody who needs it and to eliminate some of the potential spread of kovid that exists in congregate, housing, shelters, which are very dangerous conditions under any circumstance, but certainly under this pandemic, then there's a bill for extending the eviction moratorium and including foreclosures in it as well.
this quite simply cancels rents from march 7th until the duration of the crisis plus 90 days, it is designed to be universal because there are many ways that tenants fall through the cracks So. It includes a landlord hardship fund which is designed to prioritize small operators, non-profits and public housing authorities before all other potential landlords and landlords can basically get their rent payments covered in, but in exchange they have to open their books and demonstrate that they actually have a hardship that other programs work.
There's the question of at what rents and given the recent you know, departure of a larger number of people from the city Right now than the last time, the city checked, there's a larger question, also about hotel rooms that whose operators don't believe that tourism is going to return anytime, soon enough to make them economically viable and whether it makes sense to convert those into permanent housing.
Right I mean in the past when hotels have been converted in this way by non-profits, they have been at least 20 supportive housing, which means having social support services in-house A highly effective way of ending street homelessness That could be a problem that you would anticipate residents in our district and community board able face You either elaborate on that or talk a little bit more about some of the other qualifications and requirements of the hdr program that you think would make it difficult for people who should otherwise qualify or seem to be in need in our particular district in community board aid that might make it challenging for them to end up actually qualifying for these, for these benefits right.
So the rule is that it doesn't cover people whose rent is over 125 percent of the federal housing and urban development agencies, fair market rent standards Maybe we could get more specific, but I.
It is sad that we don't have nothing about our community in this, and this and this bill you have for other communities which is basically I'm very happy for them, but I'm happy for our community We have to see what's going on in our community and a person of myself I , don't know if that was so much as a question, but if you have any thoughts on any of that, I leave it up to the board to decide whether either the actions that have been taken by the state and city federal governments live up to your needs.
The investment of millions of dollars that put the city in the affordable housing after 30 years is gone, so we're going back to zero in 20 years, and while the city paid millions of dollars to the developers just only to the developer, to become millionaires and I suppose strongly support the developers by the way I would like- and I think they deserve to have some income.
Their approach seems to be from the governor down to do just enough to keep things held as they are So. The eviction moratorium in the first place was very important and needed to happen, but a moratorium is just for stalling an eventual eviction unless some other action is taken and we did pass the attendance safe, harbor act which says that, basically, you know you can't be evicted for not paying rent because of Covid-19, but you still have to repay the rent, and if you lost your income, it's going to be next to impossible to do that, especially if you're already rent burden, so some of them may have left the city by then plenty will, and you know we don't want people to have to leave the city under these dire circumstances, and it's going to be very hard for the city to recover.
