I, think to talk about, and sam has told me that he has lots and lots of updates from albany on pending legislation regarding rent housing and all things related to that.
So ed asked me to talk a little bit about the state of of housing, evictions, the state of the rental assistance program and other things going on in albany.
It also doesn't cover people who became unemployed in phase four which we're in right now in new york, city.
What's called the tenant safe, harbor act, which was passed at the end of June and is the piece of legislation that protects workers who lost income or became sick as a result of Covid-19?
Also, a federal eviction moratorium on tenants whose landlords receive federal funding and the clearest case of that is NYCHA residents whose landlord is the public authority, but also section 8, tenants, tenants in program in buildings that were built with a low-income housing tax credit which is most affordable, housing and then most affordable, housing.
Should, you know, lose your income That is correct, especially if they're in private housing, without section 8 subsidies, or something like that group That's how much the state is willing to spend.
This doesn't include public housing, section, 8 or other voucher recipients, because they can reapply for their programs at their new lower income, and it doesn't cover people whose rent is over 125 percent of what hud considers the fair market rent standards.
That would provide housing vouchers for those currently homeless and those at risk of homelessness to move from temporary hotels and shelters into permanent housing, and it would cover the pretty big gap that exists between what the city is currently offering homeless and your homeless residents in terms of rent vouchers and what the actual cost of rent is in new york, city.
Eight zero, two s: zero, eight zero, two assembly, a10826 810826, so this quite simply cancels rents from March 7th until the duration of the crisis, plus 90 days, it is designed to be universal because there are many ways that tenants fall through the cracks So. It includes a landlord hardship fund which is designed to prioritize small operators, non-profits and public housing authorities before all other potential landlords and landlords can basically get their rent payments covered in, but in exchange they have to open their books and demonstrate that they actually have a hardship that other programs, work.
Nothing about your own situation, right, It'll, open up a box you'll see a button that says raise hand, click on that it'll elevate, you in the participants menu and if you're on the phone, it's star, nine What is 80 AMI accordingly, one person, 80 percent AMI, falls between forty one thousand seven hundred dollars to sixty three thousand six hundred dollars for homeless people.
The city checked, there's a larger question, also about hotel rooms that whose operators don't believe that tourism is going to return anytime, soon enough to make them economically viable and whether it makes sense to convert those into permanent housing.
You either elaborate on that, or talk a little bit more about some of the other qualifications and requirements of the hdr program that you think would make it difficult for people who should otherwise qualify or seem to be in need in our particular district in community board aid that might make it challenging for them to end up actually qualifying for these, for these benefits right.
So the rule is that it doesn't cover people whose rent is over 125 percent of the federal housing and urban development.
I, leave it to the experts in cb8, whether you think that's going to be an issue in your community, but it seems worth looking into okay, any you have a follow-up.
The values, is, our community, approximately have, if I know, wrong, 141 000 households from which 49 000 are households that have serious problems such as the 52 percent of the 141 000 They're, paying more than 20 30 of the rental income and 23.
I I've definitely heard concern that very little will be passed in this emergency session, because there's so much uncertainty at the federal level, but I think there's also going to be a major push from all those groups that mobilized in the summer of 2019 around the rent, and so I wouldn't write any of them out, and I.
The investment of millions of dollars that put the city in the affordable, housing after 30 years is gone, so we're going back to zero in 20 years and while the city paid millions of dollars to the developers just only to the developer, to become millionaires, and I suppose strongly support the developers by the way I would like- And I think they deserve to have some income.
Basically, you know you can't be evicted for not paying rent because of Covid-19, but you still have to repay the rent, and if you lost your income, it's going to be next to impossible to do that, especially if you're already rent burden, so some of them may have left the city by then plenty will, You know we don't want people to have to leave the city under these dire circumstances, and it's going to be very hard for the city to recover.
If there can be a program of what you think needs to happen at the state, I think that's an important voice to get out there, whether that means revenue, whether that means extended tenant, protections, thinking, commercial, thinking, residential, It means you know, demanding a federal intervention because they have the power of debt spending whatever it is, that you decide is necessary.
You know that marco was saying we need to look out for the obviously the residents of community district.
I. Think that, as after 2008 there's going to be a significant amount of pressure on the single-family home stock as well in the past , we've sometimes seen those housing issues get a lot more money in terms of stemming foreclosure of single-family homeowners, rather than multi-family homeowners or the evictions of tenants.
I, just I'm thinking a person like our fellow community member, which I admire a lot wilma, One or one of the elevators, doesn't work.
And I've done this before with the budget to talk about a millionaire income tax, how he could pay for some of these things, because I think that's what it's down to is: redistribution of wealth And we're not going to help any affordable housing.
And we have to talk to legislators outside of new york city Anybody have an idea as to you know, a resolution or something that we could you know, get that get something going?
Would, you read out everybody who's, a board member who's still here that way, What's the how we're going to get a real, affordable housing in this community.
Certainly, you can't do it by letter, but I really want to talk about ray how we raise money, which I seem to think it should be: income tax and capital gains taxes or whatever you want to do it to pay for affordable, housing.
