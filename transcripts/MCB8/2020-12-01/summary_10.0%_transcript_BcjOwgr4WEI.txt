Good, okay, so good evening, everyone and welcome to the special meeting of Community board 8 on the land, use, process.
So Spencer Williams from the municipal arts, society's livable, neighborhoods program, will share with us some resources for understanding the land use process in New, York City, and it takes a lot to get to understand.
The livable neighborhoods program helps local leaders in under-resourced, communities, develop the knowledge and tools that they need to participate effectively in public land review processes and engage in creative, community-based design and planning.
I know that you all have a number of projects coming to your part of town and a good refresher, never hurt anyone, especially on land use, processes, they're, so complicated again, I'm, Spencer, Williams.
We think that community is a really critical part of that and Lnp. In addition to our other advocacy events, Our programs, things like Jane's, walk that you might have participated in are operated under the municipal arts, society.
I'm gonna start with some really basic intro to zoning then spend a little bit more time in going over the land, use and zoning review procedures in the city, and I'm going to reserve the bulk of the time for walking us through a few key critical lane use tools that are available, the zoning handbook and a couple of interactive web maps that are really helpful, that the city has put together that many neighborhoods and neighbors don't really know about or know how to navigate and use.
There are a lot of people in the city that interact with or involve with land use, whether that's the office of environmental coordination that deals with issues of environmental quality, things like air quality, transportation, the Landmarks commission, the Department of Housing preservation and development, parks.
Any of these offices could be a lead agency or having an application before the city that you might see at the community, board, and so I'm, going to try to demystify some of this process.
The 1916 Zoning code was started really, after and in response to the equitable building, which was a good example that showed how the interest of the public of private building owners and health safety welfare come together to shape, New, York, City and so thinking about being able to see the sky and the advent of the modern, skyscraper there's.
Incorporation of the sky exposure plane in New York City, which helps define a lot of these wedding cake style buildings that we see, as well as introducing things like floor area ratio to how we govern the bulk, the scale the size of buildings.
Most, notably in 1961, with really thinking about a whole system of bonuses, special districts, We are constantly adding to the complexity of the zoning code as a city, and there are a couple of key, really important components to know about one when we say land use.
In the same way, We have three basic zoning categories of residential, commercial and manufacturing in the city that are most common at community boards.
Another, really key mechanism in New, York, City's zoning code and zoning resolution is the idea of transferable development rights which allows for that underlying allotment, so that underlying zone that says I could build.
With talking about zoning, the land use process in New, York City is one that aspires to give all of these actors a voice in that process.
So residents, community boards, city-wide organizations like Mas elected officials, business, interests, government, agencies, private developers, all have a role to play in the land use review process, because those impacts and opportunities are shared or ideally should be shared amongst those different players.
A. Zoning change may involve city money or maybe a city project, and so those three items will go through this environmental review process, which has a three-step review.
The environmental quality review is really looking at what would happen or what could potentially happen under no action, and so in a situation in which there's a three-story building currently in a zone that would allow an eight-story building that application was asking to be a 12-story building.
So, you can really think of seeker as the way in which we ask the questions that are critical to make the decision later in the land use review, process.
So, as I said before, The seeker process would be initiated by something like a zoning change, a project that involves city, money or city project.
That is the point in time in which communities can ask for additional elements to be assessed as part of the environmental review process, and so it's really important in that process to be really technical and respond to the manual.
There may be additional concerns that come up in scoping that are really important to take note of, but things like asking very specific questions about not just parks and open space, but a community garden and its potential impacts and really looking at what type of detailed questions would the community want to have answers to really inform the best decision.
As that, and then that would begin the applicant's time to begin asking and answering those questions in alignment with the technical manual at which point they would then release a draft environmental impact statement with an opportunity to comment on that draft environmental impact statement within 60 days of the release of that Deis.
This is an important step in the process for seeker, because it is also the point in time in which the uniform land use review procedure begins, and so, when there is that initial assessment of project impacts, the public phase, the public comment period can start to really begin.
Council, like final action can not be taken by the city Council until there is a final environmental impact statement, issued, which solidifies all of the additional analysis and comments which is important to note, because all of the comments that are received in the Deis stage have to be responded to in the final environmental impact statement, and so it's a really great time to really look at in great detail at the appendices and the findings of impacts and potential mitigation that are outlined in the environmental impact statement and so.
That is a relatively new thing, that is, that I think community boards will be figuring out exactly what that means, as new projects come online, but it should mean that you have a little bit more time to comb through those documents to really look at the underlying applications that are coming through this process.
A very long process in which you have a very community boards have a very discreet and important role, because it's starting the documentation of the public comment in the land use review process, so the dis and the Feis will have baked in it.
What's working well about the project, things that you feel like it responds well to if it does, as well as like really detailed concerns about the merits of the project, the scale, the fit the use, the intensity of use, as well as other potential impacts that might be covered in the environmental review.
There have been a number of decisions that have paused at City Council or been dropped by the applicant in part, because there's a lot of confusion and concern about unanswered questions from the community, whether that's about affordability, displacement, risk project benefit or anticipating additional impacts, and so it's really critical to document those as best you can.
Some of the things in our community district needs assessment that we think you should respond to as you make decisions in that case about the budget.
That really gives a great overview and detailed explanation of many aspects of zoning by code by use and goes into some of the nitty gritty details that you may see in a project, particularly in your neighborhood.
The next item that I'll go through is New York, City's zoning and land use.
I think when we look at what other projects are going on in the neighborhood and how those impacts may or may not be taken into account in the scoping of a project oftentimes those types of things of like hey, yes, you've identified this construction impact for you building your building, but at the same time this other impact is going on, and you should really account for that in the decision that you're making, because our neighborhood will be impacted, I- think that's a really great example of the kind of input that would be really helpful and is often missing in some of the environmental review and land use review, processes.
In the absence of that information to say, we're, making a decision to not support this project, because you haven't answered this question, like that's a fairly powerful thing to put in a community board letter advising the borough president on how to review the project and also puts you on record of saying this is really important.
Information to this community board that when future projects come, these are some of the concerns that we want you to respond to, because these are issues that are important in our neighborhood.
You just look up the zoning handbook, but I also believe that the links in the chat, so similarly, there is New York, City, Planning labs, which is part of department of city.
Another thing that you can do is look up projects by text and so like I could put up blood center right, and so what will come.
It also gives you these project milestones, that you can use to file and track the project over time, and so, If you don't want to commit to memorizing those diagrams that I went through earlier in my presentation, you can use the zoning application portal to really file through these critical milestones that each project must take right, and.
Borough president then has 30 days after the community board issues a recommendation to review the application and issue their own recommendation, and that will all go all the way down to the mayoral Review City Council vote and approval of or not approval, of.
And I can pause here if people have additional questions, but a good example like in this project, the draft scope of work that's been released that you would then be commenting.
We want to comment on open space and make sure that they're asking particular questions about open space, we're going to comment on land, use, zoning and public policy.
Think that you should ask a more specific or better question, because that's information that would be helpful for us to make a decision, but I think look at these kind of tasks, and that's those are the comments that you want to be giving during the scoping project so to go back to, but.
Yes, So this seeker access, it will be where you can find all of the project, information that you need to comment during the draft scope of work, as well as during the environmental impact, statement.
President Bureau's recommendation on this project the same with the Cpc report, So you can track this process through the zoning application portal and really get information.
I think that's would be a great thing to reach out to your council member about to see what response is needed or additional resources might be needed to better manage those spaces, because certainly there are impacts for sure and opportunity.
You were had the zoning application portal up and were showing the blood center, There was a yellow rectangle on the map and a list of building block lots that are impacted.
Should there be impacts to a would be considered as part of the environmental impact statement and would be referenced likely in the scoping the draft scope of work in terms of that being incongruous in Congress to what you've been presented, there are times in which a zoning action on a larger set of tax slots can facilitate the eventual design of the building, and so that there might be reasons to include or exclude particular lots within a rezoning, depending on what the ultimate development proposal is seeking to get, and so that could also be something that you could scope and think of calling out those particular parcels surrounding if there are particular impacts that you want to be mindful of okay.
I would say, applications are coming, People are interested in building and investing in New York and investing in neighborhoods and communities should have a say and be equal partners in that, and.
It's also a tool that I think we want to see more of from the city, I think New York, City planning labs through the zoning and land use map and the zoning application portal have really.
