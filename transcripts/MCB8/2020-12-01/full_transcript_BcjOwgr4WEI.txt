Good, okay, so good evening, everyone and welcome to the special meeting of Community board 8 on the land use process. We invited and we're lucky enough to have the municipal arts society accept our invitation to come and explain the land use process. So Spencer Williams from the municipal arts, society's livable neighborhoods program, will share with us some resources for understanding the land use process in New, York City, and it takes a lot to get to understand. It I think founded on the principle that community involvement is essential to successful city planning. The livable neighborhoods program helps local leaders in under-resourced communities, develop the knowledge and tools that they need to participate effectively in public land review processes and engage in creative, community-based design and planning. This program is supported in part by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the city council, including our local council member Keith powers. Thank you very much. Council member, we're so excited to have Spencer here with us with here with us. Excuse me and we'll be taking questions after his presentation. So, in terms of asking questions, please go to the bottom of your screen and you'll see participants which look like two little people with the name, the number 37 next to it. If you click on that, there'll be a whole list of names and if you click on the little virtual hand on the bottom of that list, that says raise hand will be able to see that you're raising hand do not do what Spencer just did, which was raise his real hand, because we can't see it, especially with so many of you interested people here. So you have to raise your virtual hand in order to be called on and we'll call on you in the order in which you raise your hand, they push you all to the top of the list, we'll start with public members and see how the time goes and then board members and ask that everyone's questions be succinct and compact and concise, and really limit yourselves to one minute of questions. So we can get as many questions out there as possible. It is a complicated procedure with probably a lot of explanations as clear as Spencer will make them. So why don't? We begin I'll turn it over to you Spencer, and welcome, and thank you so much for having me I'm glad it worked out. I know that you all have a number of projects coming to your part of town and a good refresher, never hurt anyone, especially on land use processes, they're so complicated again, I'm Spencer Williams, I'm a planner and architect by training. I'm the director of advocacy at the municipal arts, society and I run livable neighborhoods program. I'm really excited to do a new version of this programming. For you all that allows us to take advantage of the zoom format. Typically, if we were in person, wouldn't necessarily be able to do the kind of walkthrough of some of the tools that I'll be able to do virtually and I've been trying to as much as possible really take advantage of the new possibilities that this distanced format brings to us, because I would really love to be with you all. Certainly here the last time, I believe my colleague, Tom Devaney, gave this presentation, so you know you've heard a little bit about livable neighborhoods program. That's a really core program to the municipal arts society. We really want to uplift the voices of people in these debates that shape New, York City's built environment. We think that community is a really critical part of that and Lnp. The livable neighborhoods program is one of the ways that we bring that program to people. In addition to our other advocacy events, our programs, things like Jane's, walk that you might have participated in are operated under the municipal arts society. So tonight I'm really gonna go through three key parts of a presentation. I'm gonna start with some really basic intro to zoning then spend a little bit more time in going over the land, use and zoning review procedures in the city, and I'm going to reserve the bulk of the time for walking us through a few key critical lane use tools that are available, the zoning handbook and a couple of interactive web maps that are really helpful, that the city has put together that many neighborhoods and neighbors don't really know about or know how to navigate and use. I think they'll be really helpful for you and reinforce a lot of what we'll be going over today. So New, York, City's, lanies and zoning is storied. It's history, it's complicated. There are a lot of people in the city that interact with or involve with land use, whether that's the office of environmental coordination that deals with issues of environmental quality, things like air quality transportation, the Landmarks commission, the Department of Housing preservation and development parks. There are all of these different entities. It's really hard to navigate and keep all the pieces straight. So any of these offices could be a lead agency or having an application before the city that you might see at the community board, and so I'm going to try to demystify some of this process this evening. It's important to note that New York City is the first city in the country with a comprehensive zoning code. The 1916 Zoning code was started really, after and in response to the equitable building, which was a good example that showed how the interest of the public of private building owners and health safety welfare come together to shape, New, York, City and so thinking about being able to see the sky and the advent of the modern, skyscraper there's. Certainly, issues of land use rights of like I want to build this building impacts of those rights, and so what we saw after that was this incorporation of the sky exposure plane in New York City, which helps define a lot of these wedding cake style buildings that we see, as well as introducing things like floor area ratio to how we govern the bulk, the scale the size of buildings. Our zoning code has continued to evolve. Most notably in 1961, with really thinking about a whole system of bonuses, special districts, we are constantly adding to the complexity of the zoning code as a city, and there are a couple of key, really important components to know about one when we say land use that is both simple and complex. The simple side of that is that we're really just explicitly talking about what is the land used for? Are there residential uses, manufacturing uses transportation, storage, commercial parks? Those types of that's one, really basic understanding. What it actually is both regulates, the land use and the intensity of use. That's the way that I like to think about it, and so that's going to involve both written code that will define things like the distance between buildings and lot lines. The amount of parking that may be required, the types of uses that are allowed there number of dwelling units open space, planting requirements, as well as the intensity of those items, and so allowing one residence versus 100 is going to be a very different zone. And then we map those zones. So there's always the zoning map and the zoning code and oftentimes in the city when there's a zoning change, it requires both of those things because there's often a change to the underlying code, as well as a map change, that's associated with any kind of land use application. It's important to be mindful of those, because sometimes those underlying changes that are being requested may be to change the bulk of the building or the setback of a building or other standards that are in the written code. The code is simple and complex. In the same way, we have three basic zoning categories of residential, commercial and manufacturing in the city that are most common at community boards. Also, industrial zones that intensity piece is reflected in the zoning nomenclature, the way that we name those zones, and so as that number goes up from one to nine or ten for residential uses. The intensity of that use the size of the building the amount of floor area also increases oftentimes there'll be a split zone on a lot, so there may be some allowances for commercial uses and residential uses, and those things will stack to determine what can be built on that piece of property. The key governing factor in New York City's zoning code, because we don't regulate like height by height as much as other cities. Do is something called floor area ratio, and so this is really just a simple relationship between the underlying building lot and the amount of building or floor area that can be built, and so in this example on the left, you'll see a floor area of one, that's taking up the entirety of that tax slot or building lot, and so that one-to-one relationship is equal. The amount of floor area to the lot is equal in the middle example, you still have the same amount of floor area. It's just been stacked on top of each other, and so you still have the same amount of floor area, but you have a higher building and then, lastly, on the right you're, seeing that same relationship where you still have a floor of one, but your results, the resulting building is a four-story building that just covers a much lower percentage of the lot, and so you can think of that in a couple of ways. Some people like to think about floor area as a sand in a sandbag or milk in a jar you can change the vessel, but the amount of milk is going to stay the same, and so thinking about the additional floor area, not just height, is really important to think about the bulk, the massing and the ultimate shape that the building may be able to take under consideration. Another really key mechanism in New, York, City's zoning code and zoning resolution is the idea of transferable development rights which allows for that underlying allotment, so that underlying zone that says I could build. In this example, let's say eight stories: if I'm not using all those stories, I could transfer those rights to a neighboring property, and so that results we see that often in the city that results in taller more concentrated buildings, and there are a couple of mechanisms by which that happens in the city one. We see zoning lot mergers, so someone essentially merges a lot and they amass those rights. So it might be three lots that are next to each other. They'll join into one parcel, essentially or one development lot and combine all of those underlying development rights. We also allow them for landmark transfers across the street. This helps monetize those rights for landmark buildings to be able to make investments and also preserve those really critical components, and then there are other examples in which we do it in a more of a district scale that allows for those rights to be transferred and across a wider geography. So that's a basic, we'll come back to some additional resources on zoning at the end and I'm going to all pause before that and come back and take some questions. And now I'm going to go quickly, go through some of the review processes, namely the environmental review process and the land use review process as I started. With talking about zoning, the land use process in New, York City is one that aspires to give all of these actors a voice in that process. So residents community boards, city-wide organizations like Mas elected officials, business interests, government agencies, private developers, all have a role to play in the land use review process, because those impacts and opportunities are shared or ideally should be shared amongst those different players. So one of the key components of the city's environmental review process is an environmental impact statement. It's one of the things that's required can be required by the city's environmental quality review process, which is the version. The city's version of the state's environmental Review, Environmental Protection Act. To really look at how we evaluate certain projects and projects that require seeker are typically those projects that may be asking for. A zoning change may involve city money or maybe a city project, and so those three items will go through this environmental review process, which has a three-step review process. Essentially, so the city's environmental quality review program has 19 environmental categories. This environmental process is really a disclosure process. It is a series of questions that we must ask to say what will the impact be based on a land use change relative to what we might see without that change happening, and so this is a really key component to think about we're, not measuring between what is here today and what might happen as a result of the project. The environmental quality review is really looking at what would happen or what could potentially happen under no action, and so in a situation in which there's a three-story building currently in a zone that would allow an eight-story building that application was asking to be a 12-story building. They would be evaluating the difference between that 12-story building and the eight-story building that could be built not on the three-story building that could be that is existing today, and so that no action, often trips up community members, because there might be changes that we might expect to see under the existing rules, the existing zoning and that's really what the decision needs to be based upon according to the state law. So you can really think of seeker as the way in which we ask the questions that are critical to make the decision later in the land use review process. So getting back to that review process you're going to see a couple of these diagrams this evening there are a number of megaphones that you'll see those really are indicating public participation, opportunities or common opportunities to really pay close note to those. So, as I said before, the seeker process would be initiated by something like a zoning change, a project that involves city, money or city project. The first step of that project is an environmental assessment statement which is really a way to anticipate if there will be significant impacts. As a result of a project, and so in some cases that project may be consistent with what is already anticipated to happen, maybe a very small change, and so in those cases we would see a negative declaration. They would prepare this environmental assessment and find no significant impacts and therefore no additional scrutiny based on the technical manual would be required if there's a positive declaration. That means that initial assessment found the likelihood for some significant impacts. That would then trigger a full environmental review statement or environmental review process. That would include both a draft scope of work and some analysis that follows that process. So after that positive declaration, the lead agency would then initiate a scoping process that would include the release of a draft scope of work, as well as having a scoping hearing to respond to that graph scope of work, and so within that scoping hearing. That is the point in time in which communities can ask for additional elements to be assessed as part of the environmental review process, and so it's really important in that process to be really technical and respond to the manual. There may be additional concerns that come up in scoping that are really important to take note of, but things like asking very specific questions about not just parks and open space, but a community garden and its potential impacts and really looking at what type of detailed questions would the community want to have answers to really inform the best decision. That's possible after that hearing. The lead agency would then issue a final scope of work. That would include both the response to the comments that were raised in the draft phase and really solidify the scope of work for the environmental analysis, which would include all the things that are outlined in the manual plus any additional items that may have been agreed to be studied within that scope of work. As that, and then that would begin the applicant's time to begin asking and answering those questions in alignment with the technical manual at which point they would then release a draft environmental impact statement with an opportunity to comment on that draft environmental impact statement within 60 days of the release of that Deis. This is an important step in the process for seeker, because it is also the point in time in which the uniform land use review procedure begins, and so, when there is that initial assessment of project impacts, the public phase, the public comment period can start to really begin. Having substantive discussion and conversation. Based on that initial analysis, action can not be taken by the city Council, like final action can not be taken by the city Council until there is a final environmental impact statement issued, which solidifies all of the additional analysis and comments which is important to note, because all of the comments that are received in the Deis stage have to be responded to in the final environmental impact statement, and so it's a really great time to really look at in great detail at the appendices and the findings of impacts and potential mitigation that are outlined in the environmental impact statement and so and then at that point, Euler begins and we will go through another process and then we'll pause and take some questions and then go through some tools, so Euler process. Similarly, is a fairly rare thing in the city there's about 10 of projects that undergo this additional level of review. It's really a process when there's a discretionary land use action. That means it's not in it's not consistent with the existing allowances and the existing zoning code, and so there needs to be there's some judgment. Call that needs to be made, and so the city has created this uniform process by which all applications go through. These stepwise phases to ensure that each project is getting a similar scrutiny and level of review before making the ultimate decision. So special permits also fall in here. Preventative housing and urban renewal plans and projects, neighborhood rezonings individual applications as well, will trigger this process. So again, this process starts at the Deis when the draft environmental impact statement is released as a result of the last charter reform process, community boards now get a application notice, 30 days prior to the start of Euler. That is a relatively new thing, that is, that I think community boards will be figuring out exactly what that means, as new projects come online, but it should mean that you have a little bit more time to comb through those documents to really look at the underlying applications that are coming through this process. So that starts with the department of City planning, whether that's the lead agency working with or working with an applicant will receive an application or generate an application and pre-certify that application, which basically means that is a complete application. That includes all of the documents, the Deis and can be completely evaluated on its merits. At that point, it goes first to the community board who has 60 days to deliberate on that application. They can vote it's an advisory boat. It can be a vote in support, vote against a vote and support with conditions, a vote against with conditions, or it can be an abstention or a neutral. There are applications before community boards, in which the community board has not been able to come to a unanimous decision within that time period, and so essentially it goes with no comment to the next phase, which is to go to the borough. President oftentimes, particularly in Manhattan bro president, will also provide detailed comments, sometimes on uncomplicated projects hold the hearing. But then the borough president will weigh in on those comments for the next 30 days. Both of these documents, then the application plus the community board comments and the borough president's comments will then go before the city Planning Commission, where the city Planning Commission, will review that application and then affirmatively vote to send it to the city council. They can also have a no vote and it can still go to the city council, which is important. The city council can still take up decisions or applications that are not affirmed by the city. Planning Commission, the City Council then takes its time to deliberate, holds additional hearings and then ultimately takes a vote out of the land use committee. That then goes to the full committee and then would ultimately be signed by the mayor. It's a very long process in which you have a very community boards have a very discreet and important role, because it's starting the documentation of the public comment in the land use review process, so the dis and the Feis will have baked in it. Some of the comments that have been received to date, but the community board really has the opportunity to set the stage for how this project will be reviewed and should be looked at through the community's lens and so really highlighting. What's working well about the project, things that you feel like it responds well to if it does, as well as like really detailed concerns about the merits of the project, the scale the fit the use, the intensity of use, as well as other potential impacts that might be covered in the environmental review process. As you pick up that thread, the community board would then be on notice or putting all the people in subsequent steps on notice, as here are the concerns that we want you to track and respond to throughout this process, and so it allows the community board and the broader community to then go to the bureau president and go to this planning commission and ultimately go to City Council and say this is an issue that we've been tracking along this entire process, and it's really critical that you take that into account. When you make your decision we've seen over the last year or two, a lot of rezoning attempts and efforts face a lot of scrutiny. Some face lawsuits. There have been a number of decisions that have paused at City Council or been dropped by the applicant in part, because there's a lot of confusion and concern about unanswered questions from the community, whether that's about affordability, displacement, risk project benefit or anticipating additional impacts, and so it's really critical to document those as best you can. Even if it's just asking the question along this process, and so both of these processes, the environmental quality review and the land use review process have a lot of benefits. They do provide some opportunities for community input on major land use changes. It is a uniform process. That's predictable! That has a clear and consistent application across everywhere in the city. It can be really challenging to sustain community engagement throughout both of these processes, which can sometimes in total, totality span years or many months to then make sure that as new people, new community members who may not have been involved earlier on in the process have the information that they need to meaningfully participate. Oftentimes. These are very complex projects. With lots of details. These documents can be. You know, hundreds of pages, long with appendices that go into a lot of depth and detail, and so navigating that technical process can be really difficult can be really helpful, especially on a community board. If you are working to develop really skill sets amongst the board where people can take on certain chapters of those documents to review and come back to the board with findings, because reviewing a multi-hundred page document individually can be really difficult, and so, if they think you break up some of these tasks or really target in and focus and say as a community board. When it comes to this decision, we're going to be really focused on these three aspects of this project: transportation, housing, shadow impacts to really focus in your comments on that can be really helpful to break down the complexity of the project, but also to be really impactful on the community's ability to impact the project. Both on. What's being asked and what's being answered- and this ultimately goes to it- can be really difficult to influence the project, parameters and outcomes. Oftentimes we'll see. Community groups have really impassioned comments, but they may end up being out of scope and so really focusing your comments on. What's within the scoping document for the process, as well as documenting the concerns that are outside of that process or saying them both. I'm saying in response to the documents that we're reviewing and the presentations that we've heard here are the things that we like have concerns about are doing well outside of those things. There continues to be concerns about these core elements. Those types of community voice in this process can be really helpful. One of the ways that you can think about that really clearly is a not quite a similar, not quite the same structure, but is in the budget advocacy that the community board does every year there's the in the next year. We want you here the line item items that we want you to really prioritize and focus on, because we know that those speak to the budget, but globally. Here's some of the things in our community district needs assessment that we think you should respond to as you make decisions in that case about the budget. But in this case you would be just stating those things about the land use application, so I'm gonna preview, the next three things and then I'll pause for a couple of questions, maybe three or four and then I'll go through a live demo. So in a moment, I'll be going through the zoning handbook as a resource that really gives a great overview and detailed explanation of many aspects of zoning by code by use and goes into some of the nitty gritty details that you may see in a project, particularly in your neighborhood. Some of the more advanced zoning 20201,301 aspects are explained in great detail here and it's a great resource that I think everyone on a community board should get to know really well. The next item that I'll go through is New York, City's zoning and land use map. That really has a wealth of information. You can do a lot of research on underlying zoning issues and find out a lot of information about projects and then, lastly, where I'll spend most of the bulk of this is the zoning application portal, which I think you'll find the most helpful, because you can go back and forth through the other tools by using this as your interface and so I think I'll pause there take a couple of questions and then we'll switch to a live demo great. That was a lot of information. I apologize. It's reading right all this stuff, so you just explain it, which is great. Thank you. Okay. I see a few questions. Let's start with I. Think members of the public carol and is that will is that Marco Tamayo from the board or someone else all right? Well, let's start with Carol. If you didn't mute Carol, please can't understand what you're saying unless it's just me, you're no reception, no yeah! It doesn't like your microphone, is picking up girl best thing. If you look next to the microphone button at the bottom of your screen up arrow, you can click and test your microphone there or quickly leave and come back, raise your hand again, and we will call on you right away after the next person. Okay, so then, let's go to Marco and then Shari will come to you after that. I just don't know if it's Marco from the board go ahead. Thank you. I'll leave that if you want Shari, because she did not help me- that's fine for me. If no I can start I, think why don't you just start, I'm sure sherry, won't mind thanks. Sherry go ahead! Mark! Okay, thank you all Spencer, for the presentation. The only thing I regret is it's very small presentation, but I'm gonna play with you. So the first thing I have to disclose. So you know where I'm coming from I'm a licensed architect and also a planner. So I did my internship in the city, Planning Commission, so you know now you know who am I? Yes, because that I'm coming with the questions. You know what you present: the C1 C2 C3 G4, yes, I love I would like to have the c2, because there is beautiful places. There is nice places and I think it's beautiful with the our community. We should have it. On the other hand, I'm going to explain to you our community war is a result, a completely residential district and all the business that we have is just only for the residential district. In addition to that, we have also a serious problem of transportation on second avenue because of the interest of second Avenue or bridge. We have also a potential big problem that may rise. Very soon is the opening of the Msk, which is on a 64th street, and they are planning to bring approximately I think 5,000 people which, basically, they will come by cars. I guess maybe 10 percent of that, usually in the rush hour, York Avenue on rush hour is almost very close to a gridlock. Yes, so I think the plan is probably to convert York Avenue in one way, so the traffic that the going south northbound it will go to First Avenue. Now the whole traffic was gonna go over there. So, but we have like this beautiful infrastructure that was created called the Second Avenue Subway when you travel on the rush hour on that train is almost like at the sixth train. It's full pack on the on rush hour too. Now. Do you think it's reasonable in the under this condition to have a c2? It really depends on a whole host of factors, and so I think that those kind of questions that you're asking are really great to bring up on the community board. I think when we look at what other projects are going on in the neighborhood and how those impacts may or may not be taken into account in the scoping of a project oftentimes those types of things of like hey, yes, you've identified this construction impact for you building your building, but at the same time this other impact is going on, and you should really account for that in the decision that you're making, because our neighborhood will be impacted, I think that's a really great example of the kind of input that would be really helpful and is often missing in some of the environmental review and land use review processes. Thank you. Let's see, if Carol's working again, if not, let's go to Sherry Carol you're unmuted. Are you able? Are you there? No? Well? Maybe you could something: I can do yeah other than chatter should be the phone, but in the meantime, can you unmute Sherry go ahead: Sherry, okay, hi! Thank you very much for that very informative explanation of the land use process, as you've mentioned or alluded to. We are now looking at the development of the blood center and we have been advised that their scoping meeting is coming up in December, so I'm wondering and oh and we had an informational session and from the comments of the members of the community there seems there is quite a bit of opposition to the proposed plan. So my question to you is based upon your experience. What areas should the community board focus on, which might be most effective in getting the project either killed or at least modified? You were talking about, we need, we should focus on certain areas and I'm just wondering which do you think is most effective to bring out when it goes up the chain to say the community. Just really does not want this project. That's a great question, I think. Ultimately, it comes down to what you'll be most impacted by I. Don't think that there's a similar standard answer to that. In some cases, we've seen businesses they're like finding that there will be business displacement and so a new building's coming in and those small businesses are being displaced and in the EIS it will say something like well. Those businesses could relocate somewhere else in New York, and so that local impact is not. Are you familiar with this application? I am all right, so we have I mean we're basically talking about height in the middle of a residential neighborhood. So what you're saying you know we're that doesn't really right. So it's application. So in your case I think then, if the height and the intensity are the things that are most of concern to the neighborhood, then you need to comment on those things. If you don't comment on them, you can't change it and it affects the park that we were aware of the neighboring park in effect. So those are the things really specifically on the areas in which you think you would impact the health and safety of the neighborhood of the environment. So oftentimes we see things around transportation and also like what are ideas that you might have that might improve the project. I know that this is a project and a neighbor that you all have had for a long time as well. I've, the last CBA meeting I, attended I believe was in the blood center, the current blood center and so I think you know there is a relationship and a neighborhood presence. What are the things about that work really? Well that you want to see heightened as well. I think are things that you can also comment on, and so it's I think really responsive to hear about change and say here are the things that are that we don't like about it so like are there aspects of the ground floor that you really like about the permeability or about how that fits in with the neighborhood context and scale that you want to comment on as well and so I think to the degree that you can really be constructive, especially in that scoping projects or scoping phase around here are the questions that we have, that scoping project process that scoping process is the time to ask questions more than it is to state support or not for the project. You really want to be saying here are the questions that you need to answer for us to have support of this project or at least to evaluate the project not even to have support, or just you know, you're saying here are the here's, the information that we need, and so, if, in your case, if it's, we really need to know more about the impacts on this park, because it's a park that we use and we use it in the winter time and so impacts during these times of year, will particularly be impactful, because it's our closest open and green space. That might be an impact that you would want to say. This should be in the scope that those kind of like these are. The questions is really what you want to be doing during the scoping process, because you'll have your opportunity later on in the process to say, given all the things that we've know that we know and the things that you've studied, we don't support the project where we do support this. That's very helpful. Thank you very much very helpful. Yes, thank you. Okay will has Carol's questions, so will why don't you read it? Yes, okay. Is there a geographic distance that determines zoning lot mergers? Do the lots have to be within a certain distance from each other to merge them? They have to be contiguous, so they do need to be touching. There are wild examples of that. One in particular that our organization has commented on and been involved with, is 200 Amsterdam, just a 39-sided tax lot that amasses a lot of development rights through that merger process, but typically they are contiguous or they are required to be contiguous zoning lots. There are questions about partial lots, but I will save that for another time. Thank you. Okay. We have two more questions. Would you like to hear them now or wait until let's hear those two more and then I'll go through the demo and share some of these tools? Great, thank you. Michelle will. Would you and mute her thanks, yeah hi. Thank you very much Maxwell. That was a good presentation. I just want to make two comments, one in addition to you or the contiguous lots. That are the usual reasons in places in historic districts like the theater district, yes, I think so as not to interfere with the feeling of the theater district, in that case height that you're able to transfer like up 9th Avenue or 10th avenue to a building outside of the district. So it's not to interfere with the historic nature of that distance. I just couldn't let one thing go by because the buzzword was York making York one way, and this is really a comment that the community board had taken this up many years ago and there was a lot of community opposition to it. This is not to say it can't be raised again, but I know there is still a lot of community opposition to it. So I don't want I didn't want to let that linger out there. So that could be an easy. You know project for us to go forward with. Thank you thanks Michelle and will would you and meet Elizabeth rose, please Alita Spencer. Can you give a lay explanation of what the tax lot issue is at 200 Amsterdam, and why does that? Why do all these little? You know tiny lots, tax lots generate so much height and I think there's been also in our district. There is the example of the unused lot that allows additional height for Lenox, Hill and I. Just I don't understand it well, essentially, if you think back to the graphic that I shared around transferring of development rights, and so that is essentially moving rights from one lot to another that happens in the theater district, as Michelle alluded to that, you could transfer those lots over. The other mechanism is to merge the lots so that they become one contiguous tax slot, and so, when those lots are merged, those additional development rights go to that base lot, and so it is similar to transferring a lot, but it is you're stacking on one lot as opposed to giving those rights to another place. That's the most simple explanation is that they're unused air rights, and so, if you have a sliver on one corner of a building, let's say you have 10 feet of building that you can do on one parcel and then on another tax slot. That's next to it. You have four additional stories that you might be able to build by combining them. You could put all of that development potential onto that one lot. So, in effect, it's an extreme variation of your. What portion of your total lot are you covering? Yes, and in that case, it can be used in that way where that additional floor area could then be stacked to create a super tall tower. That is, concentrating those development rights on a smaller portion of a larger lot. Okay, so that is one of the ways in which we get higher taller buildings, even though they have us the same amount of or a smaller amount of floor area. Okay, thank you, I, don't think we have other questions. I have a question, and it may be just very not at all full of knowledge, which is there's a scoping meeting coming up with respect to the blood center, as Shari had mentioned, if they're not responsive to the kinds of questions that we're interested in our only remedy would be to say that you didn't provide answers to the questions and therefore it puts us in the position of not being able to properly evaluate this project, but there's nothing else. They could still move forward with Ulerp and do whatever they want to do. Yes, I mean they will have to adopt a final scope of work, and so some of your comments may not be included in that final scope of work, but I think you have to comment first before that happens to really know if those kind of concerns will be included or not. You can continue to bring them up throughout the process, and so your neighbor to the north and Inwood as part of that neighborhood rezoning consistently brought up some items that were left out of the scoping. That case has been in litigation. They won, they lost they're thinking. You know it's but I think that that's a good example of asking the question consistently and in their case remitting it all the way through litigation or falling in article 78, was the path that they exercised to ensure that those questions were answered as part of that decision-making process and so I think. To that same token, if you document them in the scoping process, then document them again in the community board process, then document them again at the borough president and then document them again at the city, Planning Commission and then document them again with your councilman, your council member and then ultimately the mayor. It's really important to have those things on record and to be making decisions either, in the absence of that information to say we're, making a decision to not support this project, because you haven't answered this question, like that's a fairly powerful thing to put in a community board letter advising the borough president on how to review the project and also puts you on record of saying this is really important. Information to this community board that when future projects come, these are some of the concerns that we want you to respond to, because these are issues that are important in our neighborhood. Okay, thank you, so I think we're all ready for your demo. All right. Let's see if I can get this girl in here all right, so you should all see the zoning handbook up on your screen. It's a really wonderful document this, how to section it provides an introductory zoning. How do we apply zoning? It goes through all the details in the district how zoning gets amended it's a fairly long document, it's nearly it's over 200 pages, but it does really take the zoning code and the text, which is you, know, very thick and boil it down with lots of graphics images that go into all the zoning history, as well as the individual zones. How to read the text, that's in the zoning code and what it means visually and graphically it goes through different types of uses, around permitted uses, non-conforming uses, etc. Really gives you a lot of detailed information in a way? That's a lot more easy to understand than going through the zoning resolution. This much of this information is also embedded in the zoning and land use map, and so, if you get comfortable using the zoning and land use map, you can also navigate back to the similar information. That's in this report. So like a good example, let's go to like an r, let's go to an r six, so yeah, so it'll give you good examples of what's allowed within R6, and so it'll give you this kind of graphic explanation. What's allowed under the mandatory inclusionary housing construction regulations, in some cases, contextual zoning in districts that might allow for a shorter squatter building so that the height comes down on those buildings. And then it will go through this zoning code text which really breaks down the lot area, the rear, the different aspects that shape how big and what shape the building can occupy. Which- and here is this basic form- that's shown in a dotted line or a dashed line which is describing this things, like the rear yard, is the space on the back of this lot. The lot width. It's really communicating some of those things as well as required parking and a whole host of other issues. So I would say that get familiar with this as a really great resource for you as you're. Looking especially the difference between the underlying zoning and what's being proposed, you can really get a good idea of what that visually looks like, and you can. You know it's very easily findable if you just look up the zoning handbook, but I also believe that the links in the chat, so similarly, there is New York, City, Planning labs, which is part of department of city planning, has pulled together. This interactive land use map which allows you to get additional information. I'm going to make my screen bigger a little bit bigger. Yes, one smaller there we go, so you can zoom in to this map and get additional information. So you can zoom into your neighborhood. You can type in an address in the search you can also, if you're a super savvy, you can look it up by Boro block and lot, which is the bbl number. Each tax slot in the city has an identifiable code. That's ascribed to those three things: what burrow am I in? What block am I on and which lot am I? The great thing about this is when you zoom in sorry, for the driver error is that you can go to a particular tax slot and get more information about the zone. The underlying zone. If you were to click then on this learn more, it brings you to the New York City planning website that has that same information. That's in the zoning handbook for this zone, and so it's a really easy way to go and find out more information. It's really helpful. Similarly, you can look up additional information, so there are commercial overlays. You can look up places where there may be amendments to the zoning code or zoning map which are really helpful. So, like east side, Mid block zoning changes. You can also turn on this pending zoning map amendments, which would give let's go to a larger, which will highlight areas in the city that have pending zoning map amendments again, Square south. You can also look up special districts, historic districts. It's a really great way to find out where sidewalk cafes are permitted in terms of street activity. Fresh zones, business improvement districts will show up on this map. You can get information about what business district that is as well as things like your council or Community board districts subways building footprints as well as aerial maps. So you can get a lot of information by going into this portal to really find a lot of different things. You can also look up in many cases, aerial imagery from different points in time, which can be really interesting to see how your neighborhood has changed, and so sometimes, when you're, looking at doing research of like historical tax, lots of record, you might be able to see some patterns in some of those old aerial maps. If they're available for your geography, but of all of these tools, the zoning application portal is the one you want to really get to know and love. It has all of the zoning applications in the city. You can filter those projects by geography or other aspects, so you can look like what's been pre-filed and as you update those selections, it will give you all the projects on the right-hand side of the screen so like right now, I just have what's a project, that's pre-filed and it's bringing up 2556 Bainbridge Avenue I could also search by community districts, and so I could go to like Manhattan six, and it's going to give me all the projects that are active in that community district I can further review by. Is it in public review? There are no projects here. Is it completed? So that's one really great way. Another thing that you can do is look up projects by text and so like I could put up blood center right, and so what will come up? Are these projects and so I could then click on that New, York, Blood Center? And it's going to bring me to information about the projects, there's a lot of information on this page, and so I'm going to go through it somewhat slowly, but it gives you a really quick description of the project. This area here, which is really great, it summarizes what the land use actions. Are it's a map amendment. So the actions consist of one: a map amendment to rezone from R8B to c27, two, a text amendment to this section of the code that allows an increase in the amount of commercial floor area and modifications to the use, bulk, curb cuts and signage requirements and three a special permit. As part of that section. That would allow those changes. It then says no public documents for this project, and then it gives you again the summary of those actions when they're. What if, when it enters the millennial's review process, it would be assigned a number. The great thing about this is that you can click over these eyes. These little information dots and it will give you additional information about what that particular element is in the process and so I can go and say a zoning map amendment is a change in the designation or a change in the district boundary for any zoning district in New York City. This really helps to demystify the complexity of this wild process for people. It also gives you these project milestones, that you can use to file and track the project over time, and so, if you don't want to commit to memorizing those diagrams that I went through earlier in my presentation, you can use the zoning application portal to really file through these critical milestones that each project must take right, and so, ideally you know the date of the scoping meeting would be on here and other information, and this website will get updated as new information comes up, but it's a good way to follow the steps that this project will take towards completion, and so everything in here that's gray, hasn't happened yet. Similarly, you can go over any of these eyes and get additional information about what's happening at this step, and so a good example is here at the community Board review. I go. The community board has 60 days from the time of referral, which is nine days after certification to hold the hearing and issue recommendation. So that really gives you what happens in the process. Borough president then has 30 days after the community board issues a recommendation to review the application and issue their own recommendation, and that will all go all the way down to the mayoral Review City Council vote and approval of or not approval of, the project. This is a really great resource for you to track the projects that go through your area. As I said before there are these bbls here, which are you know that are they're identifying these tax slots that are identified in this yellow zone. So here all these are all the individual lots that this rezoning application is subject to, and so you can go back to these. If you were to click on these, you can go to the zoning and land use map and get more information, which was the screen we were on previously and go. You know, what's allowed in the zone. What does that look like it's a great way to get additional information? You can also get additional information on the secret process. It tells you what type of decision it is and then that link takes you to the seeker project search, so you can then find additional information, so I typed in blood center right. This brings up the seeker proj, the seeker information. The record for this project I would then click on that seeker number right and then I can get all the files and details for that project to do all of the get all that information and all that research and then click on that. It takes me to all of these project details, and so, if you're like, where do I find all of these reports and resources, what am I commenting on this would be the method by which you would find those documents, and so you would see things like the draft scope of work. The environmental assessment statement, the scoping, the notice of the scoping meeting positive declaration, which is you know, we think there will be impacts and we need to study them. It also gives you these comment period, milestone dates that should be populating on the zoning application portal, but this is a really great resource and I can pause here if people have additional questions, but a good example like in this project, the draft scope of work that's been released that you would then be commenting on. So it goes through a you know, description of the project and then the summary of the proposed actions, those text amendments, the map, changes, etc. It gives you the building height and then it's going to go through what type of analysis are they going to be doing? What is the reasonable, worst-case development scenario, which is the project? The version of the project that was anticipated to have the most impacts and that's what they're going to be studying for their project? They'll identify development sites they'll have this description of the future. What would happen if we did nothing under the existing zoning and then they'll go through lots of detail on the types of questions that they have? What they will study types of- and these are referring to these tasks- are referring to the Seeker technical manual and so to the question that was raised before of what's a way to focus on, you could say we're going to focus on commenting on a number of these tasks. We want to comment on open space and make sure that they're asking particular questions about open space, we're going to comment on land use, zoning and public policy. We're going to comment on shadows, because there is a lot of. There are a lot of elements that are being evaluated or proposed to being evaluated. You should definitely look at the entirety of the draft scope of work, but a good example. Let's see, let me go to make this bigger, so a good example of the kind of comments that you would want to give in the scoping. So here's like a task inventory existing open space and recreational facilities within a quarter mile of the rezoning area. Add that open space up, and so like is a quarter mile. The right distance should it be an eighth of a mile? Is it do people have mobility issues? Are there places that are hard to get to estimate the population of the open space study area? Is it important to think about the population over 65 within the study area, as it relates to open space or the number of youth in the area in terms of playgrounds and other facilities? Those would be the kinds of things that you would comment on the scope to say. We think that you should ask a more specific or better question, because that's information that would be helpful for us to make a decision, but I think look at these kind of tasks, and that's those are the comments that you want to be giving during the scoping project so to go back to, but yes, so this seeker access, it will be where you can find all of the project information that you need to comment during the draft scope of work, as well as during the environmental impact statement. Yes, so to go back to give you what a more complete site might look like or a complete project, to give you a good sense of humor. Did you order? Let's see here, trying to think of a good project for you all? Let's do actually, let's do so Inwood. The neighborhood rezoning is a good example right. It has a complete set of all this information, so you can track all of the actions and all the milestones for this project right with these checks. This is what, ultimately, as you go back on, like the blood center other projects that are in your neighborhood. You will see these milestones here, and so you can see the application was filed. It was reviewed, sent to the community board, disapproved this application or advise to not approve their comment. Letters then get uploaded into this portal, so you can see it's also a good way that you can see like what are what have other community boards said about similar projects if there are similar projects, so you can go and look through the structure of their letters what they found. You can also do the same for the borough president's review on the different lanyard sections right to disapprove with modifications with scales was border. President Bureau's recommendation on this project the same with the Cpc report, so you can track this process through the zoning application portal and really get information. The information that you need and so I think I'm gonna go through one more time, just to walk you through how to get to the seeker documents because I feel, like maybe that was I didn't go over that enough. It's not completed all right went to the project in the portal, then I went there's a link next to seeker, which is the city environmental quality review. You click on that link. It takes you to seeker access. If you know the secret number you can put it in. You can also search by community district or by project name. I use the keyword then just hit search. The record comes up with the seeker number. You can also bookmark this page for future reference. It's what I would do if I was following a project and then that's how you get to all of those relevant documents, and so this is a good example of the notice of the scoping meeting that was referenced earlier. All right, public scoping meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday December, 15th, 2 p.m gives you all the information on how to comment and a little bit about the project. So I'm going to stop there because I just shared a lot of information and it's getting later in the evening, so I want to make sure if anyone wants to go, wants me to go over anything again or has a subsequent question that I can make sure that I answer it. Thank you. We do have a couple of questions and then I have a potentially I have a question at the end as well. So I know that Michelle and Elizabeth rose have questions and I would just ask you guys if you could tailor them so that they're as succinct as possible, and thank you very much Spencer. There is really a lot of information. Go ahead. Michelle if you could on mute, her will a reminder to raise your hand through the participants menu or on. Thank you yeah, a couple of questions Spencer, that's my grandson's name! So I love that name Community Board eight wrote a letter with reference to the blood center. Would that letter be in that information that you pulled up as community import input I it would likely show up in. Was it in response to the scope of work or just well the information it was in response to the informational session that was given to us by the developers? I would suggest that you include that in your commentary in the scope of work, so it would not necessarily appear because it was something that came in relevant to the project. It would not necessarily appear here, not necessarily I, think if you submit it in response to the scope of work. As part of the comment on the scoping, it should show us before not. This was before the scope of work, so you're thinking it wouldn't. Okay. The other thing is how much respect is given to the mid-block zoning because, for example, there's a super tall I think it's about 100 stories. That's going up, I think 51st street. It's a block north of St Patrick's you're familiar with that it's right by our office. Yes, okay, so that's mid block I, don't know if it's 100 feet off the corner or what it is. But how does something like that? Can? Since we know the zoning in the mid blocks, how much respect is given to the mid-block and the existing zoning, the context is going to determine that I think the context and the complexity of the project, the example by Saint Pat's that you mention is complicated because it's using development rights from the from Saint Pat's, so there's the historic transfer. That's part of the reason why that they're, able to transfer across the street essentially and I, think there are areas in which we see those super tolls, mid block and other places where that character is respected or is codified in the zoning. In the underlying zoning, where there is a mindful protection, especially during neighborhood rezonings, we've seen a lot of interests in mid blocks in places like Bushwick and Inwood and southern boulevard, where you're wanting to preserve that lower residential character in particular. Well, there's good. Thank you. There's going to be a lot of interest in the mid block because it's ripe for development. The thing is: how much do you want to violate it? The other. My last question is about the permanence of the new cafe the outdoor cafes. We had asked a question at our last zoning meeting and then I read in the paper subsequently that zoning has permanently it's been made permanent, where we thought that we were getting that we were giving input and we were gonna get some kind of a response before the city acted on it. However, it doesn't see that that's the case now most of those permanent cafes are in violation of the existing zoning and there they are. It's completely disrespectful to those cafes who are in an appropriate appropriately zoned place for cafes. Now it seems that the city did not have much of a chance to comment on this and those of us who did comment on it. We're not giving much of a hearing or much credence. Do you have anything to add about that, and is that no longer challengeable? Is it a done deal and it does permanent mean forever? Does it mean for the next year? What does it mean? I believe the street tale permitting has been. You know one in response to the pandemic and real business issues and I think there was a push from a lot of the business community to have some certainty about making investments in those outdoor seating, the outdoor, dining, the retail environments, so that they could ha really make the investments that they felt were needed to make sure that people were comfortable that so that they could still get that money generated. So City Council in response to that, the that request and that need from the business community extended the dining in public through next year, I believe so. The certificate means a year. I would need to double check on the final date, but I don't believe it's in perpetuity I think we will have some form of extended street tale in perpetuity I think. But this way that it's been rolled out over the last three or four months will be extended through next year. Originally was supposed to be extended through the pandemic, and so now, if it's extended for a year, I understand that, if it's in perpetuity does that mean you have to go back and change the zoning laws and go through the entire public process for each cafe? That might be in violation. That's a very interesting question. I think we heard some of this, so the department of Transportation held a hearing or the city council held a hearing about the street tale program. A couple of months ago received mixed testimony from the public. So certainly members of the business community heralded the ability to get up permitting, for you know the thousands of businesses that applied, but also some unintended consequences and impacts, and so we heard from members of the bike community about impacts to bike lanes. We heard about safety, we heard about sanitation, increased trash, rodent activity and so I think there are a lot of unanswered questions about how we've responded in terms of what that means going forward. But I don't, unfortunately, have the answer to what that means in terms of the role both of the community board. For approving those you don't know anything about process. In other words, it's done now. We don't know going forward any process for input and though it's not going to follow the usual zoning commentary and not for the immediate, not for the immediate future, I, don't believe, but I think that's would be a great thing to reach out to your council member about to see what response is needed or additional resources might be needed to better manage those spaces, because certainly there are impacts for sure and opportunity. Yeah. Okay, thank you Michelle we will. If you and Mute Elizabeth rose please and then we'll go to Marco. Thank you! Spencer. When you were had the zoning application portal up and were showing the blood center, there was a yellow rectangle on the map and a list of building block lots that are impacted. Can you please explain what the yellow rectangle represents and how the affected bbls are chosen identified? It strikes me. That's actually a pretty limited number of lots. Yes, so that is the yellow area indicates the area that is subject to the land use application, so that is those are the areas that would be subject to a land, use map, change, text, amendment or subject to that discretionary action. That's being considered. If you recall the Inwood example, there was the wide swath of yellow parcels throughout that neighborhood geography. That's the same deal, that's the extent of the zoning application, and so each of those lots would be subject to some change or some consideration to be included in the zoning application. So just to follow up on that, since the application appears to be only related to the blood center itself and actually across the street, to the west, going to the solo building on 2nd Avenue that yellow rectangle represents all of the block other than the 2 Avenue sections. What are the? How do we understand the impacts to the portions of that block that are not currently owned by the blood center? I'm just confused by there seems to be a difference in that visualization and in that list of Bbls, then has been represented. So I think the impacts would be assessed at a wider geography, and so there's always the project site and then the environmental impact. The environmental review process, will look at a series of geographies around that site. Look at things like transportation, impacts, shadows, a whole host of issues, and so those edge conditions that are outside of that immediate side area should there be impacts to a would be considered as part of the environmental impact statement and would be referenced likely in the scoping the draft scope of work in terms of that being incongruous in Congress to what you've been presented, there are times in which a zoning action on a larger set of tax slots can facilitate the eventual design of the building, and so that there might be reasons to include or exclude particular lots within a rezoning, depending on what the ultimate development proposal is seeking to get, and so that could also be something that you could scope and think of calling out those particular parcels surrounding if there are particular impacts that you want to be mindful of okay. Thank you yeah, thank you will would you want to meet Marco? Thank you. So much I have two questions since you don't want to comment about what was my intention to hear from you, because you are an expert, I'm gonna ask you very simple, two questions. This question is about what is the history of the setbacks, talk to about a little bit this world war building these people with good common sense, and this is the foundation of the Sony resolution and that we are happy with that. Can you elaborate that part? That is extremely important in our case and the second methodology of the cqr I found that I believe there is a global warming and, according with the methodology of this Cqr manual, they find out that they propose millions of btus and I. Did a calculation of a brief calculation I think they're asking for two millions of btus per floor and even themselves they recognize they said. Oh, they need a robust dots. So that means the this book I think is probably is no review yet, and the consequence of this book is against of the world global warming. I, don't know you want to comment about that. These two questions. Thank you! So the first well, there are three things in there: I'll go over. The first is you are also an expert in your neighborhood. The reason that I'm not going to comment on 2nd Avenue as someone who's sitting in Brooklyn at the moment is because you know I would want to study the impacts and talk to you. That's one of the great things about this program and why I love working in this program is because we really want to elevate communities as experts in their own neighborhood and many communities. Members are experts in their own neighborhood. The hard part is being an expert in the land use review process, and so what we want to do is match that expertise with the land use, review process and so I think. The questions that you're raising about on 2nd Avenue are really important and should be raised in the land use process about setbacks. I think they come about as a response to a couple of things. One is around sky exposure plane, and so there is an idea that you should be able to see the sky from the sidewalk as part of like light and air and public health, and so by. If you could imagine having a building, you would want a sky exposure plane. That would then allow sunlight and air and the visible sky, and so in order to accommodate that, you would then step back the building, so you would have it set back on those upper floors to allow light and air to hit the street. The other reason to do it from an urban design perspective is to minimize the impact of larger buildings from the street level, and so, if you have an upper a significant upper level setback, it's oftentimes not perceivable from the street, especially if it's a larger building and so what you end up with as a result, is you get the base of the building, helping to define the street edge or the ceiling of the building, and so you might have a six-story facade that then steps back, and then it has a point tower above it, but when you're on the street, it feels like you're walking in a place that has a much smaller scale and so I think in response to both of those things, light air and urban design sensibility around the perceptions of height. Those are the reasons that we've seen more applications of building setbacks throughout the city in a variety of applications. Can you remind me of the second question the book, the manual of the Cqr, the secret manual? Yes, and the consideration of sustainability factors and so I think there are lots of ways to improve the technical manual I. Think adding more evaluation of sustainability is important. I think there have been some updates, particularly around energy production. Certainly, the state has set aggressive goals. The city has followed up those goals, their requirements for green buildings and green roofs on new buildings in New, York City. Those elements are important to look at. You have to also recall remind yourself that seeker is a disclosure document, and so in that process they would say. Yes, we are creating a lot of energy through this use through the intensity of use in this building. However, that is a result of the function of like air quality, moving air, the requirement to heat and cool space for comfort in the center, and so you can verify one thing, I'm sorry! Yes, this will clarify. One thing is the conditioning, and another thing is the ventilation. There are 16 two different things and in this case that's what it is one. But in addition to that, there is the new local law 87, that all the buildings have to be in compliance for a reduction of 40 percent, of the reduction of the energy and with two millions of btus multiply for the factor that they give you. This building is probably going to be very low, which, until 2024, it will be fine, but that's what they expect to finish, but after 2024 it will be annoying compliance. It will be on local, but the cqr doesn't address this point right. What it would disclose those points it wouldn't address them, it would disclose them and I think what you do with that information and how that influences your decision or what that might mean for project mitigation, and so, if that means more aggressive use of solar energy or other things, to offset the substantial energy use of the building to be in compliance with the vision of the neighborhood. Knowing that information allows you to then comment on it, the secret process doesn't make the decision and the determination it only sets out the questions and discloses that information to be included in the decision-making process, and so it does not take out the decision-making process from each of the people in that process and ultimately the council on the city Planning Commission. Thank you, you're welcome. Does anyone else? Have any questions? I have a couple of questions, so the mayor tweeted back in September, that we have some major rezonings coming up, De Blasio says I'd. Imagine turning some heads and this was reported by Ben Max. He cites the blood center. So aside from the unfortunate issue of timing, in other words, saying that there will be rezonings before there's been any kind of review process. Does that have any impact at all on the process? Is that the mayor apparently is pushing this through I? Don't know, I wouldn't read the mayor's tweet. Necessarily that way, I think there are a number of applications that are coming towards the city. We have seen a number of applications throughout the city, whether that's Gowanus, whether that's industry city, whether that's southern boulevard and the Bronx. And so there has been a strategy both by the private sector and by the city, to re-zone different parts of the city, to accommodate additional growth, to support the production of affordable housing by the private sector through mandatory inclusionary housing and so I. Think. When you look at the last seven years of the De Blasio administration and look at the legacy of rezonings I. Think that to read into that, as not being necessarily continuation of that, we've seen a lot of interest both by the city and by the private sector, in additional capacity in different parts of the city. And so it's hard for me to look at that and say that by some means that the city has made a decision independent of this review process. I think it is more a reflection that, in spite of all the challenges that we're facing as a city when I look at what's happening with commercial development, for example, or commercial uses, with many offices being shut down retail spaces being shuttered, the idea that there's millions you know a million square feet of commercial space being proposed in downtown Flushing is I. Think a testament to that people are really betting on New York and really believe that they'll continue to be demand for these types of spaces and so I think, given where the mayor sits. It's hard to ascribe which one of those things is that, like a New, York, Resilience, New York, is resilient comment is that you know. Can people are continuing to want to build comment? Is that I support this? These projects comment? I can't speak to what that says, but I certainly see the implication. Is these projects should be evaluated and then we should make a determination, as opposed to rezonings are coming. I would say, applications are coming, people are interested in building and investing in New York and investing in neighborhoods and communities should have a say and be equal partners in that, and so I think it's an interesting question, but that would be my sensibility. Those are the lenses that I would look at that comment through and then some members of the community and some board members are concerned about for the blood center that more than two-thirds of the building would be used by a for-profit life sciences developer. Is there a place in the scoping report or announce what we submit to raise the idea of altering the zoning in such a great way as a to benefit a private developer? Is there I mean? In other words it's not they're, not just looking for community facility they're, also looking for commercial and is there a place for that? Certainly there's a place to be critical of the tenant. I think you know. If we look at precedent for that, I think we could look at a place. We could look at some of the island campus development right of like who's. What institutions are going to be on this land? That's being rezoned, to accommodate things that protect potentially on like Roosevelt Island right like there is criticism of what those uses were. Certainly if one of the elements in the zoning application is to allow for additional commercial uses, then what are those additional commercial uses for like? Why do you need that additional commercial floor area? And that's a question? That's really the program of the site that you would be commenting on. Okay and then I just have one more thing, but it doesn't pertain to the blood center I didn't notice on the zoning map that there was a zoning application for governor's island, which I think is a city-wide issue is, did I miss that is it there, because it's we're not hearing an awful lot about it and I'm just wondering if it's even on the map and then that's all. Thank you. I believe it is on the map. Yeah I, believe, there's information about that. Yeah there's been some delays on the zoning portal with Covid-19 in terms of updating, but they do a pretty good job of doing routine maintenance. It's also a tool that I think we want to see more of from the city, I think New York, City planning labs through the zoning and land use map and the zoning application portal have really. You know, tried to extend a hand to communities to really demystify like the idea that I could would tell you. Here's how you go here are all the documents that you need to track: here's the seeker, access portal, here's this! There's that here's this to be able to really condense and consolidate all that information into one place that I could just go and find out. All the information I need to be informed about a project is I, think a real testament of the city's you know interest to include and involve the community. It still is like grossly technical, and you know a really complicated planning process, but I trust that you know. Community boards can really develop the expertise and I'd really encourage to really have a strategy as like subcommittees or members of committees, to really think about in the duration of your time on the community board. What are the spaces of expertise that you really want to lean into and who can maybe be your buddy so that you have someone to review those aspects and bring that back to the broader board, because it's too much information to really sift through for one person? It's certainly too much information for one person for like a group of 20 people to sit through all individually. You also obliquely bring up the term limits for board members now and the idea of the institutional memory and how to organize all of this information and all of the research and all of the opinions and questions and requests for explanation in one place so that it can be used by subsequent generations. Shall we say yes to build that capacity so that it's there to really think about that as a board of like how do you want to be transferring knowledge and making sure that there's a continuation of both those hard skills of like how do we find out about how do we find the documents for seeker, but also, what's the history of second avenue or going to a one way on first, you know like that's. Those are all really critical to really make sure that the community board can have a legacy voice, but also be really responsive to new energy. New ideas, new perspectives and also like there's planning fatigue is also real and so I think you know dealing with a lot of planning projects. It can be helpful to tap on a neighbor and say I would really love you to join this conversation, so that I can do some other things as well, because it does take a lot of time and I appreciate the time and effort and energy that you all have committed to really take on this role. It's really critical to the health of our city, to the way that our city looks and feels and functions, and you are real stewards of that and that's not lost on me as someone who has a professional planning and architecture degree and knows what depth one can go to with these things. Thank you well having thank you for having us, I'm sorry, I interrupted you I just said. Thank you for your advocacy yeah. Well, thank you for being able to come here. It's looking at and listening to people with a lot of experience and expertise and who can pinpoint issues that really makes a difference for us. So just on behalf of everyone. Thank you so much for devoting almost two hours of your evening here and providing so much information. Thank you and I assume. If we have other questions we could get in touch. Please do yes great! Thank you. We really appreciate it. Okay, then, with it's not a real board meeting, so we don't need a motion to adjourn, but it's not a committee meeting, but is there a motion to adjourn anyway just to cover all bases, great Marco and Elizabeth seconded? So on that basis we we'll stay adjourned and thank you again Spencer. It was really a pleasure to have you and thank you will, as usual, bye.
