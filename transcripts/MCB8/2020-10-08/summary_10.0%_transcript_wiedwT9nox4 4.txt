We are just going to jump right into our agenda tonight because we have a speaker for and our presenters here Well, it's an update on the resumption of construction of the east Midtown Greenway and Andrew Haswell Green Park, Phase, 2B, and I'm eager to hear that wonderful, presentation.
Many of you know, the governor, issued an executive order that halted all non- essential construction work in the city.
Details again, just as a reminder and then going through the through the schedule and what folks should expect to see and then, of course, we'll be coming back to the community board, with additional updates as the project progresses, but excited to be here and with that I will turn it over to evie.
Think at that point we had explains that we strategized and determined that the best way to deliver Andra, Haswell, Green 2B was to also pair it with east Midtown greenway, which is a larger project south, so just to provide a little bit of quick context.
The, east Midtown greenway project even further is part of a larger conceptual plan for the east Midtown Waterfront esplanade, so that was originally conceived as three separate sections going from south to north being the right of the screen.
The design team, which is comprised of stantec for Eastmantown, Greenway and Jacobs for Andrew We, wanted to have some unifying elements such as the park, standard, hex, pavers, standard, light fixtures and sea rails, but we also wanted to give a really interesting quality as you walk along this entire esplanade.
This is the existing park where we are putting the bridge ramp, access which goes over the Fdr and connects down here at 53Rd Street, and you would walk along this white box.
There is that we would basically fortify the ramp such that construction, vehicles and materials can come down so that we could build the rest of the esplanade and then work our way back out and finish.
That's this pedestrian bridge right here that will be done in 2021, Clara, Coffee, Park or something place park at 54Th. Street will reopen in fall of 2021 and then the entire greenway, including Andrew Hussell Green2B, will be open in 2023.
So, it's a chance for bikers to pull off and take a look out at the water in the landscape and then to the right is an aerial view of what the 60 street ramp would look like with the new pavement treatments.
And, there's no surprises out there in terms of you know where there are temporary closures or where work needs to be happening, so appreciate everybody's patience during that time, So members of the members of the public or any questions starting with Judy hi.
Think it's one of your early drawings with Clara coffee color, because I've gotten a lot of questions from people in the area and also people from board six that I happen to know and come in contact with that.
And I do not know if this is correct or not, but the south end of that drawing going up to where the ramp is there going to be seating there, because a lot of seniors go there, people in wheelchairs etc.
I know we talked about that a lot at the last committee meeting So the repairs to the sea wall that are going on throughout the esplanade are being overseen it by Parks, Department, This is an EDC run, projects excuse the baby, but, and so you guys are not repairing any, you guys are actually building new esplanade.
You lose a great opportunity to divide the cyclists from the pedestrians because remember at the parks, senior cities is going over there and you had to protect them Obviously, you had to provide access for the cycles.
Then the this, the design, itself, and I, think you have to give more priority to the pedestrians We talked about how, in this area, where there is a shared space for bicyclists and pedestrians, maybe doing some sort of treatment to the hex pavers or something to sort of like show a place for bikers to be versus where pedestrians would really be.
The entry point to our community board from this other beautiful work that you're doing south of the district, and I and three I you know, that's an area that has been closed off to folks for a very long time.
It may be where our community board feels like they want to pass a resolution or make some actual suggestions for how that's going to be.
And I think I think that trisha you're right that we did talk about this last time and the and parks may be able to speak to phase three, since we were not brought on board to do that part in particular, and I'm, not sure if that project is funded right, now.
Do think that I just think that you are touching that area, but we do not know exactly what that looks like and particularly as you have, and I'm imagining cyclists going into this dark corridor and pedestrians going into the stark corridor, and it just seems like, even if it's not your project, and even if it is parks, overseeing.
Now I had an answer for felice who was asking about what was happening to the sea wall and in this particular section, which has become part of this project under Andrew Haswell Green EDC Will be fixing the pilings under that part of the park that need fixing.
Elita had asked our every committee to think about how issues of justice and equity impact, our specific committees and Barry, and I had already just given the timing of our meetings and what was on the agenda said that we were going to do just that, but wanted to had to put it now in the fall.
You know, look over designs and proposals and that sort of thing, but I wanted to give us the space to talk about this and to just get any sort of thoughts that anybody had on these issues.
I think that over the past year, there have been a few instances where I've, where I've thought like this may be something that we want to talk about thematically later on one instance that came to mind Was the whole Amy cooper situation in central park, where, where there was somebody who was using their power and their privilege to to influence and to you, know, harm.
What we can hope for, is to generate a conversation with ideas and different ways of moving forward, that it takes a while to get answers and it takes a lot of community input to get answers or even to get talking points to get thinking points and that this is.
Perhaps if our members on the zoom have any questions, comments, observations, thoughts, I'd like to share, please send them to will at the board office, who will then disseminate them to Trisha, and I, and me I do not want to put everybody on the spot And we'll take any comments that people have now.
She said the only work that's being done is below 96th street, and I said, oh, my god, come to 77th street and let's see what you see there, but I think that may be a dialogue where it is not that fishing is in Cb11 The way we're doing, and I'm trying to have the committee that Rebecca and I a co- chair of to work with that type of thing.
It's one walkway, I, often walk north And I think that we would open up and have a better dialogue that way, I will say that we've been trying to we've reached out to Cv11 a handful of times to try to work on this together.
What comes to mind a lot of what elita was it a leader who mentioned Amy, Cooper or whoever mentioned Amy cooper, of course that's relevant and how we think about also policing in our parks and whether the parks are a place where policing in this sort, of, certainly in the criminalization sense can be removed and things can go in sort of a more civil way or a way in which we rely more on arts enforcement rather than NYPD.
Schurs Park, where I know Trisha was incredibly responsive earlier in the summer, and others have been involved where signs were being taken away and destroyed, and vandalized, and I think, or I hope.
You know, people of color in our community who are experiencing our parks differently than I am, and just an effort to bring in those voices to this type of meeting, I think would serve us well.
I think we all need to sort of do a lot of listening and figuring out where we can play a role and hopefully bring this type of thing back on the agenda at a meeting soon If this is your first community board meeting, then I'm really glad that you chose parks.
If you have any additional questions about how this committee works or how community awards work, but we're very glad, you're, here, and I hope that you come back to this committee, and I hope that you bring your thoughts and concerns to this committee as well , I just wanted to say, I've been in that situation, personally, the gentleman in the park with the dog, probably at least a hundred times at John, Jay, Park, specifically and several times also a car shares and No matter.
Often we have people who stalk the vigil they drive up and one of the people who drove through the Columbus circle protest is someone who parks outside of our vigil and just sits there kind of harassing us Then there's one person from the neighborhood who comes, So I'm the school teacher and My brain's litified Right, now torments a lot of the members and is very against what we're doing calling us fascists, our anti- fascists and any community board support backing us up that we are allowed to be doing.
Trisha was in order to to look about and think about, Carl Schertz Park, because those are different issues than central park and and they deserve a discussion and where there is an action that threatens the ability of people to use the parks in any way.
I do not feel, like you see a great amount of diversity within the park, certainly not what is in line with the rest of the city or even perhaps our community district, and then I guess.
We have to make sure that we know that our parks are city parks, that people from any place can come, and particularly our pools.
John Jay Park, particularly the pool when it opens up, would be an area that we should spend time talking about and making sure that it's welcome for everybody from every area of the city.
And, but I think that some of the things that you're talking about are just are just like values that we have to keep in mind or things that we have to keep and remind ourselves with every park that we address and every issue that comes up.
We have several volunteer projects coming up and, as I said, with the Covid-19 We've kind of had to modify and change things we're working through some of those changes.
A safety issue, especially now, since people are really walking a lot more in this area because of Covid-19.
It's definitely a much bigger issue than it was, and that's something for the designers and the architects to think about and part and in parks and force parks , In other words, that everybody should think about how you're going to streamline or not, it's not really streamlined, but how to extend that area around with all of the you know.
There was discussion earlier about an area where bikes are separated from pedestrians, and I think this is going to increasingly be an issue for that whole area to be considered.
And I've seen a lot of issues along the both the ramp, both at the top of the esplanade and in that Teeny narrow area and the bikes.
Okay, we'll take a look at this, a lot of people going by and tons of people walking through in that area and bikes.
So the areas of central Park, like I, say I mean if it's a bike.
It's been on the radar of parks, because when I looked at a Google street view from July 2019, the area was barricaded, but it did not seem like there had been any sinking or apparent thinking or clearly a hole.
