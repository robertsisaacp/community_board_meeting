I've had heat on, as my sister-in-law, said, you're, just not used to being here at this time of the year, which is true Oh great, so you'll notice they'll be up first And, then everybody else is going to appear after them in alphabetical order by first name, okay, But we can reach out to who we want to participate from the public, You me He may have stepped away from you!.
I will tell him: it's been a very difficult time for the family to close a restaurant after 30 say five years We they want it to close, but god bless them they're trying to do stuff with the community.
It is in the pre-application stage at city planning, and what we'd like to do is hear anything that tony that you have to say about what cpc is up to at the moment and then anything that department of buildings can do, because it's bitter as we're working on getting something widely supported in the community to protect the community in its quality of life and people.
Communicating with talk is that, as time has moved on, our budget does not have anybody to continue the work on the applications.
We hope that will change very shortly, but there are some issues, but we are thankful that in our meeting with you with every single elected official there that you they were supporting where we're coming and that you acknowledged you wanted to work with us, and we know that there was another non-profit that put in an application that you denied.
You know we don't support the proposal, but we will work with you to make sure that it proceeds through the land use process.
We told you what we have contributed fair share, so we want to work with you, but I want you to have an open mind and remember what we said at that meeting, both elizabeth and myself and others that you are not going to take the east side and think we owe the city because you put a subway there.
What I want you to be is open as we move forward with the application and don't do what you did to other community groups.
Side, the prevailing height limit on the upper east side and the height limit that has the support of the community, we're proposing saving the tenements in the small buildings and who doesn't want to save affordable housing, and we want to save the local service stores and retail stores.
Any members of the public have a question about this, or so you have five people have their hands up, starting with elite camp and then valerie mason and then two members of the public, wendy and andrew, and then marco tamayo, Okay, fine, Take the public people first, okay, I come before you tonight to ask you to commit to supporting and promoting a 210 foot height cap for all construction and to calling for a temporary moratorium on the destruction of smaller buildings.
For decades, new yorkers have been given the false promise that taller real estate construction would provide upgraded transportation, affordable, housing, lower homeless rates, new senior center schools and the like, and as sky high additions were used as inducements to developers to provide these necessary components of neighborhood life.
We need to initiate an action, a plan, an absolute 10 to an absolute 210 height cap and a temporary stay on the destruction of the smaller buildings that have safely provided us with affordable housing and neighborhood services.
Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to speak about the 210 foot height cap application, And I'm, so thrilled with what the previous speaker discussed both separating the idea of tallness in buildings with affordable, housing, which, as we've seen, is not true, but also introducing the climate change aspects of these tower.
A. Recent harvard study has shown that when people are exposed to air pollution over longer periods of time, they're, eight percent more likely to die from Covid-19, and so I'm asking the department of city planning the department of buildings and also the departments of environmental protection and health to look seriously at a 210-foot height cap.
And I'll talk with you tomorrow, but I do want to make it publicly known now that I'm speaking for east 79th street neighborhood association And, if you ever have a problem with funding for something as important that we all support what you're doing we will try to get funds.
There's, just no proof that these taller buildings bring affordable housing into our community rather taking down the tenements.
We will be prepared to provide that information to dcp, with the expectation that it will encourage you to be a more enthusiastic supporter of our application, because it will not only preserve affordable housing, but actually.
We believe, bring more affordable housing into the community by taking some of the pressure off of the the crazy development.
If we were a private developer So, we don't get any more points that we're in the community My understanding from talking to other not-for-profit groups, is that new york city is one of the few major metropolitan city in cities in the united states of America.
Are there any chance or any oppor or possibilities that, since it's hard to visit in the and find out any information in the building department, one of you can are notified directly to the community board, especially those development, on the avenues in question.
I counted 12 developments all around the unexploding, the advantage of the second avenue and all of them they demolish 777, affordable units and they are going to build just only 44.
Indeed in our community, the developer they're coming And, they use the old vouchers and you guess what they produce: affordable housing in the declining areas.
Let that person speak first, okay, maggie, lehman I believe it was tony's statement that city planning believes the upper east side remains the right place for increased density, and I wanted to point out that.
I think we as a community need to listen to all of what you've said and say that we are a community that is under-resourced but over-developed, and that we need to look at and it'll be the next item, Maybe it's this item on the gender We have for many years, supported, affordable housing, We can't afford it in our neighborhood and they move to other boroughs, and we are saying now we need to have the affordable here within the constraints of the zoning and move forward, but we are supportive of what we need to be as a community and the upper east, side, yorkville, etc.
The department of city planning has rebuffed our advances and the issue with the affordable housing discussion that everyone brings up is that in the last couple of years, the city and the state have chipped away.
Preserving the affordable housing with people already living in it is much more important and I think that's what our proposal does.
Our community board has supported, affordable, housing.
They didn't one of the things they said was that if we can show them that we will not lose affordable housing units that they will be more enthusiastic supporters of our of our proposal to get height limits.
You know I respect you, but I just have to say that this is not only a means to preserve the community but a means to bring in and retain the affordable housing that we have.
The residential tower is gone, and I want to thank the community group that organized and worked hard on this, as well as the community board that worked to preserve that area.
The participants button to open the participants box and you'll find a raise hand button in that box Maybe the community could not make it tonight I'm delighted to hear that residential building on park is no longer in play.
If it's going to be used for the hospital, that's good news, but I think we still have to be vigilant that a hospital building won't approach the height that they were, that they were proposing for the residential building.
So I think, as we go, forward, we've taken the position thus far, that the a building that is two and a half to three times allowed by the zoning resolution.
If they want to make changes in the mid block, we ought to think about how they can do that without damaging the community, such as a full lot coverage, because if you only block in yourself, we don't care.
I. Think that that's where we've been successful so far, and I'm hopeful that in the future, as we look at what the final design is going to be, if we keep staying on it, the way we have with the community.
I am remaining optimistic that the hospital will be more interested in in coordinating with us and interested in our feedback as they develop their plans, as gal mentioned, anthony has come to those meetings with very strong ideas about how to allocate space so that they don't need to build that kind of tower how to phase the construction, which has been their justification for that size tower, so that they don't need to use that and, and just to believe, that the hospital will be interested in health issues around the city and in complying with the zoning resolution that we have so that they can modernize the hospital so that they can handle a surge.
The issue on third avenue is: there are no height limits, and so they can do whatever they want, but we've been assured- Okay, we'll move on any other public members or our board members before we move on.
Explaining about the notices to community boards about changes in zoning lot designations we'd be very grateful.
If I can speak to a specific proposal that you're mentioning, but I can say that you know the department of city planning has come out on record at a city council meeting saying that we would support a local law that would provide notice to community boards.
The department of finance, not through the department of city planning or the department of buildings, and so we are in support of any sort of legislation that would change the transparency of zoning lot.
I would hope you would add, cutting off pieces because we have a building, that's built, on, I think 88th street, where they got around the zoning by chopping off an unbuildable chunk and to in order to So your first question about specifics of that proposal.
Let them know before I go all right, scott from the public and then michelle scott I work with I work with tony, So I mean I was only raising my hand, because I can't actually unmute myself, but really wanting to sort of reiterate that the department doesn't have an active project to try and make this happen.
In light of what I heard, I would like to make a resolution supporting that transparency for changes in zoning lot designations and, if seconded I'll, speak to it, because we can then clarify the language, but I didn't want to miss the chance of making the resolution.
I think we're within our rights in writing a general and supporting a general resolution that says we support being notified about any changes in zoning lot designations and any other kind of transparency.
To then provide this public space, and there was an issue with tony's restaurant on I'm, going to say 64th and 3rd, where they took over that site and the residents of the building raised.
They have serious issues and in working with cpc and DOB around what certain pops wanted to do to even make it more accessible and safe.
But we have no issue going back out there again to confirm that the pop site is open if the pop site is closed, we can't issue a violation of the owner, but you can notify the appropriate group that they're still in violation and that's what we need to hear, because we do not want our residents to be not denied any of the limited open space that we have.
I mean the pops has been a major issue for us in the community, with many sites not being available to based on our study to people in the community, because even the buildings did not know that they had a pops.
Was: Do the people purchasing in these buildings Understand their responsibility to pay for a pops, and it's been unknown, but we'd appreciate you going out and making sure we have as much open space at this point.
Because I have another plaza in Yes, I know, but given whether it's covert or not, these pops are be open to the general public and when you are perceived by the public as not a public space, people then do not enjoy what we were forced upon by the changes in zoning with the development rights.
So I, don't think that the pop is sacrosanct at this moment in time and considering the fact that there is a way for the public to use it.
If you wanna, okay, I, just wanted to say that the community is an absolute support of our small businesses.
It's still in the sign moratorium right now, The community board know where we have people who have applied for these science, because it is an environmental infiltration of our area, and people have been complaining.
This is a really good opportunity to look at the city while it's undergoing so many changes, and the reason I brought it up here is because if it were voted on in zoning and development, because it is a question of development, then at the community board it wouldn't take up new business because our meetings run so long.
So we wanted the community to know that this indeed does not fit in the zoning for 67th street, but that something is being proposed and we need to know- Some kind of a meeting with the community board on this.
But we wanted to alert the community that something is a coming from the blood center on 67th between second And I must say: I think we did- handle the northwell issue and the tower on park.
