Oh great, so you'll notice they'll be up first And, then everybody else is going to appear after them in alphabetical order by first name, okay, But we can reach out to who we want to participate from the public, Then you see, city planning just showed up.
It is in the pre- application stage at city planning, and what we'd like to do is hear anything that tony that you have to say about what Cpc is up to at the moment and then anything that department of buildings can do, because it's bitter as we're working on getting something widely supported in the community to protect the community in its quality of life and people.
Communicating with talk is that, as time has moved on, our budget does not have anybody to continue the work on the applications.
We hope that will change very shortly, but there are some issues, but we are thankful that in our meeting with you with every single elected official there that you they were supporting where we're coming and that you acknowledged you wanted to work with us, and we know that there was another non- profit that put in an application that you denied.
We told you what we have contributed fair share, so we want to work with you, but I want you to have an open mind and remember what we said at that meeting, both Elizabeth and myself and others that you are not going to take the east side and think we owe the city because you put a subway there.
That has the support of the community, we're proposing saving the tenements in the small buildings and who does not want to save affordable housing, and we want to save the local service stores and retail stores.
For decades, new yorkers have been given the false promise that taller real estate construction would provide upgraded transportation, affordable, housing, lower homeless rates, new senior center schools and the like, and as sky high additions were used as inducements to developers to provide these necessary components of neighborhood life.
We need to initiate an action, a plan, an absolute 10 to an absolute 210 height cap and a temporary stay on the destruction of the smaller buildings that have safely provided us with affordable housing and neighborhood services.
Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to speak about the 210 foot, height cap application, And, I'm, so thrilled with what the previous speaker discussed both separating the idea of tallness in buildings with affordable, housing, which, as we've seen, is not true, but also introducing the climate change aspects of these tower.
A recent Harvard study has shown that when people are exposed to air pollution over longer periods of time, they're, eight percent more likely to die from Covid-19, and so I'm asking the Department of City planning the department of buildings and also the departments of environmental protection and health to look seriously at a 210-foot height cap.
And I'll talk with you tomorrow, but I do want to make it publicly known now that I'm speaking for East, 79Th, Street, Neighborhood Association, and if you ever have a problem with funding for something as important that we all support what you're doing we will try to get funds.
You ever have a problem like this again and for now I'm hoping that whatever who, with whomever you're speaking tomorrow, morning, that you will get the funds, but you have neighborhood associations who are there , it took what did it take 20 years for city and suburban, so we're kind of used, to, We will make sure it happens, and we will absolutely be out to your group and all the other community groups, because we do have the support of our elected Ben Kayla's for 210 and let's move it forward.
There's, just no proof that these taller buildings bring affordable housing into our community, rather taking down the tenements.
We will be prepared to provide that information to DCP, with the expectation that it will encourage you to be a more enthusiastic supporter of our application, because it will not only preserve affordable housing, but actually.
We believe, bring more affordable housing into the community by taking some of the pressure off of the the crazy development.
If we were a private developer So, we do not get any more points that we're in the community My understanding from talking to other not- for- profit groups is that New York City is one of the few major metropolitan City in cities in the United States of America.
Are there any chance or any oppor or possibilities that, since it's hard to visit in the and find out any information in the building department, one of you can are notified directly to the community board, especially those development, on the avenues in question.
Indeed in our community, the developer they're coming And, they use the old vouchers and you guess what they produce: affordable housing in the declining areas.
I wanted to point out to everyone at the virtual meeting tonight that if the past seven months have taught us anything about life in a big urban area about life in New, York City, it should be that the definition and the pros and cons of density must be revisited.
I think we as a community need to listen to all of what you've said and say that we are a community that is under- resourced, but over- developed, and that we need to look at and it'll be the next item, Maybe it's this item on the gender We have for many years, supported, affordable housing, We can't afford it in our neighborhood and they move to other boroughs, and we are saying now we need to have the affordable here within the constraints of the zoning and move forward, but we are supportive of what we need to be as a community and the upper East side, Yorkville, etc.
So I, think that I hope that city planning will open its mind and not take just the position that they do not support, 210, think about 210 realize it what it means to our community and do not put it off the table.
The Department of City planning has rebuffed our advances and the issue with the affordable housing discussion that everyone brings up is that in the last couple of years, the city and the state have chipped away.
Now the city only allocates 100, affordable, projects, they've, taken away the ability to transfer bonuses, off- site, so projects that we're going to do affordable, big, affordable, components, I'll point you to 511 East 86th, street.
Preserving the affordable housing with people already living in it is much more important and I think that's what our proposal does when saving the tenants in the smaller buildings.
Our community board has supported affordable housing.
They did not one of the things they said was that if we can show them that we will not lose affordable housing units that they will be more enthusiastic supporters of our of our proposal to get height limits and, as Elizabeth said, preserving the tenements, preserving the walk- ups and preserving small business adds to the community nature and decreases the pr.
You know: I, respect you, but I just have to say that this is not only a means to preserve the community but a means to bring in and retain the affordable housing that we have.
The residential tower is gone, and I want to thank the community group that organized and worked hard on this, as well as the community board that worked to preserve that area, and we will continue to work with Northwell and Andy if you're there.
So I think, as we go, forward, we've taken the position thus far, that the a building that is two and a half to three times allowed by the zoning resolution.
I. Think that that's where we've been successful so far, and I'm hopeful that in the future, as we look at what the final design is going to be, if we keep staying on it, the way we have with the community.
I am remaining optimistic that the hospital will be more interested in in coordinating with us and interested in our feedback as they develop their plans, as Gal mentioned, Anthony has come to those meetings with very strong ideas about how to allocate space so that they do not need to build that kind of tower how to phase the construction, which has been their justification for that size tower, so that they do not need to use that and, and just to believe, that the hospital will be interested in health issues around the city and in complying with the zoning resolution that we have so that they can modernize the hospital so that they can handle a surge.
That's been the issue, but I remain ever hopeful that we will be able to have more input and persuade them that compliance with the zoning resolution in a purely residential There is no commercial usage in on that in that area is really valuable.
The issue on Third Avenue is: There are no height limits, and so they can do whatever they want, but we've been assured- Okay, we'll move on any other public members or our board members before we move on.
Explaining about the notices to community boards about changes in zoning lot designations, So, I, I'm, actually not sure.
If I can speak to a specific proposal that you're mentioning, but I can say that you know the Department of city planning has come out on record at a city council meeting saying that we would support a local law that would provide notice to community Boards council members.
Mergers are something that actually goes through the department of Finance, not through the Department of City planning or the department of buildings, and so we are in support of any sort of legislation that would change the transparency of zoning lot.
Are you working with finance and on what basis are they moving forward on the merger of the zoning lots and how are we going to be notified on a timely, basis?
I would hope you would add, cutting off pieces because we have a building, that's built, on, I think 88th street, where they got around the zoning by chopping off an unbuildable chunk and to in order to So your first question about specifics of that proposal.
Let them know before I go all right, Scott from the public and then Michelle Scott, And I'm from city planning, as well.
I work with I work with Tony, So I mean I was only raising my hand, because I can't actually unmute myself, but really wanting to sort of reiterate that the department does not have an active project to try and make this happen.
In light of what I heard, I would like to make a resolution supporting that transparency for changes in zoning lot designations and, if seconded I'll, speak to it, because we can then clarify the language, but I did not want to miss the chance of making the resolution.
I'm, certainly happy to have the wording you know made in any way that you all feel comfortable, but I think it would be a way of getting ahead of it, because we have plenty of chance later once the proposal is actually made to support that proposal or for all we know there might be something in it that takes away something that we would want to see in the proposal.
So, I, think if we can build on that with and again we're only talking about transparency, it's about I mean who could be against it, but we could put things in there that we know that have been hidden from us before on purpose or inadvertently.
You know not get not getting any broader, just a very closed, very simple resolution that we are asking that You know changes to transparency And whereas we would see city planning- Whoever the agencies are- would be supportive with the tra of transparency.
To then provide this public space, and there was an issue with Tony's restaurant on I'm, going to say 64th and 3rd, where they took over that site and the residents of the building raised.
Now, be because of a complaint and want to discuss really what is going on with the pops and what has city planning and DOB doing, and I turned that over to DOB and cbhc.
I just wanted to clarify one thing, the Department of city planning is not responsible for the enforcement of pops.
So we need to know now with the complaints, what is going on, and how can we help our residential pops?
But we have no issue going back out there again to confirm that the pop site is open if the pop site is closed, we can't issue a violation of the owner, but you can notify the appropriate group that they're still in violation and that's what we need to hear, because we do not want our residents to be not denied any of the limited open space that we have.
I mean the pops has been a major issue for us in the community, with many sites not being available to based on our study to people in the community, because even the buildings did not know that they had a pops.
One of the questions in our study, was: do the people purchasing in these buildings understand their responsibility to pay for a pops, and it's been unknown, but we'd appreciate you going out and making sure we have as much open space at this point, as is needed.
Me, Tony's has been a committed member of the Upper East side community for almost 30 years, we've been very supportive of every faith- based organization, every school, whether public or private, local hospitals and charitable organizations.
It takes a long time to get your approval on the pops, but this Covid-19 thing is recent and have you come up with the standard for all the pops that you've notified them about that they have to post for distancing and mass I'm asking what the city is.
Because I have another plaza in Yes, I know, but given whether it's Covid-19 or not, these pops are be open to the general public and when you are perceived by the public as not a public space, people then do not enjoy what we were forced upon by the changes in zoning with the development rights.
There was no sense on my part at all or the other adult who was with us that in any way were we made to feel the least bit uncomfortable as the public using the space thanks maggie, you have three board members with their hands: up: It's, a time where local institutions are literally dying every day and going out of business due to cobit and all the impacts of it.
If you wanna, okay, I, just wanted to say that the community is an absolute support of our small businesses.
One seventieth on third East mid eighty, fifth, okay, I'm, going to write down 70th and third, because that one, I did not get a question for you just want to follow up on the illuminated sign, request right and the state, and you raised that banners etcetera are permissible in residential communities.
This is a really good opportunity to look at the city while it's undergoing so many changes, and the reason I brought it up here is because if it were voted on in zoning and development, because it is a question of development, then at the community board it would not take up new business because our meetings run so long, but we could do it at land use also I mean for me.
Now, I think it's a really important idea: We should be considering the fact that there's going to be a new mayor in a year and a half, And. So maybe it's not right now, but at some point it would be great to take this up, because we do need comprehensive planning all around the city.
So we wanted the community to know that this indeed does not fit in the zoning for 67th street, but that something is being proposed and we need to know- But we wanted to alert the community that something is a coming from the blood center on 67th between second And I must say: I think we did- handle the northwell issue and the tower on Park.
