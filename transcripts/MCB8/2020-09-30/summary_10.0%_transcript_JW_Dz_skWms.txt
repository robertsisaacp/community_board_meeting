It's a pretty busy night in New, York City as we open our indoor dining.
You know we're going to hopefully have some good suggestions for both restaurant owners and diners, but because people are in the middle of trying to keep their businesses.
We're going to think about maybe scheduling a time, maybe earlier in the day, maybe a morning meeting at some point to shake it up a little bit see week that might encourage some of the or not encourage, but allow a lot of the small business and restaurant owners to participate before they open their doors.
Some of the people on the call from the city agencies will be more aware, but there will be 400 enforcement personnel walking around to to make sure that the guidelines are being followed and that's along with my understanding, a state police task.
You know, movable partitions in your restaurant in the indoor state in the indoor space so that you can accommodate more people at a table and move it around and another thing that this rockwell group has also thought: about.
Too, is: If you have a hostess station inside your restaurant, you might be better served to move that outside of the restaurant, to minimize the number of people indoors and also to keep one of your employees in the fresh air.
Thank you for joining us tonight, and anything that you can share with respect to on the Department of Health's involvement and what's in this reopening program, and then once we hear from the three agency members, we can open it up to the floor.
You went through really great over a really great overview of the guidelines that the state has set forth for New York City in terms of indoor dining.
Certain communities within the city, and I think it's really important for all of us, as we continue to move forward and reopen that we all take responsibility and follow all of these social distancing guidelines, because we can see that when there is no adherence to those guidelines, cases will go up and rather quickly, and so we really just want to remember- If, you're, sick, wear face covering wash your hands frequently and there's one more, but It's off, I can't remember off the top of my head: What is it stay home if you say oh and maintain physical distancing?
But you know the health experts have always indicated that indoor space is potentially more conducive to the virus being spread and transmitted, and so this is the reason why the governor and the mayor have decided on these particular rules and then also just keep in mind that again, as we continue to open.
So in terms of the health department and indoor dining, I think the most important role that our agency has in this particular part of reopening obviously would be around inspections.
If your restaurant is scheduled for an annual inspection, where you receive your letter grade, now, restaurants will be notified beforehand for to give them a period of time in which to expect an inspector before they would just show up at your business, but now they're, offering that time frame so that you can prepare your staff so that everyone has proper PPE and that you know you are able to follow those social distancing, guidelines.
As indoor dining continues that you know the restaurants are following those rules.
We have a ton of information on our website entitled restaurant reopening guidelines, which has information from the state as well as Department of Health and mental hygiene, and some other city rules and regulations.
We've been partnering with our with our sister agencies in providing the the most up- to- date, information as to how restaurants can open within the guidelines that was set forth by the state.
Take any questions that you may have pertaining to the indoor restaurant guidelines and how else we're playing a role in helping businesses understand those rules and regulations.
As, you know, my colleagues mentioned limit occupancy to 25 maximum capacity and also you know, designate separate entrances and exits for customers and employees where possible, taking a temperature of every patron at the door and also collecting information, full name phone number and address from one member of each party for contact tracing purposes, and also you know, closing indoor food service at midnight and just social distancing.
You know, businesses would have to go through DOT , I guess to apply for the open restaurant program, but we can follow up with you in terms of any updates on the star.
I was not quite sure what you and Valerie were referring, to, that there are 400 people Is, That from the mayor's office from the police, department, from what Department of Health that's going out to enforce, Is it for like public plazas and how does that work?
That's for those neighborhoods in which we're seeing that uptake in cases with regards to the indoor dining enforcement of all of the social distancing guidelines, those will be made up of multiple inspectors from different agencies and the state, and so I do not have an actual number of how many of those people it will.
But at this point, I believe the mayor's office of special enforcement or the mayor's Office of operations is pulling together inspectors from all the agencies that have inspectors so that they're all trained up on indoor dining regulations and that they will be the ones dispatched out to restaurants to make sure that they're all following the state's guidelines.
I'm guessing that DOH is incredibly strapped right now, but are there either DOH or other agency staff that could be doing that kind of enforcement or education in the same way that the mayor's office is taking inspectors from other departments to train them on restaurant inspection?
So, if they're, very close together does a partition work instead of the distancing and are there specific guidelines about cleaning things like condiment, bottles, salt and pepper shakers I know, people are really concerned about safety, and sometimes it's the little things that make a difference.
All businesses have to read and affirm that document before they can reopen- Or you know, have indoor dining.
We used to have a lot of people, pre- theater and after theater that would come and even sit at a dining table and have like a glass of wine and a dessert or just have a glass of wine or an after dinner.
So, there's a lot of gray area, and if you could help us understand that And if, whenever it's going to go back, that people could actually sit and have a drink without eating, because you know that is all new Certainly I think you know we're following the New York state guidelines , the you know, that's the governor issues.
I did not know with regards to inspections, so they're done by the state and also there's the mayor's office of special enforcement that also handles, like business, reopening complaints and inspections.
You have like state level and also city level, but regarding indoor dining- And, you know resuming like service right for bars.
Thank you, Pauline is that a health department concern I, mean, I think, The it's more of a question for the state in terms of guidelines around ventilation and then requiring businesses to then purchase different ventilation.
I'm, not 100, sure what that would look like and how that would work for businesses that are already struggling, but definitely get the the point that Marco was making about the fact that there needs to be fresh, air.
You know: Department of Health Small business, services.
Right now in regards to indoor dining And I, you know, we have to follow New York City guidelines You know we are city agencies, but we do want to make it easier for businesses and also wanted to mention like We are city government, so I understand it can be tricky navigating, especially if there's like a language barrier We do have materials in multiple languages and if people call us I know that somebody who is dealing with a very difficult situation, you know since there's so many storefronts empty and commercial spaces.
I know that I mean, I think, every everybody, who's walking up and down the upper East side has seen a lot of tables in front of empty storefronts, where there's a restaurant adjacent to it, and the cases that I'm aware of it I mean you can't be on their property without the consent.
Think it's more than final information right here, the Small Business Administration I used to have DOV together working and different in restaurant projects.
