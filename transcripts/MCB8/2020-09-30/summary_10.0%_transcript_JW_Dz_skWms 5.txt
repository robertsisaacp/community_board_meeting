It's a pretty busy night in new york city as we open our indoor dining.
And we've got three speakers from various new york: city, health, agents, agencies, one, the department of health, the other, the department of consumer affairs and then the department of small business services, and I As everybody has learned in this Covid-19 opening environment, things can change fairly quickly, hopefully for the better, but that's yet to be determined.
We're going to think about maybe scheduling a time, maybe earlier in the day, maybe a morning meeting at some point to shake it up a little bit see week that might encourage some of the or not encourage, but allow a lot of the small business and restaurant owners to participate before they open their doors.
Some of the people on the call from the city agencies will be more aware, but there will be 400 enforcement personnel walking around to to make sure that the guidelines are being followed and that's along with my understanding, a state police task.
You know, movable partitions in your restaurant in the indoor state in the indoor space so that you can accommodate more people at a table and move it around and another thing that this rockwell group has also thought: about.
Too, is: If you have a hostess station inside your restaurant, you might be better served to move that outside of the restaurant, to minimize the number of people indoors and also to keep one of your employees in the fresh air.
Thank you for joining us tonight, and anything that you can share with respect to on the department of health's involvement and what's in this reopening program, and then once we hear from the three agency members, we can open it up to the floor.
You went through really great over a really great overview of the guidelines that the state has set forth for new york city in terms of indoor dining.
Certain communities within the city, and I think it's really important for all of us as we continue to move forward and reopen that we all take responsibility and follow all of these social distancing guidelines, because we can see that when there is no adherence to those guidelines, cases will go up and rather quickly, and so we really just want to remember- If, you're, sick, wear face covering wash your hands frequently and there's one more, but It's off, I can't remember off the top of my head: What is it stay home if you say oh and maintain physical distancing?
We know, it's been a very difficult time, especially for the restaurant industry, but you know the health experts have always indicated that indoor space is potentially more conducive to the virus being spread and transmitted, and so this is the reason why the governor and the mayor have decided on these particular rules and then also just keep in mind that again, as we continue to open.
So in terms of the health department and indoor dining, I think the most important role that our agency has in this particular part of reopening obviously would be around inspections.
If your restaurant is scheduled for an annual inspection, where you receive your letter grade, now, restaurants will be notified beforehand for to give them a period of time in which to expect an inspector before they would just show up at your business, but now they're, offering that time frame so that you can prepare your staff so that everyone has proper PPE and that you know you are able to follow those social distancing, guidelines.
As indoor dining continues that you know the restaurants are following those rules.
Now that we have indoor guidelines, we have a ton of information on our website entitled restaurant reopening guidelines, which has information from the state as well as department of health and mental hygiene, and some other city rules and regulations.
We've been partnering with our with our sister agencies in providing the the most up-to-date information as to how restaurants can open within the guidelines that was set forth by the state.
Take any questions that you may have pertaining to the indoor restaurant guidelines and how else we're playing a role in helping businesses understand those rules and regulations.
As, you know, my colleagues mentioned limit occupancy to 25 maximum capacity and also you know, designate separate entrances and exits for customers and employees where possible, taking a temperature of every patron at the door and also collecting information, full name phone number and address from one member of each party for contact tracing purposes, and also you know, closing indoor food service at midnight and just social distancing.
You know, businesses would have to go through DOT , I guess to apply for the open restaurant program, but we can follow up with you in terms of any updates on the star.
That's for those neighborhoods in which we're seeing that uptake in cases with regards to the indoor dining enforcement of all of the social distancing guidelines, those will be made up of multiple inspectors from different agencies and the state, and so I.
But at this point, I believe the mayor's office of special enforcement or the mayor's office of operations is pulling together inspectors from all the agencies that have inspectors so that they're all trained up on indoor dining regulations and that they will be the ones dispatched out to restaurants.
I'm guessing that DOH is incredibly strapped right now, but are there either DOH or other agency staff that could be doing that kind of enforcement or education in the same way that the mayor's office is taking inspectors from other departments to train them on restaurant inspection?
If we hit a threshold at any point over a five percent positive test, rate, I think everything is going to have to go back to a lockdown, but with regards to you, know, potentially pausing the indoor dining.
So, there's a lot of gray area, and if you could help us understand that And if, whenever it's gonna go back, that people could actually sit and have a drink without eating, because you know that is all new Certainly I think you know we're following the new york state, guidelines, The you know, that's the governor issues.
I, didn't know with regards to inspections, so they're done by the state and also there's the mayor's office of special enforcement that also handles, like business, reopening complaints and inspections.
You have like state level and also city level, but regarding indoor dining- And, you know resuming like service right for bars.
We turn away a lot of business that people want to have like you, know.
Pauline is that a health department concern I, mean, I think, The it's more of a question for the state in terms of guidelines around ventilation and then requiring businesses to then purchase different ventilation.
I'm, not 100, sure what that would look like and how that would work for businesses that are already struggling, but definitely get the the point that marco was making about the fact that there needs to be fresh, air.
They need to make money, and you know it's not like the government city state , whatever you want to say, didn't know that this day was going to come, so it's like when they open up.
You know: department of health, small business services.
And they do have a lot of great resources, for you know restaurants and bars with the reopening and guidance on their website, and we can definitely following up on this meeting.
You know, there's just a lot of like information right overload right now in regards to indoor dining- And I.
You know we have to follow new york city guidelines, Right, where you know we are city agencies, but we do want to make it easier for businesses and also wanted to mention, We are city government, so I understand it can be tricky navigating, especially if there's like a language barrier We do have materials in multiple languages and if people call us I know that somebody who is dealing with a very difficult situation, you know since there's so many storefronts empty and commercial spaces.
Here's the formal agreement I think it's more than final information right, here, the small business administration I used to have dov together, working and different in restaurant projects.
That, though they're small, like they're The front of their restaurant literally opens to the air, The guidelines would allow for them to have more than 25 capacity.
