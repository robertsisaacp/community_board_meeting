This evening's program focuses on the new app and includes technology, privacy and purpose we're lucky to have a with us, Dr Ted long, the executive director of the Covid-19 test and Trace Corp of New York City's health and hospitals, Albert foxconn, the founder and executive director of the surveillance technology, oversight, project, a privacy and civil rights, not nonprofit, housed at the Urban Justice Center, and he's also a fellow at Nyu Law, School's, Engelberg Center, and we have with us as well.
What I'm going to do is walk through a couple of slides that represent our approach in New York City to using the New York State Covid-19 App. I'm, going to leave time for questions.
We have nearly 4,000 contact, tracers more than half from our hardest hit communities and now we're reaching 91 of every single new case across New York City, completing interviews with nearly 80 percent of them, and we confirm on a daily basis that 98 are isolating meaning not going out there and risking infecting other new yorkers.
Then on the phone you'll see here in the middle of the slide, the app has detected that on X8 somebody has tested positive for coronavirus again being within six feet of you, so think of the ring around yourself with your cell phone for a period of more than 10 minutes, please.
Let's turn it into a little bit of a discussion before questions about the efficacy and privacy concerns regarding doing contact tracing through a digital app.
At the start of my comments is that you know, as a privacy lawyer as a technologist, I, think there's a big distinction to be made between contact tracing apps such as the Covid-19 alert, New, York App, and existing public health measures that we've had for decades.
While it is true that this uses bluetooth proximity rather than GPS, location, tracking or some of the more invasive technologies that have been considered for other exposure, notification, apps GPS pro sorry, bluetooth, proximity data can be mapped onto specific locations at specific times when paired with stationary g bluetooth, beacons.
We know that lower income individuals are less likely to have that sort of device, and so we worry that it will expand health inequality that this sort of app will give us a misunderstanding of where Covid-19 is spreading in our community, because it does not have that community focused approach that we've seen with manual contact raising because it and those blind spots we think, can be very dangerous.
And lastly, before we pivot to the Q&A, I, want to highlight the fact that there's no legal protection against having contact tracing data given over to police or even immigration.
That would require that sorry would not even allow police access to contact tracing data with a warrant, but currently they can get that information with a warrant or even a subpoena a much lower standard and that legislation, even though it was passed by the assembly in the state Senate, it still has not been signed into law by governor Cuomo, and so today there simply is no protection against that information being misused, and when we're talking about contact tracing data, it is such intimate data and trust is so indispensable to having the effective response.
And, then I think we're going to get more into some of the sort of technical aspects of it, including the efficacy and the privacy stuff a little later on, but I would just say that you know Kevin Sheldon.
I think one of the kind of basic questions that I think would be helpful for folks to hear about is just you know, as people are using the app.
I'll use Albert's words here: manual contact tracing, none of that changes with the app, not a single thing.
That actually has a really good example to try to explain how the app works, but the one thing that I'll add, is there's actually no data connection between the app itself and the contact tracing system.
We've been in several discussions, too, with with apple and Google, who you know, are responsible for developing the underlying technology that this app uses, and you know the we from a New, York state, perspective.
You know a million downloads is significant, but it's an order of magnitude less than what we would need for the app to actually live up to its stated purpose, simply because the vast majority of Covid-19 transmission will take place in instances where you do not have both people using the app and also while we've also wanted to caution that we should not assume that a million downloads equals a million users.
This question is primarily for Dr. Long, but also for Kevin or Albert, and I've read recently that there is new thinking that it's not 15, minutes or 10 minutes at one time.
It's really 15 minutes over the course of the day and whether the contact tracing either the manual kind or the app recognizes that and is able to keep track of multiple.
The next question will be, and this I defer to Kevin on in terms of if New York state additionally because they manage the app is going to make any similar changes after they've completed their evaluation.
That type of data is very challenging to well, first of all, to collect because we're the that would actually compromise the you know the anonymity of the app in regards to it being those anonymous transactions with others and with the server.
You know gender, ethnicity, etc, and that's kind of that as I mentioned, would compromise the anonymous component of it, and one thing I want to add:- is that with any of these metrics we're looking at sort of a generalization of exposure risk and none of it's ever going to be a perfect a way of capturing when any specific individual is transmitting a Covid-19 or not, because you know there are so many other forms of context that come into play.
We look to the public New York state testing, data, to where you can see the positive case, data and any testing trends, and you can actually view that on a county breakdown level as well and all of the app activity is completely anonymous.
What's going to happen, is when someone tests positive for Covid-19 a case investigator or a contact tracer from their the local health department, will ask if the person is willing to share that the apps list of what we call closed contact code.
So, what's going to happen, is within the contact tracing system, it will generate a six digit one-time pin number that the individual that, in this case, Joe, will enter on his phone and he will consent to sharing those close contact codes.
So, there's several states that have their own apps, but they use the same underlying technology and actually the same type of server to generate and issue those positive keys.
So, Covid-19, Alert New York actually works across several state lines without having to go and download the individual app from that state and more states are now looking develop.
There is so little data being collected, then what conceivable downside is there to having a clear state law that says that this information can never be used by police can never be handed over to ice, and we continue to see the governor turn Covid-19 from a public health issue into a policing issue, much to the detriment of our response.
They provide information as part of the contact tracing process to help combat this historic pandemic, or do they risk potentially putting their loved ones in harm's way, and that is why we need to make sure that we have these protections against misuse and abuse.
Organizations like Theranos, come to mind that have made really just unsubstantiated claims about the efficacy of how their systems can help solve public health dilemmas, and here the evidence just is not there that these apps are going to work, and they certainly is no evidence that they will be trusted by the new Yorkers, most at risk of dying from Covid-19.
You know any of those facts that a human being could could find during a manual contact tracing interview, which is why we think it is so important for the city to continue to focus its resources on those human interviews on those phone calls on that outreach that Dr. Long was describing and not the high-tech, solution.
They can not run the New York's Covid-19, Alert App, and where we've seen you know really the public forced to use similar systems.
We know that work, access to testing manual, contact, tracing like the program Dr. Long overseas neighbors, reaching out to neighbors, using evidence-based measures, and, of course, enacting privacy laws to make sure that every New, Yorker's health data and contact tracing data is protected.
I think we're going to get the get into more discussion about a lot of these points through the questions that we have, but Kevin I just want to give you a chance.
You know other individuals, apps look for those positive code matches to issue the alert.
Because, you know, I think we've mostly been hearing about the contact tracing component and how the codes work and that kind of stuff.
Think that's an area where I guess folks are potentially putting in more information about themselves and and that kind of thing, so I'm wondering if you can just sort of explain a little bit more, how it works, how it interacts or does not with the contact tracing feature.
It just provides you with some useful information such as hey, if you're not feeling well today, you know contact your health care provider or call the test and trace hotline.
If, you're, keeping track of your symptoms within the app you know, you'll have a not a detailed log, but just a very basic log of when you first started having symptoms, and that could be useful information in providing that to a you, know, contact, tracer or case investigator.
It seems like an open question that has not been proved one way or the other, but that being said, we do want to make sure that we have protections against potential coercion, and you know this is something that's really been a theme throughout that we oftentimes.
You know, because what you're going to do, if you test positive, is you're going to isolate yourself, so I'm a little bit confused about how we think this is actually going to work.
We should really be putting as much money and energy as possible into evidence-based measures into manual contact, tracing into support services and into making sure our testing is, you know as effective as possible.
Albert- could go into a little bit more specifics on this, which is about the kind of fear that New York state implementation of this app encourages kind of schools and universities to use their own apps or even devices that actually use geolocation tracking services for their students.
And, so I think that really we see a disconnect on the ground across New York and up in Albany, with the sentiment, lawmakers and the governor have on how to approach privacy, how to approach big tech and how to you, know.
I want to be clear, like while I do not believe that the New York App is privacy.
Encryption is very helpful as part of a secured design, but that is not a substitute for everything else that we need for this app to actually be secure for all new yorkers, and you know.
We have to also not oversell, because when there are a number of assumptions that are made by Google Apple when they're talking about the ability to re-identify someone with their code from the from their bluetooth transponder and there's so many instances that any of us can think of where that's simply not going to be privacy, preserving I, mean.
With that issue of asymptomatic people who are just going in to get tested for the hell of it, I, guess so Kevin correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the standard, regardless of the specifics for the patient, is 48 hours prior to either the onset of symptoms or the positive result, which means that you are going to have edge cases where someone has been spreading Covid-19 for an extended period of time.
It needs to know where you were located the app and again there's no communication with the contact tracing system of your general, whereabouts, etc.
Can this contact tracing app, have access to other information that may be of use not to New York state but to Google or apple, or if there are third-party apps.
You know they created a new application programming interface, a new layer of the operating system, which allows for only the authorized health app to actually use that sort of bluetooth, data.
That, actually is the perfect segue into my question, which is this is not the only contact tracing app that we have access to in the city, there's one through citizen, which seems to be extremely alarming.
So I, guess my question is: Maybe you could explain a little bit of the differences, because I do think there are some people who will choose to use the app regardless of any privacy concerns, and we want to help and make sure they're using the best app.
As with the Covid-19 Alert New York App. There's no protection there against that data than being harvested by law enforcement by third parties, and my understanding is the terms of service for the citizen.
You know really any apps outside of Covid-19 alert, New York.
You know you can only have exposure notification service enabled for one app at a time, but the one thing that I did cover in my presentation is that other states are doing this as well.
There are other apps out there, but you know Pennsylvania Delaware New Jersey, like they have very similar apps, very similar interface, and you know in many cases the Covid-19 Alert New, York App will work in those states without having to download others.
You know that I can only comment on Covid-19, alert, New, York.
The only actual push notifications that you should get on your phone from Covid-19 Alert, New, York, are.
So, as in terms of again the underlying exposure notification technology, that is, that was developed by Apple and Google, and then the New York State Department of Health, has contracted with a developer called near form, which again I can provide the link to the open source.
It does not have the specific information about funding, but I know the New York State Department of Health has partnered with tech, NYC and other bloomberg.
I mean again: New York's been working with several other state partners and out-of-state partners to not only from a security privacy standpoint from just a general usability standpoint, and the thing with this is that you know exposure notification.
Let's go to to Elita, who has another question, probably because alberto when he mentioned privacy impacts in other states and other than the interaction between other apps and the notification.
Think that my question is, if there were a sort of broad-ranging privacy protection bill coming from the state, you know along the lines of whether it's the one, you know.
