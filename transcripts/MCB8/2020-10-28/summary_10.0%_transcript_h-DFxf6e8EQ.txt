If I may ask Senator Krueger something in high center, with you, I'm very worried about election day and given the lines we've seen, I know we're going to have more sites open, but we're also going to have more voters and people.
For me, the issue is you're going to have long, lines, probably regardless, but you need a protection for people who are going to need to know that they can wait If it's going to take an hour or two, then that's what they'll have to do, and this is going to be the last chance to vote.
It's pretty easy to find me and many people find me by standing outside my front door on my block, because I've lived the same place for 31 years, also, and I think we were just joined by councilmember powers, so we're going to meet him thanks for coming: We were discussing the chaos of early voting.
We have council, member Keith powers, who's, chair of the Criminal Justice Committee of the New York City Council and State Senator Liz Krueger, who is chair of the Finance committee Who will talk about defunding, the police And then we'll open.
I always enjoy seeing folks from Cb-8, and I've also just been able to discuss things that are happening in the city and the local community, and always so good to see my my favorite state senator.
Obviously this year there was a you, know, missed Covid-19 and everything else happening in 2020 We've been having a very serious conversation about public safety and the role of the policing and budgets, and things like that in as part of those City Council's dialogue around these issues, social justice and policing issues.
This year, and I think that when we got to, as we were going through our budget process, this year, we started to talk, see and Covid-19 having such a disparate impact on different communities and also having such a large.
The council itself started to look at the mayor's proposed budget and thought it did not really accurately reflect a lot of the priorities of this community, the city and many of us, because it did attempt to start zeroing out programs that were really important to us.
So, the very beginning, we said you know doing a budget appropriately means a sacrifice in a number of different places, but we would really be making a mistake if we, if we took away you, know money for affordable housing, programs and CUNY and educate departments and fair student funding at the city level and Those something.
You know we were asking for information on the personnel and over time and same types of conversations Are we making the right decisions, and then we started to have a very serious conversation nationwide about the role of the police department and that's where we even furthermore went into start talking about functions of department and things like accountability, and I, always say you know, I, we're fortunate here.
Some people mean absolutely, you know, remove money from the police, Department New, York, City.
Think what was overspending in certain areas and to make sure we did not drastically cut other parts of the budget that would have been really undermined goals of ours in the city to keep people safe to give them opportunity.
We have some reserves that we've been able to save up over the last couple years, but also we're going to have a conversation with either federal relief or state borrowing and or additional cuts, and probably maybe some combination of things I'm always glad to do anything with Keith powers and again I give him the due respect that he is on the committee that deals with these issues.
I am not on the committee that per se deals with these issues, but I want to just clarify: We did three major changes to criminal justice reform at the exact same time, and they interrelate, and sometimes people are asking me questions This, pretty massive set of changes.
What we passed, we changed the bail laws so that new law eliminates cash bail as a pre-trial option for people accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felonies, which is disproportionately the huge numbers of people who were going into Rikers island by the way and staying there for extended period of time.
It also did not change the fact that it's not violent, felonies and if you're picked up a second time on something while awaiting trial, then that bail deal is broken and they we can charge you bail, and we can put you in Rikers until such time that you have your day in court, but the system we set up is actually been working quite effectively so far and there is statistically no increase in the number of people picked up a second time while awaiting trial.
The example that a lot of people remember is the case of Khalif Browder, who spent three years on Rikers island awaiting a trial for charges of stealing a backpack, including over 400 days, in solitary confinement despite never being convicted, and if they had the 500 for bail or we had our new bail reform laws And, he never would have been in Rikers in the first place on that kind of charge.
I'm thinking really quickly before we turn to questions, if you could just kind of maybe state what the actual purpose of bail is, because I think in this misinformation age, it's become, people have started viewing bail as a means to keep streets.
This case, I've got to give up your information, but we know that the bail reform, actually rather the discovery, law, Senator Krueger, say you can get a protective order to protect a witness and, if that's not being communicated to would-be witnesses.
So we have to, we do have to sort of have the serious conversations as community and neighbors, and I will just point out that you know with the rising rate of shooting, which is absolutely the kind of crime that scares us all and with good reason.
We're only having this number of shootings, I'm sparred, far from saying that, but we need to ask ourselves: Why do we end up in different situations, as Keith just pointed out when illegal guns can easily get to our city through other states that do not take gun laws?
If you believe in that collaborative effort here to try to make this all work, you have to come through the mayor, and so he had some different positions announced, but we go, I, certainly understand the funding problem generally And I think when I did speak to the police, they all said they think certain reforms are extremely important.
They do not want to say that that's what they're really upset about so they're saying incorrect things about bail, reform and criminal justice reform and changing the use of the city funding for police and even claiming that the city's taking away so much money that they can't even have police officers doing their jobs.
And, you know the daily news is not a liberal rag newspaper and the daily news has written this whole series of articles about the changes in crime rate have nothing to do with the changes in the law that Albany's passed or the changes in policy that the city has moved through their budget and through committees like Keith's, And, so I think it is really important that we just try to stay on fact, and I do think that will change people's attitude over time.
You know whether we would do it or not a different question, but they certainly rejected any opportunity to have a conversation about it because they wanted to sue on it and take it to gordon fight it that way, which actually will leave their members.
But look, I think, a basic thing here that the council thinks is that you can make an arrest, and you can do your job as an officer without having to resort to putting a knee on someone's neck and choke on someone, and that can not be the only basis for saying you're, not that crime is going up, which is kind of the dialer.
That's going on here, and so you know we're always happy to have a dialogue with folks to make sure that what we do, what we attend is appropriate and also we're keeping people safe, But I think that the attacks on that have been fairly fairly hard to follow and and have been, I think, still being a lot of fear amongst their members.
Many cases, quality internships, while they're still like in a high school situation, have proved to be incredibly valuable for helping young people who may not have the strongest role models in their lives for how you prepare yourself to go out and search for a job or how to make the right decisions about whether or not you should be going to college and what kind of college One of the things that I was doing all the time for people was urging them not to imagine that they had to pay for private colleges when they did not have enough money and they were trying to go back to college, perhaps after being young parents, but now have stabilized.
Well then, you're, going to apply for another college, for your junior and senior year or You'll be able to go into one of the good CUNY senior colleges, so, So we did not have anyone to ask, and the same thing is true: When you take, you know, high school students in from the Upper East side for Internships, and I, do and Keith does the difference in the knowledge base they have about the world and how they're supposed to act in a work environment and what the next possible steps are for.
So I know that this is tangential to the issue of the police and funding and and some difficulties that the city has been experiencing with the police , It's, something that might lead to, I, guess a better overall community or an environment, including between the cops and the and the neighbors and different things going on in the street.
How do we change that conversation, because the constant that thing that we're going back to when people here defund The police is exactly what you know.
Revision and some reports are really like sort of with money, but And, so I think I would talk more about that in terms of how do we focus on our priorities here in the city and budgets are always about priorities, but right, now, they're, particularly around about how do we?
There was a member of City Council, head of the Public Safety committee, who said he was willing to work with the garner family and other groups to at least address that particular part of the law and to make sure- And I.
The police like either bill, You, know different approaches, but I think we were totally in sync with each other that we're trying to make sure police are not doing serious harm to people in the process of arresting them.
In the way people would think you would mean a crime.
Like I said, the second thing is: We need that vaccine so that people actually can start moving back into jobs into restaurants into you.
When people ask me you know, do you think I might see more state money than I've gotten up till now?
