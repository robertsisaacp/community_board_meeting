We go good all right, so I want to thank everybody for coming to community Board to second regular monthly meeting Tuesday June 16th.
We are preparing and trying to keep the branches as safe as possible for both the staff and the patrons when they do come into the branch Do. We are there going to be limited number of people?
We have a presentation from Department of Parks and Recreation they're, going to present a new design for dying and playground walks I'm with a director for New York City Parks Department, and this is a little change of pace, we're looking to life beyond life beyond pandemics, and we are designing donggeun playground very excited about it.
So the goals of the project are to basically increase the play capacity within the park, while also mitigating the flood issues that are currently on site, as well as providing programs for people of all ages and abilities.
This is our proposed plan along Duncan Hills Avenue, we're keeping site access fairly open, how it is now just expanding some of the planting beds back where the game tables used to sit, we're putting in synthetic turf and moving some game tables over to the center of the park.
There will be a small two- foot wall on the street, side, that'll be shielded with planting and then a large nice piece of play equipment in the center for the big kids- This is a look at the synthetic turf area, so we're raising what was once sunken up to basically flat level so that we are meeting the planting beds they're in an aerial, view.
We've, told them that we're presenting this project, sea- What we would need from you- is a letter of support from the Community board, saying that you support the project, then that gets submitted into the public So If anyone is not in favor of this proposed design and proposed use, We'll send the letter and thank you, okay, all right.

It was about an hour and a half each night until the end of May, and maybe the third week of May, as we were heading into Memorial Day. That's seven days, a week, we switch down to two days a week for our co, ed meetings, but we still were meeting individually and the purposes of all of these meetings was to get University, Hospital, Rumsey, the nursing homes and everyone to work together to be able to deal with some of the challenges that were facing Staten Island in particular, dealing with Koban, so that you understand the nursing home landscape.
There are 3,200 licensed beds in Staten, Island, most nursing, homes.
It essentially walked in the front doors with our visitors and with our staff, and while the at first nursing homes I think we're a bit resistance to taking COBIT positive patients from hospitals.
The governor signed an executive order stating that nursing homes would not be able to use the Kovach status of a patient as a means to refuse admission to the nursing homes.
Such and such a pharmacy was willing to provide supplies at a discounted rate to nursing homes, and so we were trying to send out information and share information about accessing PE accessing support.
They made a concerted front to the governor, and it was one of the rare times that there was an exception subsequently made to an executive order, and that was to allow nursing access to the same medications that were used in the hospital if they had the facilities to be able to administer them.
So things like oral medications that were being used in hospitals were then able to be used in nursing homes, and this was a significant success win for the nursing homes of Staten Island.
We were an integral part of the movement of patients from being impatient to stabilization and then being able to go home, and we found there was a bottleneck because Char's or community health agencies visiting their service Visiting Nurse Association northwell were at first resistant to taking the cases at discharge because they did not have their own PPE for their own nurses.
Our greatest density of positive cases occurred very much in the beginning when I believe there was a lot of cross contamination from visitors still coming in from staff moving from facility to facility, and then somebody had on a political basis had criticized the governor about the rate of nursing home illness with Covid-19, and he turned his eye and really sort of started to take on the nursing homes and another thing: He was quoted in newspapers really going after nursing homes and suggesting that they never should have accepted what they could not handle.
Best majority of this loss is because there's no rehab business, the rehab patients who are able to leave early in the outbreak all left We just have losses of patients on long- term care to the k√∂ppen virus, and we do not have new admissions coming.
We all worked very closely together to try to get antibody testing done in the nursing homes on Staten Island, and this was really a push that I had because I think that population testing would really allow us to cohort patients appropriately in the nursing homes by this I mean that patients who had either tested positive or would all be together.
Those, who demonstrated no exposure to coded, could be protected in different wings of the nursing homes and based on the size that one has and the physical plant one could then allow for appropriate cohorting of residents, so that really was sort of at the cornerstone of what I wanted to do at Egger as the rehab patients will quickly.
I had weekly meetings with my medical staff and with consultants who are in the nursing home to be able to share information about the status in the nursing.
Looking at the cases per 1,000 of nursing, home residents, with positive diagnosis of Covid-19 and per 1000 in New York.
The death rate of staff in nursing homes in New, York 0.6 per 1000 in New Jersey 2.7 per 1000 in Massachusetts, 5.9 per 1000, so I think.
We have really been able to tightly control people who are positive for Covid-19 coming in contact with our patients when the test is done appropriately to check for pcr and the RNA virus by nasal swab.
We are forced to use a private lab, because the public facilities are still only supporting the hospitals and one less thing about nursing homes as an important piece of a continuum of care.
The nursing homes had not accepted those early patients, the successful decanting of the hospitals so that they could handle the cases that they dealt with I I'll give you an example of the stress that the hospitals were in normally Staten Island, University, Hospitals, north and south sight Have roughly 40 ICU beds.
