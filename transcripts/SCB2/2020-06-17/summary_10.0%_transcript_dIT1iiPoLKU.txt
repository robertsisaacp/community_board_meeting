We go good all right, so I want to thank everybody for coming to community board to second regular monthly meeting Tuesday June 16th.
Every branch could to be eight total branches, separated amongst Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx, don't know which two at this point True they're, still trying to figure out what buildings would be conducive to social distancing.
The plan is to use the branches that are opening as like test cases, and if it's successful the system that's being set up, they will open more branches in a second phase.
We have a presentation from Department of Parks and Recreation they're, going to present a new design for dying and playground walks I'm with a director for New York City Parks Department, and this is a little change of pace, we're looking to life beyond life.
Jordan Weber's on the line, here, she's, the project manager in the designer we spend a lot of time, looking at the park, understanding the flooding, that's in the neighborhood understanding the physics that are in there to give you something: It's telling me that the host just disabled, that give me a minute.
The goals of the project are to basically increase the play capacity within the park, while also mitigating the flood issues that are currently on site, as well as providing programs for people of all ages and abilities so as I'm sure you're, familiar.
Some of the issues that we focused on during the design are the circulation Some of the pavement problems, maintaining access across the site and really focusing in on the flood.
This is our proposed plan along Duncan Hills Avenue, we're keeping site access fairly open, how it is now just expanding some of the planting beds back where the game tables used to sit, we're putting in synthetic turf and moving some game tables over to the center of the park.
We would need from you- is a letter of support from the community board saying that you support the project, then that gets submitted into the public design commission and that's a big step forward for us.
I wanted to give a little overview really of what I've been involved with the Staten Island incident command for Kovach 19 has really come up as a part of the community organizations exist, I'm active in disasters.
It was about an hour and a half each night until the end of May, and maybe the third week of May, as we were heading into Memorial Day. That's seven days, a week, we switch down to two days a week for our co-ed meetings, but we still were meeting individually and the purposes of all of these meetings was to get University, Hospital, Rumsey, the nursing homes and everyone to work together to be able to deal with some of the challenges that were facing Staten Island in particular, dealing with koban, so that you understand the nursing home landscape.
It essentially walked in the front doors with our visitors and with our staff, and while the at first nursing homes I think we're a bit resistance to taking COBIT positive patients from hospitals.
The governor signed an executive order stating that nursing homes would not be able to use the Kovach status of a patient as a means to refuse admission to the nursing homes.
They made a concerted front to the governor, and it was one of the rare times that there was an exception subsequently made to an executive order, and that was to allow nursing access to the same medications that were used in the hospital if they had the facilities to be able to administer them.
So things like oral medications that were being used in hospitals were then able to be used in nursing homes, and this was a significant success win for the nursing homes of Staten Island.
We were an integral part of the movement of patients from being impatient to stabilization and then being able to go home, and we found there was a bottleneck because char's or community health agencies visiting their service Visiting Nurse Association northwell were at first resistant to taking the cases at discharge because they didn't have their own PPE for their own nurses.
Had the you know, the northwell home care service had the backing of their northwell system, so they were able to access some PPE and a much quicker fashion, but for vns and VNA.
Our, greatest density of positive cases occurred very much in the beginning when I believe there was a lot of cross contamination from visitors still coming in from staff moving from facility to facility, and then somebody had on a political basis had criticized the governor about the rate of nursing home illness with kovat, and he turned his eye and really sort of started to take on the nursing homes and another thing.
We all worked very closely together to try to get antibody testing done in the nursing homes on Staten Island, and this was really a push that I had because I think that population testing would really allow us to cohort patients appropriately in the nursing homes by this I mean that patients who had either tested positive or would all be together.
I had weekly meetings with my medical staff and with consultants who are in the nursing home to be able to share information about the status in the nursing.
Looking at the cases per 1,000 of nursing, home residents, with positive diagnosis of kovat and per 1000 in New York, there were 98 similar in Pennsylvania with 94 in New Jersey, which is a much smaller state.
We have really been able to tightly control people who are positive for kovat coming in contact with our patients when the test is done appropriately to check for pcr and the RNA virus by nasal swab.
We are forced to use a private lab because the public facilities are still only supporting the hospitals and one less thing about nursing homes as an important piece of a continuum of care.
