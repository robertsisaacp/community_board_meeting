The project is scheduled for completion for next January 2021 The goals of the project are to basically increase the play capacity within the park, while also mitigating the flood issues that are currently on site, as well as providing programs for people of all ages and abilities so as I'm sure you're familiar Next to PS 52.
Some other seating areas and then a majority of the park is this: recessed play space So. Some of the issues that we focused on during the design are the circulation some of the pavement problems, maintaining access across the site and really focusing in on the flood damage.
Blue is the projected flood plain so two major issues here and then just to give you an idea at how we're adjusting that a majority of the site is going to be raised above that floodplain Looking at the neighborhood context, the same sits above a lot of the rest of the area, but it's still at risk and we'll have four trees that are being removed because of design conflicts The existing comfort station, the central LA and game table area the play equipment You can see some of the pavement damage there.
That's my friend school Janey, so they requested more play equipment and really focus on people of all ages and all abilities that teacher patty This is our proposed plan along Duncan Hills Avenue, we're keeping site access fairly open how it is now just expanding some of the planting beds back where the game tables used to sit, we're putting in synthetic turf and moving some game tables over to the center of the park.
I wanted to give a little overview really of what I've been involved with the Staten Island incident command for Kovach 19 has really come up as a part of the community organizations exist, I'm active in disasters, that's the Staten Island Co ad Theodore, strange, representing Staten Island, University Hospital and northwell health, dr Phillip Otto Beck, representing rum C as well as Tina, Campbell and Tina also has another role in that she represents New York City's office of emergency management.
The governor signed an executive order stating that nursing homes would not be able to use the Kovach status of a patient as a means to refuse admission to the nursing homes, so the admissions had to be sort of coded blinded At the same time most nursing homes had no availability of testing.
Nice and did step up and start to feed some PPE supplies to nursing homes you would get a lot of gowns, but maybe the gowns were all extra larges, and so some of them couldn't really be utilized very variable on the n95 masks and n95 masks are still in very short supply hard to obtain such and such a pharmacy was willing to provide supplies at a discounted rate to nursing homes, and so we were trying to send out information and share information about accessing PE accessing support staff You lost a lot of staff and in the face of all of this more executive orders for coming down from Governor Cuomo, there was an executive order that barred the use of hydroxychloroquine, except for hospitals and for places that were doing formal studies.
The leadership in the state representing Staten Island They made a concerted front to the governor, and it was one of the rare times that there was an exception subsequently made to an executive order, and that was to allow nursing access to the same medications that were used in the hospital if they had the facilities to be able to administer them.
But for vns and VNA we were very helpful in getting them to get access to encourage the establishments of telehealth visits and yet that bottleneck, moved along Our. Greatest density of positive cases occurred very much in the beginning when I believe there was a lot of cross contamination from visitors still coming in from staff moving from facility to facility, and then somebody had on a political basis had criticized the governor about the rate of nursing home illness with kovat, and he turned his eye and really sort of started to take on the nursing homes and another thing.
We all worked very closely together to try to get antibody testing done in the nursing homes on Staten Island, and this was really a push that I had because I think that population testing would really allow us to cohort patients appropriately.
We have really been able to tightly control people who are positive for kovat coming in contact with our patients when the test is done appropriately to check for pcr and the RNA virus by nasal swab This swab goes right back up to the posterior Nerys and you feel like the back of your eyeball, is being scrubbed and that you have, if you can almost feel it in your brain We also have done antibody testing on patients and staff.
Now we are forced to use a private lab, because the public facilities are still only supporting the hospitals and one less thing about nursing homes as an important piece of a continuum of care.
