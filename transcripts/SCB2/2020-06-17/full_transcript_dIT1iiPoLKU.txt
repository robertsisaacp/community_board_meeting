Okay, good, alright, good evening, everybody, let's stay the Pledge of Allegiance I hope we have a there. We go good all right, so I want to thank everybody for coming to community board to second regular monthly meeting Tuesday June 16th, it's our second virtual meeting, zoom and so far so good and use the raise hand function if you'd like to speak. Thank you: okay, Theresa, okay, AJ policing by Baskin Lozano twist glad you Dolan demise somebody's tried calling garli, see: Kennedy's yeah Fred, no Hennessy Jones, Willian, Lanza yeah, yes, Markowski Mandy, dear Nina, vision, nina vadia, Orlando Missy, my cell, via this yellow, walk roll Zhanna, Rico, yeah Vince can hear, but ok thanks, Theresa some of the proposed agenda that will second. Thank you all right. First of all, Cheers report. Further. Let me just thank everybody for coming to this meeting like we'll be doing this for a while until we got our marching orders and, in effect that's how we're going to function going forward so until further notice, one of you to be supposed I don't have too many points to bring to everybody's attention. Tonight. The only the item that we did or on the top since our last meeting was, if you remember, we had that presentation on the homeless, shelter in us on Victory Boulevard and we did go on record against it and we, the city, are noticing receipt of our notice we did receive yesterday. National Grid is going to be installing a storm hardening devices throughout the city for them, or so in Staten, Island and they're, going to be mounted on telephone calls and yet basically routers a computer network sort of system and in the event of a storm surge or sobbing Clement, weather or some catastrophe. These devices will pick up that condition down gas service, so we don't have fires and uncontrollable gas fires throughout the borough and it's putting them throughout the city. There was an application. Both consent documents were sent to Gerry. We reviewed them and we're in agreement with that plan, because it helps protect Thank You, Gerry, City planning's working group may call upon us to meet during the summer they're not here, to discuss the analysis. Jack Bogle and Sal general base are the more members Thank You, Sal and Jax is not here, but if we get notify, we will let everybody know if you guys won. That's basically all that I had to report tonight. I guess: that's it I! Don't everybody safe and I? Don't everybody I'm gonna get through the best part of this down. There's academic thing: oh okay! We have a presentation tonight, but before we do that, we do have I wanted to do the public session first I'm just trying to find my notes for the public session. That would send the public session speakers. They don't have too many speakers for the public session tonight. So I figured we'll have the presentations very. We have a representatives from South Beach branch of the public library. Mr. William weld died, spellers pronounced incorrectly I was pretty good. That was pretty good yeah. We pronounce things at cb2. My name is Billy I'm from the South Beach branch of the New York Public Library I'm. Just here to pretty much talk about our current reopening plans, though of course that subject to change like much as nowadays forgive my son standing in the background. Go ahead, move so the New York Public Library, the New York Public Library brooklyn-queens systems are all trying to get onto the same page and one more targeting a mid-july opening for the branches. It's not going to be. Every branch could to be eight total branches separated amongst Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx we're looking at two right now on Staten Island I, don't know which two at this point, they're true they're, still trying to figure out what buildings would be conducive to social distancing. I can tell you that the branches that do open will be a grab-and-go service. Much like a lot of the restaurants are kind of doing right now, where patrons would put books on hold and they would come into a small like entrance in the front and pick up their book it and leave. They wouldn't be allowed to browse or use the computers, and there would be no public programming in the branch for the foreseeable future. I can't say that our virtual programming will continue, probably for the remainder of the year. At this point, I can speak specifically to South Beach that we have a pretty robust virtual programming, but if anyone wanted more information on that, I could provide more information later about specific branches or system. Overall, the plan is to use the branches that are opening as like test cases, and if it's successful the system that's being set up, they will open more branches in a second phase. Now, that's an NYPD is not a state phase. The ideas would have been a few months that we would have many of our branches open, but I again, anything is subject to change and if there's any issues and the virus does come storming back, we would re-evaluate the way we open the branches and maybe take a step back from there. I'll close with that, we are just don't. We are continuing our summer reading, albeit a lot different than we normally do it. It's a quest through adventure this year, unfortunately, because I'm Johnny, the branches will be closed and you only know programs inside the branches. We will be doing everything virtually so if you do want to take part of that, you want you know, children want to take part of it teens who want to take part in it. We I can provide that information few either in the fat or in emails after the meeting, but just know that we are coming back. We are reopening, we are preparing and trying to keep the branches as safe as possible for both the staff and the patrons when they do come into the branch and I could take any questions, even no problems. Thank you. Thank you. Billy just one question: what restrictions are the customers we expected to see when we go in the library? Do we are there? Gonna be limited number of people? Will there be social distancing and all that stuff sure yeah there are going to be? They were still kind of ironing them out, but more than likely they're going to be. Everyone has to wear a mask both staff and patrons who enter the building. This is for our first face, so you would you would patrons who just be coming in and grabbing their books or DVDs and leaving they would still need to have a mask. We would have masks available. Should you forget your mask and you walked into the building. We will have a mask techno, a throwaway mask that you could use. While it comes to the building, there will be hand sanitizer in place. You wouldn't be able to really have any contact with the staff. We wouldn't be doing like any answering many questions. We would kind of be just directing you where you have to be in the branch you would be expected to come in, get your stuff and pretty much leave and, of course, maintaining that six feet in the next phase. When we start using computers, everything is going to be separated and there isn't an intense cleaning process every night. Our facility stamp will be cleaning the building to ensure that everything's good for the patrons the next day, but it will be masks and gloves. Thank you. Thank you very much. Anyone else have any other questions: okay, Thank You Billy. Thank you all right speaker, we had Mandy know AJ. Would you be kind enough to let your Easter know AJ its recent AJ is here and para message: okay, I just went down the list and I got everybody. I missed I. Just phone numbers are all right. We have a representative from American Red Cross, Beatrice slansky. Is she here with us [ __ ], no, okay, right! Thank you. Alright, then, like anyone else that wanted to speak for the public session, that has not notified that me. Otherwise we will close out. So we are in fortunately, the social distancing on site they sites have to apply, have to compromise, to have Shan wash and with sanitizing stations logs and people that submitted out of the site. Distancing. There are situations where we may not be able. You know where workers may not. They may be unavoidable for them to be 62 part, but but in general they have to stay in your maintain their distance, it's understandable. So if we're into those type of situations, so the OB will be enforcing it for the first 30 days. Any violations that issued are not come with penalties after 30 days, then those penalties will start to be six for six to ten 65-74. Who is that I? Don't know somebody dialed in six for six to ten 65-74 I say it you're recognize. Do you want to speak hi? Everybody did some Stephen Caruso from the Department sanitation, hi, Stephen, hope everyone is doing well staying safe, I just want to talk real, quick and remind everyone to please do your part as I'm sure. You've probably noticed that our pickup has been a little inconsistent lately and that's due to several reasons. Most importantly, whenever someone is sick, we equals our facility and we clean and disinfect. We also have boundaries in effect. So that means that, whereas we used to be able to allocate manpower in between district lines, we can only do that we're trying to prevent the spread of infection. So therefore, whatever we have on any given day, that's what we're working with so at times when we're short due to staffing out sick or on vacation, we have to cut functions, and that can mean that we're cutting specific routes just determined with where we'll be picking it up at a later time. So with that I'm just asking everyone, please remember to put your garbage out for collection the day before, don't wait until the day of I know. Sometimes people wait until the very last minute, because they know that you know, usually their garbage gets picked up during the day, but we could be picking it up overnight or on the 412 shift, so just to make sure please put your garbage out day before after 4:00 p.m. and you're fair with us, and also just make sure to do your part. Please clean in front of your home, maintain your area. We are issuing violations, of course, with an additional level of discretion, but more important than anything else. We just do want everyone to do their part. We all want to work together to get through this and we don't want to have another type of health crisis on our hands. So if anybody needs anything if there are any circumstantial issues in particular that you need an assistant, please feel free to reach out to me, but otherwise I just wanted to pop in say hello, remind everybody that we're here and I hope everyone is doing wrong. Thank you, so much muted, Bob, okay, thank you. Steve Anna shots from duty or do something and do a few points, so New York City's, currently in phase one of reopening we're at this point encouraging all New Yorkers to get tested for Kobe 19 to get a location their site next to you, could either call 3-1-1 or go to see gov /co a testing and New York City's, offering testing kids to all hospitals and hospital systems. This is whether or not you have symptoms of or are at increased risk will not be asked with. 19 testing sites and care services are not a public benefit under the public charter. Rule and poetess are free. They might ask you for your insurance. If you have it, but other than that coded test, diagnostic tests are free and repeat, testing should be offered if you have code, 19 symptoms and if you are concerned by a possible exposure, including if you have spent time in large crowds, if you have had an exposure or just someone confirmed or possible code 19 or if you have the breeches and wearing a face covering or maintaining physical distancing. Additionally, you know as a reminder: key physical distance stay at least Expedia way from other people wash your hands, often with soap and water use, hand sanitizer. So it's not available and we're face covering because you can be teaches without symptoms and protect those around you by wearing a face covering and I'm again just saying hello hope everyone is doing well and I'm here. If you have any questions. Thank you very much. Thank you. How frequently should people be getting these :? Yes yeah? So if you have been staying at home for the most part- and you haven't been- you know exposing yourself- you don't have to do it frequently, but if you have been outside and you have possibly been exposed, you know essentially work there, especially you can get it. You know frequently and maybe yeah. Thank you. Okay, all right! Thank you very much. All right, I said it three times already, but I think that might be the end of the public session. Okay. Public session is closed. All right. Next up, we have a presentation from Department of Parks and Recreation they're, going to present a new design for dying and playground walks you're up all right. So I mentioned before on Dave McConnell I'm with a director for New York City Parks Department, and this is a little change of pace, we're looking to life beyond life beyond pandemics, and we are designing donggeun playground very excited about it. Jordan Weber's on the line here, she's the project manager in the designer we spend a lot of time looking at the park, understanding the flooding, that's in the neighborhood understanding the physics that are in there to give you something: that's gonna function and be safe and be resilient. So with that I'm gonna hand it over to Jordan and let her go through the presentation and I hope you guys like it. We put a lot of heart into it. I'm sure you guys did. Thank you very much good. All right, thanks Dave, if I am able to share my screen. I can put the presentation up here right now. It's telling me that the host just disabled that give me a minute. That's the first we're sharing documents. Nancy, it's another level of thought, started wearing them, make sure that's what you want us to stay. You should be good to go now. I see you Jordan. We could see you, we could hear you, so your mention really can't dong in playground. Here. That's on Mason Avenue, between DeLeon, Hills and Beale avenues. The project is scheduled for completion for next January 2021. So the goals of the project are to basically increase the play capacity within the park, while also mitigating the flood issues that are currently on site, as well as providing programs for people of all ages and abilities so as I'm sure you're familiar. This is where the playground is right. Next to PS 52, we are in the flood zone, both the current flood zone and the future flood zone, also within the ms4 boundary, and a primarily residential area. We're about two blocks away from the hospital there and several other parks that are currently under construction are also nearby. So looking at the existing conditions, we have an existing comfort station on site. We have a recessed area down in the back here with game tables, some other seating areas and then a majority of the park is this recessed play space. So some of the issues that we focused on during the design are the circulation some of the pavement problems, maintaining access across the site and really focusing in on the flood damage. That's happening on these lower elevations. So, to give you a visual everything in the medium blue, there is within the current flood plain everything in the light. Blue is the projected flood plain so two major issues here and then just to give you an idea at how we're adjusting that a majority of the site is going to be raised above that floodplain. So, looking at the neighborhood context, the same sits above a lot of the rest of the area, but it's still at risk and we'll have four trees that are being removed because of design conflicts. So these are some images: the existing comfort station, the central LA and game table area the play equipment. You can see some of the pavement damage there another view of the play you can see how much lower we are from the street there and the entrance reveal Avenue. So earlier in the year we had a visioning session with the students of PS 2. Colleagues, like you very you saw your son. Schools is -, that's my friend school Janey, so they requested more play equipment and really focus on people of all ages and all abilities that teacher patty. Please. Yes, you mind just going on mute. Ok! Thank you. Ok, right, sorry about that! We're almost done! This is our proposed plan along Duncan Hills Avenue, we're keeping site access fairly open, how it is now just expanding some of the planting beds back where the game tables used to sit, we're putting in synthetic turf and moving some game tables over to the center of the park. That space will be right next to the two to five year play equipment, and then you can see a majority of the space will be for the five to twelve year old kids, the to play areas have a concrete band separating them. This is actually an elevated platform with ramps and stairs to access that and that allows us to pull some of the play equipment up to a nice height for accessibility also doing swings right now. There are only bucket swings on site, so we're adding some strap, swings and accessible swings and then keeping some nice open circulation through the space, so we're raising all the elevations bringing everything up out of the floodplain and we're also going to be integrating some below-grade things to help mitigate flatus use as well. So those are areas where you won't see anything, but water will be held so to look at this again. You can really see about 50% of the site is being lifted up out of the flood zone. All of our high-value equipment and safety surface will be outside of the projected flood zone as well, so the site is expected to be protected throughout its whole life. So this is an image of what the play equipment is going to look like this section is cut through the center, where that elevated platform was that I had mentioned so access onto the play is going to be three feet above everything else. There will be a small two-foot wall on the street side, that'll be shielded with planting and then a large nice piece of play equipment in the center. For the big kids- and this is a look at the synthetic turf area, so we're raising what was once sunken up to basically flat level so that we are meeting the planting beds they're in an aerial view. So you can get an idea of how the circulation will work through the space. The fences will be minimal, just low fences where we need them for planting and then 3-foot fences anywhere. There's possibility. Look at the equipment for the older kids, lots of high ramps, lots of accessible features and then sensory play for the younger kids, we're using all part standard materials, and we will have a drinking fountain that will be mounted to the Comfort station as well as native plantings. That can tolerate some of the flooding. So we are expanding the planting beds by about 10%, and this will help with some of the stormwater capture. So this is the overall design. Thank you for your time and happy to take any questions. What is the currency for this project you're in design? Now? Yes, so design will go through January of 2021 and then we have about eight to eight to twelve months for procurement and then it'll be a year design after that, so you're in construction. Yes, any time reasons of security features as part of this design was they're boxed and there's cameras or anything like that. We haven't included any and that wasn't an initial request. Is that something that the community is interested in? Well, it talks group Freddy speak, but typically, when we reviewing we've been talking about security systems and park, correct Freddy, when we were talking about Park plans and programs that we've had before us did we not like and then don't have the talks, consider security systems during the day or after hours and stuff? Yes, we've had a lot of uses got on the board with the octopus is working on no gates to close it. So it is an open site and it's going to mean it's gonna continue to be that way. The one benefit I would say that this Park has over some others is that it actually has external floodlights from the Cobra heads on the street. That actually shine down into the park, which that's not a feature that we generally come across, but it's actually very helpful here, because you can, we don't have the whole expense of lighting up the interior, because it's already led up lit up from the exterior and that in and of itself is an excellent security feature. So we didn't, we didn't tag anything else onto it. We kept it at what it was because we felt it was sufficient. If you wanted cameras, that's perhaps we could go down. I, don't know that you needed here, it's just something that we typically as a minimum, that we would recommend if they, if you have to come back to the border and some concurrence or some support for us that that's one of the items, you're gonna correspondent, you have a lot of street grade or below street great homes. There you're saying you're gonna plant a few things. What how what are you gonna do with all that displaced water? Now that you're, raising that where's? That gonna go? Is that gonna flood the surrounding homes? No so we'll actually have space below the surface of the park. That'll detain the water that would have been captured there originally I mean all those low areas where water and pull we're now going to be collecting that below grade so that people in the park don't have to worry about it and it'll be safely allowed to enter the sewer system as it's safe to do so, though, there's a sewer system there. Yes, there's an existing sewer since that the park connects to yes, the playground equipment as a handicapped accessible. Is it going to serve multiple needs? Yes, so we have a fair bit of what we call sensory play. It'll engage, kids of all abilities. Majority of the play equipment is also on ramps, so anyone who uses a mobility device will be able to easily access different levels and different play experiences. Did you put up the slide of the plants again? Please I was just doing the grounds here and I interested in taking a photo. Thank you, okay. Thank you. Everybody any other questions. Thank you very much parks. Thank you. Well, I'm just gonna jump in and say that our process right now is that our next step is to go to the public design Commission, which we're doing is at the end of this week. Jordan, yes, okay, so the end of this week we'll be submitting this to the public design, commission, and so for that we hope. We've told them that we're presenting this project sea-doo and so for us. What we would need from you is a letter of support from the community board saying that you support the project, then that gets submitted into the public design commission and that's a big step forward for us. Okay. Thank you very much all right. So if anyone is not in favor of this proposed design and proposed use and I think they've addressed 29% of their concerns. Please let Debbie know we provide email or now just raise your hand and we'll go to the next step. We'll send the letter and thank you, okay, all right. No other questions on this particular matter. We shall move on just to administrative things. Typically, we go through the committee executive board members, but there's really nothing to report, so I just wanted to get that in the record, and we had one more speaker. I think is that right mark from controllers office yeah, they say something. Is he still with us here? Hi everyone? Yes I'm still here, Donald ERISA from New, York, City, Comptroller, sorceress office, I'm, just gonna, be very brief to move everything away like a minute I promise to you 60 seconds, maybe even less you know, we've been working on over the land. The big thing that I just want to highlight for you. All I spoke last month about how the Comptroller launched an investigation into the mayor's response to the pandemic. That war- and we basically asked the mayor and his administration to preserve all documents between a certain time period to come with us to kind of create a schedule to transmit those documents to us. Emails phone call, transcripts, memorandums and whatnot just because we fundamentally believe this is something we need to look into. Unfortunately, the mayor and his administration have not been as forthcoming as we wanted them to. So, a couple of days ago, we formally issued subpoenas to the mayor for these documents. This is important, I'm highlighting it because we're in the midst of the global pandemic, and it's extremely important that we really understand how we responded to this. To you know what we did right. You know we did wrong and whether anything else to prepare for what can come in the future, so I just want to make you all aware of that. The second and last thing is I'm gonna post our website in the chat box. Now you can, of course, look through our website to see all of the recent things that we've done over the last month that I have been able to speak about, but, most importantly, we do have our kovat 19 resource guide. That is a fantastic resource for anyone and is constantly updated with new information, and that's on our homepage as well. So I encourage folks to take a look at that, but thank you for the time I. Thank you very much. Okay, all right any other issues before we get to our feature presentation so I want to make sure and the host. If you can just mute everybody except doctoral seminar, Chris we're not gonna, have any interruption she can take as long and whatever she needs a presentation. Okay, so we're up to our feet. Our feature presentation, which is by dr. seminar on the aging committee chair dr. seminar, has been volunteering on staff and I'm an incident command representing the skilled nursing facilities for the past three months. She will discuss the industry's challenges, successes and things and before she gets started, I mean I. Could I just happen to have first-hand experience on what goes on at the nursing home over here and I, see exactly what the issues are and I just ma. I had someone who's very relative doctor seminar doctor. It's all yours, hello! Hi. Can you hear me great? So thank you for the opportunity to just speak this evening. I wanted to give a little overview really of what I've been involved with the Staten Island incident command for Kovach 19 has really come up as a part of the community organizations exist, I'm active in disasters, that's the Staten Island Co ad and there's a subgroup of that Co ad called the medical ecosystem and within that medical ecosystem. We've had myself representing the nursing homes, dr. Theodore, strange, representing Staten Island, University Hospital and northwell health, dr. Phillip, Otto Beck, representing rum C, as well as Tina, Campbell and Tina also has another role in that she represents New, York City's office of emergency management. She is our link to that office. Furthermore, Ginny Mantello, who is the director of health and wellness for the Staten Island borough president's office, has really been the lead in this in this project, and we also have, of course our co-ed Ches from ill arouse a cur. So we have all been meetings since I'm going to say the weekend of March 16th or so, and during that meeting we have been meeting. It was about an hour and a half each night until the end of May, and maybe the third week of May, as we were heading into Memorial Day instead of meeting every day. That's seven days a week, we switch down to two days a week for our co-ed meetings, but we still were meeting individually and the purposes of all of these meetings was to get University, Hospital, Rumsey, the nursing homes and everyone to work together to be able to deal with some of the challenges that were facing Staten Island in particular, dealing with koban, so that you understand the nursing home landscape. There are 3,200 licensed beds in Staten, Island, most nursing homes. All of them actually have long term care beds, as well as short-term restorative rehabilitation. In most three nursing homes have ventilator units. Several of them are capable of performing hemodialysis. There is also a dedicated, traumatic brain injury unit at Seaview, Hospital and Co vyd came into the nursing homes as it was in the community. It essentially walked in the front doors with our visitors and with our staff, and while the at first nursing homes I think we're a bit resistance to taking COBIT positive patients from hospitals. There was a governance. The governor signed an executive order stating that nursing homes would not be able to use the Kovach status of a patient as a means to refuse admission to the nursing homes, so the admissions had to be sort of coded blinded. This was all happening in mid to late March, when we were at our steepest ascent towards trying to get to a plateau in New York. At the same time, most nursing homes had no availability of testing. There was one nursing home that did tests most residents very early on and that's because its ownership was part of a larger organization, and that was arch care. So arch care was able to get some testing done at Carmel and they really paid for it because they were able to identify that they had Kovach specific patients there and I believe very erroneously. They were vilified in part in the press because they knew that they had Kovach positive patients. Meanwhile, all the other nursing homes had suspect cases and the suspect cases were called pu I's persons under investigation. So we didn't have testing. We had persons under investigation and those patients like the patients at Carmel would have testing for things that we did have access to, so they were being ruled out for influenza. They were being evaluated for sepsis. They were put on sepsis protocols with intravenous antibiotics and intravenous fluids all during this time as well, there was a real fight for PPE access. It wasn't until we were about four to six weeks into this problem that we started to get drops from nice of supplies, probably closer to four weeks. So in the beginning we had everybody had their own supplies. They were burning through the supplies, quickly, nice and did step up and start to feed some PPE supplies to nursing homes. Although it was very variable from week to week one week, you would get a lot of gowns, but maybe the gowns were all extra larges, and so some of them couldn't really be utilized very variable on the n95 masks and n95 masks are still in very short supply hard to obtain. There are challenges on a weekly basis in getting eyes shields and sometimes simply gloves, and so our incident command would try to work and share contacts such and such a pharmacy was willing to provide supplies at a discounted rate to nursing homes, and so we were trying to send out information and share information about accessing PE accessing support staff. If you lost a lot of staff and in the face of all of this more executive orders for coming down from Governor Cuomo, there was an executive order that barred the use of hydroxychloroquine, except for hospitals and for places that were doing formal studies. The problem with that is that it left out the nursing homes now, even though subsequently we don't think that hydroxychloroquine is helpful. Encoded we did have to fight, and our co ad was really instrumental in going through back channels. Utilizing the office of the borough. President jimmy otto got together the leadership in the state representing Staten Island. They made a concerted front to the governor, and it was one of the rare times that there was an exception subsequently made to an executive order, and that was to allow nursing access to the same medications that were used in the hospital if they had the facilities to be able to administer them. So things like oral medications that were being used in hospitals were then able to be used in nursing homes, and this was a significant success win for the nursing homes of Staten Island. Furthermore, we were an integral part of the movement of patients from being impatient to stabilization and then being able to go home, and we found there was a bottleneck because char's or community health agencies visiting their service Visiting Nurse Association northwell were at first resistant to taking the cases at discharge because they didn't have their own PPE for their own nurses, who would be going out in the field. So again, our incident command identified. This bottleneck got all of these jobs together work to try to obtain PPE and northwell. Had the you know, the northwell home care service had the backing of their northwell system, so they were able to access some PPE and a much quicker fashion, but for vns and VNA we were very helpful in getting them to get access to encourage the establishments of telehealth visits, and yet that bottleneck moved along. So things were still very difficult on in the nursing homes. Our greatest density of positive cases occurred very much in the beginning when I believe there was a lot of cross contamination from visitors still coming in from staff moving from facility to facility, and then somebody had on a political basis had criticized the governor about the rate of nursing home illness with kovat, and he turned his eye and really sort of started to take on the nursing homes and another thing one's I think felt that he really declared war on them. He was quoted in newspapers really going after nursing homes and suggesting that they never should have accepted what they couldn't handle. Nursing homes were fighting back, saying you wouldn't let us not accept koban positive cases and then came the executive orders that refused to open positive cases to go back to nursing homes and there's been the most recent executive order mandating that it had to be testing of all skilled nursing facility employees twice a week, but this is an unfunded mandate, so the financial implications of this whole kovat experience on the nursing home has been absolutely astronomical. There has been decreased Medicaid reimbursement since January 1st of this year and then in the budget that was passed by the governor on April 1st. There was a further a decrease in that reimbursement. So it's a total of 1.5 to 2 percent decrease automatically this year in Medicaid, reimbursements, the census and all of the nursing homes is quite low. Now I will give you the example of Agra, where I work we are licensed for 378 beds and I. Think that yesterday we had 304 or 305 patients. Best majority of this loss is because there's no rehab business, the rehab patients who are able to leave early in the outbreak all left and we just have losses of patients on long-term care to the köppen virus, and we don't have new admissions coming in. So when you add all of that up, as people are slowly leaving as they continue their rehabilitative process, the census continues to decrease and then there's the increased costs that have been incurred. Yes, some of that will eventually be paid back under FEMA, but I'll point out that for superstorm sandy there is still you know, outstanding FEMA creditors on Staten Island, so I don't see that this is going to really help them with their cash flow issues in the next year or two. The cost of testing at Edgar in the first two weeks alone was in excess of $200,000. So this has been very economically difficult. It's been morally very difficult to manage all of the different things that have been happening just from the perspective of trying to keep our heads above water and also trying to share amongst partners that haven't traditionally partnered before the co ad and the medical ecosystem. By having this very tight group meeting on a regular basis, really tried to push out a lot of information and pushing to the nursing homes had its challenges. We tried to push directly to medical directors and also to the administrators. We had some very successful meetings where we were able to share information and share some best practices. We all worked very closely together to try to get antibody testing done in the nursing homes on Staten Island, and this was really a push that I had because I think that population testing would really allow us to cohort patients appropriately in the nursing homes by this I mean that patients who had either tested positive or would all be together. Those who demonstrated no exposure to coded could be protected in different wings of the nursing homes and based on the size that one has and the physical plant one could then allow for appropriate cohorting of residents, so that really was sort of at the cornerstone of what I wanted to do at Egger as the rehab patients will quickly discharged. We took over one of those rehab floors on the second floor and designated that as a co-ed positive-only unit, and this really helped us to be successful in isolating kovat within the nursing home. We worked as I said, to develop the population health assessments, and we were working on the medical side. I had weekly meetings with my medical staff and with consultants who are in the nursing home to be able to share information about the status in the nursing home, share thoughts on difficult to manage cases and also share our collective experience in our offices and in the hospitals, and bring that to us, for instance, the identification of one components of Kovan 19 being the thromboembolic feature of the disease patients who have the disease, it seems that after they, initially stabilized when they later within in the second week of the illness, start to crash, it's usually coming from inflammation and thrombosis. The thrombosis may present itself as clots and these clots primarily affecting pulmonary embolisms and sometimes stroke. So by being able to share this information to identify when patients were having difficulty by monitoring their pulse axes, you know we really tried our best to treat people with the information as we were able to receive it remember. This is a new illness first identified in Wuhan China in December of 2019 identified in the United States, primarily with an outbreak on the west coast in a nursing home there in February and then very soon after in the mid-atlantic states of the United States, where we reside I. Don't think that if you really analyze the numbers across our region that New York comes up poorly, so I do have some data from CMS. Looking at the cases per 1,000 of nursing home residents, with positive diagnosis of kovat and per 1000 in New York, there were 98 similar in Pennsylvania with 94 in New Jersey, which is a much smaller state. They had a rate of 206 and in Massachusetts 244. The death rate from coded in nursing homes per 1000 in New York is 42 in New Jersey, it's 145 internet in Connecticut 125 and in Massachusetts 117, and very sadly, the death rate of staff in nursing homes in New, York 0.6 per 1000 in New Jersey 2.7 per 1000 in Massachusetts, 5.9 per 1000. So I think. If you compare us to our region, we've done I'm, just gonna, say: okay, of course, what happened is tragic. Our patients, of course, are some of our most vulnerable patients. They have comorbidities, they have advanced age and by virtue of the fact that they are in long term care in a nursing home. They are exceptionally dependent on others for activities of daily living and institutional activities of daily living. So they are very much at risk I'm happy to say that, just as we have seen a decrease overall percentage of cases in our community by keeping visitors out and I recognize how heartbreaking that is, for families how very difficult it is. This is a problem, and also by testing our staff twice a week. We have really been able to tightly control people who are positive for kovat coming in contact with our patients when the test is done appropriately to check for pcr and the RNA virus by nasal swab. It is not a simple nasal swab. This swab goes right back up to the posterior Nerys and you feel like the back of your eyeball, is being scrubbed and that you have, if you can almost feel it in your brain and I, mean it's a very specific unusual feeling, and we all have it done twice a week. We also have done antibody testing on patients and staff, so we know who has been exposed in the past and that has helped us to do our internal cohorting as well I'm, looking to take this opportunity of the summer when things are a little quieter to really get us prepared for the next wave. Unfortunately, my medical opinion is that another wave is coming, that we see that it has not been eradicated in the community and we do know. The behavior of coronaviruses is that they are seasonal and I suspect that this one will be no different, that we will have a seasonal realignment of increased cases, and we will also have increased cases if we take our foot off the gas in terms of maintaining social distancing from those who you are not sure of it. What they have been doing in terms of there are social contexts and behaviors. We are seeing spikes and states- and this is all very concerning my concern- is an advocate for the elderly who resided in nursing homes is to make sure we learn from the processes that have occurred already and we're working to adjust utilization of anything that we can in the nursing home. We I think understand now the importance of cohorting. We now have access to testing and we are going to protect that assets. We are all working hard to pre, stop ourselves with appropriate PPE. The recommendation is that we have three months of PPE in stock at Edgar, we're already at about the two and a half month mark for that, so that we will be prepared when this occurs. We are learning about positioning patients in beds, positioning patients within the bedrooms if they have shared rooms and read you're, not going to use that. Just today, our staff was watching a participated in the zoom from the CDC. We take our guidance from the CDC in the New York State Department of Health, and as also the and also the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene I have been in contact with representatives of the latter, particularly relating to the public health in pursuing and securing testing for our patient populations. Right now, we are forced to use a private lab because the public facilities are still only supporting the hospitals and one less thing about nursing homes as an important piece of a continuum of care. I would point out that the nursing homes that have accepted Kovac positive patients on Staten Island can only speak to that experience have successfully discharged patients after rehabilitating them so that they could go home after they had succumbed to their Kovach 19 illness. If the nursing homes had not accepted those early patients, the successful decanting of the hospitals so that they could handle the cases that they dealt with I, just don't think that would have occurred. I'll give you an example of the stress that the hospitals were in normally Staten Island, University, Hospitals, north and south sight have roughly 40 ICU beds. Patients who are on ventilators in hospitals by almost by definition except for rare cases, are in intensive care units. At the height of the coded crisis we had over 225 and ventilated patients at Staten, Island University Hospital. That's increasing the vent capacity alone to five times what it normally could handle when I will never forget the sound of some of my colleagues voices as we were really going up that steep incline make no doubt about it. Staten Island was really at a precipice with our hospital capacity. All of that said, Staten Islanders stepped up very few patients left the island to be treated in New, York City, either at Javits or uncomfort, or the Billie Jean, King, Center, etc. Staten Island University Hospital took over the Staffing of what came to be known as Staten Island University Hospital East at the South Beach Psychiatric Center, and that was another site where stable hospitalized coded patients were able to be sent while they continued their supportive care and treatment and I, say supportive care because there is no definitive treatment for Covid-19. Unfortunately, at this time we still are in a race to find appropriate vaccines, and until we have a vaccine or until we develop enough immunity in our population, kovat is going to be a challenge for us in our region, in the United States and in the world and I, don't really see how this can be anything less than a two-year experience and I. Don't say this to frighten anyone I'm just giving you my medical opinion, based on my experience in my conversations with thought leaders in the city state and on the national level, so I just wanted to give you an update of what has been happening. Medically sort of behind the scenes and I'd be happy to take any questions if anyone wishes to ask [Applause] okay, thank you very much. That was an extraordinary story I. Why I think I speak to the Gordon? We have the highest respect for all the things that you've done and you think we're ahead of the curve on this now so far. Well, I think for our first phase, I think Staten Island has done really well social distancing, I, don't think, can stop right. Now I think we still need to use our masks. I think that meetings like this will continue to be the norm for a while, but the good news is that our hospitalization rates are low. Well, so that's the good news. What I'm concerned about is that if we keep up through a good behavior and things continue to open up in a safe fashion, I'm just concerned about what happens when the weather cools and we have complexities like influenza. One thing that's important to everybody, make sure you get a flu shot this year, even if you weren't big on cheese shots before and even though the influenza vaccine has not always been as potent as we would have hoped. I think anything is good at this time. So if you aren't immunized for pneumococcal infections or then please get your Pneumovax and your Prevnar vaccines and you do want to get your flu shot this year as well. Thank you very much. Okay, because I know it seems to keep changing. Do they currently believe that if you've had the Coben, you are not going to catch it again and if so, are they using people who have already recovered from corona to treat patients and like the facility? So there are two questions there. The first is: how do we know if we're immune, and unfortunately we do not know yet having an antibody merely means that you have been exposed to the virus? It does not impart a knowledge of immunity such as titers would for Rossella or for German, measles or measles or months. You know how the kids go for their titers and you can tell that they've gotten their best scenes and you can see that they have adequate amounts of antibodies in this particular situation. The presence of antibodies does not guarantee that there is immunity from the illness, and so we believe that it is possible to have it again. When we look to China and South Korea, we do see reports of secondary infection, so it could be I think it's just that we may not recognize all of the antibodies that are appropriate for this illness and we don't know how to measure appropriately yet for immunity. The second part of your question is that if you have antibodies, can your convalescent plasma be of benefit? There are studies through Southwest I think the Mayo Clinic? Yes, so there's a Mayo Clinic study that allows for compassionate use of convalescent plasma for patients who are hospitalized, so any hospitalized patients in New York can access convalescent plasma. A recent theory, however, is that by the time you give the plasma to a person who's sick enough to be in the hospital it's almost too late. It's like catching a patient who has overwhelming bacterial sepsis. You can throw everything in the kitchen sink at them. If the sepsis has been ongoing for too long, the inflammatory damage is done. So I will tell you that our incident command has had multiple conversations with Johns Hopkins, where they are initiating studies with two arms, one arm being for ambulatory patients. Who've been diagnosed with kovat to be able to get convalescent. Plasma early, they've been diagnosed they're sick, but not sick enough to go into the hospital, give them convalescent plasma early and there are 17 different sites that are involved in this study and I. Believe Rumsey is trying to pull together to be I, think there are 16 sites in Rome she's trying to be the 17th site. The other arm, interestingly, is for exposure for persons who are in nursing homes, so if you've been exposed but you're not sick, when convalescent plasma prevents you from coming down with the illness, so there are studies occurring and some of them may be enough. So let me hear you very soon for the use of convalescent plasma very early in the course of disease. Currently, through the Mayo Clinic study, all hospitals can obtain convalescent plasma for patients who are hospitalized. We believe that convalescent plasma is most effective when it's taken from the donor very early. In the course of their having antibodies, if you were sick three or four months ago, your plasma is not as good as the plasma if you were sick just a month ago, amazing mm-hmm, thank you very much mark any other questions.
