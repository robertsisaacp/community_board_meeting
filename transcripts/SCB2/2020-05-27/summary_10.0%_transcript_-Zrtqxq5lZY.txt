Many of you know, the Staten Island downtown Alliance, has been opposing a homeless shelter anywhere on Staten Island number one, because we have a thousand people identified homeless, and so that could be taken care of with permanent housing and number two We just approved a B Street corridor rezoning, which would be provide plenty of opportunity for affordable housing in the North Shore close to all of transit, so The downtown Alliance has said no to any homeless, shelter on Staten Island period, but in particular with this site.
We recognize that this site should not only not be used for children and women who win is supposed to serve on the shelter site, but it should not be used for habitation at all, and so we are stating- We have enlisted other civics and the Community Board one in the area and asked for letters of support to some environmental remediation to reject the application.
So I know they noticed, because tomorrow is the deadline for comments were notified because, as we went out asking for people to reject this application, so again, I'm here to say to ask individuals if you would please.

One of the major things that we actually just did was we launched a formal investigation into the city's preparedness and response to the pandemic, and we basically at this point just requested documents received, created or issued by city, government officials and agencies related to the public emergency.
You know, there definitely will be more on that, and the last thing I want to touch on quickly is our city's budget, which is immensely important and is going to probably be one of the most consequential budgets that were going to be going through in recent history and The mayor released.
In an estate, as do many of the cities and states acrosss the country to get through this, but we do not know if that's going to happen, and lastly, is the Peg program, which is more or less trimming fat at City agencies, and we believe right now that the mayor's executive budget does not do enough of that, and we need a lot more of that.
We do not know what that final product is going to look like, but we expect to be in a much more severe financial situation over the next coming weeks and months as this pandemic.
We always look at for funding, ways that make services available to individuals and especially now What's going on, we know HR A, the Parcel Service is going to be really it with an influx of people coming in actually for services.
Our Commission has been doing web seminars every Tuesday, giving the public elected officials and community boards, as well as a community partners, information, along with no updates on the agency, things that we implementing as far as making changes and then gladly taken concerns that are coming up from them.

Where is that starting point for them, because I do not know of any place on Staten Island that serves alcohol And, it's a choice of wine or beer?
, we'll just he'll just have to read our transmission after in the public record, all right, all right, so that closes out this issue when these applications come through.
I, understand you, but I want you and the rest of the board and the public to understand that when Debbie, when we get these things, we take them.
But, as I said in the February meeting, were giving Roy a pass going forward and that he does do meticulous accounting for the board and the report is available at the board office and if anyone has any questions or concerns or wants to see the arithmetic and the columns and the expenses month- Let me go back to the agenda because it looks why believe it or not went down to any new business.
