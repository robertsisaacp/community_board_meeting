We need to know that you can pass on to people that you may know and need some help about something, but it does have its So we'll be ki lying on the electronic format, all of our business All I had tonight on that from them from the Chairman's report, [Laughter] speakers and the public session to the nominations and the back end of the agenda.
With regards to phase one you're, probably hearing from business owners you're hearing from people that would you want to get back to work If the governor can allow us to resume on our own, having met the metrics I To also add that you know we continue to do what we can to just help people get by at this time, so whether it be the PPE or unemployment, or you know, food drives I'm working closely with the Kiwanis Club, as well as the Verrazano Kiwanis Club, as well as Miss Richmond County outstanding teen, Angela who's.
We recognize that this site should not only not be used for children and women who win is supposed to serve on the shelter site, but it should not be used for habitation at all, and so we are stating- We have enlisted other civics and the community board one in the area and asked for letters of support to some environmental remediation to reject the application.
So if the site was remediated for commercial use, that would be acceptable, but since they have put in the application and stated that they want to remediate the site for residential or for the shelter use, it's an experiment.
So I know they noticed, because tomorrow is the deadline for comments were notified because, as we went out asking for people to reject this application, so again, I'm here to say to ask individuals if you would please.
We really have been honing in on a lot of various issues, whether it relates to food insecurity, analyzing data on frontline workers to help inform those who make policy in our city and state to drive various legislation and whatnot.
One of the major things that we actually just did was we launched a formal investigation into the city's preparedness and response to the pandemic, and we basically at this point just requested documents received, created or issued by city, government officials and agencies related to the public emergency.
You know, there definitely will be more on that, and the last thing I want to touch on quickly is our city's budget, which is immensely important and is going to probably be one of the most consequential budgets that were going to be going through in recent history and The mayor released.
But we don't know if that's gonna happen and lastly, is the peg program, which is more or less trimming fat at City agencies, and we believe right now that the mayor's executive budget does not do enough of that, and we need a lot more of that.
We do not know what that final product is going to look like, but we expect to be in a much more severe financial situation over the next coming weeks and months as this pandemic.
We always look at for funding, ways that make services available to individuals and especially now A the Parcel Service is going to be really it with an influx of people coming in actually for services.
Our Commission has been doing web seminars every Tuesday, giving the public elected officials and community boards, as well as a community partners, information, along with no updates on the agency, things that we implementing as far as making changes and then gladly taken concerns that are coming up from them.

So we're continuing looking at new processes how to minimize, like you, know, contact in the office in transition, those processes over to online.
Okay and the application that's submitted when the boxes are checked about being within distances from schools and churches and stores and children, and all those things you know, and so there's really You know we can take this conversation of the firm , Thank You Jerry, but the borough Commission of want to know about this I mean maybe something I can get more than where it may be.
We'll just he'll just have to read our transmission after in the public, record, all right, all right, so that closes out this issue when these applications come through.
I, understand you, but I want you and the rest of the board and the public to understand that when Debbie, when we get these things, we take them, serious.
