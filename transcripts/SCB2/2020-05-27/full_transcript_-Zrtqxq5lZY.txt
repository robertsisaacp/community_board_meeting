[ Applause][, Applause], okay, okay, anyone else going once twice: okay, a motion to accept the proposed agenda for tonight's meeting. Thank you, which is the chair report. First and foremost, as I said it to be me. I just want to thank everyone for showing up here at the meeting tonight we made history for CB2. This is the first virtual meeting that we have and until we get some clarity and some guidance we'll probably doing this for a while longer so let's not notified. Otherwise, this is the format and the platform that we will be using and you're there from Debbie on that in the coming days and weeks, I hope, I, hope everyone is safe and everyone that was impacted by this treacherous pandemic has come out on the other side in better shape and I hope. Everybody is in good health and I mean that from the bottom of my heart, as far as the netiquette and the other kiss for tonight's meeting, it's the same as if we were in the board office at the Brielle, nearly different series, as the host mentioned. If you're not speaking, please put your microphone on mute on your video on. If you can do that, if you have that and if you want to say something or speak, just raise your hand on the bottom right hand of your screen. Next, in the participants column, there's a link or a cage for raising your hand and you'll be recognized during the meeting, and we intend to follow the same order that we do on all of our meetings in the past years. I just wanted everybody to know that, most importantly, probably one of the most important things that I mentioned tonight, I just wanted to acknowledge the passing of an Trinity. You saw some correspondence from Debbie and for me to all of you a few months ago, a month or so ago, acknowledging that but sadness how longest- serving member I think that's right am I, correct, Debbie, right Jerry that she, the longest member we have on the board, as you know, and always sat next to me and asked me questions about things and explained everything on how to get through the meeting and connected to history. But what we were doing at the moment and I will miss her terribly I want to dedicate this meeting and the following meetings in her memory and just take a moment of silence to remember Aunt and they and all the things that she did for the board whether she was out in front or in the background she was very attractive. So, let's just take a moment in silence. Thank you. Okay, I just want to remind everyone. This is the nomination typical nomination meeting, as you know, and have this written script that she would follow to the team to the letter, and we would rehearse it and she'd make me, read it backwards and forwards, but that Baton now has been passed to Teresa and she'll, be talking about that not momentarily when we get through the agenda. I want to thank Debbie and for all of her endless dedication, keeping us notified daily, weekly hourly by the second at least May I'm, sure the rest of the board of the things that have been happening and what do we need to do? What do we need to know, especially all the notices from notifying New York City and the endless information that she provided to us to keep us safe, Debbie I just want to publicly acknowledge and thank you for all of the work that you've done when with Cheryl as well. Thank you I want to thank all board matters for your continuing dedication and understanding of working with us and getting us to this point tonight. I mean this is really remarkable. You know considering how we sit in the Brielle or XE business. This is really a remarkable accomplishment far as I'm concerned. Any does have any technological challenges. Please let W know by email, we'll try to work out everything for the next meeting, which will be the last minute for FY 2010. Looking ahead, did you immediately look just like this? One will have the same format and the same set up of all the correspondence and documentation will be sent out well before the meeting. So that's also fine is that for demise and doubled, while keeping the website up to date and running that the CB2 si.com. That's our portal, where anything you everything you want to know about, CB2 is contained. There are enormous number of links to everything in the city and everything we need to know that you can pass on to people that you may know and need some help about something, but it does have its it's quite comprehensive and it's quite current and thanks aper and Debbie truck keeping all of that up to date. So just watch out for the website for additional updates, because eventually everything that will be the platform to find out everything about CB2. Since we do not merely mail many things out anymore. We do not need to have paper and that sort of stuff so we'll be Ki lying on the electronic format, all of our business so I'm very much. Alright. That's all I had tonight on that from them from the Chairman's report, speakers and the public session to the nominations and the back end of the agenda. So it happens tonight that we have a guest speaker too. Perhaps Assemblywoman Nicole, Melia Caucus is scheduled to speak to us tonight. So it's our representative or she's here, hi everyone, it's great to see all of you via zoom and I, look forward to the day we can be together again: I hope you and your families are healthy and safe and I just wanted to take a few minutes to update you, because there's been a lot of obviously transition over the period of time that we've been unable to see each other and by the way, usually I'm in session on a day. Like this, and so maybe this is a way that we can join you in the future when we're in Albany, and so we could still stay in touch. So basically, you know things have obviously taken a course here and we went through the beginning days of you know just trying to expand that capacity and testing capacity and then being able to ensure that our hospitals had the supplies that they need the ventilators that they need and the PPE, and all that you know I'm very proud of my team that helped distribute tens of thousands of pieces of PPE to our nursing homes and to our hospitals, to our frontline and then. But what I really want to focus on today is where we are at this point, because things are progressively changing and quickly. First I want anyone to know that my office is available. If you need assistance, if you have an organization that does need PPE, please feel free to reach out. We will do our best to try to accommodate you if you are in healthcare or you're a precinct or you know, firehouse or whatever we're here to help you. Secondly, if anyone still needs unemployment assistance, we have helped. Hundreds of people gets through to the DOL through a roundabout route that we have state- level. So anyone that you know that you still may need to get through or is having difficulty. They do not receive their full payment or they received, maybe the state but they're, not getting the federal just reach out to us and we're. You know happy to help. You write my office number, seven, one, eight, nine, eight, seven, zero one, nine seven for those of you that do not have that information. So you know I've been making a push now to try to interstate an ion into Phase one we've met the metrics, we're hoping that the governor will give us some consideration, at least when it comes to elective surgeries. We have an issue right now. We're constituents are reaching out saying that they can't get joint replacement surgery or they you know we're waiting for a mastectomy and they'd kidney blockage or yeah, just very ill', no PSA's things, hernia surgery, gallbladder surgery. These are all real life examples. Constituents that reached out additionally people that need endoscopy colonoscopy, preventive care. You know I've been meeting with the Medical Society and the Dental Society about all these procedures, and it's really important that we are able to resume these as soon as possible. So being a settler meets the metrics. The governors are allowing us to enter phase one without the rest of the city, I'm, hoping that he would at least allow us to resume the elective surgeries, because every other Kerala County I, was judged as a county throughout these regions in the States or, for example, mid- hudson, Ulster County started before the other counties in that region and when you look at long island Suffolk was able to resume elective surgeries beforehand, so Stein Nose really being treated differently. In this regard. With regards to phase one you're, probably hearing from business owners you're hearing from people that would you want to get back to work and I know it's. You know split on everyone agrees, but I think hoping buddy by next week. If the governor can allow us to resume on our own, having met the metrics I I'm, hoping that by next week, this will all be resolved. So with that I wanted. To also add that you know we continue to do what we can to just help people get by at this time, so whether it be the PPE or unemployment, or you know, food drives I'm working closely with the Kiwanis Club, as well as the Verrazano Kiwanis Club, as well as Miss Richmond County outstanding teen, Angela who's. My rep on the board has been very helpful and helping organize these food drives that we're doing at Marius churches to help fill their pantries. We've done four. So far, we're doing the fifth one Friday from three to five Sinclair's on Nelson Avenue. So if anyone wants to contribute food, you know non- perishable items that would be greatly appreciated. Another thing I just want to point out is the state has set up a mental health hotline. I just think it's important for all of us to get that information out. Many people are dealing with a lot of stress, loss, depression, anxiety, there's a lot going on out there and we just want to make sure people have the resources. You know that they have somebody to talk to. So if you do not share that number on your social media sites, that would be fantastic, 8:4, 8, 6:3, 9, 3:1, 4, 8:4, 8, 6:3, 9, 3:1, 4 and lastly, tomorrow I've been doing I've been trying to do my own little zoom holes on Facebook. For those of you, please call my facebook page where I post, regular information updates tomorrow I'm going to be doing something with Councilman Braley as well as Michael to new sisters, an assembly Kennedy B's, a former prosecutor and as well as the detectives union, will be talking about public safety. We'll be talking about some of the policies that come out of City, Hall and state government will talk about some of the changes we achieved. That will take effect in July in terms of the bail reform to make it more palatable and better for the community. There are a lot of significant changes. We added number of crimes that now judges discretion restored. It's so important people that used to you know, there's news articles that you were reading on Staten Island, about people, committing 6 bank, robberies and being released. That's not going to happen anymore, they can be. They can be kept it's up to the judge, the judge they will be, but he kept be kept after you know it will be if it appear released again like that we gave we improve things for the DEA when it keeps discovery. So there are significant improvements. I'm really proud, and thank you all I know. Last time I spoke to you guys. It was about that issue in a very antsy, as long does not go as far as I'd like, but certainly was significant, considering we had to get the same people that voted it in to make the changes. So that was a success. I would say, and that will take effect in July, so we'll be talking about that tomorrow on our Facebook Town Hall, that's at 7:00 my facebook page to watch. That's if I'm not called for a vote tomorrow night, which is very possible, no I have to postpone it, but just keep my page for the latest information with that I'll take questions. Thank you very much for your time. I really appreciate that. So what I was thinking of doing unless we have specific questions in order to move our agenda along you'll following questions to you by email from Debbie this way, we do not have good luck to you. Malliotakis, please email, Deborah and she'll, get them to the Assemblywoman, either through our Facebook page or to our representative, who was on the phone yet. Thank you, okay, public session. For the moment we got a couple of items, traffic and transit and public service. One has to do with the liquor license. Application is zero here in the firehouse rescue five years ago was Dino's bar the football player. Then he closed it and I believe they open up a bagel store or a deli there. Now somebody else wants open up a lounge in a cafe. He was going to have music I think we ought to pass it. There would be no music, okay, I propose that we either do this boys if you want to go through the agenda list attendance list, it's your choice. Okay, any objection to this. Please raise your hand on the right hand, side. Otherwise, we'll assume we can gauge unless we start screaming and yelling at everybody, unless there's a hand raised in the Chat box on the right. That's the barometer. We will use- for objections to approving this matter until we figure out something more efficient. Otherwise we got to go through the attendance list, so the chair of the committee had decided to do the voice vote, so we will go in that direction. We I agree with that. So having said that, Mr. Host are there anyone raising their hands beside misters Mariinsky on another matter not related to this particular. One, though, is issue is related to the process, and he happens to be quite correct, so there will be no security that way with the stipulations we should pass. This liquor license application okay, hands with the stipulation that will be no live music or recorded music. Okay, we have the public session. We have the t- shirt and Laura wants to speak to us I'm glad to see everybody well. Thank you for your service on the community board I'm here to speak to you today about the Wynn homeless, shelter about 44 victory. Boulevard I have recently received word that the office of environmental remediation has received an application from victory. Johnson who's, the owner of the property to remediate the property after contamination was found on the property. As many of you know, the Staten Island downtown Alliance has been opposing a homeless shelter anywhere on Staten Island number one, because we have a thousand people identified homeless, and so that could be taken care of with permanent housing and number two is we just approved a B Street corridor rezoning, which would be provide plenty of opportunity for affordable housing in the North Shore close to all of transit, so the downtown Alliance has said no to any homeless shelter on Staten Island period, but in particular with this site. We had hoped to see permanent housing on this site because it was resumed to be as Tower after the environmental review was revealed, though there are heavy metals and petroleum and other contamination on this site. We recognize that this site should not only not be used for children and women who win is supposed to serve on the shelter site, but it should not be used for habitation at all, and so we are stating- and we have enlisted other civics and the Community Board one in the area and asked for letters of support to some environmental remediation to reject the application if it is for the purpose of a residential development of any kind. Of course, we want to see the site remediated, so if the site was remediated for commercial use, that would be acceptable, but since they have put in the application and stated that they want to remediate the site for residential or for the shelter use, it's an experiment. It's commercial at the bottom. It's just familiar it's at the corner of Victory, Boulevard and BC. It would be 200 units sheltered units for women and for children, so serving would be a common space. I thought it was just a wrong idea period specifically for this site, because it is contaminated, we're saying no to the site and we're saying no to a shelter anywhere. So I know they noticed because tomorrow is the deadline for comments were notified because, as we went out asking for people to reject this application so again, I'm here to say to ask individuals if you would please, if you would please consider saying that you noticed, but if you could just get in any commentary focused on the environment, I'd appreciate it. Thank you very much Leticia. Thank you all right so before we I comment on Leticia statements want to make sure there are not any other public speakers or elected officials do not want to speak and then I'll come back till the teachers position and the weekend hi. Could you just what is the email address where there's what is has to be sent? Yes, absolutely just hang on a second and I'm gay and I will open it up. Okay, so we are going, the gentleman's name is Chemin Des Koala, it's Shi n de our last name, CH awl A, and he is the deputy director of the Office of environmental remediation. The email is season. Cat H's in Harry, Hey, WLA, DEP, DOT NYC no I can I would be happy Denyce to send you copies of the link where you can download all the information, including the documents that show the contamination and what they want to do so. I can get that to you I. Can you just give me your email address and I'll send that over? Yes, that would be great. Thank you. The check, though that's P, as in Peter, the Apple C Charlie H house, Charlie I, will send out right over send okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Letitia sure. Okay, thank you any other public session speakers that wish to make a statement or comment on something before I close the public session. Thank you, Thank You Marcy. This is Donald from city comptroller, Scott stringer office. I. Just wanted to give you all a very quick update on some of the things that we've been working on over the last couple of months. It's definitely been a very difficult time for many folks in our office. I know for all of you, but it is great that we're able to gather virtually for what seems to be the foreseeable future for now, but some quick things we really have been honing in on a lot of various issues, whether it relates to food insecurity, analyzing data on frontline workers to help inform those who make policy in our city and state to drive various legislation and whatnot. One of the big things that we've been working on is resources for small businesses, movement, having a series of webinars and town halls. We actually just recently had a small business Town Hall with the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce and borough president James Otto, to really talk about the realities of what's happening for small businesses in our borough and to also have a better understanding of what resources are available. To add to that, we also launched a Covid-19 Resource Center. That is really for anyone. A small business owner, a non- profit, an individual of freelance work or whatever you are, it's just a central location where you can get as much information as possible from every single level of government, and we know that information is changing rapidly and it's been a fantastic resource that we have had up for almost two months now, one of the major things that we actually just did was we launched a formal investigation into the city's preparedness and response to the pandemic, and we basically at this point just requested documents received, created or issued by city, government officials and agencies related to the public emergency. The comptroller is the chief financial officer and the chief auditor of the city. It is our mandate to investigate city government and we fundamentally believe that this is not only within our scope, but it is warranted and necessary at this time. So that is something that we did formally launch. We sent a formal scheduled request for various information and over the coming months. You know there definitely will be more on that, and the last thing I want to touch on quickly is our city's budget, which is immensely important and is going to probably be one of the most consequential budgets that were going to be going through in recent history and the mayor released. His is his executive budget. A couple of weeks ago. We crunched the numbers on that and when we basically find as a revenue gap of eight point, seven billion dollars, which we expect to rise, and the mayor is looking to close that gap by a mixture of pulling from reserves. The city has expected federal aid and the Peg program, which is something called the program to eliminate the gap. We have concerns with all three of these ways in which the mayor is seeking to close the gap. The Comptroller has long said that we need to be saving more to put more way into a dedicated reserve fund so that we can have mine during times like this and unfortunately, over the years we have not saved enough. We are pushing very hard for federal aid. We fundamentally need federal aid in the city in an estate, as do many of the cities and states acrosss the country to get through this, but we do not know if that's going to happen, and lastly, is the Peg program, which is more or less trimming fat at City agencies, and we believe right now that the mayor's executive budget does not do enough of that, and we need a lot more of that. The Comptroller over the years has done dozens and dozens of audits, various city agencies, and we found billions of dollars worth of simple savings that we could be using right now in this time to try to split our budget to try to get through. This I mean II, fundamentally believe that we are not going in the right direction with this budget, as it is happening right now. Of course, the council and the mayor are now in their negotiations with this budget. So we do not know what that final product is going to look like, but we expect to be in a much more severe financial situation over the next coming weeks and months as this pandemic progresses. It is definitely a very challenging time financially for the city and for a lot of people acrosss the city, and we will wait to see ultimately with the council and the mayor come to an agreement on and I will, of course, be more than happy to come back and provide updates on how that progresses and whatnot, but I definitely appreciate the time questions comments, concerns I'll, definitely take them, but I'm glad to see everyone here and glad everyone is doing well, thus far. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you Jermaine. Oh thank you. Can you hear me? We can yes good evening. Everyone or someone say you know, thoughts and prayers go out to everyone. Who's been affected by the Corona virus. I know that a lot of unsaid words about people who did not touch either directly or indirectly. So you know just got ta, say condolences there, you're not alone, and we're going to get through this. So real quick, you know just some sentiments of the controller's office. You know again no we're City and we always look at for funding ways that make services available to individuals and especially now and light of, what's going on, we know HR a the Parcel Service is going to be really it with an influx of people coming in actually for services. So, in light of that, we've been working real hard. Our Commission has been doing web seminars every Tuesday, giving the public elected officials and community boards, as well as a community partners, information along with no updates on the agency, things that we implementing as far as making changes and then gladly taken concerns that are coming up from them. Our constituents, as well as elected officials, because some things you know at the agency we possibly will miss just in light of just certain things we did. We received the waiver that allowed us to actually have individuals apply for cash assistance online, so it helped us reduce the number of foot traffic and footprints inside our centers, where we can close on them to keep workers on safe at home. We've been talking about pandemic EBT card, just as a state issue benefit that for families whose children participated and other school or participate in private school children at for the age. Between five and eighteen, who were eligible to receive a one, I mean who was able to receive reduced to a half price lunch they're going to receive of our one- time payment of about 420 for each elavil child representative for school meals and from the periods of March to June 26. There's no reason to apply for this. The state occurs pretty much for us to be reaching out to the Department of Education to get the families. This is a this will not affect public charge for anyone who's undocumented again. This Appendix considered a pandemic EBT card system to help with situations for people who did not come in for family school children did not receive reduced to have price lunches during the school session or in a pandemic. Hard is a couple more things, real, quick to get it now. I begin concerns. People who say name receive I, mean apart for SNAP benefits or catches, any have not received a B BT card, so I'm actually going to put into the comment. I hope it went through. So you get a BT card is an information than the comment for people to do this fake. It either call eight three two, eight six, three nine or they can actually go to W, and then we also created something to keep in touch with the community called our CDA QA, and that is a way that the community can send questions or learn information that is going on in the office on our social media. We are on social media, Instagram Twitter, so you can go to social media and we also and so he's working diligently to make sure that those individuals in prison I will send that information to Debbie and I am here. Anyone has any questions great to see you Thank You Marci. Thank you very much. We appreciate. Thank you. Okay from DLB. Does everyone hear me? We can all rights right from buildings, whatever I'm doing all right: okay, I'm just quickly. As you know, the governor's orders still in place essential versus non- essential construction, so you'll be still enforcing the essential, do be still enforcing non- essential construction. So if any complaints are coming in to us, we are going on and look at those may be essential construction sites. Those sites have to apply for a certificate or authorization that has to be posted on the on the job site, letting you know they and there's a map on our website as well. If they were I've been sending out emails, but field does not know you bought on our website. There's a map you could type in the address of or type in the address and I'll show you. If there is a if that job is essential site, so they could have applied for it. We got approved such as, like a health care food government facility. Those types of coal consider essentials so, but they still have to apply to get that certificate. Many emergency jobs will fall in a category as well. We are enforcing social, distancing on- site, so we- and you know you- are taking a lot of steps to a lot of our processes that were in paper to online, so a lot of its going to do beat down as well, so we're continuing looking at new processes how to minimize contact in the office in transition those processes over to online. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, alright, so that officially closes out the public session. As I said in the fork, there are any comments or concerns by any individual board members or the public. Please let me know we will redirect it to the appropriate individual whose concern you need an address. I just want everybody to know that, so we do not have the clipboard. So it's hard for me to engage where we're going from person to person, so please bear with us alright. Thank you very much so that closes out the public session. Before we move on to the election notification. I want to address Steve's boyens, he's concerned regarding the liquor application process that we receive Steve your point. You know this is not the first time you know. We've spoken about that, especially we were at Moravian, where the applicants came down to the with their attorney and that we had all these discussions and I specifically asked at the time I Act, II, D, salic and I also asked Jerry and Debra to at the time. I did not try it to that I used to ask Frank, Marciano and Dana when these applications come in to the board, I mean we're really powerless. You know unless we get some specific complaint about someone raising an issue or something like that, we basically review. What's submitted in front of us and pretty much accepted as truthful. You know, because we do not have any oversight. We do not have any legal authority, we just we do not even have enforcement authority, you know and that's unfortunate what happened. It's juicy Lucy's is terrible and the guy came to us specifically and made representations to all of us and none of them panned out. You know but I'm sure, there's a other story that we're just not aware of there. You know, but I just wanted. You and the rest of the board know that when we W gets these no Jerry and Eddie and the team they do review these and put them through their diligence that will authorize to do and that's the way we take those actions. I do not Jerry there anything else. You want to add to that or Eddie, because I'm not sure what else we what other authorities we have to do in that regard, Jerry I look at the places where they are and I try to do the best we can I have a couple of friends at a police department. I ask them, there's any objections and we go from there. Yeah cuz I mean no track record, you know or approval, and then the following problems has been pretty. You know, there's more right: we had Lincoln Avenue, we had capodanno the one on Lincoln Avenue, the last one that we had it's working out: fine yeah the last one that but remember before that, of course, one but stamping these things you know and see. Did you want to say anything about that or any other recommendations, if you're so naive? No do I wanna sound like a barfly, but do any bars on Staten Island that strictly serves just beer and wine and have music playing restaurants. You, where is that starting point for them, because I do not know of any place on Staten Island that serves alcohol and it's a choice of wine or beer? That's true, I, just think it's a starting point and I think they start to add on and add on, and then it escalates into something that people did not walk in the beginning, a problem and they get the phone calls. And then we come back to us again right, yeah I, just you know, I think beefsteak Charlie's was beer and wine that was in the 70s. That was it Jerry. If they're going to go horn and beer wine, they have to come back and renew their application for their license to serve liquor license so today, exactly how look into juice loosely as well. Do you run these by like I'm Talkin is the new barrel Commissioner? Do you run these by him prior I know Debbie and I? Have you know conversations sort of locations, but do you have like a formal process where you run these by the immortal Commissioner if they have any questions prior to the meeting, unless no, unless we get complaints or criticisms from the community? Okay and the application that's submitted when the boxes are checked about being within distances from schools and churches and stores and children and all those things you know, and so there's really there's really I know, there's no red flags that would go up to say. Well, it's called a DOB. Maybe they today I do not have a CEO, you know! No, we do not do that. No, unless there's a specific complaint, so I was going to speak to Debbie and Jerry to see what is what is the actual process to vet? These things I mean you know by the time we get them attorneys they come down. I mean they have it's awesome. You know we can take this conversation of the firm yeah, okay, Thank You Jerry, but the borough Commission of want to know about this I mean maybe something I can get more than where it may be. More of the those meetings. Well, you have the approvals. You know it could be an option. Application I could not forward it to you and you could. Let me know what you know what you think of it. We also send them to do to the local precinct or community objections. Got it. Okay, seas, plane, skier, you still on with us. Okay, maybe he left all right, we'll just he'll just have to read our transmission after in the public record, all right all right, so that closes out this issue when these applications come through and it goes through. Robert I do not mind beer and wine being by the beach I live I live on the beach okay. I am concerned about the Cabaret more than anything I know. Did you hear the discussion we that we ensued between I appreciated, so God thank God I'm a board member and I can get to you people and we can kind of understand these things as they work out. Okay, I want to applaud everybody for that, but I do not know what that does for us for Juicy Lucy, because all the things he promised us and nothing I know that I know that Robert, but would not you know they can promise everything in the world, but that does not mean that it becomes true. Okay can get a lawyer and they can come in front of us and they kept Travis the world we've seen this time and time again it's not this started out that there was going to be another liquor license and the only do I put it as a prerequisite of this is the circumstances and conditions of that liquor. License. I understand you, but I want you and the rest of the board and the public to understand that when Debbie, when we get these things, we take them serious. You know I mean we read. Every knows. Jerry knows me and Eddie the whole Public Service Commission committee. There. We really look at these things and you know, to the extent, were able to do things. We do and I understand we're doing exactly what we can exactly I. Think between you and me and four walls, it went, come June comes or July and the music starts again. That's very going to be exuberant. Okay, that we can just step on this a little bit. That's what is now that's fine! It's on everybody's radar be interesting to see if he has a crowd in there in June and July. So that's a bigger issue taking joy. He can get a crowd. Well, they can get a crowd. You can get a crowd, keep the music down into a decibel, that's going to be acceptable by the community, and then you can hold the crowd to make all the money in the world. I could care less. Okay noted all right. Thank you. Steve I just want to make sure you heard what we're trying before we get to the item on the item on the agenda, which of the elections is Letitia's comments about the homeless, shelter on victory and Bay for money. We did get the information today. Debbie did send me several emails, actually a lot of emails with all the backup that I had acts for, and it was not. It did come late in the day, but listening to your presentation, Leticia I do not know if you're still, along with us here, I would agree with you that I'm not so sure that that's in this time, in this age, with the issues with the with the coronavirus and all the issues that just that occupancy poses to the inhabitants and the local community I'm not sure that it's a good idea and it's the highest and best use on that without major changes to that whole concept. So unless the board, anyone on the board wants to comment or say something. Please raise your hand, so the host can see it, but I would otherwise recommend that dedi it consistent with Lateisha's request that we go on record that we support her and in rejecting that plan for that location. But then we will continue to read the information that was sent to us, but from what I've seen thus far from what I've heard. I'm not sure that it's the right thing to do at that location in this time. So having said that, I'll just turn back to the host. If there's any more comments or any questions about that particular item, otherwise Debbie will be requested to notify Latisha and the authority of the Community Board to use position. Nothing. Thank you. Okay, I guess. We're still here, that's to fill 48 people any other business. Last time we met I guess it was February right. Okay, I do not even remember what the list anybody any other all business. Please raise your hand and let the hosts know so we can discuss and address okay, all right so before we go to new business. Let's go to item for item 6, actually nominations for the election of the offices and the meticulous script in the binder in the spiral bound book is now in the hands of Teresa Triana.

Looking over the on of the older agenda tonight, it would not be a real meeting if I did not ex Roy golly see about the treasurer's report but, as I said in the February meeting, were giving Roy a pass going forward and that he does do meticulous accounting for the board and the report is available at the board office and if anyone has any questions or concerns or wants to see the arithmetic and the columns and the expenses month- to- month, day- to- day week- to- week seconds two seconds. Just please reach out to Debbie and Roy and they'll be glad to show you what we have. That's one that everybody to know that, but we're not in the interest of full disclosure. Okay, all right, let me go back to the agenda because it looks why believe it or not went down to any new business. Okay, not having any new business. I motioned before I motion to adjourn the next full board. I just want to thank everyone and know that I take your confidence to heart and I always do the best for this community and the people of Staten, Island and I. Congratulate all my fellow Board members, Executive Board I had a question. Robert I do not know if any of our elected officials could answer this question if it's appropriate at this time, but I have a question with this unemployment Michaels where people are not getting more money, that's a federal issue. Okay, he's still here was a woman, the city, but the two other courses are disrepair. Does the city have any plans on opening, because everything's open in Jersey State horses are open and wonder what the city is doing with that yeah? That makes sense, I think so far, they're still under two, because they're concessions on our property, the concession supposed to be taking care but I think since they are shut down because they are a business that they do not have the maintenance going on. It is discouraging people from playing, so it kind of helps both ways, but I can get all the details sent over to the office. If you like. Just do you guys have certification on it? Okay, it looks big agenda, but I think we're up to new business, but before we do that one more time for new business is there anyone that did not get a chance to say something and the board that wants to say something and raise your hands. So the host can recognize you for 45 seconds. Okay, all right, I, a motion to adjourn any one. Second, on the bottom right, it says, leave the meeting.
