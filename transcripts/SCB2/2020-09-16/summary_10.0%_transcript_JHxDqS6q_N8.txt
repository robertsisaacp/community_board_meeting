Almost ready all right, it's seven o'clock, it's time to commence the community board two September meetings.
Keep saying, is the home of where all the repository of the status of the board and all the things that we've been trying to do or not do, but that is the first place for you guys to look If. Something doesn't make sense, please let debbie know committee chair and vice chair.
The committees need to be able to do exactly what I'm doing here to moderate a meeting with the committee and then collect whatever information or whatever items you guys would be voting on or recommendations for a matter that you guys have heard to bring it to the full board.
He's, our newest member, to community board too He's currently assigned to the environmental committee working with mr ninavagi as a board member to that committee, so he'll be reached out so welcome and thank you again feel free to reach out to debbie.
I. Don't know that the board needs to take an action or even vote on this, but please proceed with your presentation, debbie's landing ahead, that we do So We're going to vote.
And, I'm, the accountable manager for this job Okay, as you may, know, dep, is responsible for delivering over 1 billion gallons of drinking water per day to over 9 million new yorkers, and I'm, just starting off in terms of committee members who aren't familiar with the ep and what we do in terms of delivering the the water to new york city area.
In the yellow approximate location of the victory boulevard pump station, it serves the abbess chelsea local area of staten island on the right hand, side.
That is going to be all new and incorporated another important element of implementing that we have to put in sustainability requirements as part of the design to meet new local law in 1994 and an important another important item that needs to be done is maintaining the pumping operations during the construction of the pump station.
Okay, I mentioned designing for 50-year structural life, and the map on the right-hand side shows the approximate area of victory.
If you look down at their sea, level, rise adjustment of critical flood elevation that table shows you what you need to design the pump station for if you're designing, for a structure of 50, years, so end of use for life, that's between the year 2070 and 2099.
The line needs to it's going to be 16.33, so we have to design the pump station to meet that minimum requirement, and I have on the new design.
Boulevard, looking east, as you can see the new above ground electrical building for the pump station, so that would meet the criteria for the flood elevation and on this side here behind the the fence.
We will be able to use the existing wet well of the older station to increase the capacity without having to build a whole new one, right.
This would be under franklin, obagi's wheelhouse, but since it came directly to the board, I will take this now and propose that the board vote on the new york city department of environmental protection pump station 317 at victory, boulevard station vote.

Right, the opposite, whatever you think Yes, because this project is adjacent to a residential community of town homes and the only way in and out to get to this self-storage unit would be to have a parade of trucks and cars.
There was a link that, in the in the invite for people that were going to show up Okay, I I'm new to the to the community board hearing for this.
So I recommend that you contact debbie, erico tomorrow, she's, the community chair, okay, What is your concern?
The ccrb would like to respond to the open comment period for that disciplinary matrix, but we want to make sure we collect feedback from the general public, so we sent an email over to the community board.
