But right now, our guidance is we're going to be meeting like this, so you be on the lookout for the notices that Debbie will be putting out the CB2 website, as I.
Keep saying, is the home of where all the repository of the status of the board and all the things that we've been trying to do or not do, but that is the first place for you guys to look If. Something does not make sense, please let Debbie know committee chair and vice chair.
The committees need to be able to do exactly what I'm doing here to moderate a meeting with the committee and then collect whatever information or whatever items you guys would be voting on or recommendations for a matter that you guys have heard to bring it to the full board.
You, probably got the census application in the mail, the more people that respond to more money, that'll be allocated to New York and the borough, and specifically staten island, Hopefully CB2.
I want to introduce Mr Ben Damato, he's our newest member to community Board too, he's currently assigned to the environmental committee working with Mr Ninavagi as a board member to that committee, so he'll be reached out so welcome and thank you again feel free to reach out to debbie.
I do not know that the board needs to take an action or even vote on this, but please proceed with your presentation, Debbie's landing ahead, that we do so We're going to vote.
As you may, know, DEP is responsible for delivering over 1 billion gallons of drinking water per day to over 9 million new Yorkers And I'm, just starting off in terms of committee members who are not familiar with the Ep and what we do in terms of delivering the the water to New, York, City, area.
We have 14 wastewater treatment facilities located throughout the five boroughs and, in addition to that, works in conjunction with 96 pump stations that conveys the wastewater flow to the treatment plant and Victory Boulevard is one of the treatment plants and, of course, DEP.
If you look at the bottom, left- hand, side, you'll, see Staten Island see a little box of Victory Boulevard Pump station.
I mentioned it's Travis Chelsea area of Staten island So, since then, all the electrical have been relocated above ground and that's something that needs to be addressed, and this collects all the sanitary waste and sends it to port Richmond.
That is going to be all new and incorporated another important element of implementing that we have to put in sustainability requirements as part of the design to meet new local law in 1994 and an important another important item that needs to be done is maintaining the pumping operations during the construction of the pump station.
The right- hand, side shows the approximate area of Victory Boulevard Pump station a border zone x, which is the 500 year, flood, plane percent chance of an annual flood, and you could see zone ae, which is the 100-year floodplain.
If you look down at their sea level, rise adjustment of critical flood elevation that table shows you what you need to design the pump station for if you're designing, for a structure of 50, years, so end of use for life.
The line needs to it's going to be 16.33, so we have to design the pump station to meet that minimum requirement, and I have on the new design.
Boulevard, looking east, as you can see the new above ground electrical building for the pump station, so that would meet the criteria for the flood elevation and on this side here behind the the fence.
We will be able to use the existing wet well of the older station to increase the capacity without having to build a whole new one, right.
Let's say storm They're, looking at the forecast they will and the generator will be new to Victory Boulevard pump station, but it will not be there permanently, so upcoming storm.
There's one on cannon, Avenue and, as I heard, I, think there may be eight more That, you know would have the same: problem: Yo, Staten, Island, Some pump stations are not owned by DEP.
But since it came directly to the board, I will take this now and propose that the board vote on the New York City Department of Environmental Protection pump station 317 at Victory Boulevard station vote.
There was a link that, in the in the invite for people that were going to show up I, do not know if you guys rule on this decision or is brought to your community board decision.
The new DEP project, that's being done along Highland Boulevard.
So I recommend that you contact Debbie Erico tomorrow, she's, the community chair, okay, What is your concern?
The ccrb would like to respond to the open comment period for that disciplinary matrix, but we want to make sure we collect feedback from the general public, so we sent an email over to the Community board.
However, we're just hoping that the Community board and their public safety committee may be able to attend.
, I do not know where we are hold on a second So that ends the public session for community board members.
