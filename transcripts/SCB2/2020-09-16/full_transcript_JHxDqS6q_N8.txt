Almost ready all right, it's seven o'clock, it's time to commence the community board two September meetings. Let me just welcome everybody. So, let's just say the pledge of allegiance. Look at David santoro, please. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands. One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice. For all. Thank you please be seated okay, theresa attend. Are we ready we're ready? Let's do it aj. I know I saw his name up there. I saw him he's there all right, alifi Babashkin. I know I saw him yep. I saw him too no they're on mute. That's why, but they have to come off mute in order and everyone and everyone on Mute can the host unmute everybody for 30 seconds. Okay, I'll start again, aj! I know he's there. He said on mute, no stop you're, not going outside. Okay I'll start with D'amato. The Yamato beat your penny. Dolan Dumas, Fagan, Freeman, hello, she's, here, okay answered me garlicy. I know I saw him. Why he's here he's there genevieves Jenta, Hennessy Jones, I saw Jones somewhere Joan. Is there maurice is here: I saw her okay, all right: Kang you're, diabetes, lillian, yeah, okay, oh wild, Zador, Rico SAPOynsky! What's that? Okay, that's it all right! Do we have close to a quorum that we could proceed? Yes, all right, all right, we're going to move we're going to move forward with the motion to accept the proposed agenda. David. Second, all right, one! Second, because there's a lot of background noise. Some people have two devices on and we're getting back now they commute they commute everyone could now. You can all mute your phone just unmute collegio for a few minutes, okay and I'll shut up all right. I think it would be a good idea to ask anyone who is phoning in to give us their name, because we really do not have we have. It looks like seven, eight ten board members present. That does not seem right. No, I think there's way more than that, I'm looking at everybody on the screen. So if everyone that called in that's not on zoom or use the zoom number yeah, I have 17.. Yes, she does 2:3 4., but Marissa. Jones is a questionable because I do not see her. Oh you're right. That was a mistake. I have 13. well, I have 16. I'll go over with you. After the meeting debbie 43 members, we need a quorum to vote. How many do we need so we need at least 20:43. Yes. So let's do the attendance again if you do not mind no by all means, otherwise we can't move forward. I agree. Okay, everybody ready wait. Theresa wait. Can the host now unmute everyone, because you have control to do that alexandra? Yes, everyone is unmuted. Everyone on music, well, they're, all muted, okay, I'm going to take attendance. If everybody's here, please just answer when I call your name aj. Yes, alifi Sebastian, I'm here Collegio, here, Yamato Freeman, here Darling. Can you please help me Markowski Mcnamara, Mindy, yeah, salic santoro, here Seminara Sheen, Mcnamara, Randy, Mcnamara's, here zaboinsky, you get me who's that sandy yeah. I have you, okay, roseanne clift. Are you here? Okay? Yes, I keep getting disconnected. I'm sorry, that's okay! It's Iphone! Can I ask a question? I have 20 debbie. Can you hear me yes, whoever's trying to hear you? My phone says Michael Pacheco, but it's Denise Pacheco from Assemblyman Michael Riley's office. We're not yet we're just cutting board members first and we'll! Oh I'm sorry, the politicians! What do you have? Okay, one minute? Maybe we do not have a performance, maybe you're on mute that'd, be we're good, we're going to go. It's counting up. I have 20.. I have 22. all right. We got enough while I was taking the attendance. Okay, all right, we're going to go okay motion to accept the proposed agenda. David. You had second, that right, David Santoro's, second, that, okay, my the chairs report just bear with me a moment. So, first of all, I just want to thank everyone. Welcome everybody to our September meeting. I do want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of our esteemed member fred. June's brother Debbie sent an email out to the board members yesterday and our condolences and our friends are with Fred and his family. There was the notice the information was in the email about the memorial and burial and so on and so forth. If anybody wishes to attend the board, I think we're sending a card. Terry. Is that correct Teresa? It's already done. Okay, thank you! Good. Okay! So obviously we're going to be continuing these zoom type meetings for the foreseeable future until we can meet as a group with this quality of people without any traditional without any safeguards or anything. But right now our guidance is we're going to be meeting like this, so you be on the lookout for the notices that Debbie will be putting out the CB2 website, as I keep saying, is the home of where all the repository of the status of the board and all the things that we've been trying to do or not do, but that is the first place for you guys to look it's cb2si.com and thanks to zefrazoom Darma's, everything has been trying to be updated as current as we can. If something does not make sense, please let Debbie know committee chair and vice chair. We did assign a number of vice chair to all the committee to help the committee chairman get through any items that we may have to handle as a board. I did send out some requests this afternoon that we do need to have. The committees need to be able to do exactly what I'm doing here to moderate a meeting with the committee and then collect whatever information or whatever items you guys would be voting on or recommendations for a matter that you guys have heard to bring it to the full board like we're doing here and it'll wind up on the agenda. I'm not a mute. Am I no and so yeah the I so Joel Traub and a few others have reached out to me and we're going to try to set up a zoom training session for the committee chair and vice chair. So everybody can learn how to access it and how to set up an account on your own, if necessary, to be able to conduct board business for the committee if that's not possible or if it's too much, please let Debbie know and I'll have to either tack on that particular committee's meeting agenda on our board meeting somehow either before during or after so that you can get on this particular platform that we're doing now and we're just going to have to start earlier. That's all so. I want to make sure that we're doing everything correctly as far as the hearing of matters and the decisions and the votes and the public and the notices and all the things that we go through our admittedly, our workloads dropped dramatically to zero since we had the pandemic. Actually, so there's not a lot really going on. So it's a good time for us to learn and get our administrative processes and house in order. That's what I've been trying to do all summer with Debbie and you saw all the emails she sent out about the assignment special committee. If anybody has any questions on anything that we're trying to do just reach out to you to Debbie and she'll reach out to me and we'll discuss that as usual. So again, the meeting will be held virtually until further notice. The NYPD, in conjunction with Richmond County, District attorney, Michael Mcmahon, and the Central Family Life center will be hosting a cash for guns event on Saturday September 9:19 from 10 to four. At the last three cash for gun events, Staten island collected over 200 guns, which were surrendered. There were no questions asked social distancing needs to be adhered. I do not know how we return a gun, social distancing, but that's how you're going to do it. If you have it again, no questions asked that's at the Central Family Life center at Wright Street, I'm not sure where that is. If you go with a with a weapon or something like that, you'll get a 200 prepaid, gift card or a prepaid gift card. If you have a rifle or a shotgun, so the bigger the weapon, the worse weapon, you bring the more money, you'll get okay. So, as a reminder, the 2020 census is ending in September, which is in a couple of weeks and it's critical that all new yorkers are counted. There's a whole paragraph here for me to read, which I'm not going to do. Of course you got the idea. You probably got the census application in the mail, the more people that respond to more money, that'll be allocated to New York and the borough, and specifically staten island, hopefully CB2. So that's all. I really had for the board for the chairs comments and committee items here. So let me just get back to the agenda for a moment. It looks like our new member is on. Okay, that's what I was going to get to which I just wanted to introduce our new member. Is he here? I do not see him that internet. What is it terry? What's his name, I do not know your motto. I saw him on page two, oh okay, there it is okay, you got it Ben, yes, Mr D'amato! Welcome to Community board two everyone on board on our meeting here. I want to introduce Mr Ben Damato, he's our newest member to community Board too, he's currently assigned to the environmental committee working with Mr Ninavagi as a board member to that committee, so he'll be reached out so welcome and thank you again feel free to reach out to debbie. If you have any questions on anything and our website is where there's a home, where all the stuff that we do and do not do is located. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome, okay, all right! We have two presentations tonight. One is the New York City Department of Environmental protection. We'll present the Ps 317 victory. Boulevard pump station practice. Anyone here from DEP, yes, Robert, Olivari, okay, hi Robert. How are you good go ahead? You have a few minutes and we'll just shut you off when we had enough so well, I'm the Staten island representative for DEP, I will be giving the presentation my co- workers Steve will be doing that. I saw him on here earlier. I think he might still be muted. No, I'm muted! Oh there you go. Where are you? I do not see you? Okay, all right go ahead, please go ahead and just I just want to think this is Matthew Sid, I'm also with DEP I'm. Oh, I work with Steve. So if there's any questions at the end, Steve and I can answer- but we may- we may both be needed. Okay. So this is just the public information session here for this. I do not know that the board needs to take an action or even vote on this, but please proceed with your presentation, Debbie's landing ahead, that we do so we're going to vote. Okay go ahead. Please go ahead! Steve! Yes! Now, in terms of the presentation, I thought it was going to be put up on the board. I do not know if there's possibility of sharing screens or I did receive an email of what is going to be presented, but I was not told I was going to be the presenter, the Presenter Steve. You could probably share your screen. We have the ability remotely to yeah exactly right. Okay, the green button in the middle of your in the middle of your screen on the bottom. Do you have you can have your presentation yeah? Let me just open up. I requested to share screen. It says: host disabled participant screen sharing. Okay, so I think on your side, you have to allow me to share screen yeah, I'm not the host, so I think we're going to have to just work our way through it. If you can just describe for us, okay sure what I will do, I will try the best in terms of describing they had a lot of pictures that went along with the presentation, disabled participant screen, sharing. Okay, I'm going to try again screen share okay, go ahead, okay, nothing's happening so with everybody, so the board will get it well, it could work now. If you try again try it again. Okay, are you able to see it not yet all right, you should be able to see a screen one moment. Hi Lord. Is anyone able to see it nope all right, you're still seeing every? I guess all the faces, everybody! I see the whole board and the visitors so go ahead. Yeah we have it electronically, so yeah steve. Just what do you just go through the slides? Oh it's coming up there. It is there you go there. You go all right there. It is all right now. The little quirky problem is that it has to be the top okay. There you go. We're good are you. This is my screen. I'm sharing my streaks at the presentation. It's this way awesome! That's it excellent yep! That's it all right! Let me know, as you want to scroll down, will do all right thanks good, go ahead! Okay, welcome everyone! Thank you for having us here tonight. Now, of course, my name is Steve Eli Pierre and I'm the accountable manager for this job. This contract ps317, which is for the reconstruction of the Victory Boulevard Pump Station, and I also Matthew, identified himself portfolio manager, DEP and next screen. Okay, as you may know, DEP is responsible for delivering over 1 billion gallons of drinking water per day to over 9 million new Yorkers and I'm just starting off in terms of committee members who are not familiar with the Ep and what we do in terms of delivering the the water to New York City area. This is done by we manage 19 reservoirs, mostly upstate, and three controlled lakes, with a storage capacity of over 58 billion gallons. For the wastewater side, the Ep treats an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day and that's done. By operating. We have 14 wastewater treatment facilities located throughout the five boroughs and, in addition to that, works in conjunction with 96 pump stations that conveys the wastewater flow to the treatment plant and Victory Boulevard is one of the treatment plants and, of course, DEP. Also. We work to reduce air noise and hazardous materials pollution, mostly through enforcement. Okay. This is a map showing the various locations of the 14 treatment plants and, if you look at the bottom left- hand, side you'll see Staten Island see a little box of Victory Boulevard Pump station. That's the approximate location of the pump station and where you see the large red star, that is the treatment plant, the that the flow eventually from Victory Boulevard Guard makes its way for treatment, and that is port, Richmond, Wastewater, Treatment, Facility Richard, yes, port Richmond. This slide shows staten island on the left hand, side more or less in the yellow approximate location of the Victory Boulevard Pump station. It serves the abbess Chelsea local area of Staten island on the right hand side. I know it may be a little hard to see, but it's zoomed out of the Travis Chelsea area. The pump station is located around the red arrow and it's right off of exit 7 off the West Shore Expressway yep, just to give individuals an idea of where it is, and it's on the west side of the expressway it's west of 440 right here exactly this is a zoomed in view of the victory pump station, it's where you have the yellow rectangle, just north of that is pratt industries. I believe that's the paper mill victory Boulevard. The punk station is located on the right of way of Victory Boulevard and I gave more or less an estimate of 80 feet at the edge of the right- of- way, the width of the street just to get an idea of the right- of- way. This is views of the pumping station. Looking from Victory Boulevard on the upper left- hand, side, the pump station is relatively middle- aged at 32 years old. It was constructed in 1989, it is a sanitary type pump station serving residential, commercial and industrial users and the receiving facility I mentioned earlier. It's Fort Richmond the structure itself. It's a partial above ground pump station with a separate electrical vault has a valve vault and a wet weld, and all of that is located underground. Current number of pumps. There are three submersible pumps general description of the pump station. I mentioned it's Travis Chelsea area of Staten island and it's zoned its industrial zone. It's currently the location of the pump station, and I just wanted to point out after superstorm Sandy most of the electrical was underground in the electrical vault. It was partially flooded. So since then, all the electrical have been relocated above ground and that's something that needs to be addressed, and this collects all the sanitary waste and sends it to port Richmond facility. Is that how that works? Yes, what it does is it will pump into downstream sewers that eventually makes its way to the facility. Thank you. These are various components of the currently station. You have the con-, ed meters and the electrical controls on the upper left- hand, side have a few pictures of the wet well hatches that go down into the wet well and the various bolts, and you can see on the bottom right hand, side the valve chamber. Okay, if I'm rushing through it. Just let me know you know, that's fine! That's fine! Thank you well for the project elements for victory pump station. It is a state of good repair, so the job needs to be done due to the age. Of course, you have deteriorating conditions of the pump station and it's been identified by our by the bwt, which is the group that operates. It needs full rehabilitation and reconstruction of the pump station and part of the design it needs to meet certain design criterias from Bwt. That's a bureau wastewater treatment. One criteria is n, plus two pump requirements that n plus two pump requirements. It means basically you're going to have one or two pumps in operation and you need to have one pump on Standby and one pump spare and that's what well. We need to provide dual power service when available from Con Edison yeah. For this pump station we're lucky to have two feeders coming in from finance. We need provisions to incorporate an emergency generator. We have to increase, of course, implement new safety standards that have changed since the first build of the original station and what we do during the design build that we designed for 50 years structural life with 20 years. Mechanical and electrical life in the 50 years is significant because it ties with the flooding elevation that we have to build for and of course, we have to meet critical flood elevations levels I'll go into that they have a few slides and it's important to bring the electrical room. The electrical components above ground because of flooding, of course, the new design. Also we have to provide all new equipment, mechanical electrical mechanical being the submersible pumps in the wet. Well, we have some pumps valve actuators piping, HVAC plumbing systems all need to be new. Likewise, for the electrical we have the motor control, centers Mcc level, controls in the Wet, Weld generator and led lighting in the electrical building. That is going to be all new and incorporated another important element of implementing that we have to put in sustainability requirements as part of the design to meet new local law in 1994 and an important another important item that needs to be done is maintaining the pumping operations during the construction of the pump station. So we can't stop pumping the flow eventually into the receiving sewer, so that has to be maintained throughout the full construction period. Okay, okay, I mentioned designing for 50-year structural life and the map. On the right- hand, side shows the approximate area of Victory Boulevard Pump station a border zone x, which is the 500 year, flood plane percent chance of an annual flood, and you could see zone ae, which is the 100-year floodplain, so the pump station is on is in zone x, close to the zone Ae and that's important because we have the Fema base elevation of where the pump station is that is 12 feet. So, if you look down at their sea level, rise adjustment of critical flood elevation that table shows you what you need to design the pump station for if you're designing for a structure of 50 years, so end of use for life, that's between the year 2070 and 2099.. So as part of design added to the 12 feet, base flood elevation, we need to, we need to add 24 inches Free board. In addition, we need to add 28 inches of sea level rise adjustment. So we have the new elevation, the critical flood elevation 50 years down. The line needs to it's going to be 16.33, so we have to design the pump station to meet that minimum requirement, and I have on the new design. It says: top Tub top elevation wall I'll go into it at 17 feet, that's going to be a location where the generator is going to be put in when needed. The emergency generator. The first floor of the electrical room is at elevation 17, which meets the flood criteria, the criteria, the critical flood elevation, sorry of 50 years down the line and also the valve vault. The top slab will also be 17 meeting the criteria. I have a question for you. This is just a recommendation and rather than get into the full report in full detail, can you just summarize because we do have other items on our agenda tonight? Sure, okay and we do have this electronically, and I did not want to waste your time. You know and everyone here. If we have, if you can just summarize the back end of this and then we can okay well, how about how about pictures? Fine! That's! Fine! Okay! Thank you! Okay! So this is the picture of the new proposed pump station I'll go through the items. The existing structure is here we're going to keep that footprint Steve. I think he needs to move forward a few slides, okay. Well, you go to the renderings, which I do not remember. I do not recall what slide number that was, but keep going right here. Okay, so I have well two renderings of the proposed pump station, so this is victory. Boulevard, looking east, as you can see the new above ground electrical building for the pump station, so that would meet the criteria for the flood elevation and on this side here behind the the fence. That is where the tub is going to be, where operations will be able to just pull in the trailer mounted generator when needed. If the forecast calls for upcoming storms they'll pull in that trailer mounted generator, it will be watertight around the four. The four sides and the up the pump station will be able to operate. So that's the 20 foot for 24:7 operation in the event of a hurricane or a storm, or something like that. Exactly correct. Awesome! Very good, okay- and this is the other view of the pump station looking West along Victory Boulevard, and that is the the rendering that we will be sending over the pdc for the new pump station. What is the status of this project right now? Okay, I have the status. These are the architectural elements, I'm not going to go through it right, okay, the status of the pump station right now. We have, of course, we're looking to submit to pdc early fall this year, yes, this year for 2020 we're going to try to do it, hopefully next month, design or construction. This is for well. This is the construction contract. We're going to put it out, so pdc approves the construction contract with the proposed renderings. So this is designed already. Is it going to be a design build? No, it's at the next. You can see design completion. It's currently in design right now, oh okay, right! So we have to put out the construction contract got it. The design completion is 2020. and when it says procurement start that's where we have to put together the construction contract they'll go out for bid. It takes a little while to actually select the bidder and so forth, so we're looking at the start of construction when that's done, December 2021 so the end of next year and substantial completion that date means when the pump station will be able to be taken over by bwt. So the construction period is approximately two years and we have one additional year for final completion out and that's really administrative on Dep's side and the existing pump station will remain in operation. While this is being built exactly yeah, that's an important part of it. So that's critical and then what happens to the existing the do they stay operational cycle or does that just get no the existing? What we're going to do with the existing? It will be mothballed. What I mean by that we're not going to demolish the of course the existing is underground. So we're not going to demolish the structure because, if needed in the future, if that drainage area has additional, let's say population growth which you have additional stormwater or wastewater coming into, we will be able to use the existing wet well of the older station to increase the capacity without having to build a whole new one right. Exactly. Thank you. Okay, so last slide, of course, questions. That's it. I was using my own slide, so this was good, very good yeah. Is this funded for construction? Yes, it is funded for construction, but then again, currently what New York City is experiencing with the budget we have to see, but so far we have the green light. Okay, I have some questions sure I want to know how many pumping stations do we have on Staten island, oh Staten Island, I'm off the record, I'm not sure, but I would say approximately probably 10. and how many wastewater stations we there are two is that in Oakwood, the other one exactly the other one in staten island is Oakwood beach. So there's port richmond in Oakwood beach, Oakwood beach satisfies it, takes the drainage from the southern part or mid and southern part of Staten Island. Okay, thank you. Thank you all right, one second, so we happen to have. I think we have visitors from Travis within whose town this pump station actually will reside or will reside in gene. Are you still on with us? If you guys, if Travis had any questions? Yes, I am. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. I did not. I have two questions. Okay, we have the cannon avenue pumping station, which is directly almost acrosss the street from my house and I'm sure that it interacts with the Victory boulevard pumping station. My main question or concern is whenever Con Edison loses power. Okay, that pumping station goes out of service and if it's out of cert the cannon avenue pumping station I'm talking about if it goes out of service for more than a half an hour, the low- lying homes on Cannon Avenue flood begin to flood. Okay, I have through councilman matio and I may have even brought it up to the Community board asked for DEP to put in an ats system an automatic transfer system that would automatic. There are generators at that site, but we have to. We have to contact. Dep has to get people in from Oakwood to start up those generators to get them back online. I've been asking for an automatic transfer system for years. I can't see in this day and age why we do not already have one, but that's one concern my other concern would be. Will the Victory Boulevard station have an ats system because if they go at us Offline I mean then the whole. The whole system goes downtown, so that is, you know. We have a brand new sewer system going in through Travis and that's all well and good, but it's only as good as that. Pumping station remaining online yep good question. Thank you. Steve he's mute. The Steve is muted yeah. He was muted, Steve you're a mute. You need to mute yourself, please, okay, I'm unmuted! Go ahead. You heard the Exis the Victory Boulevard pump station. What they're going to do again when there's an upcoming, let's say storm they're, looking at the forecast they will and the generator will be new to Victory Boulevard pump station, but it will not be there permanently so upcoming storm. What they would do is, I think you have to think about it. Excuse me: well, I heard someone in the background, so what they will do is they will park the generator into that tub? Okay, this is not the day of the storm they're going to plan this out and they'll actually be there and they'll make all the connection, and it will have the automatic transfer switch to to coincide with the feed coming in from Khan Ed. In case we lose power from Con Edison. Thank you, okay. What about what about the local pumpkin stations if they lose power? I mean you know, there's one on raw roswell Avenue, there's one on cannon Avenue and, as I heard, I think there may be eight more that you know would have the same problem: Yo Staten Island, I'm not familiar with all the pump stations, but I know that Staten island does have some privately owned pump stations. Also price. Some pump stations are not owned by DEP. Well, the ones I'm referring to are definitely DEP and I formally request an automatic transfer system at Cannon, Avenue, okay, okay, tomorrow, whatever that's worth yeah, what I could we could reach out to certain individuals but Cannon Avenue, I'm not sure if it's currently, if there is a current design going on for Canon Avenue. That would address that issue. But that's some information we could get. Okay, I'd appreciate it all right. Thank you, yeah one. Second, I just want to close the screen, so I can see the rest of the board. Mr Ninova, okay, good, awesome, okay, all right gene. That was it! Thank you very much diane! You have a question. Yes, why is the generator have to be carted in the event of an emergency? Is there only like one for multiple locations? So what happens in an event like super storm sandy, where we're being hit all over there's not enough generators to go around? No, this generator is going to be sized specifically for that station, but the problem with generators they need maintenance once in a while, so it has to be sent back to the shop to to be maintained. Oh okay, thank you. Okay, anyone else have any questions or comments before we move this to a vote. No okay. So, typically, since we started the environmental committee, this would be under Franklin Obagi's wheelhouse, but since it came directly to the board, I will take this now and propose that the board vote on the New York City Department of Environmental Protection pump station 317 at Victory Boulevard station vote. Yes, if you're in favor and vote no, if you're not teresa, are you still with us? Okay, I'm here good? Okay, please thank you vote board members. Only try to vote do not try to sneak in okay and when I call you have to put you have to unmute, so that I could hear your answer. Aj! Yes, Alifi's! Not here, Babashkin, yes, balzano antoinette, yes she's here! Doctor autism is here. I see her. Oh thank God. Okay, Rosanna! Are you here? Pledgio? Yes, Dolan is not here. Durham, yes, Bacon's! Not here Freeman, yes, Garlicy Roy! I know the Roy you have to unmute Roy. I can see him buddies. Can't genevieve! Yes right, Franklin Hennessy Jones is not here. Kang is in here claude's, not here, Lillian! Yes, lance is not here with Markowski. Yes, Mcnamara Mindy, yes, okay, Orlando's, not here, Pacific, parallel, yes, raju! Yes, Nigeria, yes, Phallic Ed! I know he was here santoro. Yes, oh yeah. Okay seminar is not here. Sheen trout, yes, Cryano! Yes, Viscio's! Not here! That's it is there anybody I missed. Let's see the king, I'm here, huh, hey, okay! Yes, okay, like Roy your phone, your mute button, bro you're on you, Roy, give us a thumbs up if you're in favor of it thumbs up. Okay gave us a thumbs up. Alright, we're good all right. I got him and roseanne. I do not see that, so I can't even ask you get roseanne, no, all right. Okay, it's one! Two, three, four: five: six: seven, eight, nine ten, eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen. Sixteen seventeen! Eighteen, all right. We have twenty six we're good. Okay, so looks like we're going to build a pump station one of these days, a good one. Okay, a good one, traveling generator all right, you'll be getting correspondence from Debbie. I think. Okay, thank you. Everyone for presentation come back gene you make sure it does not leak. Gene! Okay, all right! We have. We have one more presentation which I'm told will be pretty quickly: Steve Williams here! Yes, folks, how are you doing? How are you doing David hi Steve? How are you going to talk about the Tax Limousine Commission Accessible dispatch program? Yes, folks, this is going to be very brief. I'm going to share my screen. Okay, great! You have screen right. So you're, not you! Will you see it here, nope Alexandra. Can you give Steve screen sharing rights? Please I did send my presentation over to Deborah, just in case yeah. We do have it so for the record. So if you want to okay, it's coming up here, we go okay. Thank you, frank. That's it! Okay! Well, that's a that's a different one, but that's okay! I'll just talk briefly, because I do not have a lot of time, but anyway hi folks, my name is Stephen Williams. I represent the accessible dispatch program. This is a program that connects the community to wheelchair, accessible taxis. It's 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It operates in all of five boroughs. There's no enrollment necessary.

Thank you very much frank. Thank you, frank. Anyone have any other questions to see before we shut him off. Okay, all right. Let's try to move on here then. I think that ends the presentation and we have our feature. Our feature presentation tonight is our land. Use Chair, David Santoro will present Ridgeway Avenue David. Are you hi everyone I'll try to breeze through this really quickly? So we had one item on our land Use committee meeting agenda. It was BSA calendar number, 2020-, 51-Bz, 95 and 105 ridgeway Avenue Block 2610, Lot 50.. The application was a proposed self storage, warehouse Ug16 with access provided through an r32 zoning district that is contrary to section 22- 10 zr, so we held our land use meeting on September 1st, where the applicant's representative, who was their attorney, gave a presentation and attempted to answer some of our questions. Although most of the questions we asked were essentially taken under advisement in some, the applicant seeks to build a self- storage facility adjacent to a residential development. The only access to the facility would be via ridgeway Avenue, a street lined with residential homes, all vehicles, trucks etc going into the facility- which, incidentally, would be operational. 24:7 would have to drive through this residential street to get to the site the exemption, so it relates to this access and the proposed use would be as of right, but for the required access through the residential area. The application was originally made in 2015. However, it was put on hold due to a change in the ownership group of the property. The land Use committee unanimous unanimously, passed a resolution to oppose the application 14 votes in favor of the opposition, zero votes against the opposition, so we're going to take a full vote today. A yes vote is a vote in opposition to the project. Okay. So we just it's a little a little awkward. But just remember if you vote. Yes, that's you're opposing the application David, the applicant's not present tonight the application does not is not present. Okay. So that's one of the people from Travis to g and everyone to know that the applicant's not here so we're going to move this along. Okay David. Can I ask you a question? Okay? Yes, right, Frank, I'm sorry what was the recommendation coming out of committee? The recommendation coming out of the committee was 14- 0 in opposition to the project, so we voted in favor to oppose the project right, the opposite, whatever you think, it's the opposite, yes, to oppose! Yes, and is it too much to ask why? Yes, because this project is adjacent to a residential community of town homes and the only way in and out to get to this self- storage unit would be to have a parade of trucks and cars 24:7 understood. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, all right! Frank, David Ready! Yes, it's all yours dave go ahead! Ajayi. Are we ready to vote time out? David Terry will take the vote. I just want you to move, make the move okay, yeah, so I move for a full full board. Vote: okay, Robert Question! Yes, Joe is not there a way to phrase this so that people do not have to say yes to say no, it's not confusing you're right. We get caught in this mess all the time. There has to be some way to say this, so people can say yes or people can say. No, how about you say in favor or in opposed right, exactly make that a yes exactly all right and that and then the land use chair will figure out. Are we either agreement or we're? Not an agreement and they'll just have to figure out what the hell, what we meant? Okay, we do not want to see it there. If we see it there, then we voted wrong. Okay, I'll be ready, go ahead! Yes, David go ahead! Aj we passed. Yes, okay left what happened. I do not know where everybody is thumbs up with thumbs down. Dr Kagnada, yes to oppose yes, right, collegio, yes, to oppose what the doctors said. Yes to oppose Dermas opposed Freeman, yes to oppose Garlissi, oppose genevieves, oppose Dang Kang who's. Here all right. Let me just put him aside for now: Lillian, yes to oppose this is confusing Markowski opposed. Okay, Mandy opposed yes to oppose vehemently opposed demons, no vehemently, even more confusing opposed phallic, ed and Ed you're on mute. All right, alec is on mute. Santoro pose opposed; okay, that's it I'll! Try with Debbie to get the ones we're missing all right! So excuse me, did you call me? Yes, go ahead! Tell me what you want. Did we in the Senate? Did we miss anybody? Okay, wait. Terry, wait! One minute! A kang is opposed. He just voted okay, I do not have antoinette Roseanne, clift, Perell and Ed who's on mute, Eddie, Salek, you're on mute. Give us a thumbs up or thumbs down. Eddie, be careful what you do balance it. You do not want it. Okay, all right, she'll get the other two, the other two! Okay, all right is debbie. Still here Debbie, I'm still here. Oh okay! These boxes keep moving so Ed Joe Markowski's right if things are confusing enough. So when you know when you, when we get these things and you and I go through them, I want to make sure that they're in English, so we understand they have to be. We have. We do not have a vote from policy and he's here now. Anyone who is at the list right thumbs. So I would assume- and forgive me if I'm not correct- that anyone who voted opposed to this project that land use is opposed today, that's fair, yes, right, okay, and if they change their mind, I want to know who they are. I do not think anyone's changing their mind. We've been voting for this project since 2015.. That's right! That's right! Okay, right before we go backwards and start reading it backwards, David anything else, that's it! The motion. I do not even know what is the motion to object? That's, okay! The motion to oppose is carried with 21 votes. Okay, David! Is that it? Thank you very much. David appreciate your efforts there. Okay, that actually completes the first six items on the agenda, believe it or not. So we're up to item seven, which is the a public session. Did anyone sign in that? You know for an item that we have not discussed or really has a burning desire to say something we'll give you the flaw now. But if we already took a motion on the things on the agenda, the public records closed we've already taken care of our business. So if there's something new somebody that's signed in the that wants to speak, Debbie does Jermaine get the email he. I know he had not gotten him a few times, because I sometimes will send it to him. But this time I did not he likes to speak for Hra yeah. I know that my group contact list I will check. Thank you. You're welcome also just Rob yeah she's opposed and antoinette. Okay, good, all right, theresa. That takes care of that item. Then, okay, on that one that did not answer. Okay, I did so if I saw perel on the screen he was here. I do not know what happened all right. I do not. I normally I normally get the clipboard with. You know the politicians and all them people. I do not have anything. So I do not. I can't tell who's here and who's not here. There was a link that in the in the invite for people that were going to show up so I'm going to assume whoever was here at the last meeting represented all the elected officials is here one way or another, because I have no way of knowing we're not going to go. Could you guys hear me? I have a question. I'm new to the wait. Where are you Alan? Is that Allen yeah? That's? Okay, yeah! I finally got this off to you. Yes, I opposed okay, good. We got it. We're in got that Theresa, Alan Perrell opposed got it. Okay. Did you guys Jimmy? We can yeah okay. I I'm new to the to the Community board hearing for this. For this evening. I have a question in regards. I do not know if you guys rule on this decision or is brought to your community board decision yeah one second one. Second, who are you and where I'm looking for you on the screen, my name is Christopher. Piazza, oh okay, I see you Chris. Okay, I got you go ahead. Okay, great! I live on in Dangan hills. The new DEP project, that's being done along Highland Boulevard. Is that brought to your boards to your guys table is any of those it has not been. It has not been recently. We typically would get building construction notices of traffic. You know well, this is the whole Sandy, a part of the DEP, the water. The whole project they've been doing as far as sandy concerns with leveling all the wetlands. I was just curious. They mentioned it. I spoke with a regional manager, that's actually doing the work on in the on the area, and they mentioned that. I should mention it to the Community board. Has the DEP brought paperwork or findings of what they're actually doing? I represent my community in Dungan Hills. We have a 62 unit hoa and five steps away is part of that wetlands that they're knocking down and they're, revamping it for a pond for for the water pond and for a potential walkway from off of Highland Boulevard. Is that under your is that, under your guidance? Well, that is, that came that may have come before us, so I would suggest that you give Debbie a call tomorrow and give her the address and she can research the what we, what actions that tell you what to do, how to contact DEP or what you're concerned, and we have Mr Ninavagi she's, the chair of our environmental committee, there's a couple of towns over who might be able to help you out as well. So I recommend that you contact Debbie Erico tomorrow, she's the community chair, okay, hey Robert, would not that have been brought to the board, I'm pretty sure. That's I'm pretty sure what it was. I mean those projects are pretty significant down there, of course, and I think it's part of the blue Belt Development Blue Belt yeah, I was going to say: Jack Volcker was the champion of all the blue belt projects, so I would not be those would have been brought to the board probably years ago. But what is your concern? Because you want to know what they're doing exactly yeah? I have 62 homeowners that are walking out their door now and they're modeling yeah. I mean they're asking the contract say something please diane, please go ahead d vandenberg! If you go on facebook at the Staten Island Taxpayers Association he's been involved with the blue belt for 20 years, so I know she spoke to my civic numerous times on the topic. So if you go on the Staten Island Taxpayers Association page, you can reach D vandenberg and ask her and she will be able to answer most of your questions and maybe be willing to come out and speak to your group and Debbie. This is the same project that we had that they sent me the information on the trailer. Remember they wanted to locate the trailer and we had to prove that trailer location down there, hello to boulevard, be right. The office there are a couple of projects right now on Highland Boulevard, so I'm not really which one he's talking about. It could be the one that is acrosss the street from this league. Sending me an email that I can follow the information I have Christopher. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay and then, and as diane points out D vandenberg is a bigger mouthpiece on that stuff too right guy Rob, can you hear me yes Roy? How are you fine, listen? That project is last chance, fun that Luke Carribone and the Beethoven minor group has been working on for 30 years 30 years, so is it under construction or almost done? Yes, the construction is being done. What it's going to do, as the gentleman mentioned, there'll be a pond up in there where people can walk along and everything, but all that water that's flowing down through there they're going to improvise and send it down to the ocean and down to the bay okay right. Okay, that's going to be for flight control, flood control! That's why there's part of the blue belt! This Frank pointed out exactly okay. Well, we gave you a little nugget to start this interest of research, so it did certainly came before the board Chris. I want you, okay, all right anything else, any other speakers. Anybody else, elected officials and politicians consider yourself in attendance to the Community board 2 meeting for the record. Okay, if you look at the chat, a number of people said that they wanted to speak during the public session. Okay, all right hold on hey all right, all right, I'm looking at the chat now hold on Sharon one. Second, I got ta I'm trying to just do this orderly because, like by the way, yes, I'm here, can you hear me Sharon Pope Marshall? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, I can loud and clear.

You know what they're I'm just trying to undo my video, I am the director of community outreach for oh okay, great I'm, the director of community outreach for Bike, New York, and I'm happy to be here this evening and just as an aside, I'm a community board member at a different community board myself actually almost for two decades, and we can never get those resolutions right where you're voting in new posts- and you know what, if you figure out something really it's I always have to ask every time they call my name. I always have to ask, because I want to make sure that I'm voting correctly you're right, you're, absolutely okay, so I just wanted to tell you I you know something that you already know that our beloved city continues to be terribly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and Bike New York has cycled the streets of the big apple since 1977 we've been around that long. We know New York is tough because we are all new yorkers and we're just that tough and as cyclists. What we do best is we cycle forward. It is therefore with no small amount of pride that bike New York is indeed excited to announce our virtual. Our first virtual cycling event, which is called Spoketober, spoke: that's cool October in October. Oh, my god. That's a good spot! Hey! That's September, okay, exactly we're inviting everyone to ride every day, whether you're, just you know, go one block or a couple of blocks. It's really more about Camaraderie. The emphasis is on wellness. The emphasis is to make it a family fun. So virtually but listen you get out there on your bike. Okay, it's virtually yeah! I'm sorry about! I think that was Joel right yeah, who said who said virtually okay yeah, you know what so what happens is that you ride your bike and let's say you go a half a mile or you go a mile, then you have to log your miles and we total those miles and we'll have prizes for each mile or each mile that everybody rides so we'll have a raffle we're going to do prizes, okay, and so you have to be in it to win it. So listen wrapping up, I'm going to leave my contact information as well as information about Spoketober in the chat and we're hoping that you can join us as we figure out the new normal and send it to debbie too, because she can circulate it wider to the board. Okay. Thank you. So much everyone. Thank you all right. So everybody just bear with me, hello, aj. I got it. We got you Frank Fontana, hello. Do you want to say something right? Yes, how's. Everyone doing. Thank you hope. Everybody, nice summer, just a couple, quick updates and I'll send it on the chat for one. We have a business accessory signage, webinar tomorrow, ten o'clock, so I will send a link right now. Okay, you can register to DOB, so any business owners that has an accessory sign there's been some. You know some some changes to the law, anyone that has a has a business successor signed. There was a moratorium in place until 2021, where we're not issuing a violation if they do not have a permit for the business side, so Ed Forte will be our he's from assigned unit he'll be doing the webinar tomorrow. So I encourage everybody to you know to join. We also sent an email out earlier this morning to to community boards and the elected officials. As far as DLB there's been a lot of changes with DOB. Now the Ob now a lot of the it's expanding their capabilities, so there's a lot of job filings that can that could be done through DLB now such as like alteration ones and twos before I was really just limited to like alteration: three which is curb or small permits, so they are expanding those capabilities. You can view boiler violations on there now, as well as well as a certificate. If you have the file certificate of correction before you have to go down to the DOB office, but now we're allowing people to correct those violations submit the forms through DOB now so like. If you are looking up a some kind of property, you could always check Biz and check the Ob now as well. Those two two sites just to see you know whatever information you're looking for okay and then as far as the Covid-19 so DLB as far as our role, what we're playing are not if we receive a complaint for indoor dining to someone's, Violin indoor dining rules, DOB will go out based on 301 complaints like anything else, we'll go out and inspect those those locations and then, if any business has let's say for say they have a backyard. They do not have any drive or anything, but they have a backyard space. They want to use that for outdoor dining, they can use the outdoor dining without getting a permit. They just can't go over 75 people, anything over 75 people. If we do receive a complaint three or one, we will go out and inspect the location, so they we are temporarily restricting putting that on hold in terms of getting a permit due to the coving crisis. So again up to 75 people in a backyard space. The restaurant itself would act as one means of egress as long as they could get out through the restaurant that acts as a means of egress.
