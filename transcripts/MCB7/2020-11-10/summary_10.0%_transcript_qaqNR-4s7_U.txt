She chairs the committee on public housing, which is why she has been so great to agree to come, speak to us, today, she's, actually also a former employee of NYCHA and has worked in the offices of several elected officials.
I. Want you to explain how we can go forward with the comparisons with the pact and the rad and all the things we need to go and forward, because, as I do not know.
Has I think it's such a shame that they close down the community centers and what we see happening across all of the developments across all five boroughs, with the lack of activities and space for our young, people.
There's a lot happening with public housing, not just in New York but across the country, and when we speak directly to what's happening at NYCHA.
There's a realistically a 50 billion dollar need to fix apartments, and we know that NYCHA has had its issues of poor management, piss, poor management and that lack of management led to lawsuits related to mold and lead.
That's infill deals as well as the red which is the renovation of the units and converting them from traditional section, 9 public housing to section 8 with private developers.
And I think what makes it so problematic and so challenging is the fact that what's missing is the voice of the people, the voice of the resonance and the voice of the surrounding you know: blocks.
You can't just come up with plans internally, you know in a border room, you know at a conference table in NYCHA and within you, know, HPD in city hall, without incorporating not just the input from the residents, but residents should be an integral part on the decision making and that's what I'll go.
And I'll talk about that the fact that residents should be included at every single aspect from designing you know just the ideas and first should we have a building on this parking.
You know that conversation that decision should be should be from the people, and that has not been the case across the city and just a quick example of that.
You know, by the basketball courts, overlooking the FDR into the in the water and NYCHA, came back and said that we're not going to go with plan C.
New York has the you know, largest content, the you know, largest public housing across the country, and it's like okay.
London has more people that live in public housing and more units, because it's council.
My family lived in what was called the prospect market in the 50s and they had to relocate from their home because they were going to build the NYCHA development, prospect, Plaza and marcus garvey houses and so.
So, when they started to demolish developments across the country, public housing units across the country, prostate Closet, in New, York City, was one of the first, and so a lot of my family members were displaced.
And I think that we need more people to speak up and fight and advocate on behalf of public housing residents.
To say what we're seeing today is just not appropriate and that, if a rad development, if a conversion development is appropriate in far rock away and the residents love it there, it does not mean that that's what we need.
That's having that conversation, because some residents do not want anything to do with NYCHA and some people feel more comfortable with making sure that it continues to be traditional public housing because of the tenant rights that follow that.
You have public housing residents have rights under HUD regulations, and you know, for instance.
You have to negotiate every single new development lease and deal with any conversion, because you're no longer going to be part of HUD public housing authorities is going to be.
There's such a lack of trust in government and in systems and in all administrations on the city, level, federal, level, state level, and until we are able to sit and make sure that the residents are part of the entire process.
The public sector, I'm wondering if the same way that sort of a lot of other sort of major development is going forward.
You know some of your affordable housing developers and community-based organizations all day.
And I really believe that what we're seeing right now in New, York, City, we're developing everywhere.
We should be able to invest those same types of dollars in our public housing units in a way where we can have conversations about converting the units to co-ops the same way.
We had those conversations with the Mitchell llamas, and you know back in the day, and we talked about workforce housing.
We should be having those same conversations with our unions and with state, and you know, local government and being able to apply capital dollars to renovating our units and have an ownership.
Those models, exist, they're still in place, and we are now even having those conversations around third-party transfers and the fight to make sure that these tenants to continue to you know be able to own their units and working with them.
There was no push because you know facing we're talking about public housing and as far as the federal monitor in place and that being a push for like federal, dollars, Federal funds, the agreement itself put New York online.
We will have a big bulk of the public housing funding for capital improvements that we would actually need and could use, and so I'm hopeful in the change in leadership on a federal, level.
You, know reason number 365 of the great things that you know come out of other places in public housing.
You know 250 units on this particular site and it will take five years, and so there are experts that will be assigned to the residents that will help them come up with their own plans as well.
You know, focused conversations and meetings around land use and housing development on the community board level and being able to work with the surrounding public housing developments, because in my district, I have actually have 27.
I have the highest concentration of public housing in north America in my council district and so for me to have a conversation with my community boards.
So it's working with them and making sure that they have the talent and expertise at all meetings to have a real conversation that when we are talking about the state legislation, the state legislators submitting a a bill about the public trust that is reflective of the residents submitting what they think the bills should include and when HPD is having their conversations around infill.
Sorry, I'm just going to say that speaking of you know, resident involvement, can you calling up Mona Lisa.
You know, like I, said we were the sister of wise and part of the developments in the area.
We want to see that to come in action again because when other things were going on back in 1996 around during that time, I did participate in as a community service aide and sat with NYCHA on making decisions on contractors and certain things that would come to the developments and that's not happening anymore.
I think the key part is in all of this is the fact that the days of you know saying, let's force government to do X, Y, z, and the only thing is.
You have to be aggressive and what Jeanette was talking about a little while ago, we were talking about the planning piece of it is now coming to that point of being strategic in organizing and planning what your next steps are going to be and utilizing this opportunity to present the city present HPD with some alternatives, because, again, not all developments.
Everyone is each development, each community, each borough is unique and so being able to articulate what the needs are for that particular community working with the community board working with even the precinct councils working with the resident associations.
Let me just put things in place and being a little more aggressive about it, and so this is that this is that opportunity, and so I think that the city Council members play a role so going back to London, right.
The ones that you know can literally are part of the process of having in their own budget for their district for the public housing in their district.
You know it's on a borough by Borough Basis, Council, District, Council district, so we're a ways away from that, but it goes back to being able to to advocate for your own particular community, based on what those needs are, and so we should not be having a conversation about rad across the table for every single unit right.
They did a survey and 93 of the residents want nothing to do with public housing.
In, my district, where you know, NYCHA, owns private homes and remember the ghost home situation and habitat for humanity stepped in and renovated those and public housing residents, natural residents were able to, you, know, apply and purchase the homes and put in that sweat equity when they were doing the renovations, and so all these things exist, and so we can do that with the single unit.
We visited Cambridge Massachusetts and a different piece of Cambridge was the fact that what we saw with the tri-barrel deals here, where the units were converted to section 8 and the NYCHA workers had to make a decision as to whether they are going to work for the new management company or try to find another job in NYCHA.
They live in public housing, and so some of them have worked for NYCHA for 20 years or 15 years.
That's the reason why we're having these conversations to come up with plans for residents as to what they want to see done and work with allies and advocates to push that agenda and have those conversations I, do.
That's, not part of my world, because in this in this climate right we have a voice, and we have to believe that and own that and make the changes that we, you know, want to see.
And I, think what you said about allies really resonates, because that's what we want to try to do here at the community board is, you know, be those allies and would love to continue that conversation cynthia, okay, just for the two others who had their hands up.
I talk about the entire community right and as an example when we were going through a East, New York, rezoning plan, the mayor in the city of New York were focused exclusively on affordable housing.
You know investing in the infrastructure of transportation and bike lanes and there was an entire public housing development that was in the footprint of this zoning plan that needed boilers.
They needed roof repairs and not one conversation during the rezoning plan spoke to the needs of the NYCHA development, frontino Plaza right, and so it was the it was organizing and working directly with the advocates and like the Cypress development, the Cypress hill.
You know development Corporation, the Ldc's and East New York Development coalitions just working with our advocates and our allies and community Board, five and Community board 16 the housing committees and the land use committees to say we have to force them to include the public housing footprint in this rezoning.
I need to make sure that you're doing your due diligence and making sure that the needs of the community is included in this particular development right and having those conversations with the public housing residents so that they can understand that their developments are part of the fabric of society.
They are part of the community because for so long the public housing residents were not part of the conversation.
They were not part of the Community Board right and so making sure that we are intentional in our conversations about what makes a real, healthy and safe community in this totality is what we need to first start to talk about right and making sure that we are building community and getting the residents to be engaged by just civically engaged coming out to not just the ta meeting.
In order to ensure that we were able to have more affordability in it and then turned around and used the Community board space and time and effort and energy to do outreach to the to the actual NYCHA residents to let them know that this is what's coming down the pipeline, and this is what we need to do.
And, so I think it just kind of starts with that whole civic engagement and outreach piece, because it's such a big deal and once you have people that feel like they are part of the conversation.
I know this is going to be a hard question to answer: Is anybody going to be advocating to them to put more funding in public housing.
I know some people do not want the government to be in NYCHA affairs, but we're at a time where this is a crisis.
Then you know your plan is not even necessary because it can speak directly to the needs of you know a huge piece of the NYCHA housing stock, and so the ones that do want to you know, transfer to section 8 convert to section 8.
There is your office thinking about doing that, here, duplicating that same model, maybe where you would get funding from the city to maybe plan some development in partnership with neister residents, leaders.
Listen, I'm, an older guy, whatever you know what I mean, but I was so humiliated for him, especially as a man of color that all he talks about is putting people out if they do not if they do not meet his requirements, if they do not stand up and fly right by what by what he has to say.
I know for a fact that I have every development, we've all gone through the same thing and that that's why I appreciate Mr Leaker for imparting all this knowledge, because I'm going to be honest, I I've been sitting here.
Like Mona Lisa was saying you know that a lot of people are with the conversion, but I also have a lot of people that are not that do not trust the process.
As far as the Community board right, because madeline, who I know her whole life, she says.
You know it's a great thing to say, but I think that the community can work harder to get the tas in there and have them more involved.
She started having town Hall meetings around the new section, three law that came out that Ben Carson just put in place about a month ago, and in that conversation they're also talking about resident management groups, but I do not know how long they're going to be doing that because they're, you know heading out the door.
