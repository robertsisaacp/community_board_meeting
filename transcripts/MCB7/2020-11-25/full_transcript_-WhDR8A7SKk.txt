My name is Catherine de Lazaro, I'm the co-chair of the health and Human Services Committee, and I'm going to talk about the agenda for tonight and some of the protocols in just a minute, but first I want to hand it over to my my co-chair Sheldon Vine who's, going to speak for a couple minutes. Okay good evening. I wanted to spend just a short a few moments reflecting on the passing of David. Dinkins was very special to me, because I first met him personally in 1980. He swore me in as a member of the elected member of the area policy board and but more important, and there were other interactions, but the strongest one was related to this board. He ran into me at the function and said: I need to speak to you and I went to his office. He was borough president in 1986 and he said tell me about the community board. So I said: I've only been there when things were important to me and I was chair of the school board at the time, and he asked me about certain issues and I explained to him. He said I need you on that board and I said I'm very busy. I'm you know, chair of the school board of other responsibilities. I need you on the board. Please consider it. I went home and I had such respect for the man. I said well, I, don't know how long this is going to be maybe a year, but if he needed me to do it, then maybe I should do it. That was 1986. He kept in touch after that. We had many wonderful encounters, some personal family and political, but he was always the perfect gentleman. He was always kind. He was always warm and someone who will all miss, but personally I'll miss him tremendously. They don't make him like that too often today, especially not in the political realm last thing. I'll just say, is he didn't want to be mayor? It was obvious I. Was he invited me to the NAACP luncheon where he was pushed onto stage and introduced as the next mayor, and it was clear that he was very reluctant to go there? He was very happy being her president of Manhattan, but he took the challenge and did a really good job in the overall and got some very important. Things started like the comstat program and brought people together. He said New York City was a beautiful mosaic and with him as mayor, we could be so I just felt that I wanted to share with that. We couldn't go today without reflecting on him and just let's spend a few moments, just quiet reflection on the wonderful man that he was okay. Excuse me, I'll, do the timing, if you like I, probably figured out how to do it? Okay, timer, okay, yep, terrific! Thank you! Okay! So thank you Shelly. So I'm gonna explain what the agenda is for today. First, we are going to hear from speakers we're going to learn strategies for meeting the needs of those living outside or on the street, so we're really excited to have Lisa Lombardi with us from urban pathways Taylor from the Manhattan outreach consortium and the center for Urban Community Services, Linda, Yance, Rod, Jones and Carrie Goldwyn from Goddard Riverside. After that we're going to discuss the resolution called condemnation of hate crimes and support for education and training. After that, we're going to talk about our upcoming meetings for the next three months, just to get ideas and hear from the committee and then after that, Muhammad Chakanye from CUNY graduate School of Public Health and health policy is going to present on bill number 1326, which was introduced by councilman Mark by Council member Mark, Levine and Mark Levine is going to join us for that. So that will be great I want to go over the protocol for our discussion today. The speakers will- and this is the discussion on strategies for meeting the needs of those living on the street. The purpose of today's meeting is really for our education for us to learn from the speakers. Will each take 5 to 15 minutes to share their work for the purpose of educating us on strategies for meeting the needs of those living on the street? We look forward to learning from all of you and we're really glad that you're here after everyone finishes, we will then take questions in response. First from the health and Human Services committee, calling on each person one at a time and Shelley's going to be chairing this discussion and then board members, and then after that members of the public, I'm gonna post a link for the community to sign up to speak. This is my first time creating this kind of form, so I'm hoping that it works. It should so. This is directly to speaking directly to everyone. Who's joined us tonight. We're really glad you're here we're excited to hear from you. Please focus your questions tonight on the topic of tonight's discussion and in response to what the speakers share. As mentioned, the purpose of tonight's meeting is really to learn. Each person is going to have a minute and a half at which point we'll stop you so that everyone receives the same amount of time, we're a community and to solve problems. We have to talk in ways that are respectful, collegial and professional, and as much as possible in ways that assume goodwill. This means that we focus on addressing issues not making personal attacks bullying in any way or slandering individuals by name it's inappropriate to speak in ways that are derogatory towards groups, including, and especially those experiencing or at risk of homelessness. We respect and encourage diversity of perspective and opinion comments are most effective and easiest to understand when people speak from their own direct experience, rather than claiming to speak for all people in the community. Please use your legal, full name in the chat and sign up sheet. If you notice something in the chat that we miss, please let either me Catherine, Delazaro or Sheldon Fine or Mark Diller. No, if there's something that we should be aware of in the chat, because we don't see everything or even those things, it's necessary for every participant to follow these guidelines. In order to maintain a space that is as inclusive, welcoming and safe as possible for everyone here, no one will be removed from the room or interrupted as they speak unless they're acting in ways that compromise these guidelines of civility. We don't expect that to happen tonight at all and we're glad you're with us, and we want to hear from you so so. Please give me a few minutes to post the link to the sign up sheet in the chat, because it's my first time creating it and I'm going to hand this over to Sheldon fine who's going to chair this portion of the agenda. Okay, thank you. I'd like to suggest that since we'll have all our speakers speak in order and not have questions in between to jot down questions, you may have for a particular speaker or for all of the speakers, and, if you think of in terms of questions, these are the people who are most familiar and spend a good part of their lives in work and dedication to the people who were discussing, and so we can learn from them and that's really the purpose. So questions are in order and sorry we can't break it up, but it'll get too unwieldy, and we may not also we're asking people to give of their time in the evening, and we appreciate their being with us tonight, so we're going to start with Lisa Lombardi who's, a deputy executive director of urban pathways, and if you can begin by telling us what urban pathways are, okay good evening, everybody thank you for having me. So, as you know, urban pathways we've been in existence for several years from the 70s to current and we have a large portfolio of services, and that includes street outreach, drop-in center, safe havens. We do a couple of bids on the street outreach. Also Flatiron bid fashion bid. We do the bus terminal, the Gw Bus terminal. We also do Kennedy and Laguardia Airport. We also do call support of extended care, supportive housing, where we have a mixture of supportive housing properties and also permanent housing, and we also do a congregate care facility and we also do scattered sites. So we have a pretty large portfolio. One of the things I know up that. We've talked about up in the in this community board has been really what we call safe havens and I think the safe havens are the key to as we talk about strategies and really helping with the homeless situation in the communities. Is that we believe safe havens are really a large answer to a lot of our problems. We believe in small, we believe in client care client centered, where most of our workers will have, let's say, a 1 to 12 ratio of clients, so that is where a client will come in off the street, go to a safe haven or a drop-in, and then, from that point on, we will try to get that client ready for permanent housing and permanent housing is the key housing first. We all agree that housing first is what helps all of our clients do better. The issue, I would say the hard part here. I always say: homelessness is very complex. It's not simple! It's understanding its partnership. So all the people here that you invited tonight we all partner together in different ways, all really doing the same thing. We might do it differently, but the goal is to say to help our clients get off the street to help our clients get service, to treat them with respect and dignity, and we strongly believe that that's the key I think some of the heart difficulties is, you know we have a population out there that are mentally ill is very hard to deal with at times and the substance abuse and, if you're, both mentally ill and substance abuse it's even more challenging. You know the old clinician will say you have to get rid of the substance abuse before you could treat the mental illness. Some will say: well, you have to treat the mental illness and you can go back and forth. The reality is you need to get them a house? First, an apartment first, a room first before we could do any of that. So I think that's really key to what we do. Also. I also believe that in working with different clientele in different places, you're trying to be part of a community and being part of the community is that we live in the same neighborhood. You live in and we strongly believe urban pathways that we have to be a good neighbor. So we're not out there saying oh, come and do what you want, even though safe havens give you a lot of flexibility and you're able to come and go, but at the end of the day, most clients respond to good structure, good services, good management, as we also respond to being a good neighbor. As you know, we're in the community at 105th, Street and I. Think we have a small program there and I think we do very well, and people respond and we've had great placements and we've made our as they call our city targets that we have to make every year and we've done more than our share and that's where people start to say: wow I, don't mind coming to 150 they service us, they provide food, they provide shelter and they provide permanency. I. Think the hard part is right now, you're in the middle of a pandemic, where I believe people are struggling, as you all know, we're seeing more and more homeless. But the reality is if we were not able to put clients in places they'd be on the streets, so we're working really hard to put temporary temporary situations to put clients in places, so they can be socially distanced appropriately. That's been a challenge. I also see that if you don't have the turnover, meaning the good turnover of transition into permanent, it takes a little longer for clients to move. So that's been a little process that has slowed down a little bit more recently. I think because there's such a need out there and I think that's something we all have to deal with. We mainly deal with only adults. We don't do families currently, so we deal with mainly the adult population. As you know, families are definitely an issue as well, but they are placed automatically. They go up into the assessment center up a path and most of them will be placed and also be placed in permanent housing. I think these are tough questions. I think the question we always get is: why would someone want to be on the street? Why would someone want to stay on the street and not come inside I? Think the reality is everybody has their own assessment of what they think they need or what they believe they need, and once you leave the street and you go inside, you lose somewhat of your independence and I. Think many of our clients really fear that, for a variety of reasons, some just feel they don't want anyone telling them what to do, or they just feel that you know they are clinically or using substances and once you go inside, there's more rules than they really can manage and there's and then the argument of taking medication not taking medication. So there's a wide range of issues that I think we deal with, but I. What I do believe in and I think we believe in this is building the relationship, the trust with the client and I think eventually, most clients respond. If you provide that good communication giving clients an option, giving clients back some of their own responsibility, their own dignity and what they want- and that's not always easy, but it takes time and once you do that I do believe. Clients respond well, based on just think about doing this. Every single day, you're on the street every day, trying to ask a client to come inside, accept services, anything and you're, doing it every single day, and you see the same person on the same corner and they keep saying no and then one day they say yes and you're sitting there going you're, probably surprised that they said yes and you're. Saying okay, wow I get to place this client and then, when you have that continuum and then they go into their own apartment in independent living. That's probably the greatest joy most of us have is to see that and how that client transformed their personality, saying I've never had an apartment. I've never had a key. I've never been on my own and how? What that does to them, and that's something I think we all agree on. That is the most important thing for us to get to I know we have a tendency to look at all the issues you know we've had homelessness for a long time when I first came to urban pathways, I felt there were things that had really clients were really responding. I think now currently I feel that we're not moving people as fast as I would like, and that's because people are staying where they are and they're not moving to the next level. And how can you move when you live in an economy? That's so challenging I mean an apartment on your own is very difficult to get and afford in New York City, as we all know so, I think those are the things we have to work on: building more subsidies, building more local, low-income housing, which we've done. Everybody has done at the table here, so I think we have to keep building. We have to keep building and let the city help us build and build low income housing throughout the city and every neighborhood and I strongly believe that, because you can't just pick certain neighborhoods and I'm not saying you know, you don't want crime, I know people get frightened, but I strongly believe that we have to work on a plan to help have mixed housing. I think mixed housing can work. We've seen it work in our programs where we have low income and we have homeless, and they would do very well together. So again, I think it is complex, but I do think. There's a lot of potential and I do believe. Most of our clients do respond when you provide good access, good resources, good services, so I hope that helped a little bit. But there's always a lot more and education and I do believe. It's a partnership and being open and listening is really important. We don't have all the answers, but I always I'm always fascinated by people who want to learn and want to listen and want to help, because we do need your help every one of you. Thank you Lisa, and that's exactly why we're here tonight. Next we'll have Lauren Taylor and deputy director of Manhattan outreach. If you could tell us first what your organization does and where you, where your responsibilities lie. Absolutely thank you for having me again, I'm Lauren Taylor I am the deputy director for the Manhattan outreach consortium at the center for Urban community services, also known as Cucs, so the Manhattan outreach consortium we are. The DHS contracted the New York City Department of Homeless services contracted outreach provider for the borough of Manhattan. We work together with our partner agencies, God Riverside who's, also on the call and breaking ground, as well as our own Ccs team, to cover the entire island of Manhattan 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing street outreach services and housing placement services to individuals living on the street. So, like I, said 24 hours a day. Seven days a week, we have teams in the field meeting people where they are meeting people on the street, building a relationship building that trust that Lisa was talking about forming a relationship in which people are maybe willing to give housing. A try so many of our clients, in fact I, would argue. Almost all of our clients have experienced even some trauma over the course of their lives, whether that's just the trauma of homelessness in and of itself or other experiences. They've had along the way that can really impact their ability or their willingness to trust and their willingness to maybe make a change. So what our role is to really try to build that relationship, so we can work together and then work to figure out what it is. That person is open to. You know looking at each individual person for who they are, what their needs are and how we can help connect them to the thing that's going to help make the difference for them. We have teams providing you know that assistance in terms of case management, so helping people work on work towards permanent housing and a little bit more into that in a moment, in addition to working together with our both psychiatric and medical services. So the way that we work across Manhattan is we have the island split up into what we call catchment areas, four different catchment areas and Goddard Riverside he's on the call covers the Upper, West, Side and Upper East sides of Manhattan, as well as a team downtown every below 23rd street. Our Ccs team covers north of 110th street, basically, all the way up through the top of Manhattan, and then our breaking ground team works in that kind of Midtown area 23rd to 59th. So we have teams that are working in each of those areas, working with the individuals in that part of the city towards housing. So what does that mean? We? Our ultimate goal for all of our clients, is permanent housing and we work with clients for as long as it takes to get them connected to housing of their own and for some people. That is a more linear path and some sometimes that is you, know more circuitous path, but we, you know, we stay with people and that's I. Think our really strong component of the foundation of our work is being consistent and showing up. You know for people who maybe had situations where people haven't shown up for them in the past, so we work on housing now in the meantime, while we're working on permanent housing, we work towards. You know, offers that offer people transitional housing options like the safe. Even that Lisa was describing options that are maybe a little smaller or a little different than the city shelters that offer people something a little different. Oftentimes they're like Lisa, saying they're smaller, they have on-site case management services. Sometimes people are sharing a room with fewer people, maybe even have their own room depends on the safe haven, but trying to connect people into that type of housing to work together with the safe haven staff to move that person into permanent housing. We can also work on permanent housing. You know, and from wherever people are willing to accept placement. You know some people want to just focus on permanent, but we are always offering people, even if they say no, even if they say no 50 times, you know we're always offering and always trying to bring people in off the street. We provide case management like I, said in terms of working on the housing process, so we help people complete the documents that they might need to have what's called a housing application. We help people obtain their identification like a birth certificate, a photo, I d, a social security card. We help people with obtaining a source of income, some of our clients are employed and working, and they can use that income. You know towards housing, but we also assist with public. You know helping connect people with public benefits or social security if they're eligible for that. We also work together with our psychiatric and medical services. So we work together with Janey in medical care, which is an affiliate of cucs. So all of our teams have psychiatric providers that work with our teams, helping to both provide support around the housing process, but also to provide you know, assessment and treatment with individuals. If they're open to that, as Lisa said, you know, we operate from harm reduction and housing first perspective, meaning that you know someone, substance, use or mental illness isn't a barrier to housing and we want to bring people in and help them. You know address those issues when they're read you know as they're ready to and provide them the support to address those issues when they're ready to and the other component of our you know, working with Janie is we have a street medicine team made up of a registered nurse and a nurse practitioner and they're able to really connect people with medical care who maybe aren't open to connecting with traditional medical care or medical services in the community. So we, you know we bring the care to them and connect with them in that way, and sometimes that's also, you know a way that we engage people, maybe somebody's willing to talk about a medical concern. First, maybe they're not quite ready to talk about housing, but they are ready to talk about. You know something that's going on for them, and so you know we work together with that kind of triad of services. You know the case: management and social work component, the you know, psychiatric services and also the medical care, and we you know. Of course, we also help connect people who are interested in substance, use, services or treatment. We help connect people with that as well. So once we help people get into you know into the housing process, work through, you know moving into their own housing. We stay connected with people for at least several months after they move into permanent housing, just to ensure that the transition into their new environment is working for them. That they're connected, if you know, they're, moved into permanent supportive housing of some kind if they're connected with their case managers. So it's really about staying with people from that whole trajectory from the street all the way until they're, you know settled into their permanent housing. Our teams have been doing. You know really incredible work during the last several or many years, but especially over these last several months of the pandemic. You know: we've been out there consistently out on the street, engaging people and trying to bring people inside continuing to provide support and services to our clients, helping you know, advise people about ways to stay safe, offering them PPE like masks and hand sanitizer. You know connecting them with those resources as well during this time and I think this has been a tough. You know a tough time for everybody, I think there's. You know, isolation that many people are feeling as a result of this pandemic, and you know our role is: has continued to be to connect with people and try to bring them in into placement. So I think I've covered all my bases in terms of the services of our program, but you know I. We have our my partners at Goddard here as well who work specifically on the Upper West side, and maybe you can share more about that as well and I'd be, of course, I know we're gonna take questions at the end, so, okay, thank you, Lauren. Thank you very much. So Rodney I saw you first. How would you like to begin yeah? Thank you Sheldon. So I'll share the presentation with Kerry Gohan, which is one of my colleagues from Goddard. Okay, just a little bit about Goddard, some of you may or may not know. We we've been on the upper West side for many years. Our history dates back to 1853. We started as a Wilson Industry school really to work and help women's vocational skills and over the years we've evolved and kind of grown and as a settlement we have a vast majority of service serving about 22,000 people across the entire lifespan, and so we have programs for the very young preschool services all the way through to senior services, and so we have 22 locations throughout Manhattan and we're adding one location in Queens, which happens to be a safe haven. And for us we are a settlement, so we tend to think of our work as two levels. Both the service delivery based on responding to needs and communities as well as systems advocacy, because sometimes a program just won't fix. It requires a larger set of advocacy and I think. Thirdly, we count our agency as the living room or community a common ground for people to solve solutions just on the fundamental belief that government alone won't solve those problems, but as a collective community, where there's a neutral place for people to be that people can collectively come together to solve their own problems. And so we take that stance as a community-based organization, and we we've had a long history in this set of work around the fight for fair and affordable housing. Many of you know: Larry Woods who've been with the agency, probably 35 or 40 years, and he and my predecessor Stefan, have been and to Lauren's point. Stefan and Tony Hennigan were here for years and years on the battlefront to preserve Sros and affordable housing, and we have been in that battle. For a long time. We've watched a number of SRO units decline year over year, as well as affordable, housing and I. Think to Lisa's point that just the sheer cost of housing in New York has grown to a level where the average person sometimes just can't, make the rent, and so that we've been. We think that part of our work is not just the delivery of the service, but also the fight for affordable housing more broadly, and so we're still Larry would scream. If he didn't hear me say yes, we still are fighting for Sros and affordable places for people to live as part of this set of work, I think for us in terms of housing specific. We have a continuum that starts with prevention and goes all the way through to permanent housing. So we have a law project that, with a team of lawyers who work to address what we call affirmative cases where there are challenges where landlords are attempting to push out people, particularly with it where there are sros or affordable housing. Sometimes landlords will put the squeeze on tenants with the attempt to push them out, so we have organizers to organize an entire building so that a person is not fighting that battle alone, and then we have a team of lawyers who represent that collective building or the individuals in that building. However, it is that they come together as a group, in addition to the law project, we have a resource center, which is located actually in Harlem, but they do a lot of work with individual families to make sure they're connected to resources. Sometimes we find that families are just on the brink, but with some assistance they can get connected to social security, which is a fight or sometimes to other kinds of public services that allow them to maintain themselves in their housing to keep them from being evicted. And, of course, we do right to counsel cases as well. So for those cases where people are on the verge of eviction, we will represent them as well, and those are a bit different than affirmative cases. We, as Lauren, talked about. We participate in the mock. At one point we were the grant holder and now Ccs is the grant holder, but we've been working collaboratively for well over two decades around this particular set of work and Kerry will talk a bit about outreach and what we're seeing the other set of programming on the continuum is. Actually we operate. We're up we're opening a new, safe haven in Queens, which we support heavily because it is a lower threshold for access and I. Think Lauren and Lisa and Kerry you'll hear repeatedly. It is a fair amount of work to build a relationship to bring someone in, and so when we can lower the threshold or the reasons that person won't come in. It allows us to do our work, more expeditions and safe havens. We believe is a real answer to that, and so we are opening the safe havens now in Queens and then one other on the horizon in another part of Manhattan, which we can't quite disclose. At this point, we have a collection of supportive housing buildings that provide permanent supportive housing for those people who have decided to come in, and I'm pretty proud to say that two of those buildings are on the Upper West side, they're, not obvious to people, because they look much like the luxury buildings that sit side by side with them. But those at least one of those buildings really came to God at Riverside, because the Upper West Side community really advocated to preserve affordable housing in that neighborhood, and so collectively we have on the upper West side, roughly 600 units of affordable housing 200 for seniors, specifically not homeless population, but just affordable housing for seniors. And then we have another 400 for permanent, supportive housing that has all the resources that Lauren talks about psychiatric services, case management services, as well as medical and clinical services that we partnered with Css to provide. And so then we have a team of people who work on advocacy because I think without advocacy we're never going to keep the pressure on to have resources for affordable housing. And so we manage that entire continuum. I'm going to turn it over to Kerry to talk about kind of what we're seeing and what those services look like, really as an add-on to Lauren's earlier comments about the mock, Kerry, hi rod, hi good evening, everyone, it's a pleasure to be here with you all. I first want to thank all the panelists who came before me, which made my job of an explanation a little bit easier and I hope. I'm not too repetitive. Once again, I'm the program director with Uptown Goddard's Homeless outreach team part of the Manhattan outreach consortium. My team covers the Upper West side and the Upper East side of Manhattan, as Lauren had mentioned from 59th street, to 110th street on the Upper West side, which I will stick with for now for the purposes of CB7. So again, just to reiterate a few points that have already been made, which I just think are really important to highlight number one. The absolute foundation for all of our work here is developing and building relationships with folks that are sleeping on the street as many people as Laura, Lisa and Rod have already alluded to there's been trauma over the course of their life lifetime. There's been trust issues, and sometimes it can take anywhere from one engagement with someone to hundreds until they're willing to accept services. Another important point is accepting services might look different from one person to another. Sometimes we meet a person on the street and right away, they're ready to come inside, and we love that. As Lisa said, you know, our goal is permanent housing and there is nothing that is better at the end of the day than when you meet someone on the street and then you follow them all the way to them opening the door to their own apartment. It's the most rewarding thing, and it is, you know everything that drives our work so, along the way you know there might be folks that are ready to try a safe haven ready to try transitional housing, and you know we work as soon as possible to get them inside and often we're able to place them that very day. There are other folks who might choose to stay on the street while we work to secure them permanent housing, while it might not be our ideal plan of how the housing process might work again, as Lauren mentioned, we are meeting folks where they're at and we are offering a whole range of services, everything that Lauren had mentioned from placement to helping them get ideas connecting them with benefits, connecting them with medical or psych treatment, and anything else that might you know, come into play in anyone's given life. If it's something that we don't directly provide, then we're gonna make sure that we link them to resources or agencies that are able to meet those needs. I think you know I just want to take a moment to again focus in on the upper left side. Again, as I mentioned, my team covers Upper, East and Upper West side and I think that, over the last four years that I've been in this role as a program director, one thing that I've noticed that is very unique to a number of the folks that are street homeless on the upper West side is that many of them are so tied to the community. It's a sense of security, it's as it's what they know, it's where they feel comfortable, and there are so many folks more than a handful that are on the street and waiting for a placement, whether it's a safe haven, some other transitional or, ideally, permanent housing. That's located on the Upper West side and we're so grateful to urban pathways and Lisa for opening the safe haven on 105th street. We have a number of clients there and I think that there really is a need for again more safe havens, more transitional housing in the short term. You know to move folks along into permanent housing and increasing folks access to different parts of the city, especially here on the Upper West side. Again, you know, which has already been talked about the length of time that folks, it seems, are staying in safe havens or transitional housing has increased over the years. I think that you know the need for more affordable housing units. More supportive housing throughout the city is dire. Even if we wanted to house every single person on my team on the Upper West side alone, there aren't enough apartments right now to house them all whether they have a housing packet or not, and then you know you compound that with folks throughout Manhattan, with other outreach providers all vying for a very limited number of vacancies and affordable supportive housing. So I think that the real solution here ultimately is more safe, evens, more funding, more affordable housing. Let's see, if there's anything again, I think you know last point that I'll just make since we have touched upon the pandemic and the trying times that we are all no doubt feeling right now. One of the biggest changes I think that I've noticed across the city, not necessarily just the Upper West side, but I think you feel it in the community, especially because it is so residential is with public spaces, shutting down with libraries, closing and other you know. Community resources, where folks, who are street homeless or not or housed, would spend much of their time during the day are no longer available and so I think folks are outside on the street and more present than they themselves might prefer to be I. Don't I think that, as far as you know, we run into a mixed bag of people that are on the street and you know there are definitely a large number of people that are apprehensive to accept congregate, setting placements whether it's a double room, placement or dormitory style setting. But then again you know there are just as many folks that are very eager to come inside off. The street. I think that the greatest challenge that I see for folks on the upper West side is really feeling very tied to the Upper West side and really holding out for a placement to become available. That's within the vicinity I think that there's a lot of folks that over time, it could be months. It could be years eventually might come around and try something that's outside of the area that they prefer, but the process would be a lot quicker if there were more opportunities and more offers to suggest and present. And lastly, you know last point, and then we can turn it over to the next part of the segment or panelist again. I just want to highlight the housing first promise that Lisa had talked about in the beginning. Where substance use mental illness are not barriers for folks being quote: unquote: housing ready to come inside off the street and again where you know, without having stable housing or being able to set an alarm or put your stuff down or know where your next meal is coming from. It's really hard to expect anyone. You know to follow up on appointments or you know, stick with a medication regimen or really worry about anything more than just surviving from minute to minute. So again, our teams are out there 24 7. We work with every single person that is on the street in the catchment area. Many folks are accepting of services, others aren't but again, as Lauren said, we don't get discouraged and we don't get turned away. If we hear no, we will keep asking until we finally get that yes, okay, thank you. Carrie we're going to have questions from our committee members and other board members and then from the public. I just have a couple quick ones. One deals with the numbers in the community. How have they moved and I think increased, but to what extent in the past several months so I think I can start there, I think and Laura. You can correct me from wrong I. Think overall, at the last hope count. The number was still about thirty, two hundred somewhat thirty, two thirty three hundred across city, wide I, think that number I think the number compared to last year. Might there was a slight difference, but not a huge difference. I think Lauren would agree that what we're seeing is that a lot of the people who were invisible are now visible because there's a push they close the train at one o'clock in the morning, so those people who would normally ride the train all night and sleep they're now above the surface if they hung out in the library all day long they're now invisible site if they hung out in any other of the semi-private places. Now those people are public, so I think in general that it is not that the city-wide at least from the way the city council, numbers I, hope count. It's not that the number of people who are homeless is so much more significant. It's the visib that they are now visible to the general public, yeah I. Think part of that is because this is Lisa is that you know many things are closed. You know things have been locked down, so there's no, where I work in the Midtown area a lot. There's no tourism. There everything's shut down so you're, seeing much more homeless on the street because that's the group they have nowhere to go they're trying to get housed. Some don't want to get housed. I think you are going to see a slight increase, I'm sure with the economy, but then you're going to see possibly a different homeless people been working, lose their jobs, so I think we have to really start looking at that and see the difference and if there's a trend where it's low income, middle income, losing jobs, losing apartments losing homes, so I think you might start seeing that a little bit too. The other question is in terms of the safe haven about how many, in a given year or period of time, our people moved how many people in a year moved into permanent housing what percentage? Well, we have three safe havens currently and we are at least we at least I'm just percentage-wise I. Don't know that right now, but I can tell you the building. The amount of clients are probably let's say: if I have 33 clients at least 28 are moved within the year to permanent housing. If I have 55 clients, at least 25 are moved at least once a year into permanent housing and I have another program that has 36 and that's one of the highest and they move at least almost 95 of that number, so I mean what we talked about a little bit tonight. Was it's slowing down a little bit because it people not moving out and not moving on to the next level, building more affordable housing is key. I think the other thing I think one of the questions is: how long are you in a safe haven for I? Think six to eight months, I think now it's about six to a year. Sometimes it just takes longer depending on what subsidies are available depending on client participation and how ready they are meaning they have to get certain things in order to move and availability is key. If you have someone ready and you have no avail, so we have some clients waiting, two and three months to move into a room or an apartment, but we have to wait for that. One person to move out or for that apartment to be ready. So it's a constant moving, but they do move and we do have a good percentage. I can only speak for urban pathways. I know the rest. Do the same. We do pretty much. Okay, Catherine you have. Any questions is Katherine in there. Yeah thanks. It just took me a second to turn off so I have a I have like a few questions for this for the presenters. The first is: what's a comment: what are some common misunderstandings that people have about street homelessness or the experiences of people who are living on the street or outside? And what would you say to kind of correct those misunderstandings? My second question is: what can ordinary people do or people that have secure housing like? What can we do to help or to be helpful to our neighbors or to your? And what can the community board do to be helpful and then my last question is those are pretty impressive success rates for the safe haven? So what do you attribute to this success of those programs, shelters, fabulous staff, I think to do this work. You have to really be dedicated, I. Think we, as we all, have experienced the pleasure you get of seeing someone do well, I. Think the first question is fear people feel fearful and that's with anything that you're not you know accustomed to. We deal with it every single day. So when you're in a neighborhood- and you see someone acting different you're, not sure what to do you're, not sure what to say so, you kind of get nervous and you're fearful because of the unknown I. Think the education and really meeting some homeless clients and getting such a different perspective of them will help tremendously I invite people to come to any of our programs and see what we do and you will get a very different perception of our homeless population. People think they're not willing to do certain things: they're not willing to work. They're, not willing, I mean go on and on but I. Don't believe that I believe that when you talk to people and when you have a compassion and a concern and a real genuine listening people respond well to that and help I mean helping the community board. I think would ever help us get buildings. Get programs I think they do help as long as we're good neighbors. As long as we're good partners, no one wants to be unsuccessful. I, don't know how many people know that 105th street there's a safe haven on a beautiful block that I can't afford to live on, so I mean it's incredible: they get meals, they get services and they get to go to permanent housing. They get employment services, they get all kinds of services which sometimes the community doesn't see. They see with the one negative that might happen the one issue that might happen or the two issues that might happen. We don't encourage violence, we don't encourage drugs, we don't encourage any of that. We try to help and we don't we're not punitive. If they do those things it happens. Addiction is a major issue, not just with homeless people. Mental health is a major issue, not just with homeless people. You know, so those are the things that we could use, help with an understanding come see. Our programs come talk to some of our clients and get their perspective and how they feel they're treated when they haven't done anything some of them. I'm not sure the third question did I miss the third one, I think about everything. I think was like looking I, think you got everything good I just want to I just want to let everyone know and I meant to race. I meant to mention this and I forgot that the district office, thanks for the hard work of the district office and of our board Chair Mark Diller. The final draft of the district needs statement is now posted online. There is a very there is a long and detailed section on homelessness and housing needs, and that has a lot of information. So some I saw someone asked in the chat what the numbers are in terms of people who are living on the street, and the speakers can correct me if I'm wrong, but the numbers that I remember and that I believe are cited in the district needs statement. Are that there's a there's an estimated 80 on the Upper, West side and I? Think it's close to 4,000 city-wide if that's correct and the numbers have gone up, especially in Manhattan I, think by 55 in the last year. So, but there is a lot of information in the district needs. Statement. May I interrupt for just a quick second, because I'm trying to keep track of the chat as well as Q&A and so forth, and I remind the chairs that the Q&A may have some questions that you'll want to at least see and make sure get covered, but I'm starting to see aggressive language in the chat. Again, I'm not going to call out names at this moment, but we're having such a positive and productive conversation, and most of the chat has been in that spirit and I. Thank everyone for that. The chat is there and I don't want to shut the chat down, but I'm troubled. There are folks that are saying things that are aggressive about each other and and I'm seeing it again, and you know the admonition to be kind at the end of the statement that says that you're being cruel is not the Spirit that Catherine laid out for us at the top of this meeting. Please don't provoke us and please don't provoke each other. We want to have a positive and constructive conversation and I don't want to take any further steps, but please don't push me that way. This is not an appropriate way to be talking to each other in community and I will just leave it at that for now, but we're watching I can't see everything that goes by I'm troubled by what I'm seeing a little bit and I and like I said: I won't mention names right now and I'll shut up, but please follow the rules that Catherine very carefully and very considerately laid out for us at the top of this meeting. Thank you. Forgive me for interrupting. Okay, Committee members, Robert hi, just wanted to ask I, have a question, but I also wanted to comment that having done so much of this community based rehabilitation, work in the past I think it's a genuine testimony to the quality of the legislative community rehabilitation model that goes back to the 80s and the 70s, and that was certainly functional when I was in the late 80s and 90s and 2000, including the small units, the 20 unit, three supportive housing unit and so on, and the expansion of services and the calls that would come in from Omh. In those days we with Omh and Omh will tell you Lisa. They will tell you open up 20 new beds, please and we want 20 new beds in the Bronx. We want 20 new beds in this location and that location. Now what I have not heard in the several years that health and human services have been addressing this issue as to the levels of service in those days we call it levels of service, you have intensive, then you have supportive. Then you have an advanced supportive. Then you have support head and that's my point. We I used to manage the support, Ted housing level, every person and, of course everyone had a you know axis one and so on, and there was a separation between axis two, which is substance, abuse and people with non access tools was that when you graduated from supportive housing, there was another level which is being called permanent housing now, but we call it support Ted Living and that's what I manage. So we had arrangements with all of the landlords bo. Why? For individual apartments to be leased to the agency, and then we would write a sub lease for that client that was ready for independent living, which was a completely different definition from supportive. Because, though you needed services and you would get services as you need them, when I was talking about people who were cpas and linguists and physicists and a lot of people who are high-functioning individuals, but that they had this condition that had to be attended to and that so I don't hear support Ted living there. I don't hear the word at all anymore and I hear certainly permanent housing, but always permanent housing. Is it the same thing, because what I'm seeing is a shift to a community-based organization, whether it's urban pathways or which fish that is constructing their own housing at different levels, where we would have in those days contracted with the landlord, the major landlords that have lots of units and we would contract. So what what's? The shift am I Robert? That's the what you're doing right now! That's our for us! That's our scattered site portfolio! So we're the lease holders and we do a sublease with the you know with the client. So we have 200. We have about seven programs, different funders and we service almost 285 clients in the community of Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, mainly Queens, so that is supportive housing that we hold the lease and we work with the client. A lot of these programs are supportive, but they can be where they call extended care where they stay longer and that's fine as long as they follow. You know you want them, eventually get their own place, but what I said earlier? What's the holdup is that many of our clients can not afford their own place without a subsidy. Many of you know section 8 used to be a big item, that's less than one less and less yeah, that's less and less for people right now, it's very hard to get to section eight, it's long lists and it I don't get it I. Think it's one of the better programs we've ever had when I worked back in the 90s late 80s many people I worked in West Chester I worked in the city. Many people got their section eight. Now it's very hard to get not as easy, so that was the perfect I felt best subsidy that most clients could get right. All right. Thank you match any questions. Yes, now before Covid-19, a lot of religious institutions in the neighborhood had shelters at night places for people to sleep over or even just places to eat without I think most of them are closed. Now, how is some of the street helplessness increased because of it and how can it be dealt with and do you think any of the institutions will be coming back into these programs? That's what we call the faith-based program we used to drop, we used at the drop-in center. They were amazing. They are amazing. We've had to you know close that, but, as many of you might know or not, we were able to move our drop-in clients over to what we call the Aladdin Longacre Hotel and we have about 60 clients over there that we service and we have staff. So that's been helpful. You're right, I think it's really challenging because the faith beds, we would have them, go there at night and come back in the morning, so that's been challenging, but we have found other alternatives that has helped I'm not sure about the other. I know in the Aladdin we have also cucs is also there with urban pathways servicing over I. Guess: 100 people total it's really working quite well. Yeah, considering yeah I. Think that's a good point. They said about the some of the stabilization bed options that have come online new. You know housing options for people during this time that you know people have really been open to accepting and been able to move. You know people in off the street during this time into those some of those new options as well, but Maj I think you bring up a good point and it kind of relates to that concern. We brought up in terms of just services not being available to people in the same way right now and whether that is services specific specifically for people experiencing homelessness or, for you know the just everybody in the community that that's really impacted. You know where people are able to spend time how people are able to get connected to to other services. So it's something that you know we've been very mindful of and helping to try to connect people with other options or some of the other services, especially around you know, like food distribution and things to make sure that you know people still have access to those resources, but then also simultaneously still trying to continue to motivate people to come inside and maybe get access to some of those services that you know might not be available in the same way that they were before and I'm hopeful that things come back. You know so some of those services come back in the same way. You know in the future, but I think it's just it's a matter of you know we're just not sure what things are going to look like just yet in terms of Covid-19 and the pandemic, and all of that Rosa do you have a question now: Courtney? Okay, any of the other board members who have questions we'll entertain them now. I just raised raise a hand: okay, Doug, it's more of just a statement. I just want to just say how incredibly grateful I am for all the panelists being here today and kudos to the co-chairs of this committee for putting together such a fine program. I am deeply touched and I'm so grateful because I think there's so much misunderstanding in this neighborhood understanding the difference between street homeless and in the hotels and everything else. So thank you so much for clarifying and explaining the comprehensive processes that you go through. This is near and dear to my heart, because my ex-girlfriend was the assistant program director to project reach out with Goddard, so I used to come home to me every night we would discuss the successes and the trials and the tribulations and the just the great joy of finally hearing that this person accepted help and has now permanent housing and it we cried about it. We laughed about it, so I'm just so grateful that you're sharing this with the community, because I think the more we understand about it, the less fearful we are and we can solve problems together. So just I'm so grateful. This is a wonderful program tonight. Thank you thanks. Okay, sorry I want to follow up yes and echo. Doug's sentiments there, but also I have a a practical question. I deal with some street homeless people on it like a daily basis and have a relationship, and the couple are members of my church and at least one is applied for help through Goddard and it's been a long time and I haven't you know, I, don't know where the problem is or whether you know I just would love to know who to follow up with from from your shop how to make something happen, so that would be Kerry on our side. The other way we're connected is with the 311, so we operate the dispatch for the mock, so there's really two ways: one is three or one, and the other is Carrie is a point person for our teams. Okay, so, but if this is a pending application for assistance, that would be carry to follow up with something that's in the pipeline already. You can definitely reach out to me. Yes, okay and I. Think that brings up to the you know the just some of the processes that can take time and kind of what happens. You know we work with everybody with each individual with what their needs are, and sometimes that's varied, sometimes there's more difficulty obtaining something for somebody, maybe, for example, they're having a really hard time getting their birth certificate from for whatever reason, so we're working on those challenges or you know we're they've. You know we have all the pieces of the puzzle together, but we are, you know, there's not a permanent housing opportunity for them, yet so we're just kind of working to help support them. While we motivate through that process, so it could be kind of any number of reasons whether those things might come up or might you know, take some time for somebody to move into permanent housing, but the team, you know, stays connected and stays involved and continues to support them, regardless of how long that takes and some of it some of its confidentiality, so be aware of that there is some level of that, and also I always tell the clients that we work. We have to work together, so you know my line is if I'm working harder than you, then something's not right. We have to work together because many clients are not ready and when they're not ready, you have to be paid. We're I'm ready all the time, but they're not so I have to be more patient because I know what I want for them. That makes it better, but they're not ready. So you have to be patient and sometimes they might see it differently or feel that they're not getting help or feel that something's not happening, but then you find out, as Lauren said. Sometimes there are certain things that take time whether they have to get a birth certificate entitlements, just things that we have to do with regard to the system for them to move forward. You know I d is very hard to get. Sometimes it takes time depending on who we're dealing with all right. Any other board members I just like to mention along those lines that I worked with someone for four years and right away. He could have had an opportunity for housing and he went and then he turned it down and he's back on the street and it went on and every once in a while he'd be ready and then he felt he wasn't ready and then suddenly one day he said, I'm ready, and fortunately it happened not too much later and he you know, lived half somewhat happily ever after, but you don't know why people have reluctance to get help. That seems basic and obvious, but each person is different. So true, so Shelly I think I see. Melissa Rosenberg has her hand up, I'm not sure. If they see that and then we have I think four people from the community that have filled out Catherine's sign up sheet exactly what I'd actually recommend is that we hear from Melissa, and then we hear from those who have signed up on the sign up sheet about this topic. There's four people as Mark mentioned, and then we can address the questions and as many of the questions as we can in the Q&A. But we do have a very full agenda. So I want to be mindful of the fact that it is 8:15, so we are going to keep the public comments at a minute and a half, and then there's someone who's signed up to talk about something: that's not on the agenda, which is smoking, that's Jenna and so I want to get to that person before we move both after everybody talk after everybody has a chance to make comments about homelessness. So Jenna will get to you kind of at the end of that discussion before we move on to other things, so so I think Melissa's next, listen sure I'll try to keep this quick, I'm just kind of curious from I'm not sure who's. The best person answer this maybe rod, but about how kind of law enforcement interacts with street homelessness and I feel like there's a lot of asking from the public about like. Can we get the police more involved, but I'm just curious of in your view when the police are involved, like what's the immediate impact on people who are street homeless, and is it helpful and yeah whether people are arrested or not like? What's the kind of immediate term outcome, yeah, I, think Carrie or at least yeah I think it goes back to partnership and the police are very helpful and sometimes it's difficult, because you're trying not to criminalize homelessness, I, think where it's helpful is when you have a team that goes around and really genuinely interested in helping someone. However, if there's a crime, then that's what they're there for they are supposed to. You know help and deal with if there is a crime or any kind of violence or anything like that, but what we try to do many times where what we call is Ems for Edp, emotionally disturbed person to help the person I. Think the one problem right now for many of us is I. Think for many neighborhoods is the whole drug situation on the street. I think it's very hard and very challenging whether it be selling using I wish I had an answer. I wish I was able to take many of them and bring them to program and have them accept program, but it's not mandatory. So it's that is to me more challenging than mental health on many levels for different reasons, not that we can't do it, but we try, but many people start leave come go back and forth because that's the same thing where, until I'm ready to deal with my addiction, I'm going to kind of float and then one day they might be ready to deal with their addiction. But what you have to go through is hard I, think the police we work very well with them at the bus terminals, they're very helpful, but there's like a lot of folks who are good at what they do, and sometimes they get frustrated too. So I think we just have to help each other manage what we see and try to assist and best help the client to the best of our ability. Let me share my experience in answer to Melissa's question with the 20th precinct mark. You remember when I made the midnight round with them for the encampments and there's a team, it's the exact, it's the outreach team and they work in collaboration with Garden Riverside. There was another provider group from the hospital and a representative, and then of course, there were the officers attached to that precinct and much to my surprise. After doing that, work for so long, not the street work where I had a completely different picture. What I found that I told them to the you know, I told the lieutenant the commanding officer at the time. I said this was not the word. The wrong the police was outreach was the wrong term, because these were some of the most sensitive case managers that I've encountered. In all of my experience. Okay and one of the officers- and I'm sorry I forget her name attached to the 2-0. She had an Ms, she had an Msw. She was a cop and she put it to work with these encampments there at in front of Sapporo in front of 72nd, Street and 86th street and the whole thing and knew every single person. That was a quote-unquote character that was known in the area. The guy that's on the island in on 86th street, spends the night there and talks to everybody that thing knew them all. There was no aggression, no tone of arrest and in there were a couple of people who substance abusing grass and that thing nothing heavy and there was it was all about service. What do you need at this interval? How can I help you? I've been trying to get you into a place for six months and you've been refusing, and this is our one of our sub-themes, including a very well-known couples, sisters twins- and this raises the point that was raised earlier- of the attachment to the community where God had Riverside, they had her case, they had their cases and one had a missing document, but the other one wouldn't move without her. These are identical twins and so Goddard was working. That case and Shelley was my consultant on that and I called Shelly I said Shelly what they wanted to be in one of Shelley's residences, the one on 86th street I forget the name Shelley you put her. They wanted to be in Euclid Hall and said they were offered this and that and the other opportunity that might come up a little quicker and said. No, we want to be in Euclid Hall, you see and so that I think that the agencies, in spite of the bureaucratic glitches. So when you talk about God at Riverside, it's a bam off. It's a big agency, a lot of clients, a lot of need in the whole thing it doesn't always move as quickly and as smoothly as one would like. Now. The question is in case management. One of the issues is persistence and I. Think Lisa mentioned it's a persistence. You have to be on the case like all the time, and if you have a caseload, that's excessive. Everybody has a caseload, that's excessive, yet you have to be on it. But the point is that the police, the car, the partnership Melissa with the police, in my experience, was a quite a surprise and I fell in love with the 2-0, because the I think the police aren't supposed to be doing that kind of work anymore. But that's exactly an issue is that what is that part of the services that we're going to cut from the police work and that's another topic? But that is definitely an issue. The homeless unit has been cut. I don't want to interrupt you, Shelly I, wanna I have the list in front of me of the community members that signed up to speak and I'm really looking forward. We're really looking forward to hearing from all of you, so I'm just gonna go in order and then mark. Is it helpful to you if I, just if I call there, if I name them and then you promote them, is that the best way to do it so I I took in order Mr, Crowley and Ms Elnetta, so they're already ready to speak, and then, if you give me a heads up, I'll promote the next person and then we'll retire. The people who have already spoken is that okay, that's great perfect. Thank you, so Owen Crowley hey well! Thank you. Give me a 30 second warning, but I. Just first of all, I want to commend the speakers for their dedication to the you might say, the self-determination of the clients that they serve the respect that I'm hearing in terms of the wholeness that they're serving and trying to help- and you know that's something that I think really needs to be looked at by you know the community that I'm a member of in terms of you know as you talk about safety, and we talk about good neighbor policy. I think we all have to be safe and we all have to be good neighbors, not just you know, and safety from people is not really a kind of a safety. So that's really just a comment and I want to support. You know talk about my support for this work and support for this safe haven program. I do have one question and it's probably a question from lack of depth in this topic, but as we talk to people, we try to gain their trust and by the way the trust is not only by the person talking to the person but what they see around them. So when they see people's lives being disrupted and people having lawsuits to get you to, you know, expel them from the neighborhood. I'm sure that affects the trust of people that are in the streets and thinking well do I really want to get into that whole asthma. So I think it's incumbent upon all of us to build that trust, not just the people that are interacting directly but anyway, going back to as we succeed in getting people off the streets and into supportive housing. I'm curious where the handoff is or what the long-term plan is in terms of months and years, and keeping people and supporting people through working out their issues and dealing with their trauma and all the stresses that society brings to you longer term keeping people in housing and part of society. That was almost exactly a minute and a half so mad you're keeping time I am. Can you give people 30? Second heads up 30. Second heads up I will okay! Thank you, Owen I. Think your question is great and I do think that a lot of the work begins when someone has more permanency in their life of having a an apartment and some stabilization for themselves and I. Think they're ready to do and I see people the clients evolve, who are on the street, who had medical issues who had a lot of issues and then they move into a more permanent place, and you see that start to they work on their issues and are more in touch and relaxed and resting, and you know sleeping in a bed every night. So our recidivism of that we have not seen many turn back into homelessness or into other programs. So I think the work begins where they're more open to mental health services or substance abuse services and have more stability in their life. Plus. We provide that as well in our I programs going to jump in just to say to you know. My program hasn't been had outraged consortium, but I work for Ccs, and you know we also operate supportive housing across the city, both single adults from homeless adults, families and a variety of you know different types of housing. You know, I think that part of the outreach worker and safe Haven's role, while the person is in that environment, is kind of learning more about them. Learning what their needs are. Learning what it's going to take, what kind of supports they're going to need to be successful in permanent housing and helping set them up for that in advance as much as possible and connecting them to a service? You know a type of housing that would really you know, set them up for success right, there's some kind, there's some supportive housing where it's more of the scatter site model that was referenced earlier. People are, in you know, kind of independent apartments and get services that maybe come to visit them versus other settings where their services on site in the building. You know just on a different floor where people can you know, get medical care, get psychiatric care get case management. So you know we're constantly. You know, assessing and trying to understand what those services are that they might need and also the reason why you know the outreach team stay involved for at least several months, if not longer, once somebody has moved into housing to really make sure that transition goes as smoothly as possible and that they're connected once they're in that new environment to people who can help provide them that ongoing support as they you know, move you know as they stay in their permanent housing and maintain their housing. Okay, our next speaker, that's Miss, De Almeida who's. Next mark you can promote Corinne, Lowe and Erica Gerson, very good. Thank you. Okay, you saw me yeah. Thank you. So much I spoke during the full board meeting. Thank you for the opportunity again. I would like to let you know that fighting homelessness is not only taking people out of the streets into housing. I would like to ask all of you to try to keep us in our apartments. For the past eight weeks, I've been calling the police every day because of drug use in the days hotel. On the 12th floor, where I live, there has been all sorts of drugs. I've been calling, the police doesn't do much, they don't either smell or they smell they're, not sure. If it's drugs, the landlord, doesn't smell. Anything security refuses to come up. I've been fighting this for eight weeks. It's the same owner as the Lucerne by the way, so I do not believe that the drugs is only on the 12th floor of the days. Hotel, I, don't know what else to do. I, don't know what other policemen that's one minute warning. Okay, I've been to the hospital because of this drug fumes. I put please keep us on your own, our homes, the landlords retaliate. Every time we try to assert our right to stay. I live here for 25 years. I pay, my rent, I work, I pay my taxes I. This is I, also attached to the Upper West Side and Mr Jones. You don't have to reach me 200 times. If you want to help me, you can call me once and I'll call you back. Thank you. What hotel was that Mr Jones your this building is an SRO building. There's 300 illegal hotel units in this building. What is the address? 215 West, 94th street? The city has deemed that is illegal hotel. There's 300 units there has been people have been kicked out. You have helped me in the past. I'm the deal made up for Beverly hotels against Donata, I'm the case law. Nobody will ever rent an apartment for me because I'm blacklisted so Mr Jones. You can call me once and I accept your help. That's the day's in hotel. Yes, it is thank you for you emailed me earlier today after you spoke a month or so ago and I. Thank you for that, and you and I will be in touch as well and I thank God at Riverside if they can be of helpful help as well. I can't fight this anymore. Thank you, we'll see what we can do for you every time we talk about connecting YouTube to people who can help. Thank you very much for joining us. So back to the chairs. Okay, our next speaker, I, think that was Ms Lowe, followed by Ms Gerson. Is that correct, hi there well I just wanted to say a big thank you to the panelists I thought that the discussion was really helpful and interesting and I. Don't even think I need a minute and a half I just wanted to say that you know the discussion about providing services to individuals who are unsheltered really highlights the importance of something that I know was highlighted by this committee of you know: safe haven beds, I think there was a study done that you know unsheltered individuals who are offered a spot in a traditional shelter. Only nine percent of them actually remain in that shelter, whereas unsheltered individuals who were offered a spot in a stabilization bed in a hotel where they were able to have a door that closes and privacy to themselves. 75 of them actually remained in that situation, and so you know when we're trying to make the offer of giving people help it's so important that we actually have the right type of help to give and I've heard Larry Woods say many times that you know if every unsheltered person accepted the offer from our outreach units right now, we don't have the bets to put them in and so I think really investing in one minute. Sorry, that's one minute so yeah and so I think really investing in you know, beds and beds in the right type of setting where people actually have privacy and have safety is so important because I've heard so many times that a congregate, shelter setting often makes people feel less safe than they actually felt. You know actually being unsheltered and on the street, and so you know I think that's so important that we actually invest in that shelter capacity and the right kind of shelter capacity where we have to interact with Gerson yep. Thank you so much. Thank you hi good evening. So I have several questions. Thank you. For the time one big one is, can you help explain to me? I'm not sure which of you is the right person, but how do safe haven clients get prioritized for permanent housing relative to other single individuals who go into regular shelters because it's exciting to hear how quickly they can move through the system. But my understanding is that other people languish in the regular shelters and related to that. My understanding is: we have a multi-billion dollar budget that DHS is spending, and yet many people certainly perceive that the congregate shelters are not safe, I, don't know if that's a perception that needs to be changed or if the Congress shelters are in fact unsafe, which is more of what I've heard. So how do we solve that problem as opposed to just building a shelter? That's that is okay. We have tremendous numbers of shelters that seem to not be okay, that aren't, as far as I can understand, moving people to shelter and related to that. I'm always interested in incentives, but also unintended consequences, and so I think. One of the concerns that people in this neighborhood have is what would be the unintended consequences of being a community where being a street homeless person can get you access to a safe haven, which sounds like a wonderful opportunity if we're putting in now another 50 or 60, which was the request that would move us to I think like 80 or 90 beds on the Upper West side, if that's more than the number of street homeless, we have now. So if you cycle them through in about a year and a half now you're going to be needing to fill those beds with people who make their way to the Upper West side to get a spot there, which would seem to be the smarter solution than going to languish in the regular shelter system, which is both unsafe and takes longer to get through. So that's kind of the gist of it. If people can start talking, I, don't think that one I have to be honest, I, don't think I think it's a mantra that people say, shelters, aren't safe, I, think the issue there shelters are larger. So it is a little difficult to manage. Sometimes people in and out I think it has to do with management. I do think. I ran a shelter. I've ran several I, never had issues. I read an assessment center. We did a lot of good work, but getting back to safe havens. I think so. Do you think that's a perception that we just have to I think it is I. Think it's like anything else, I think what happens? Is you hear one negative thing and it just mushrooms and we start to believe it. I'm not saying there there's no issues, I'm not saying that, but there's crime everywhere: it's not just homeless. People create committing crime, I get it, but getting back to safe havens. I really believe that the safe haven is smaller. So it helps us focus more and they're the one of the most vulnerable clients because they are coming off the street automatically constantly so I think you have a better understanding and a better focus on 30 or 40 clients versus 200 a day. I mean I, just think in relative terms. If I have 50 clients, I know every client I know their name. I know how they're doing blah if I have 200 or 300 it's a little harder to manage every single day, all the clients, that's just life. In whether you study in a large group of classroom in a college 100 versus 30, you talk about children, they tend to do better in smaller classrooms. More attention or focus so I mean there's all kinds of situations. I do believe that more safe havens are really the answer in many ways. I wish we it takes time to get them. It's you have to go through the community. You have to go through the city, there's a lot of things, renovation building whatever. So it does take time we're in the process of trying to open up another one, and so we just keep trying to help our clients and focus on moving our clients, and we do have a good success rate. I do believe right now, where the concern is, when you see a large group of people in one building, it does get harder to deal with at one time in a community and I'm not saying they're all bad but they're more challenging. Okay, thank you. Can someone address the piece about whether there's a different track that they get fast-tracked into housing if they go to safe havens versus the regular shelter system? I, don't think that's necessarily true, but I don't have a fact to that I! It's something we could look into yeah, there's different I agree with Lisa I, don't necessarily have anything to, but there's any prioritization or fast track. Sometimes there's different eligibility. There's different. You know types of housing available and what people different people are eligible for. That might you know impact that as well, but I think that you know I think to speak. To the other points too. You know that there are many people who are accepting shelter rate and are utilizing the traditional shelter system and are moving into housing from you know that system and I think the safe haven model and how the outreach teams utilize it is it's trying to have an option for people for whom that system, maybe wasn't working or isn't something that they're comfortable with whether that's you know, based on their own experiences, experiences that didn't have to do with the shelter system, but now maybe our kind of the that setting maybe brings up some concerns for them. So we're trying to you know find that other option and so having that safe haven option having something that's a little lower threshold, a little more flexible with people that we can offer. Sometimes that thing that makes you know have gives people the option that works for them and the third part of the question is about I have to stop because we have. We have another person. My third part wasn't answered and there was long comments by people on your panel who are members of the books, we're talking about we're going to be we're going to finish up we're going to explain why we need 90. If there's only 80 people, so we're going to be going. Excuse me we're going to proceed. We hope you've gotten some of your questions answered, but we can't go on all night, so we're going to proceed to our next stage. I just want to thank on behalf of everybody. We are wonderful guest presenters tonight to share their expertise and give generously of their time. They include Lisa, Lombardi, Laura, Lauren, Taylor, Roderick, Jones and Carrie Goldwyn and you've enlightened us. You've helped since it's sensitized us to a certain degree and helped us understand the situation and the people who we consider street home was much better and we look forward to working together with you and support. You know the community board supporting the work you do in any way we can moving forward, but I think you deserve a show of appreciation. Thank you. We also have. We have two other comments from community, but more board members. Our community members of the public I want to make sure that we hear from everyone so mark if you can promote Amanda and then Jenna, Amanda, Fiock and then Jenna Witton and my apologies by mispronouncing names, very good Jenna is already promoted. I will look for Amanda right now. Here we go and we'll take Amanda as the last comment on on this topic and then we'll go to Jenna and I want to thank Jenna for patiently waiting. Thank you they're, both there. Okay. So let me hear from Amanda Right thanks so much for giving me a moment here. I just you know, I appreciated your comments in the beginning mark about or who I don't remember who was reading the rules of today. I am seeing a lot of comments about addiction and mental illness and whether people should get housing when they're still struggling with addiction or mental illness, and they need to get sober and there needs to be stipulations. I just want to say, as somebody who is in recovery from addiction that if I did not have access to housing and certain basic needs, I do not know how I would have gotten sober. Also, we have to remember that relapse is often part of the recovery process and with each relapse. Hopefully we are getting one step closer to recovery, because we were learning from relapse. We can not criminalize mental illness, we can not criminalize addiction and we can't punish people for relapsing in an illness that is, by definition, a relapsing illness. This is part of the process, so we have to get these people into safe housing situations, build rapport, build trust and, as they say, in the rooms of alcoholics anonymous. Sometimes you need to love the addict and the alcoholic until they learn to love themselves, and that is part of the process. I want you to come work for me, so I want to just give. Thank you. So much did I interrupt you. Are you finished Amanda all done. Thank you. Okay, so I just want to give a summary of what's to come, because we still have a couple items left on our agenda: we're going to hear from Jenna and again I. Thank you Jennifer for waiting and then we're going to I'm going to present the resolution on hate crimes and responses to that. And then we have a presentation on a bill and and Mark Levine is going to join us for that. So we still have those two items left and now we'll hear from Jenna. Thank you very much. I just wanted to comment on more of a health issue but and I don't really know the solution, but I did want to bring it up to all of you and see if we could develop a solution together. We are in the middle of a global pandemic and people are smoking on the street every day and they don't wear masks. Obviously, when they're smoking and you walk down every block and you find a new person, smoking I find myself maneuvering around the blocks with my stroller and it is the most frustrating thing and I feel like as a community. We need to do something better to figure out how to avoid the smoking during a pandemic. When someone is smoking, they're not wearing their mask, the smoke travels further, so their droplets are traveling further and it's dangerous and we need to find a solution together that works for the community. I understand people need to smoke, but there also needs to be safety for the community. I just would say the parks Department. The Parks Committee, had discussed this issue in terms of the perimeter of parks, but it is a problem when people are in areas where other people are also moving and congregating, and it's a very different I, don't think we're gonna solve it tonight, but it's something we should keep thinking about. Yeah where I was gonna say Mark. Do you have ideas? Well, I, don't have a good one, I'm with Shelly on that Peter Coo, Council member crew, who's, the head of the health committee on the city. Council has a bill that would ban smoking pretty much everywhere that Ms Whitten is talking about. I'm not surprised that it hasn't gone anywhere. I, don't even believe. Even though he's the chair of his own committee, I, don't think he's held a hearing on it. When council member then Council member Gail Brewer pushed to have smoking eliminated in parks. There were a lot of compromises and our board tried to fill in some of those compromises in a recent resolution, and it is incredibly difficult to get folks to in elected positions. To take that stand and having banned smoking in a lot of indoor spaces for some I will personally offer pretty good reasons. It's very hard to then take away the exterior as well. That said, congregating in front of doors and or under windows of residential buildings. It is a problem, it is not illegal. So it's not a law enforcement issue. It is a need for some kind of modification of the law and or an appeal for better behavior. But when you're appealing it's different than you're enforcing I, completely get the frustration and I'm open to more creative solutions, but I, I'm sorry to say: I, don't have one myself so will, as a committee I think we should just continue thinking and talking about that and then maybe we can also think of other people or agencies to follow up with so I want to thank everyone for their comments and I want to thank the presenters for coming, don't feel, like you have to stay for the whole meeting. We'll definitely follow up with you and mark. If you could, please pull up the oh one other point: we will follow up with those. There are some questions in the in the Q&A, so we will follow up with people who ask questions those questions, they're very specific, to get answers and we'll follow up with you. So we won't forget that. Thank you very much. I am going to leave the meeting Lisa Lombardi. Thank you, yeah, oh yeah. Thank you. Lisa thanks everybody. Thank you for having me. Thank you bye-bye. Thank you. So much for having me too I appreciate the opportunity. Much thanks, thank you. Catherine I think you're, muted I need one minute, because I can't see that very well in the screens, so I have to pull up my copy, which will just take one second. So just give me one minute, and thank you it's long, so this will give the community a chance to read it too. I'm gonna go through, I'm gonna go through it. I just need to pull it up. So just give me one. Second, okay! Thank you yes to say. In the meantime, our committee has dealt with hate crimes and bias issues of different types in the past, and this is our current attempt at speaking out. Okay, so thank you so much for waiting for me. I just needed to see it. The text I needed to be bigger, so I appreciate, so this I want to go through the text, which is about a page and a half, because I want people to be able to actually see and respond to the detail. So I'm just going to read through it. This resolution is based on the following facts: the Fbi reports, data on hate crimes, which they define as motivated by biases, based on race, gender identity, religion, Disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, crimes include intimidation, destruction, damage, vandalism, simple assault, aggregated assault and other offenses. We wrote this resolution and respond to an Fbi report that came out this month. According to the Fbi in 2019, hate crimes in the United States rose to their highest level in 10. In more than 10 years, more murders motivated by hate were recorded than ever before. That was reported in a few different places. More rapes, motivated by hate, were recorded than ever before, based on available data, I actually looked back at the data that was available to come to that conclusion. Almost 1 in 10 victims of hate crimes were juveniles. 55.8 percent of hate crimes were motivated by a race, ethnicity, ancestry, bias and I just want to make it make clear that in the resolutions we use demographic categories used by the text we reference, so the words that we use are based on the Fbi report reporting. But if there's any thoughts or comments, people have about the language that we use and resolutions, please let us know: four percent of those were prompted by religious bias and 16.8 percent resulted from sexual orientation bias of race, ethnicity and ancestry. Bias. 48.4 percent were motivated by anti-black or african-american bias. A religious bias, 60 were anti-jewish and 13.3 percent were anti-islamic. This list does not include all categories, so please see the chart and report for more data of increases from 2018 anti-semitic hate crimes increased by 14 percent hate crimes directed at Latinos, rose, 9, approximately 9 and hate crimes against those who identify as Lgbtq increased, including an 18 increase in crimes against the transgender community and the Fbi tracks. Both hate crimes against individuals and I believe communities as well. New York City reported the following incidences per bias motivation. So this data is based just on New York, City, 90, race, ethnicity, ancestry, 266, religion, 53, sexual orientation, one disability, zero, gender and 13 gender identity. As Sheldon Fein just mentioned, we did do a resolution condemning Anti-Semitism and we have data in that resolution as well. More specific data about New York City that were that is available on the website. We're also happy to find it for you. So far in 2020, there's been an increase in bias. Crimes against those who identify as transgender and asian American Fbi data under counts. The number of hate crimes in the United States. For a couple reasons, one local agencies are not required to report hate crime data to the Fbi last year, 2100 law enforcement agencies of more than 15,000 reported data according to the Fbi. This does represent 93 of the U.S population, and the second reason is that many victims, don't report incidences or incidents. Previous Department of Justice studies us to estimate that an average of 250,000 people each year, according to a 2020 department of Homeland Security report, called homeland threat assessment, and this was also recently published- and this is a quote racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists. Specifically, white supremacists extremists remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland white supremacist extremists, which they abbreviate as wses, have demonstrated long-standing intent to target racial and religious minorities, members of the Lgbtq plus community politicians and those they believe, promote multiculturalism, culturalism and globalization at the expense of the white supremacist extremist identity. Since 2018 they have conducted more lethal attacks in the United States than any other reading, the acronyms any other domestic violence extremist movement. The report notes that quote racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists could seek to exploit concerns about social injustice issues to incite violence and exploit otherwise peaceful protest movements. The number of white nationalist groups grew 55 between 2017 and 2019, so we researched what the city could do to combat hate crimes and there's a number of things and that's what we're calling for the first resolve, therefore, be it resolved at community board seven Manhattan. First, we reject and condemn all forms of hate and white supremacist extremism affirm every person's rights to freedom of expression, protest and safety, and we stand in solidarity with all those who are targeted because of their race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, immigration status, disability status and all other classes protected by New, York, City, Human rights law. It further resolves that community board 7 Manhattan calls on the mayor to include more robust, anti-hate crime and community resilience, curricula appropriate for in-person and remote learning in New, York, City schools, and we call on the Manhattan district attorney's hate crime unit to provide more educational outreach to schools, community groups and religious organizations on strategies for identifying and reporting hate crimes to law enforcement, as well as information on available resources and support supports. We are very glad to work with the Manhattan borough president's office and those of us that have attended their diversity and inclusion. Trainings have I believe benefited greatly from what they offer, though they do very good work in this area, but they need more resources in order to conduct that work. So we call on New York City to provide the Manhattan borough president's office with resources needed to provide additional diversity, equity and inclusion training in collaboration with the New York City Commission on human rights. They are moving towards making those trainings mandatory right now. They're optional support for community boards to address issues specific to their boards and districts, development of more specific questions related to demographics and diversity, equity and inclusion, onboard applications which they already share with with the public. So you can get demographic data about boards and how representative they are of communities, but that data is limited and also we would like for them to provide more guidance to boards to develop diversity, equity and inclusion, committees and or task forces, so that we can take proactive stances and develop strategies to address individual and community biases that lead to discrimination and hate crimes. Finally, we call on NYPD to continue to improve data collection and reporting on hate crimes and provide training to improve trust between law enforcement and communities to encourage more reporting of hate crimes. So that is the resolution. Are there questions or comments from the committee and I think you could stop sharing the screen? Thank you. I can't see everybody so Shelley. If you want to call on folks sure, does anybody like to comment or ask questions okay, mark yeah, because you're there's a one of the therefore paragraphs talks about the Manhattan borough president's office and I agree with how you introduced that when you were pivoting to that part of it, would it be acceptable to include a phrase that says that CB7 is grateful for or some words to that effect grateful for the trainings provided by the hamburger president and then go on to say, and we call on the city to give them more money, so they can do an even better job as opposed to making it look like we're criticizing the borough president when I don't think we are absolutely and I. Think to that point we should include that description at the top when we're listing the facts. So we could list in the facts like this is what they do. We appreciate it. It's wonderful and we can list some of the specific trainings that they've given and then say and they're moving in this direction. I mean they're working on these things, so we can kind of establish that as the fact and then in the be it result, we can phrase that, as we support this work and call on for additional resources and I also want to clarify that it doesn't have to be a lot of resources. It's these initiatives, aren't expensive or not expensive. So and I did talk to April Adams about this from the Manhattan borough president's office. Today, too, and I got some feedback from her. There are comments from from the committee or the board. I, don't see any I, don't see additional comments or additional signups on the from the community, but are there any questions in the chat that we should address related to the resolution? Did anybody? Does anybody see any? Maybe you can drop the link to sign up one more time into the chat just to make sure okay. That takes me one minute. Just that'll. Just take me one minute, very good. Okay, so just give me one second, thank you, meanwhile, I'll stall for time by saying that I did see in the Q&A someone reinforcing what Ms Whitten had said about the smoking and asking that we not let that drop, and we will continue to ponder that and try to find a solution recognizing it's difficult, but thank you for the comment and we will be sure to keep it on our minds. Okay, so are there any other comments from the committee or questions I did post the link, so we'll wait a minute to see if anybody signs up, but in the meantime, are there any comments or questions from anybody else on the committee we're bored? No. This is great. Thank you like to compliment Catherine on the excellent research yeah. Thank you Catherine. Second thanks. My only comment is I fully support it. It's so important and absolutely and I think I also just want to thank you so much Doug I. I've I want to thank everyone on the committee for support of this work for Shelly my partner for support with everything. So no one has signed up on this on the sign up sheet, so I think we could take a vote. Yeah motion, those who favor the motion vote. Yes, why don't you do a once? You do a roll call, it's not that many people, and so just because that way, you'll call on the committee members, first, okay, so Catherine in the last row. Yes, okay, Sheldon, fine! Yes, let's see who's here, Courtney Courtney's! Here, right, yes, hi, yes, okay, wrote Rosa is still here; yes, hi, it's hard to figure out where people are Badge; yes, Robert, yes, okay! Yes, any other committee members that are still here, nope, so okay, so that is how many s's that's six and I think that's everybody so six to zero right: okay, board, member Non-committee, Board members, okay, Louisa every Yeses, Louisa Sarah! Yes, okay, a dog! Yes assume! Yes, based on what you said: okay, anybody else. That would be me mark. Of course. Okay I mean yes, thank you! That's four! Okay, I! Don't think there are any other I'll take a quick stroll through the attendees, but I think we got everybody. Okay, I! Think they signed off yes, okay, that's unanimous! So that's four to zero on the internet, Howard and the attendees I, don't know so I say again: I see Howard Yaris in the attendees, oh I! Don't! Oh! Let me take a look. Oh Howard, hey sorry, I didn't see you there buddy I just dropped in just listening in. Were you here long enough to vote, or should we not no, not of no I didn't hear enough of the issue. I'll vote in the full meeting, though thanks very good, so we'll leave it at four to zero. Howard is technically not in the meeting excellent unanimous. Thank you, okay, so, and thank you to all of the community board members for being here. It's so great to have you with us and Sarah. You actually were raised this issue of hate crimes several years ago. Do you mind remember that when you first started, I do yeah I. Do it's great to see it coming to fruition? So the next item on the next item that I just want to mention is that we write resolutions that sometimes apply to all of Manhattan and the city, and it would be great to kind of follow up on those resolutions. So one thing that we typically do is that we send the resolution to various offices and agencies for whom it's relevant to advocate. So whatever offices we mention and the in the resolves another thing that we could do is we could share these resolutions with Mark's support. We could share these resolutions with burro boards so and then Burro Board could potentially adopt them. So two that I was thinking of that are relevant to to the city and specifically, Manhattan, are the resolution on food insecurity and strategies for creating food, equity and access and the, and then this last one on hate crimes. So Mark, could you speak to that process a little bit sure? Thank you. There are two possibilities that probably follow up on or that I'm sorry let me start again. There are two ways in which we could pursue what Catherine and Shelly are recommending, one of which is to ask Rosie the senior liaison at the Brewer president's office. Who is the person who runs the agenda and meetings for Borough Board to consider this as something that would be put on that agenda? Another is that the 12 chairs of the community board boards in Manhattan speak offline from time to time and share information from time to time. So what I'll be glad to do unilaterally is share those two resolutions once they're fully adopted. Of course, I don't want to share a draft, but once the full board has spoken for everybody's benefit, both board colleagues and the community I just stumbled upon a point that I should have made clear earlier, which is that the community board speaks only through full board resolutions. So a committee action is just that. It's a committee action. It's referral to the full board for its consideration and we don't, for example, circulate committee resolutions to agencies unless there's an urgency, and we tell them very clearly that this isn't a board action. But we wanted you to know what the work in progress was all right. So I'd be glad once this is adopted, assuming it is adopted by the same kind of amazing margin. You just voted upon at full board, assuming that is adopted to share it with the other chairs of the community boards in Manhattan to see to gauge their interest, and it would then be an easier task if a number of them were to say yes, we were, we will take this up ourselves or we are interested in this to have that. Go with our request to the for president's office to say that maybe this is a good thing to put on the a Future Bureau Board Agenda. So those are the two ways in which I foresee, following up based on what Catherine it just asked me. Okay, so is anyone so I wanted to know if anyone on the committee would be interested in if we do present these to Borough board. If anyone on the committee would be interested in in presenting and talking and going to a borough board meeting and sharing these more widely with Shelley and me, would anybody else in the committee be interested and in Pr, in presenting those the one on on against hate crimes that would be to the other community boards in Manhattan or the one on food it sounds like between? You can do a wonderful job, you don't know what another person's gonna add to it. I actually would I think it would be great if it was if someone would go with Shelly and I. Sat this one out, I'm volunteering Shelly and pull and removing myself, but I think it would be great if somebody from if somebody people from the committee did it and not just the chairs, anyone interested you don't have to, of course, and if you're not sure now you can always right. That's those rest afterwards, but it's like it's a good opportunity to interact with the other board, see what they're up to I think the Bureau board meetings are pretty interesting and impact policy on and have it and kind of create a much larger audience for these resolutions, because we have 50 board members and and with the other community boards that those numbers get a lot bigger, so think about it. The agenda for December, January and February I just want to go over that and ask you to email, Shelly and me any input or ideas that you have so on December on Thursday December 3rd at 7, we have a meeting that we're coordinating with safe horizon and New York City alliance against sexual assault. The focus of this meeting is how to is how to meet the needs and best respond to children who have been abused and address kind of mental health and other issues and protect them specifically in clinical settings. So that's we're currently organizing with that with them that's coming up, and so we won't have our meeting at the end of December. Instead, we'll have it on December 3rd and then in January we're having a meeting on racial and economic health disparities. The borough president's office has expressed interest in working with us on that and then in February. Robert kind of Robert and I were talking this past weekend and he raised the issue of mental health and we thought that would be a great focus for the February meeting. And so those are. Are there any immediate comments on any of that, and then also you can email us if you have ideas either about any anybody, if you have ideas for those agendas for speakers organizations really anything but child abuse in December racial and economic health disparities in January and mental health in February, hey, Mark Diller can you are you there? I am here and I said his hand up. I, don't know if it's about what you just said. So: okay I want to address the hand, but I want to call. But in the meantime, can you please send Mark Levine and the link to join our zoom meeting, because when we're ready for the presentation on his bill, he wanted me to give him send him. The invitation then, do you know what email address he wants me to use. I can ask him, so you guys meeting I'll, try to figure that out. Okay, were there comments in response to the December January and February meetings, agendas, yeah, Doug I just wanted to say we can talk about this offline, but the subject matter expert that I've talked to you about yeah, very apropos for the December 3rd meeting. If you develop yes, that'd be great. Thank you, yes, jump out for one minute to just get things set up for the next step. So just excuse me for one moment, is that Muhammad. That's me welcome we're trying to thank you for accepting my request. Okay, we're going to introduce you in a minute we just want to see if mark can get on, because he was interested in hearing speak about his bill. That's good and I'll be happy seeing him. Maybe you can tell people who you are yeah so yeah, oh okay, so my name is Mohammed. Tikani I am originally from the Gambia West Africa and professionally I am a medical doctor, but currently reading a master's in public health at the School of Public Health and health policy, City University of New York and we're doing sorry. The question is what why did you want to present this evening? Yeah? The reason why I want to present is because we, our current program, the masters in public health program, has a course on health advocate advocacy and the essence of the program is to advocate for better health. Better, you know public health measures and one of the bills that you know I saw that is of very important to you know. New Yorkers is the bill that was introduced by council member Mark Levin, and you know this bill is very, you know important, because a greater percentage of New Yorkers are you know, obese and a lot more are suffering from diabetes and majority of these people get. You know, suffer from this. You know problems due to you know the consumption of junk food or unhealthy food into the bill that council member Mark wants to. You know enact as a law once power to be enacted as a law would help minimize these risk factors and as well, help in improving the health institutes of you know: New Yorkers, particularly those that, are you, know, overweight and obese against. You know the risk of developing. You know diabetes and other cardiovascular problems. Okay, do you belong to any professional associations back home in my country? Yes, I belong to professional associations, and here in the U.S I am a member of the American Public Health Association, and also, and also I, am an advisory board. Member of the center for climate change, health and equity of the American Public Health Association, okay, because I think that's helpful for people to understand your standing and possibly that you could reach out to the agencies that you're associated with the associations for support. Also, you know for backing now. Catherine, have we found mark I, texted him and Mark is trying to connect with him, but I think it's very exciting that he wanted to hear this presentation and hopefully he'll jump in the meantime. We can get started Muhammad and we're so glad you're with us. Thank you for coming to give us education on this bill. Mark can I offer a footnote to Mohammed's apha credential, and that goes way back, but it's going to give you an idea if I may sure, on the importance of this in Muhammad in 1974, I attended a american Public Health Association conference, which was a yearly conference that was in Chicago in January and one of the arguments, because we were pushing for certain legislation out of Congress and one of the requirements for to be taken seriously in Congress at that time was to get well. Let's use the word premature from the Apha. So as a body it had such clout that if you wanted serious legislation, I figured exactly what it was I, don't know whether it was immunization or whatever it was. The idea was to marshal the support of the Apha conference and then take that with you, your proposals to Congress for particular legislation, and then you had a better chance of succeeding so for the other members of the committee, who may not have an ex experience with Apha and these other organizations and I hope that, because today we have critical issues, I hope that they have the clout today that they had then, okay, so can we proceed Catherine, I'm in here? That's it: okay, yeah, so Muhammad yeah, all right once more. Thank you very much for having me. Thank you very much for having me, and you know, for accepting my request. As I said earlier, on, I am professionally a medical doctor and currently reading a master's in public health and concentrating on health policy and management at the graduate School of Public, Health and health policy. This public testimony, I am doing is part of you know a requirement, an assignment that I need to do as a part of our course that I'm doing named public health advocacy. The essence of the program is to advocate for good public health measures that are essential in improving the health status of you know the community, because in public health the whole objective of public health is to advance the health of the community when the community gets healthy, less is being spent on health budget on economics and all lots of things. So a better healthy, a better and healthy community is very important. We can move to the first line, yeah I'm trying here. It is all right. So the bill I want to you know talk about. Is bill number 1326, which was introduced in 2019 by council member Mark Levin. It is a bill that belongs to the New York City Council, and this bill was introduced by mark, as a you know, a means of covering the amount of junk food that is present in New York, City markets- and you know the name of the bill is requiring added sugars, sugar notification and menu boards, and you know signs. Why is this important? This is important because a lot of people, especially New Yorkers, don't know the contents of the food stuffs that they consume, and so, if they are, labels of you know, added sugars on you know the food they buy, all the food items they buy. It could as well be a source of awareness for them to know what they are buying and the risk that is related to what they are buying. The objective of the bill is to require key in restaurant restaurants in New York City, to apply warning labels on food items or menu items and sign. Boards of you know, foods that contain more than 12 grams of added sugar in New York. A lot of people consume sodas, but you know majority of them don't know the amount of sugar that is, you know present in this, so that they are consuming and so the bill. The objective of the bill is to outline the amount of sugar added sugar that is in this. You know sugar, sweetened. You know beverages so that the people buying them will know the risk related to the what they are buying and as well be a source of you know, awareness for them to avoid consuming them the goals of this bill. There are two main goals: one is to reduce the risk related to development of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and other diseases that are related to the consumption of you know: sugar, sweetened beverages and the second objective. The second goal, which is very important, is to promote the consumption of nutritious diet, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, because this is helpful in preventing you know illnesses next. Why is this bill important? Oh, why is this issue we discussing important? The importance of this issue can not be overemphasized, and there are some data that, when we review we'll know that the importance of the bill, according to the New York's New York State Department of Health about 23.2 percent of adults drink at least one sugar, sweetened beverages, beverage body calculated in you know in a week, in a month, in a year in a decade how many people are consuming this and how many are at risk of developing. You know overweight or obesity or diabetes or cardiovascular problems, enormous the percentage of New York state adults who have overweight obesity, increased by 42 percent to in 42 to 62 percent 62.7 percent between 1997 and 2018. That is about twenty point. Seven percent increase- that is a huge amount, a huge increase in percentage of people that have been over overweight or obese, and you know that is something that is the words you know, taking into consideration the percentage of New York state adults, who are obviously increased from 16 in 1997 to 26.7 in 2008, and that is also about nine percent increase. So it is more or less telling us that there is the percentages of you, know. People or people at risk of these risk factors are only increasing and not reducing. Why? How can we reduce this? We can reduce this by taking care of our diet by knowing what we are consuming. Particularly you know, issues relating to a high sugar diet and also obesity among children and adolescents are said to be. You know tripled over the past two decades, currently, a third of New Yorkers of New York children are obese or overweight, so, if kids, so if children are obese at that young age, imagine how they would be. You know when they become adults and they continue to consume. You know these kind of beverages, it will be huge amount, and that means the percentage of obesity in the state will as well continue increasing like it is seen from 97 to 2018 and for diabetes. It is estimated that 1.6 million people in New, York and that is about 10.5 percent of the adult population, have been diagnosed with diabetes. That is a very huge amount, and so how can we reduce, or how can we bring down these numbers? One very important way of bringing down these numbers is by enacting this bill. When we enact this bill, it will reduce the amount of you know: consumption of sugar, sweetened beverages and as well, promote the consumption of nutritious. You know: diet like food, fresh fruits and vegetables and as well. You know promote awareness to you know New Yorkers. This is very. This is going to be very helpful and it's going to help in minimizing cost on health care cost on. You know we were talking about shelter and all those stuff. If there is reduction in the cost of you know, health care, the money that would have been used on health care will be, you know, channel or outsource to housing and provision of accommodation, and that will be very helpful just to emphasize the importance of the bill. This is this bill. A similar bill was enacted in Chile and the reason why I shared this is to encourage you and your community members as well as the constituents to you, know, see the benefits that attach to the enactment of this bill, for example, initially in 2016, they introduced a food lover, and the food law requires that advertisement of restrictions on unhealthy food, bold front of package. You know warning labels as well, as you know, as well as a ban on junk food. This was very helpful in chile because, within a period of 18 months, there was 25 percent reduction in the consumption of you know: sugar, sweetened drinks and imagine if this is done in New, York City. How many people would be enlightened about the risk that is related to the consumption of you know, beverages that have got high content of sugar. How many people will be? You know see from the risk of developing obesity, how many people receive from the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. A lot of people and researchers have also found that about five percent that was about five percent increase in the produce of of both water diet, and also, you know, fruits and vegetables as a result of this law, and so like I was like I said in the previous slide and I. An enactment of this bill will help promote good nutrition. It will encourage people to consume nutritious food, fresh fruits and vegetables and minimize the consumption of you know. Beverages that have that contain a lot of you know sugar. However, this, the enactment of the bill can not just be you know it can not just have of like it won't be easy because most of the times bills like these are always faced with a lot of resistance from interest groups, because when you enact this kind of bill, the interest or profit really gained from the seals of this kind of you know, foodstuffs will minimize, and so there will be resistance, but with a committed community- and you know constituent now, I'm sure the will can be enacted. Thank you very much and that's the end. Thank you. So Mark or Council member Mark Levine is here we're so glad that you're with us. If you want to talk about this bill and then we can ask questions to you and Mohammed. Thank you so much for your presentation for educating us about this and for bringing it to our attention. We appreciate your coming and preparing that for us. Thank you so much Muhammad. That was an incredible presentation and I'm so glad I got to catch it. Perhaps you can share your powerpoint with me and I can show it to some of my colleagues, but thank you Catherine and Shel Jelly for having me here on this important topic and you get such a thorough overview Mohammed. That I don't have a lot to add, except to say that New York had been making a lot of progress on the fight against obesity for many years and we have at best stalled and probably are starting to backslide on that in recent years. So we are going to need new policy to get moving in the right direction again, and there is no doubt that the amount of added sugar that we all consume is a major driver of obesity and other health problems, and we have something of a guidepost here on a successful strategy, because New York City has already added important information to our menus in chain. Restaurants, including calorie amounts and and now high sodium warnings and they've been quite successful and I think quite popular with the public, and we want to follow on that success by giving New York diners the power of information and when we were working on this bill and I started to look up the amount of added sugar in some well-known menu items in chain. Restaurants I was shocked, so I'm just gonna tell you two or three. If you get a apple pecan chicken, salad at Wendy's, okay, you don't usually think of salads as having a lot of added sugar that is 40 grams of added sugar. That's 10, teaspoons of added sugar in a salad. If you get at Mcdonald's the fruit and maple oatmeal, you might think. That's a nice healthy breakfast, 33 grams of added sugar, that is eight teaspoons of sugar. The barbecue hawaiian pizza from domino I, don't think we normally think of pizza as a high sugar item, but but that's also 33 grams of sugar I could go on and on baked beans at Kfc I mean all of these items that normally we don't think of as desserts are loaded with added sugar, and you know I think that if you order a bowl of ice cream, you probably know you're getting a lot of sugar, but when you're ordering a salad, that's probably not what you would expect, and so we do want to empower the public. With this kind of information, the bill would be targeted only to chain. Restaurants, I forget what the threshold was, but, but that has been the model used by the legislation related to calorie counts and sodium, and we introduced this in early 2019 and I have to admit Muhammad that with the pandemic, we really have not been pushing this aggressively, but it's just as important as ever and I. Thank you for bringing it up and I think your advocacy could help us restart the campaign because, unfortunately, I think the is greater than ever and frankly, we have seen in Covid-19 that some of the underlying conditions are certainly directly attributable to diet and specifically over consumption of sugar. So I think there's a very current reason to to get back into this. So I'll just pause there, but thank you again, Mohamed and thanks thanks to Shelley and captain for focusing on this topic tonight and oh by the way, and thank you also Chair Diller for being here and for your continued amazing leadership on this and many other issues. You had it right, the first time it's Katherine and Shelley. So are there questions for council member Levine or for Muhammad from the committee or from the from board members? Thank you so much both of you for being here. Yes, Robert question yeah I want to thank Mohammed. It was I agree with the councilman. It was a great presentation, but something occurred to me when I started traveling to Florida, where I used to I go for summer treat pre-coping and I. Would be interested in a comparative research study because Florida is about sugar, that's where the sugars is grown. So when you roll around in your car in Florida and you think, you're lost you're thinking, you know in a different country where you see nothing but sugar cane for hundreds of thousands of acres and then you go downtown to the to the social area where you have the restaurants and the young people and over everyone's going to eat and drink, and all of that and you think you're ordering a simple drink. It's all sugar! It's all! Everything in Florida is sugar, because it's a sugar economy so that and I support, I used to drink, soda, I haven't drunk soda and God knows how long but I'll have my beer has has sugar, but you have sectors of the economy that are built on sugar consumption and so I would be interested to learn what the incidence or the ideology to use. Your term of diabetes and cardiovascular disease is in Florida compared to a state like New York, for example, and and perhaps other states that rely heavily on sugar as a commodity. But I applaud your your research and the the argument and the work that the councilman is doing in the city council, because we have a critical problem which is being aggravated by being locked down and then being relocked down in the whole thing and I put on my pandemic 25 libras, which I'm having a hell of a time trying to shake and walking, doesn't work. So there is an issue, and but I really like to see some more research. Okay, thank you, though. I love, the piece and I want to see the slides too, by the way I think I have to include them in the minutes. I'm not sure. Let's make sure we call on everybody and also mark wants to give an update on Councilmember Levine. Let me know if I'm, if I have this correct, you chair the health committee on this future health committee on the City Council. So you wanted to give an update just briefly in the hours late, but this is such a pressing issue as New York City is in its second wave that we're witnessing a real breakdown in the testing infrastructure and I have a couple points to make on this. First, we just want people to understand that, while a negative test result is good news, it is not a guarantee that you are not contagious and I am really concerned about the number of people who appear to be flooding our testing system, because they want testing as a get out of jail, free card for holiday, travel or family gatherings and well of course, if you must travel and we hope people don't and if you must gather- and we hope people don't getting a negative test is preferable. We don't want people to overread the meaning of that and to let their guard down in any way. And frankly, I'm concerned at this point that we're crowding out some people who really are symptomatic and high risk, because the testing system has been overwhelmed. Having said that, it is absolutely unacceptable that we do not have more capacity to collect samples and the long lines of ours are just intolerable and are themselves a public health threat. We have to dramatically add to our capacity to collect test samples in the city. That means more pop-up sites, more mobile sites, more at-home testing kits distributed. That technology is pretty well established and more points of care testing in doctor's offices, growing possibility of self-testing, and in fact we are we're looking to open a pop-up testing site in my district office. It's not in just not in CB7 it's in a little bit farther up 144th street, but but I'm pushing very hard for this, so know that it's a source of enormous concern, but I do also want people to have a balanced view of what testing does and does not tell you and I'm just hoping we all remain extremely cautious ahead of this holiday weekend. So I'm going to pause there. If there's time inappropriate, I can take more questions, I can talk about the broader Covid-19 outlook and the data etc, but I think I'm going to pause there and see if there's any time or interest so I just wanted to add little to what you said. It is important for people to understand that a negative test doesn't equal to immunity. A negative test means that you don't have the virus at that point and also enable many other countries, because they maximize testing and isolated. As many you know, infected as possible from the non-infected population and that help in minimizing the spread, and so that is very important. You know for a populous, cosmopolitan, you know a state like New York, more the testing, the better the response. Okay, any questioners that you can see any hand see that there's one hand in the among attendees as a hand raised I, also have a question for mark a follow-up question for him, I'm for council member Levine. Is he still with us? Yes, I am okay. There you are I, can't see everyone on my phone. Do you have any opinions about and tell me if this is too big of a question but we're working on a resolution in Yl on the school's closing and the metrics that are used and the test positivity rate? Do you have any opinions on the test, positivity rate or, if those methods to change, if the school should close at all like do you have any opinion about that, because I know that that's kind of amazing right now, thank you and I'll. Try and be brief. First I felt that the closure of schools ahead of more risky venues, such as indoor dining, reflected, really backwards priorities and goes against what we've learned from other places around the country and world about where the virus spreads most easily. As for this trigger point of three percent, positivity I had to say that I more and more concerned about positivity rate as a reliable indicator for us, it is currently being impacted greatly, for example, by the number of young, healthy people who are getting tested ahead of travel, and so we have seen for about the last week or 10 days. Some consistency of positivity rate around 3, while the actual number of cases is going like this, I'm not sure if I'm doing that right, but we've had a doubling of cases in New, York City in the last 14 days. I'm not sure how much the public even hears that, but that's an extremely worrisome indicator and I think at this point, probably more relevant than positivity. You know, as for you know, reopening of the schools I think that we should prioritize children with special needs, including district 75 children in temporary housing, which is a shelter but other similar situations and and then, ultimately, when it comes to broader population, I would say elementary school kids we've. We have seen that the risk is not zero for kids of any age. The risk of spread amongst children, 10 and under is really much lower even than it is for adolescents. So, for all these reasons, I think there's actually an emergency emerging consensus about the kind of priorities that I just laid out and personally I hope. It will not be tied to a single positivity rate and there'll be a little more room for the judgment of public health experts who are really much better equipped to judge momentum and trends and to see problems and progress as they emerge. Thank you. Shelley. I'm going to hand it over to you, because I can't see everyone, but I just want to I just want to bring to everyone's attention that it is 9:45. So it's pretty late. Okay, we're gonna go on to new business. Unless there's another question, there's one person with a hand up in in among the attendees, okay that'll be our last question. Who is it? Who is that person? It's Erica Gerson who spoke earlier about a different topic? Okay, Erica! Please hi! Well, I'm glad that Catherine brought up the schools. That was where I wanted to go with this and wait did mark disappear. Is he gone he's here? Oh he's not on my screen. Okay, so my question is: can you be a little more specific I think we all agree with you in terms of the order of priorities, although I'm not sure how you can specify just that people in a shelter get to school, you have to open the whole school for that to happen, but what exactly can we do is anything happening on your level? Are you guys pushing the mayor? Are we pushing the school boards and what is what can we all do, because we have to have a school reopening plan? Even if now is not the time, it seems crazy that we've made this far and the mayor is saying well now that we're in a closing we can think about what the plan might be. I feel like this is like a number one priority for all of our families, that we have to figure out how to get our kids in school, so our parents can go to work and you talk about people gathering I mean everyone's going to gather if they need to take care of kids, so this should be an absolute top priority. I want to hear what you are doing and what we all can do to move this forward. Thank you, Erica I agree. We need a school reopening plan and I, and many of my colleagues are pushing really hard on this. Behind the scenes. We have a really strong chair of the education committee in the City Council Mark Traeger from Brooklyn. I'm a member of the committee I worked very closely with him. I have to say that it's been I think remarkable how much the pressure from parents has had impact down at city hall over the last two weeks. In a way, that's that I haven't seen much. It's really moved the needle and I think it. It's created a very broad consensus in the city council about reopening in a deliberate way in an appropriate way, but expeditiously and my sense inside the mayor's orbit is it's had a similar effect and you've seen some. What I would consider to be very helpful comments from Michael Mulgrew, president of the U of T, in recent days, about a real openness to a quick reop reopening, so I won't say the word quick, but certainly to a phased reopening, so I think to the extent that you can contact your council members with your ideas on the best way to do this incredibly appreciative and and do the same for the mayor, there's still a lot of tough questions. I would love to hear from you directly Erica and by the way, I'll put my email in the chat in a minute and I think others would as well, I'm not sure if you're in my district or not but either way, I think the pressure's working and I would say: keep it up. Okay, thank you. Okay, we're gonna have to go into new business, Mark Levine. Thank you. So much for joining us and Muhammad again for your presentation and I know. Not only did Michael Veen want it. Robert said he wanted. Maybe you could send us a copy for the community board I just sent it to you to Catherine and to Robert Terrific. Thank you. Okay, new business, Courtney, yeah hi thanks. So given yesterday's announcement that there would again be a delay in the decision regarding the situation, Lucerne I would like to propose the committee consider a resolution on how best to address ongoing concerns, given that it's likely to be tied up in legal proceedings for quite some time. So when the residents from several other shelters and temporary hotel shelters were moved to Lucerne in August project, renewal cited its good neighbor policy to which all the residents currently living in the Lucerne are expected to adhere, and it's not clear to me that this policy was ever released publicly, but Council member Rosenthal referenced it in her first email about the Lucerne, and then it was cited in an article published on the Isle of Double West sides laying out expectations which included noise. Lingering. No one should be lingering in the surrounding area, use and possession of alcohol and other drugs smoking, which we've already started to talk about tonight, littering masks, but no real firm guidelines were ever released for the process of handling handling residents who violate the policy. Nor was there any real redress for local residents who live in the local vicinity, and you know report continued violations and by that I mean we're talking gathering in front of local residences to smoke. Other reports of drug-related activities, foreign affidavits from this court case from several long-term and I by that I mean decades-long residents of the Lucerne who report witnessing drug use and threatening disruptive behavior and then those arrests that were originally reported to this board in September, which included residents of the Lutheran. Originally. As reported this board, there were nine in the original that's, but it was later confirmed by the 20th, including at a build, a block meeting that there were actually more arrests over the coming weeks back in September and the more information was not released. So I can't speak to any other of those. Other additional arrests were linked to lease Cern, but I would propose that this committee called for several measures to address the situation now that it's clear that it's likely to continue while the legal proceedings play out and I propose. First, that good neighbor policy needs to be made public and we need to put in place a framework to ensure that it's impaired too. So that to me means having project renewal security reports and record all infractions and to make those reports available to local elected officials and to the working group which I believe was assigned to oversee the temporary shelter, hotels and then an email or phone line which local residents could utilize to report to project renewal violations and request immediate attention. It's my understanding that this I think originally existed, but perhaps no longer, and then I think it's about talking about the removal of residents who receive multiple reports of infractions. Things like the smoking. Things like the mask adherence littering and lingering, as laid out in that good neighbor policy. I believe and I feel, like the working group should be receiving regular reports on repeated violations and then I think. We also need to be talking about the pro violating that prohibition on the use and possession of alcohol and drugs and talking about what that means in terms of the their removal. So again, I think this is something where the working group should be notified. Of these types of violations and I know that there is disagreement regarding the use of hotels as temporary, shelters, but I think we can all agree that it would be helpful to find a way to improve the situation by addressing the concerns and helping ease community pensions, while the courts do their work and I think revisiting the good neighbor policy and the role of the working group would be a good place to start thanks for listening, I, don't support that resolution, but I'll I, I'm interested to hear what other people think Shelley. Anybody else, I think that a key there are some important issues here, but I think they can be solved by having put work when the working group was operating. A lot of these things were able to be addressed, perhaps suggesting to the for our president to reconvene the working group and to have that type of communication that had started and seemed to be effective. Has the working group not reconvened? Was it disbanded what happened? It wasn't disbanded. It was an ad hoc group and when litigation ensued it there wasn't there wasn't a it stopped meeting the, and so, while I'm speaking, I'm also I see some con I see some of the points that you're raising, Courtney and I think that they're important I'm concerned about this not being an agenda item on a meeting that the public has noticed too and that yeah, because I'm certain that you would draw a crowd, probably two crowds and maybe more than two grounds and to discuss and to support it with doing some homework in advance of that I. Think that would be the right process for any. For anything like this. It's also like really helpful to talk to chairs about this I. This is the first time hearing of it, so I think from you and so I think it's good to have those discussions to plan to look at what the concrete problems are and what the situation is, get information and collaborate with the team and provide notice and go through that process. I, don't know if that's something that we could address in new business I think that we can address some of the concerns by speaking to the the palsb, for instance, having some communication with project renewal about what their communication process now is. With the when there are issues in the community at one point there wasn't an email I believe, so there are things that specific things that can be done to address the communication part, but to do something more would be certainly more complicated right now, I agree on I agree which I agree, 100 and I agree that communication is really helpful, so any other thoughts. Yes, what is the communication network right now between the the service agency and the community? What is who talks to whom and the politicals? How is that set up? Is there any kind of discussion, any kind of conversation there? Generally speaking, it's with the elected officials and their staffs and since the advent of litigation, it's been largely in the courts, the so that's the best answer. I can give you with respect to the community board and I, see that there's a question about how hard is it to convene if the elected officials have the will to do that, I imagine it could be reconvened and I would certainly work with them to do that. If that's the objective, if that, if there's buy-in yeah anybody else, bash I think we shouldn't ignore it and let it get bad I think we should deal with it and solve the problems between whoever it's between at this point, so that things work right and then that everybody has a better life because of it rather than just let things hang out there. So how can we maybe Courtney and some other people- can research this a little more and get even get some a few statistics on what the complaints are there? Any people from the 20th precinct to looking at things I mean how do we deal with it rather than just letting it fester I think we should take Shelley's suggestion, Shelley's suggestion to follow up with the borough president I think that was your suggestion right, Shelly, originally yeah. So let's I think we should follow I think we should follow what Shelley's suggesting Shelley's had decades of experience working in this area. Robert others have too, but let's, let's get some more information and and start there yeah. There were certain things in place and maybe even under the legal situations going on certain things that would be helpful could be reestablished. So, let's work on it, okay, so any other new business, I'm not on the committee, but I'd like to just emphasize or re-emphasize something that mark Levine just said. If I may yeah sure I, you know first I think some people in the community are not aware that the meetings committee meetings are planned weeks and months in advance. Sometimes, there's a lag on emergent issues and now that we have Covid-19 numbers rising and Mark Levine just said that we are officially in our second wave I. Think it's important that we all redouble our efforts in each committee, but we're speaking in this committee, which is probably the most apropos committee for Health and human services regarding Covid-19 and I. Am we've learned a lot of lessons from the first wave and I am concerned that many of the issues that we experienced are going to happen again and it does cross over to all of our committees and business consumer issues, transportation and on so I. Just think. We should be really mindful that we're going to have some emergent issues upon us quickly and if we prepare for them, we can better handle them, and if they don't happen, then all the better I think that's an awesome point Doug and thank you for bringing that to our attention mark. What do you think of having like a meeting in December to kind of bring together public health experts to talk about like trends that are happening in the city and like Covid-19, related things since, as Doug said like it does cross different committees like a number of committees like what, if we had like a what, if, like we had a board full board meeting, wasn't just specific to one committee to kind of get information to invite like public health experts to speak? I'm happy to talk about the logistics of that, but it's not a simple thing to do so, both in terms of attracting the right experts and having a second full board meeting in a month. The and I don't want to lose track of what Courtney was offering in terms of an opportunity to discuss these issues as well. So I think we should plan agendas that give notice to the community for an opportunity to consider these things. So both of those are things that we can consider for future meetings. If I may just add that I think of this, you know in scale or analogous to an emergency room procedure where there's a triage right, so I think we should I actually said this early on in the Covid-19 crisis. That I think the board should think about this in a triage fashion, where what are the most emerging things happening today and possibly tomorrow, such as the need for testing I personally want to try to get tested and I. I'm caretaking elderly parents until I could not spend three and a half hours waiting online. So you know that's just my personal experience, but we have a huge problem with testing and so many other things, so we triage them out and prioritize them, because we have some emergencies that are upon us now. So maybe we could have like a wait. Maybe we could have like a meeting like a board. You know board organized meeting to invite speakers to talk about the testing issue like just as that's what mark raised is. He said like I, have like a lot of concerns, which makes so much sense about the test, positivity rate, because that's just looking at kind of the percentage of people who test positive of those who are tested, and it's so as opposed to like the case rate. So we can continue kind of thinking and talking about about how to do that. Thank you for raising that Doug. So further thoughts, I suggest that we do, since it is ten o'clock. I suggest that if there's further thoughts or ideas that we talk about this offline and are we talk, we continue talking and planning Shelley yeah I just want to add on the good neighbor policy. I've checked around about good neighbor policies. Is there one or many, and it seems that DHS requires it, but each shelter or each agency develops its own, so there might, but it has to be in writing. So I think it would be important if we had a copy of you know any of the shelters or or facilities that are required in the area, so that people can feel comfortable knowing what the rules are and that, if there's violations of the rules and everything that the providers can be spoken to by the community, I think it's a healthy thing. We have this in westfish we have people smoking under people's windows and the Montessori School across the street from the transitional shelter called us not to out of concern for our residents one hand who weren't some, who weren't wearing masks and then said by the way. There's smoking under my window and all we have to do is speak to the people and say this is the effect and that stopped and the neighbors provided more face masks. So there was a good feeling between the community, so I. Think and people know these good neighbor policies it work. It goes both ways, okay and it can be a constructive practice. So I think we should find out. You know, find out and I think they should be readily available. I think that might be helpful to the community. So that's so, maybe like you and Courtney and Mark and match whoever's interested, can look into that and then we can and then we could find out all right. So I, wanna, yeah I, just wanna say that this everyone who hung on for three hours you're very special good night. Can we end it? No, please. Someone has to make a motion to adjourn I make the motion. If someone's done it doesn't need a second all in favor aye. Everyone have a good night, whatever your thanksgiving is going to be just I. Think the best thing at this time of year is to think of those things that we are thankful for and even if the family extended family together or the amount of food or the type of food is not accessible, that the real message is thanks: giving thanks Kelly. Thank you and good night. Okay, all right.
