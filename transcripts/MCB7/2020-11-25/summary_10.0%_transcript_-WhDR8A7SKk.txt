My name is Catherine de Lazaro, I'm, the co-chair of the health and Human Services Committee, and I'm, going to talk about the agenda for tonight and some of the protocols in just a minute, but first I want to hand it over to my my co-chair Sheldon Vine who's, going to speak for a couple.
First, We are going to hear from speakers we're going to learn strategies for meeting the needs of those living outside or on the street, so we're really excited to have Lisa Lombardi with us from urban pathways.
Will each take 5 to 15 minutes to share their work for the purpose of educating us on strategies for meeting the needs of those living on the street.
First from the health and Human Services committee, calling on each person one at a time and Shelley's going to be chairing this discussion and then board members, and then, after that, members of the public, I'm gonna post.
I'd like to suggest that since we'll have all our speakers speak in order and not have questions in between to jot down questions, you may have for a particular speaker or for all of the speakers, and, If you think of in terms of questions, These are the people who are most familiar and spend a good part of their lives in work and dedication to the people who were discussing, and so we can learn from them.
And I think the safe havens are the key to as we talk about strategies and really helping with the homeless situation in the communities.
Most of our workers will have, let's say, a 1 to 12 ratio of clients, so that is where a client will come in off the street, go to a safe haven or a drop-in, and then, From that point, on, we will try to get that client ready for permanent housing and permanent housing is the key housing.
So we're not out there saying oh, come and do what you want, even though safe havens give you a lot of flexibility and you're able to come and go, but at the end of the day, most clients respond to good structure, good services, good management, as we also respond to being a good neighbor.
So, I, think those are the things we have to work: on, building more subsidies, building more local, low-income housing, which we've done.
And I strongly believe that, because you can't just pick certain neighborhoods and I'm, not saying you know, you don't want crime, I know people get frightened, but I strongly believe that we have to work on a plan to help have mixed housing.
We work together with our partner, agencies, God Riverside who's, also on the call and breaking ground, as well as our own Ccs team, to cover the entire island of Manhattan 24 hours, a day, seven days, a week, providing street outreach services and housing placement services to individuals living on the street.
We have teams providing you know that assistance in terms of case management, so helping people work on work towards permanent housing and a little bit more into that in a moment.
You know for people who maybe had situations where people haven't shown up for them in the past, So we work on housing.
While we're working on permanent housing, we work towards, You know, offers that offer people transitional housing options like the safe.
All of our teams have psychiatric providers that work with our teams, helping to both provide support around the housing process, but also to provide you know, assessment and treatment with individuals.
If they're open to that, as Lisa said, you know, We operate from harm reduction and housing first perspective, meaning that you know someone, substance, use or mental illness isn't a barrier to housing, and we want to bring people in and help.
We have a street medicine team made up of a registered nurse and a nurse practitioner and they're able to really connect people with medical care who maybe aren't open to connecting with traditional medical care or medical services in the community.
We stay connected with people for at least several months after they move into permanent housing, Just to ensure that the transition into their new environment is working for them, That, they're connected, if you know, they're, moved into permanent supportive housing of some kind if they're connected with their case, managers.
You know: we've been out there consistently out on the street, engaging people and trying to bring people inside continuing to provide support and services to our clients, helping you know, advise people about ways to stay safe, offering them PPE like masks and hand.
So I think I've covered all my bases in terms of the services of our program, but you know: I.
We started as a Wilson Industry school really to work and help women's vocational skills and over the years we've evolved and kind of grown and as a settlement we have a vast majority of service serving about 22,000 people across the entire lifespan, And so we have programs for the very young preschool services all the way through to senior services, and so we have 22 locations throughout Manhattan.
Think, to Lisa's point that just the sheer cost of housing in New York has grown to a level where the average person, sometimes just can't, make the rent, and so that we've been.
We think that part of our work is not just the delivery of the service, but also the fight for affordable housing, more broadly, and so we're still Larry would scream.
We have a law project that, with a team of lawyers who work to address what we call affirmative cases where there are challenges where landlords are attempting to push out people, particularly with it where there are sros or affordable, housing.
Then we have another 400 for permanent, supportive housing that has all the resources that Lauren talks about psychiatric services, case management services, as well as medical and clinical services that we partnered with Css to provide.
So then we have a team of people who work on advocacy because I think without advocacy we're never going to keep the pressure on to have resources for affordable, housing.
I'm going to turn it over to Kerry to talk about kind of what we're seeing and what those services look like, really as an add-on to Lauren's earlier comments about the mock, Kerry, hi, rod, hi, good evening.
As Lisa said, you know, Our goal is permanent housing and there is nothing that is better at the end of the day than when you meet someone on the street.
You know there might be folks that are ready to try a safe haven ready to try transitional housing, and you know we work as soon as possible to get them.
It's, where they feel comfortable, and there are so many folks more than a handful that are on the street and waiting for a placement, whether it's a safe haven, some other transitional, or, ideally, permanent housing.
And I think that there really is a need for again more safe havens, more transitional housing in the short term.
You know to move folks along into permanent housing and increasing folks access to different parts of the city, especially here on the Upper West side.
Again, You know, which has already been talked about the length of time that folks, it seems, are staying in safe havens or transitional housing has increased over the years.
I think that you know the need for more affordable housing, units.
And then you know you compound that with folks throughout Manhattan, with other outreach providers all vying for a very limited number of vacancies and affordable supportive housing, So I think that the real solution here ultimately is more safe, evens, more funding, more affordable, housing.
I, think you feel it in the community, especially because it is so residential is with public spaces, shutting down with libraries, closing and other you know.
Community resources, where folks, who are street homeless or not or housed, would spend much of their time during the day are no longer available and so I think folks are outside on the street and more present than they themselves might prefer to be I.
Don't, I think that, As far as you know, we run into a mixed bag of people that are on the street.
Those people are public, so I think in general that it is not that the city-wide at least from the way the city, council, numbers, I, hope count.
I think you are going to see a slight increase, I'm sure with the economy, but then you're going to see possibly a different homeless people been working, lose their jobs.
Other question is in terms of the safe haven about how many, in a given year or period of time, our people moved how many people in a year moved into permanent housing what percentage.
Think, the education and really meeting some homeless clients and getting such a different perspective of them will help tremendously.
People think they're not willing to do certain things: they're not willing to work.
I, don't know how many people know that 105th street there's a safe haven on a beautiful block that I can't afford to live on, so I mean it's incredible, they get meals, they get services and they get to go to permanent housing.
I saw someone asked in the chat what the numbers are in terms of people who are living on the street, and the speakers can correct me if I'm wrong, but the numbers that I remember and that I believe are cited in the district needs.
Okay, Committee members, Robert hi, just wanted to ask I, have a question, but I also wanted to comment that having done so much of this community based rehabilitation, work in the past I think it's a genuine testimony to the quality of the legislative community rehabilitation model that goes back to the 80s and the 70s, and that was certainly functional when I was in the late 80s and 90s and 2000, including the small units, the 20 unit, three supportive housing unit and so on, and the expansion of services and the calls that would come in from Omh. They will tell you open up 20 new beds, please, and we want 20 new beds in the Bronx.
We I used to manage the support, Ted housing level, every person and, Of course everyone had a you know axis one and so on, and there was a separation between axis two, which is substance, abuse and people with non access.
Yes, Now before Covid-19, a lot of religious institutions in the neighborhood had shelters at night places for people to sleep over or even just places to eat without I think most of them are closed.
You know people in off the street during this time into those some of those new options as well, but Maj I think you bring up a good point.
It's something that you know we've been very mindful of and helping to try to connect people with other options or some of the other services, especially around you know, like food distribution and things to make sure that you know people still have access to those resources, but then also simultaneously still trying to continue to motivate people to come inside and maybe get access to some of those services that you know might not be available in the same way that they were before.
You know we're just not sure what things are going to look like just yet in terms of Covid-19 and the pandemic, and all of that Rosa.
This is near and dear to my heart, because my ex-girlfriend was the assistant program director to project reach out with Goddard, so I used to come home to me every night we would discuss the successes and the trials and the tribulations and the just the great joy of finally hearing that this person accepted help and has now permanent housing.
I deal with some street homeless people on it like a daily basis and have a relationship, and the couple are members of my church and at least one is applied for help through Goddard.
You know we work with everybody with each individual with what their needs are, and sometimes that's varied, sometimes there's more difficulty obtaining something for somebody, maybe, for example, they're having a really hard time getting their birth certificate from for whatever reason, So we're working on those challenges.
Or might you know, take some time for somebody to move into permanent housing, but the team, you know, stays connected and stays involved and continues to support them, regardless of how long that takes and some of it some of its confidentiality, so be aware of that there is some level of that, and also I always tell the clients that we work.
Any other board members I just like to mention along those lines that I worked with someone for four years and right.
Think four people from the community that have filled out Catherine's sign up sheet exactly what I'd actually recommend is that we hear from Melissa, and.
So I want to be mindful of the fact that it is 8:15, So we are going to keep the public comments at a minute and a half, and then there's someone who's signed up to talk about something: That's not on the agenda, which is smoking.
When the police are involved, like what's the immediate impact on people who are street homeless, and is it helpful, I, think Carrie or at least.
You, know help and deal with if there is a crime or any kind of violence or anything like that, but what we try to do many times where what we call is Ems for Edp, emotionally disturbed person to help the person I.
So, it's, that is to me more challenging than mental health on many levels for different reasons, not that we can't do it, but we try, but many people start leave come go back and forth because that's the same thing: where, until I'm ready to deal with my addiction, I'm, going to kind of float.
You know that's something that I think really needs to be looked at by.
You know talk about my support for this work and support for this safe haven.
So I think it's incumbent upon all of us to build that trust, not just the people that are interacting directly but anyway, going back to as we succeed in getting people off the streets and into supportive, housing.
I'm curious where the handoff is or what the long-term plan is in terms of months and years, and keeping people and supporting people through working out their issues and dealing with their trauma and all the stresses that society brings to you longer term keeping people in housing and part of society.
And I do think that a lot of the work begins when someone has more permanency in their life of having a an apartment and some stabilization for themselves and I.
My program hasn't been had outraged, consortium, but I work for Ccs, and you know we also operate supportive housing across the city, both single adults from homeless, adults, families and a variety of you know.
Think that part of the outreach worker and safe Haven's role, while the person is in that environment, is kind of learning more about them.
What kind of supports they're going to need to be successful in permanent housing and helping set them up for that in advance as much as possible and connecting them to a service.
People are, in you know, kind of independent apartments and get services that maybe come to visit them versus other settings where their services on site in the building.
The reason why you know the outreach team stay involved for at least several months, if not longer, once somebody has moved into housing to really make sure that transition goes as smoothly as possible and that they're connected once they're in that new environment to people who can help provide them that ongoing support as they you know, move, you know as they stay in their permanent housing and maintain their housing.
I would like to let you know that fighting homelessness is not only taking people out of the streets into housing.
I just wanted to say that you know the discussion about providing services to individuals who are unsheltered really highlights the importance of something that I know was highlighted by this committee of you, know, safe haven, beds.
And so you know when we're trying to make the offer of giving people help it's so important that we actually have the right type of help to give.
Woods, say many times that you know if every unsheltered person accepted the offer from our outreach units right now, we don't have the bets to put them in and, So I, think really investing in one minute.
And, so I think really investing in you know, beds and beds in the right type of setting where people actually have privacy and have safety is so important, because I've heard so many times that a congregate, shelter setting often makes people feel less safe than they actually felt, You know actually being unsheltered and on the street, and.
You know I think that's so important that we actually invest in that shelter capacity and the right kind of shelter capacity where we have to interact with Gerson.
I'm, not sure which of you is the right person, but how do safe haven clients get prioritized for permanent housing relative to other single individuals who go into regular shelters because it's exciting to hear how quickly they can move through the system.
One of the concerns that people in this neighborhood have is what would be the unintended consequences of being a community where being a street homeless person can get you access to a safe haven, which sounds like a wonderful opportunity if we're putting in now another 50 or 60, which was the request that would move us to.
I, think like 80 or 90 beds on the Upper West side, If that's more than the number of street homeless, we have now.
That people, say, shelters, aren't safe, I, Think the issue there shelters are larger.
You know that there are many people who are accepting shelter rate and are utilizing the traditional shelter system and are moving into housing from you know that system, And I think the safe haven model and.
It is it's trying to have an option for people for whom that system, maybe wasn't working or isn't something that they're comfortable with whether that's you know, based on their own experiences, experiences that didn't have to do with the shelter system.
You've helped, since it's sensitized us to a certain degree and helped us understand the situation and the people who we consider street home was much better and we look forward to working together with you and support.
You know the community board supporting the work you do in any way we can moving forward, but I think you deserve a show of appreciation.
And I want to thank the presenters for coming, Don't feel, like you have to stay for the whole meeting.
It further resolves that community board 7 Manhattan calls on the mayor to include more robust, anti-hate crime and community resilience, curricula appropriate for in-person and remote learning in New, York, City schools, and we call on the Manhattan district attorney's hate crime unit to provide more educational outreach to schools, community groups and religious organizations on strategies for identifying and reporting hate crimes to law enforcement, as well as information on available resources and support.
So, we call on New York City to provide the Manhattan borough president's office with resources needed to provide additional diversity, equity and inclusion training in collaboration with the New York City Commission on human rights, They're, optional support for community boards to address issues specific to their boards and districts, development.
We wanted you to know what the work in progress was.
Anyone on the committee would be interested in in presenting and talking and going to a borough board meeting and sharing these more widely with Shelley and me.
Sat. This one out, I'm volunteering Shelly and pull and removing myself, but I think it would be great if somebody from if somebody people from the committee did it and not just the chairs, anyone interested you don't have to, of course, and if you're not sure now you can always right.
Member of the center for climate change, health and equity of the American Public Health Association, okay, because I think that's helpful for people to understand your standing and possibly that you could reach out to the agencies that you're associated with the associations for support.
I, texted him and Mark is trying to connect with him, but I think it's very exciting that he wanted to hear this.
We are going to need new policy to get moving in the right direction, again, and there is no doubt that the amount of added sugar that we all consume is a major driver of obesity and other health problems, and we have something of a guidepost here on a successful strategy, because New York City has already added important information to our menus in chain, They've been quite successful and I think quite popular with the public, and we want to follow on that success by giving New York diners the power of information.
As for you, know, reopening of the schools, I think that we should prioritize children with special needs, including district 75 children in temporary housing, which is a shelter but other similar situations and and then, ultimately, When it comes to broader population, I would say elementary school kids, we've.
Okay, So my question is: can you be a little more specific I think we all agree with you in terms of the order of priorities, although I'm not sure how you can specify just that people in a shelter get to school, you have to open the whole school for that to happen.
This is like a number one priority for all of our families, that we have to figure out how to get our kids in school, so our parents can go to work and you talk about people.
And I know that there is disagreement regarding the use of hotels as temporary, shelters, but I think we can all agree that it would be helpful to find a way to improve the situation by addressing the concerns and helping ease community pensions, while the courts do their work.
A lot of these things were able to be addressed, perhaps suggesting to the for our president to reconvene the working group and to have that type of communication that had started and seemed to be effective.
I think we should deal with it and solve the problems between whoever it's between at this point, so that things work right.
I. You know first I think some people in the community are not aware that the meetings committee meetings are planned weeks and months in advance, Sometimes, there's a lag on emergent issues, and now that we have Covid-19 numbers rising and Mark Levine just said that we are officially in our second wave.
Do you think of having like a meeting in December to kind of bring together public health experts to talk about like trends that are happening in the city and like Covid-19, related things since, as Doug said, like it does cross different committees like a number of committees like what.
You know board organized meeting to invite speakers to talk about the testing issue like just as that's what mark raised.
Know any of the shelters or or facilities that are required in the area, so that people can feel comfortable knowing what the rules are and that, If there's violations of the rules and everything that the providers can be spoken to by the community, I think it's a healthy, thing.
I, Think and people know these good neighbor policies.
