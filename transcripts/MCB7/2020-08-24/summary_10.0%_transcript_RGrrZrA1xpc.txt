It'll be dhs, followed by the service providers, followed by inspector yaguchi from the 24th precinct, who will be speaking on behalf of both the 20th and the 24th precincts then, depending on time principal monica I may take her out of sequence, then remarks by elected officials and and then we'll go to the stakeholder groups, which will include goddard, riverside the upper west ciders for safer streets, the open hearts initiative, the west side, community organization, two block associations, two faith, leaders, a co-op, condo board and then mark There are any questions of fact in there we will repose them and give dhs and the service providers a chance to answer them.
Welcome to our information session concerning the use of local hotels in our district for the protection of homeless, shelter, clients who were housed elsewhere to protect them from Covid-19 The purpose of this meeting is for the public to hear directly from our from the department of homeland services and from the service providers in three of the hotels on the decisions made and the operations underway, and how that all works and I.
Thank you mark and thank you to the community board, to our elected officials and to everybody participating this evening to have you know over a thousand participants really says something in terms of individuals wanting to get information about the work that the city is doing to protect vulnerable new yorkers and also learn more about the services that we're providing I'm joined this evening by two colleagues by the Manhattan borough, director, leilani irvin, and our associate commissioner of adult services, yvonne ballard If I can I'd like to take a moment and sort of walk the audience and participants through the work that dhs has done over the course of these past couple of months to contextualize the conversation that we're going to have I think it will provide some information and possibly answer questions that are coming We started very early on when we were learning that this pandemic was unfolding of really working with our colleagues at health and hospitals at the department of health and mental hygiene.
This capacity allowed us to take individuals who either had tested positive for Covid-19 or experience Covid-19 like symptoms We didn't have access to testing, and so we had to use a symptoms-based approach and a presumed positive to really make sure that we were taking care of the totality of our shelter system, and so that meant, if individuals were presenting with symptoms, we were able to remove them from those congregate settings place them in an isolation hotel until their symptoms subsided, thereby making sure that we were treating them as well as the shelter system as a whole At the end of march, we started weekly commissioner, calls with our electeds our cbo partners, and our providers.
If we go back to march, the situation looked very different in terms of accessing the things that both our providers needed, as well as our clients, we were able to secure PPE we're able to secure cloth, face coverings and making sure that is provided to our clients towards the end of march Top of our excuse me in the beginning of april, in addition to the isolation capacity that we set up, we started de-densifying our hotel, our shelters, moving individuals into commercial hotels, We started that effort by focused on clients who were over 70, and then we continued that exercise.
It's not just moving the clients, they also moved their program, their social service staff, their security staff into the hotels as well to make sure that our clients, irrespective of where they were located, still had the availability of case management of housing, specialists of connections to mental health, to telehealth, to substance, use counseling and those sorts of things, as well as the opportunity to you know, continue to engage with staff.
If need be In the hotter months, we've made sure that they have access to water One of the things that I think you and I might not be so attuned to, but the public spaces and the ways in which individuals use spaces has changed very significantly during the Covid-19 outbreak right, so many locations were closed, whether they be gyms or libraries, coffee shops, grocery stores, all types of things.
What are called our drop-in centers drop-in centers are a critical tool for our street outreach team The street We began utilizing two of them in may, and then one in july, This required a staggered response, as we had to move clients out of the congregate locations into the commercial hotels So. That way, we could, as we were, moving work to also ensure the safety of our clients, as well as the staff and everybody else As of august 18th.
That includes 400 Excuse me 104 deaths, which is tragic, but we know that by moving new yorkers into the commercial hotels, we were able to save lives, Our essential staff who showed up to work each day and we've been working with our communities to address issues that some of you have raised that have been raised through the community board that have been raised directly with providers and are glad that we've had the opportunity to have a couple of stakeholder meetings where we've heard from our elected partners from community boards from bids and other stakeholders in the community and then to be able to respond to some of those things.
We've been able to remind people that if they see somebody who is experiencing homelessness and they're interested in getting some assistance to that individual to call 3-1-1 That occurs on the upper west side by goddard riverside through our Manhattan outreach consortium, the locations in and around the three hotels that we are using for our d density efforts are canvased regularly multiple times a day across multiple shifts.
Also, your neighbor I've lived on the upper west side for 23 years in an apartment, I own, just five blocks from the lucerne and I, and our staff are committed to working together with all the community leaders here to help our neighborhood and all of new york recover I'm joined here tonight by my colleagues, kaydon grinnell.
We're all worried about a second wave of Covid-19 in the fall We are here to work with you for as long as we are a part of this community thanks I'm, a senior vice president here at help We have a number of people at help on the call help you say, we've been operating, we've been operating since 1986 We provide shelter and programs and permanent housing in over 65 different program, shelter and housing capacities serving over 4 000 people daily We move and in new york city alone we run 12 shelters for single homeless men and women When.
The coalition for the homeless put out a report at the end of June, estimating that, during the height of the pandemic from march until the end of may memorial day weekend that about 200 per 100 000 new yorkers at estimated to have passed away from coburn All new yorkers for sheltered homeless So we were right in the middle from being about halfway between all new yorkers and all sheltered new yorkers for all homeless, new yorkers We feel like we've done as good a job as we can do in protecting our clients and staff I know for many of you on the on the zoom call as well who work with people in any capacity how difficult these decisions were, and still are march april and may, as we all know, was a very difficult time, but without our ability to empty out our shelters, The. Other critical decision that we made kind of fast-forwarding is that we did not close any of our shelters.
I started at a synagogue, angie hessed on 100 in west hunter street in west end I started doing overnights with folks who are homeless much to my parents, horror, which only made it better for me in some ways, and it really launched my career of public service I'm an out of borough kid, the sense of public service and where I grew up on staten island I learned about public service by and large from the upper west side, I moved from that volunteer experience, I moved to god of herbicide in another volunteer experience, I worked at four different places on the upper west side for about eight or nine years in my twenties, and it only launched my career and kept me going in homeless services for the ensuing 15 years thereafter, So I'm really appealing to all of the all the great comments and all the well wishing and all what people want to do like the list that I just provided There are things that we need from the community again in order to end our clients, time of homelessness.
Thank you for having me here tonight, so I actually have had the opportunity to meet with both project renewal and with help USA separately, along with the principle of ps9, to talk about what we can do just to ensure that we are all feeling safe in this situation, and so we discussed what we do in terms of the patrolling around the area, because I know that there has been concerns about people gathering in our play yard and things of that nature.
We have numbers to call if there's anything that is going on, so we can reach out right away to talk to security to help us, so we definitely have been working with both organizations to make sure that we are doing all that we can, while school is in session to make sure the kids are safe, The one area that we haven't been able or the one office we haven't been able to get in contact with yet is with the 20th precinct Do know that you know there is so much that the security can do from the agencies, but then there's also just the idea of if there are police patrols to help like I said both agencies with both of the organizations we'd also like to have a conversation with the 20th precinct to talk about added protection that could come to our school to help us in maintaining the safety and security of the members of our community I guess, because it's in person and remote and then blended and I'm gonna go turn now back to our service providers and the third one is cucs and hi.
Actually doing organizing in the single room, occupancy hotels at the time and and in some ways, This is reminiscent of that right because we're talking about people who are in many cases down now and looking to make a better life for themselves and Cucs has 30 programs across the city that emphasize housing and restorative health and mental health services for homeless and formerly homeless, individuals and families, though what they look like is street outreach, The, full continuum of street outreach, shelters, safe havens, We do a lot of supportive housing for individuals and families, and we also have a partly because of our genesis at the university have a very substantial national training program.
We train 15 000 staff per year in best practice around homeless people, and this includes the NYPD We. Do the training for the NYPD on crisis intervention when they do respond to edp calls All in ucs serves about 50 000 people annually on may 21st, we relocated our 100 and what bed shelter in the Bronx to the bel nord hotel It was prior to testing, but we figured we had at least 20 Covid-19 cases at that point and in a congregate setting it's impossible to manage that and it's a threat for everybody in that shelter and it's a threat for the residential neighborhood that we resided in We've acted upon our good neighbor policy and- Both eric and daniel, have mentioned the being supported by the community.
I've spoken to many of you on the phone about general things about client concerns and we're trying very hard to we're, trying very hard to address any concerns that people have and being very responsive to that and I would echo what what eric and daniel said about moving people out and I say that, because my experience in the Bronx and working with the community there is that when we start to move our clients out into permanency, we create the type of situation where they're invested in shelter.
And I think that kind of that kind of tangible benefit and that kind of tangible result is one of the things that I point to as being the progress we've made since we've moved in sort of getting ourselves situated, responding to the community concerns, responding to our clients, concerns and being the type of good neighbor that we have been in the Bronx for many years and I think that we're getting towards being on the upper west side, like I , said I'm at the site most days.
I just want to say that I, with the recent attention on all these homeless, shelters and hotels, I hope we have try to put a lot of cops out there on broadway, but a little bit more presence to counter some of the unpleasant things that the residents of the upper west side has seen Just.
It's up on social media, it's going to be on our website and it certainly has been in our newsletters and I am upset, because if, in fact, the city moves people into hotels without telling the community no not to go into the hotel, but you got to plan and right now we're in a situation where there's not a lot for the individuals to do during the day We have been trying to work on that at the lucerne at the belclair, the bell north, and we are working with some local providers to try to change that That is a concern.
I know that the security staff is going around to the different hotels, particularly at the lucerne I, have been begging, dhs for more support, so that people would know who's from which hotel and who is the individual working with goddard and the outreach I haven't been successful yet, but I think there might be one glimmer of hope to get more support.
I got the entire borough and I know all the problems that was in midtown two and a half hours a day, walking around same issues same problem and I wish that we could figure out as a society that people have the kind of challenges and I understand the need for Covid-19 be more secure in terms of not being in congregate, shelters , I've been working in this area for a very long time.
I. Think many of those comments have to do with the street homeless and, unfortunately, goddard riverside outreach is not on this town hall tonight, but we are actually oh great We need many more resources on the street to make sure that we are helping our street homeless actually agree to come in to shelter So. How can we make sure that everyone feels safe on our streets and how can we make sure that the people living in the shelters are getting the services they need?
They worked to build a community It took many years, and here we all are, but the Covid-19 19 pandemic has changed life for all of us, sheltered or not in a very short period of time, and the changes have been significant for many people's lives, incomes, housing situations and the future feels and is uncertain , Those who've been laid off and my office has helped thousands of people get their unemployment from the state department of labor and people struggling to pay, rent and feed their families.
Given the fact that elected officials didn't know us, so we have to learn from that, but in this in this situation, I'm gonna get out of the way, because there's a lot of a lot of very constructive comments that I know the community is willing to share But I do have a question about what the time horizon is going to look like what your epidemiologists or the department of health says is the figure for when it's safe for these men and women to return to congregate, housing, So, much senator I, don't see.
, I have been a senior executive at a local children's hospital and previously worked for a non-profit, supportive housing provider based in harlem and I've also been an auxiliary police officer for the last seven years We fully understand the city's plan to move these individuals to stop the spread of Covid-19 and agree that it was necessary in the middle of a pandemic, to save the lives of people who have nowhere else to go, but in the interest of full disclosure, the percentage of people with Covid-19 in the city is currently under one percent and has been for over two months now, and we really would like to understand what metrics will determine when this emergency will be considered over first as members of the community, we do intend to be good.
The police and members of the community So much I'm, going to turn immediately to carrie goldwyn, who is with the goddard riverside homeless, outreach group, carrie I'm the program director with uptown goddard's homeless, outreach team Our teams cover the upper west side, We work with folks that are street homeless that are staying on the street, with the ultimate goal of getting them into permanent housing along the way we seek to place folks into transitional housing and provide a range of services, including connecting folks with benefits, medical care, psychiatric services, substance abuse treatment through other providers and ongoing case management.
Engaging new folks and offering services Upper west siders for safer streets is a non-partisan facebook group that was formed by residents and local business owners out of collective concern for safety in our neighborhood, the facebook group was has provided a forum for information sharing and collaboration and solutions to address our concerns.
These men were placed undeveloped in close proximity ps to a ps87 It, wasn't until the community raised awareness of this issue that something was done about it as of today, nys sex offender registry reports, two level two and two level Three offenders living at the hotel, el claire, the character of our neighborhood has changed enough for the better There have been countless incidents of certain reported of public urination, severe public intoxication public heart drug use and an increase in drug deals taking place on our streets, as well as a variety of forms of harassment, including cat calling and aggressive panhandling In addition to the hotel, shelter residents have not been consistently being wearing mask or social distancing in keeping new york state guidelines for Covid-19 prevention.
The current situation affects everyone in our neighborhood, including the most vulnerable population, the homeless people who have been failed by the city by being left out on the streets or placing hotels with adequate social services and facilities to address their varied and complex needs.
Thank you for giving us a moment to tell our community about the upper west side, open hearts initiative, we're grateful for the work of the experienced and dedicated service providers that, as an emergency public health measure, have temporarily relocated to neighborhood hotels, As tonight's representatives have explained services provided in the hotels are identical to those that would be offered to in an ordinary shelter environment or any other temporary location.
We have written an open letter to city and state officials on this matter, and you can learn more about our work and join our initiatives at www We're, not asking for your money, but we would be grateful for your time and help So much returning to west side, community organization and megan martin.
What has occurred on the upper west side is to replace one public health crisis with another The upper west side is known as a welcome and diverse community in a short period and without any transparency, a large at-risk homeless population was relocated to three local hotels ill-equipped to serve their needs.
The mayor himself admitted when this policy was implemented, that hotels are not The answer and many homeless advocates have noted that, in the case of micah shelter, clients, temporary hotel housing may create significant community problems, as well as fail to provide appropriate services to this at-risk population.
We're already dealing with the pandemic, People working from home people have lost their jobs, seeing local merchants struggling to stay open to serve the community and seeing many of our favorite stores close their doors forever Now. We have the addition of the homeless men in this shelter.
It is the time we aim to set ourselves on the right path, as the community meets to discuss the temporary use of shelters in the upper west side, neighborhood Have we been showing ourselves to be the people we profess and hope to be of people who believe in opportunity, diversity and inclusion?
Is our city and state working to prevent drug use or provide adequate support for those who want to turn their lives around and perhaps most of all, what does the amount of people without homes in new york city say about our social safety, net?
I represent the boards of conducts and condominiums of the upper west side, and if I can just summarize two poets number one, there is a starking difference between what officials presented to us today with reality and what actual our neighbors feel and see in the streets and the second message I would like to say on behalf of other board members that we see exerters of our neighbors from this neighborhood and the recent development with moving these homeless People, actually accelerated that movement and I've been hearing that people are concerned about the schools and people with families moving out and with them, local businesses losing their clients and we're losing revenue from taxes, sales, taxes from property taxes, small businesses, losing customers and their employees become unemployed, and we can see more and more vacant real estate in our neighborhood.
but I thought it was important to hear from our community organizations who asked to speak We're going to jump right into that, and so the first question there were a lot of questions around the duration, the length and so forth, and the question These hotels be used for permanent shelter after the temporary uses is concluded, That in effect, in effect, fair share is the suggestion that there are many more of these kinds of operations and facilities on the upper west side than there are in certain other communities.
Seven for numbers in terms of individuals placed in community districts, The upper west side does have other locations that are used to house or shelter homeless, new yorkers, it falls sort of like in the mix of where the city is, and if you could address the concerns of folks, especially parents of children in a residential community that is, that is being shared with multiple sex offenders and of different levels.
This means is individuals are able to get connected to programs and services that there's not restrictions on who and how people can come into the shelter based on their background, they're able to rebuild their lives and get a second chance, as opposed to being out in the street If you compare new york city compared to la you, see a stark difference in the numbers of new yorkers experiencing homelessness on the street compared to those in shelter who are connected to case management, housing specialists, substance use, counselors and other resources to get a second chance and to get back on their feet.
There have been concerns about homeless encampments and the regular presence of non-shelter client homeless in as being a part of the daily occurrence or experience on the street and as well as verbally aggressive behavior toward women and questions as to why they are permitted to remain and I'll certainly look to the providers who can fill in the work that they're doing in the community.
That's number one in terms of the second thing: It includes a large pool of people, so to speak, it's hard for us to narrow it down unless there's like a specific, distinct characteristic that they're able to provide us The last thing that I would want is for you to be taking a photo or trying to take a video and that enrages the this individual even further and now you're putting yourself in danger of getting hurt physically The third thing: is: We are not allowed to go into shelters and just start searching their rooms, Obviously the shelter itself or may have certain policies in place that would allow for that search.
I do I do deep compliance when they walk out of the hotel, taking their masks off and There's been a lot of success with that, but there are limitations as well and I want to address the sex offender issue no level two or level three offenders, no residency, restricted sex offenders of the belclair chair, I'm happy to provide more information with the community like it In regard to testing There are a number of questions that were posed about the criteria for when populations would be moved back from hotels and why these hotels were chosen in the first place, In the neighborhood of residents that were proximate to schools and so forth.
You know I've been on the upper west side, probably over 30 years and I work for community board.
There was far more supportive housing homeless, shelters on the upper west side than any other community district and I really just want to emphasize that Secondly I want to say that the Covid-19 numbers, the increase in kovid, has been for the past month below one percent.
