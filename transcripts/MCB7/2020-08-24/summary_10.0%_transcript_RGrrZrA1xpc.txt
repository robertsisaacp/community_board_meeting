And, then we'll go to the stakeholder groups, which will include goddard, Riverside, the upper west ciders for safer streets, the open hearts initiative, the West Side Community organization, two block associations, two faith: leaders, a co, op, condo Board and then mark You're going to back clean, up.
We've got a long agenda, there's Christian If they're, attendees and they're meant to be panelists from the community board, maybe they could contact rich or christian by phone And it's going to take a while for 2,000 people to join Do. We have names of the people from the service providers or DHS?
Welcome to our information session concerning the use of local hotels in our district for the protection of homeless, shelter, clients who were housed elsewhere to protect them from Covid-19.
The purpose of this meeting is for the public to hear directly from our from the Department of Homeland services and from the service providers in three of the hotels on the decisions made and the operations underway, and how that all works.
But we're going to ask everybody to keep it to two to three minutes other than the DHS and the service providers, because we're here to hear from them That's how this is intended to work.
You mark and thank you to the community board, to our elected officials and to everybody participating this evening to have you know: Over a thousand participants really says something in terms of individuals wanting to get information about the work that the city is doing to protect vulnerable new yorkers and also learn more about the services that we're providing.
This evening, they've really been at the front line of the response in terms of providing programs and services and really making sure that new yorkers, who have no place else to go really are connected, really are essential services during exact steps.
If I can I'd like to take a moment and sort of walk the audience and participants through the work that DHS has done over the course of these past couple of months to contextualize the conversation that we're going to have, I think it will provide some information and possibly answer questions that are coming and so Wanna.
There is congregate, meals and recreation area, and these spaces are the ones that we focused on as it related to the relocation and consideration for the use of what we call the de- densifying hotels, to ensure that we're protecting the health and safety of our clients.
We did not have access to testing, and so we had to use a symptoms- based approach and a presumed positive to really make sure that we were taking care of the totality of our shelter system, and so that meant, if individuals were presenting with symptoms, we were able to remove them from those congregate settings place them in an isolation hotel until their symptoms subsided, thereby making sure that we were treating them as well as the shelter system.
Top of our excuse me in the beginning of April, in addition to the isolation capacity that we set up, we started De- densifying, our hotel, our shelters, moving individuals into commercial hotels.
So that way, the agency could focus on serving our clients and we worked with providers to match them to hotels based on you know the size of the shelter that they were serving and how they were going to move those clients into the commercial hotel, the provider.
They also moved their program, their social service, staff, their security staff into the hotels as well to make sure that our clients, irrespective of where they were located, still had the availability of case management of housing, specialists, of connections to mental health, to telehealth, to substance, use, counseling and those sorts of things, as well as the opportunity to you.
Also continued our work on the streets in terms of ensuring that individuals who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness also had access to information to PPE.
The hotter months, we've made sure that they have access to water, one of the things that I think you and I might not be so attuned to, but the public spaces and the ways in which individuals use spaces has changed very significantly.
We've made sure that our outreach staff are informed on the locations of public restrooms that are available to ensure that clients who might be on the street know where to access those locations.
But we know that by moving new yorkers into the commercial hotels, we were able to save lives.
I know that each of the providers are going to have an opportunity to speak later, but I wanted to give a couple of examples of the things that we've been able to respond to and that I think, are important.
We have regular canvasing that occurs on the upper West side by goddard Riverside through our Manhattan outreach consortium, the locations in and around the three hotels that we are using for our d density efforts are canvased regularly, multiple times a day, acrosss, multiple shifts.
The homeless outreach unit was disbanded, and we now are very much focused on ensuring that we're leading with our social services tools that we're working with clients to engage them, that we continue to focus on meeting the social services needs of our clients, rather than using a heavy- handed enforcement.
And I and our staff are committed to working together with all the community leaders here to help our neighborhood and all of New York Recover.
You may not know much about project renewal because until July 27th we did not have a presence in this neighborhood we've been serving homeless new yorkers for over 53 years today, we house over 2000 people, every night, half in seven shelters and half in permanent, supported housing, we've built or rehabbed.
We made that strategic decision, because we recognized very clearly that the upper West side was a much more residentially dead and dense neighborhood, and so we wanted to act as good neighbors right from the get- go.
We need access to more employment Now we have clients working at places like Sephora the New York Times.
I worked at four different places on the upper West side for about eight or nine years in my twenties, and it only launched my career and kept me going in homeless services for the ensuing 15 years.
There are things that we need from the community again in order to end our clients, time of homelessness.
So we definitely have been working with both organizations to make sure that we are doing all that we can, while school is in session to make sure the kids are safe, the one area that we have not been able or the one office we have not been able to get in contact with yet is with the 20th, precinct, and I guess our question for them would be: what role will they be playing in patrolling as well?
Both agencies, with both of the organizations we'd, also like to have a conversation with the 20th precinct, to talk about added protection that could come to our school to help us in maintaining the safety and security of the members of our community.
Cucs has 30 programs acrosss the city that emphasize housing and restorative health and mental health services for homeless, and formerly homeless, individuals and families, though, what they look like is street outreach.
It was prior to testing, but we figured we had at least 20 Covid-19 cases at that point and in a congregate setting it's impossible to manage that It's a threat for everybody in that shelter, It's a threat for the residential neighborhood that we resided in, We've, acted upon our good neighbor policy.
I think it was like Tony, said very disruptive to everybody, and we've worked very hard on trying to address the community.
He has my cell phone number and we've been working with trying to create a great partnership with them, and I'd like to thank him and all the officers for the help that we've gotten from them, and I've also put out my number and people have reached out to me.
And I say that, because my experience in the Bronx and working with the community there is that when we start to move our clients out into permanency, we create the type of situation where they're invested in shelter, they're invested in what we're doing and they're invested in the community Responding to the community concerns responding to our clients, concerns and being the type of good neighbor that we have been in the Bronx for many years.
In fact, the city moves people into hotels without telling the community No not to go into the hotel, but you got to plan and right now we're in a situation where there's not a lot for the individuals to do during the day.
I know that the security staff is going around to the different hotels, particularly at the Lucerne Do they work?
DHS for more support, so that people would know who's from which hotel and who is the individual working with goddard and the outreach.
And I know all the problems that was in Midtown two and a half hours, a day, walking around same issues same problem, and I wish that we could figure out as a society that people have the kind of challenges, and I understand the need for Covid-19 be more secure in terms of not being in congregate, shelters.
We need many more resources on the street to make sure that we are helping our street homeless actually agree to come in to shelter.
How can we make sure that everyone feels safe on our streets and how can we make sure that the people living in the shelters are getting the services they need?
It took many years, and here we all are, but the Covid-19 pandemic has changed life for all of us, sheltered or not in a very short period of time, and the changes have been significant for many people's lives, incomes, housing situations and the future feels and is uncertain, and I've heard that sentiment from so many of you over the last several months.
I always say this communities need to be in on what is going on the city and the state at times can not just place people without in a community without getting communities to be part of making it work, and no one learns their lesson, and this keeps happening maybe after this it won't.
But I do have a question about what the time horizon is going to look like what your epidemiologists or the Department of Health says, is the figure for when it's safe for these men and women to return to congregate, housing.
My name is Adam Herbs, I'm, a resident of the upper West side for the last 20 years, and tonight, I'll, be speaking on behalf of Manhattan day school school in the community.
I would like to thank the entire community board for inviting me to speak this evening and for facilitating this working group of schools and also expressed my most sincere appreciation to the providers and to the police and the 20th and 24th precincts for everything they do to keep us all.
, I have been a senior executive at a local children's hospital and previously worked for a non- profit, supportive housing provider based in Harlem And I've also been an auxiliary police officer for the last seven years.
We fully understand the city's plan to move these individuals to stop the spread of Covid-19 and agree that it was necessary in the middle of a pandemic, to save the lives of people who have nowhere else to go, but in the interest of full disclosure.
The percentage of people with Covid-19 in the city is currently under one percent and has been for over two months now, and we really would like to understand what metrics will determine when this emergency will be considered over first as members of the community, we do intend to be good.
Many parents have experienced homelessness before in the city, but this increased homeless situation that we're dealing with now has caused major alarm, a loss of safety and security, and many people are looking to leave the neighborhood and somehow already have due to the increased harassment.
We propose a work group between the city and the DHS and the service providers.
We work with folks that are street homeless that are staying on the street, with the ultimate goal of getting them into permanent housing along the way we seek to place folks into transitional housing and provide a range of services, including connecting folks with benefits, medical, care, psychiatric services, substance, abuse, treatment through other providers and ongoing case management.
My name is Lorena Marus, I'm, a hispanic citizen Upper west siders for safer streets is a non, partisan facebook group that was formed by residents and local business owners out of collective concern for safety in our neighborhood, the Facebook group was has provided a forum for information sharing and collaboration and solutions to address our concerns.
In the span of a few months, our community has fallen prey to a number of incidents that we have not experienced in the upper West side in recent memory, such as unprovoked attacks and vandalism to residence, cars and local businesses.
In addition, DHS placed 19 level 2 and level 3 sex offenders into temporary shelters without community notice or transparency.
In addition to the hotel, shelter residents have not been consistently being wearing mask or social distancing in keeping New York state guidelines for Covid-19 prevention.
The current situation affects everyone in our neighborhood, including the most vulnerable population, the homeless, people who have been failed by the city by being left out on the streets or placing hotels with adequate social services and facilities to address their varied and complex.
Thank you for giving us a moment to tell our community about the upper West side, open hearts, initiative, we're grateful for the work of the experienced and dedicated service providers that, as an emergency public health measure, have temporarily relocated to neighborhood hotels.
The upper West side is known as a welcome and diverse community in a short period and without any transparency, a large at- risk homeless population was relocated to three local hotels, ill- equipped to serve their needs.
Temporary hotel housing may create significant community problems, as well as fail to provide appropriate services to this at- risk.
We are asking our local officials to fix the failed homeless hotel policy that has put both the men and community at risk.
The city instead moved more homeless residents into another commercial hotel in Brooklyn.
It is the time we aim to set ourselves on the right path, as the community meets to discuss the temporary use of shelters in the upper West side, neighborhood.
We are taught because we never know if we might be one of the people who one day need that same charity, and we want to promote a cycle of giving being homeless is not a crime, and it is not a personal failure.
It is vital that we work with the shelter providers to support them in their needs to serve the population, including more outreach workers to support their mission.
Is our city and state working to prevent drug use or provide adequate support for those who want to turn their lives around and perhaps most of all?
We are actively engaged in work, both with homeless individuals and also with a number of other residents trying to prevent additional people from experiencing homelessness.
What we can do to support the residents of these shelters and also what we can do to get to a healthier conversation about safety for these new residents and safety for a long time and ongoing residents of the West side, we're very interested in that, And, so I just offer our whatever resources and help that we can offer to the situation, which is not ideal.
I know that if any community can figure this out, we can I've been working on the issue of homelessness and affordable housing about 35 years.
You know people that we have in our in these hotels, they're, going through the most difficult time in their entire lives.
Shelters we've been able to do so because we've been able to de- densify those locations by moving people to commercial hotels.
The upper West side does have other locations that are used to house or shelter homeless, New Yorkers.
The city of New York places all of our clients in appropriate locations in accordance with state law, and we provide shelter to new Yorkers experiencing homelessness, irrespective of their background.
This means is individuals, are able to get connected to programs and services that there's not restrictions on who and how people can come into the shelter based on their background, they're able to rebuild their lives and get a second chance, as opposed to being out in the street.
You see a stark difference in the numbers of new yorkers experiencing homelessness on the street compared to those in shelter who are connected to case management, housing, specialists, substance, use, counselors and other resources to get a second chance and to get back on their feet.
We've heard a lot of questions about aggressive behavior, and this is where we have a confluence of shelter, clients and of street homeless.
We constantly observe and monitor 311 to see where the new hotspot locations are, but it's also important for community members to know that after you flag that individual to us, the engagements do not stop.
New York is our most vulnerable population on the street, to care services and shelter.
It is a challenge, but it is something that I do know and can confirm that providers are constantly a driving home to every client that walks out of the door of the shelter, sites.
Sorry, the commercial hotel sites and any provider would like to jump in specifically to touch on what you all are doing inside of shelter to ensure clients Are being reminded on why it's important that we're face covering that they exit the sites.
And I want to address the sex offender issue , No level, two or level three offenders, no residency, restricted sex offenders of the Belclair chair, I'm happy to provide more information with the community like it.
We could not agree more and things and the service providers help us with what shelter clients need that the community could donate or provide that was.
Think the community would like to know that confirmation We need to really be careful that sense of physics.
We know that a permanent place is the best option for people, but we also know that we have to work in partnership that we all are working towards a day where I no longer have a job working to provide information to communities around homeless, shelters, but homeless.
There was far more supportive housing, homeless, shelters on the upper West side than any other community, district, and I really just want to emphasize that.
And then I might ask Kadan to jump in if you have, if you have something else to say, we've transferred 18 people in the last four weeks out of the Lucerne and back to shelter to other locations, because either because of repeated unwillingness to abide by the good neighbor policy or because they simply you know, were not willing and able to function well in the hotel, environment.
If we transfer someone they're going to another location, we have definitely found that people appreciate our clients, appreciate being in the hotel and most of them.
So I echo Iran's concern and ask Ms drinkwater to just give us a projected timeline as to when the pandemic motivated moves will be undone and the second question I would like a yes or no answer as to whether this administration has any intent to make any of these hotels, a permanent homeless, housing , This is reliant on data.
What I can commit to is regular communication with this community and any other community who is asking for information, Mr Adolf on your question and respect to does the city have any plans to make these permanent shelters not at this time?
