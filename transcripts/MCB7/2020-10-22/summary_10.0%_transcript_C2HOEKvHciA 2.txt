So, while Corey is working on shoring up the talent house, did people see that the park 79 hotel is going to be converted into residences for low- income seniors It's on my block.
As you can see, here, we I am going to prepare a a set of a presentation on the development story and lessons learned of Riverside, South and Riverside center, and what I should tell you is that I already a year, ago, actually September 2019, I had been invited to go to come In New, York, big development, and they asked for a panel about talking about what have we learned from older, ones, and I gave a talk on Riverside south of Riverside, Et cetera and the same panel Stan Extra talked about Battery, Park, City, so, okay.
Said that this was such a great thing and she wanted to do it with the community for it, and I began to talk to sema at the time, because I thought it was just terrific to have sema who was knowledgeable and knows about planning, but also did not have the history.
Looking project, It is a great way to do it, and there are many people, and I think there is How did it happen and how is it working out and November 18th?
It'll take the place of the of the November land use committee meeting, so we'll recommend that everybody tune into that instead, I'm eager for those of you who may have particularly more interested We very rarely go back to major endeavors that the board was involved with and look at what happened and learn from the history, and I think this is a great opportunity for everybody.
You, know Max an hour, probably less, and to have people with questions, of course, I do reference the first projects and the attempts- May I add one sentence, because I see Louisa and Melissa here and one of the perhaps very one, interesting component of this long history is that the their the board always tried to advocate for affordable housing, as in the long struggle of Riverside south, but quickly.
Is that Riverside center, so many years, later, that the approvals that occurred were to have inclusionary housing and to do the measurement by far so that that's something to look at as to the numbers of units and so on, and I'm really highlighting that, because I'm seeing the two co- chairs and what developed- And it may be, something that you might want to take a look at and what was learned and the same quality in the affordable, apartments.
You know what have we learned, but I also want to suggest to you eventually that it may be that this treasure trove, so much from the Community, Board, You know months ago, because I knew all about the history of Lincoln towers, and, of course, but you know this may be eventually an archive that I know the New York historical society has called me just separately to say they are interested in the work of the community.
I do not know how many of you know this fact, but we had a scheme to eliminate the highway there and instead of having the raised highway going there, we had a scheme to to have it go under Riverside boulevard from 72nd down to 59th street right, so it would be underground You would not have the highway as a detriment to the to the west of the whole site, and that- You recall, the civic groups, made a deal with trump based on the supposition that the highway would go.
He was allocating 30 million dollars to rehabilitate the West side, the highway, where it was If. I may suggest to you that to bring things up to date, almost from ethel , can you speak up a little bit, I'm having difficulty The last thing to say is that, as recently as the last three or four years, trump actually said publicly how much he dislikes Jerry Nadler, because he still blames Jerry Nadler for thwarting him in so many years, ago, and continued to feel and actually extended in the last four or five years , First, I do not know how many of you remember the meeting at the public meeting at which trump introduced his original plan.
I guess I mean do not give away the ending of her presentation, though Ethel had a kind of a love- hate relationship with trump more on the hate side, and when the then chair of the board, I think, was hope, and I went to Trump's office to solicit funds to help us do a study of the years.
The 79th street project might give us some insight into the finances of it, but I think it's worth having at least a an initial meeting of a few members of our committee and a few members of housing to see what it is.
Think the board's on record is wanting that, but maybe people who do not agree so you're talking about in new buildings, as well as conversions of existing buildings, everything, including including city housing, including NYCHA.
It's, a program that gets air rights from We. Also the you know, there's this mandatory inclusionary housing, which does not exist in our district.
I mean, I think, there's potential for soft sites farther south in our district, I'm sure, a contextual rezoning that triggered Mih could make many people happy.
Actually, I, think it will make many people unhappy since it provides very tall buildings in order to accommodate the affordable, housing.
Just saying you know it's the only way this problem is going to be attacked in any neighborhood We're not going to build 200,000 units in the city, but Other thing we need to do is look at what building sites there are that we need to help get funding for so that can be maintained as affordable housing and not torn down and build.
There was a proposal, one time to use a couple of million dollars for that of that in the 79th street project find proposal, but apparently that was no longer needed, so I think we're back up to around 14 million It would be good for the affordable housing conversation to find a home for that Before.
Yeah, I want to caution us against, like planning for NYCHA without I, do not know as people who do not reside.
You know from the NYCHA building, but it's always a question of who's going to be benefiting And They fall within both land use and housing, as well as the other points that were just made by louisa and ethel.
The second site is the Silverstein site on Columbus, which is the old ABC site, and it's my understanding and that site has the potential according to George James that to the you know, enormous and just you know really unconscionably enormous, and it's my understanding that Landmark West has initiated a request of city planning to put that block into the Lincoln Square special district.
But I think we should at least have a discussion in our next meeting about whether, irrespective of what landmark West thinks we should be a little more proactive in that area, and you know, approach, city planning and say: Look.
And I know your Silverstein is your client, but when we were aware that two sites were being sold, West, end Avenue and potentially ABC going down to Hudson yards.
You know just we need to know what your timing is, what you where you're headed and when you think it's important for community groups like ours to get involved.
