I represent the Upper West side, Asc, LLC, Mark and Chris are the architects that have designed the center, and our goal here is to have you guys, review the changes to the storefront to me, they're, very limited, obviously, but I don't really understand the whole process as much as you guys.
What we're going to do is just remove the existing door, which doesn't meet the code requirements for the space that we have, and it mirrors very similarly, the storefronts that are on the 74th street side of the insomnia, so I, don't know Chris or Mark.
When they're open, there's a just under 30 inches of clear, We need to have 32 inches clear to meet accessibility requirements, so we are proposing to remove the existing doors and we're going to replace them.
You know the interior frame of the door so that, because it looks like over here, this element and the width of this element are the same.
Just trying to understand, if I hear you under, If I, understand you correctly, these two you're right, it's an inch and a half give or take an inch and a 16 difference in width between the two panels of the doors.
You know, is only just a hair over an inch and the with everything that's going on there with the number of divided lights and the in the poles and everything else and the canopy that it it'll be negligible is from a fro when you're looking at it straight on, like this.
The really the reasoning behind it was just to try to keep it to reflect the symmetry in the space there and trying to maybe hide it in the doors, because that you know it's going to get lost in that.
I have a question two questions, actually all right: the other entrance doors on the other facades.
It's recessed, into this floor slab, So you won't see that it'll, look just like a threshold, I see, okay, and thank you for having that I thought that she wasn't in there.
I just wanted to be sure that we were all clear because it sounded like you were talking about different colors and different things.
So I, don't know if it's useful to anybody, but I did a quick look for the existing color of the windows.
You know in some kind of an infill or a single door.
This is actually a recess into a an area way that has a built out entrance with a very modern 1970s door frame like an aluminum door frame, And then this is your space.
Any other comments, thoughts, questions, yeah, I, have a comment, okay, I kind of feel about this.
The way, I felt about the vault heights at the Appthorpe, but given the fact that it's going to be changed, all things being equal without a compelling reason, such as impossibility, I, would prefer and I think it's appropriate to replace these doors with wooden doors in a color similar to the patisserie.
No one has opined I would I think we should go ahead with this and make changes or propose changes elsewhere as they come to us keeping everything the dark color that's the building is basically when you look up at all the windows.
Okay, all right, Should we try a an approval resolution for the door and the canopy.
What happened, I think, there's Kay. Okay, I'm, really sorry.
The problem is that January 5th our meeting is in the evening your schedule, your public hearing, would be during the afternoon, So you would not have the opportunity to have a full board vote and we really think that this is one area where that would be necessary.
You can see just a nice broad picture of the 82nd street facade where you can see kind of the height of the existing railings, which do come up closer to being decode.
Guess you don't have to this is the demolition you can see how these the existing storefronts are actually set right up to the front plane of the building, and if you scroll down, you can see that they're being inset back to the their original location, which is slightly in set now.
We're, providing here in store, number three, which is actually part of the linen store, we're providing for the fact that if it ever is turned into two stores that we could put a door back in there, we won't be in the meantime, although he's struggling, so we knows what's going to happen with that, did you scroll down just a little bit.
Continue it all the way across, and then we would put aluminum sign boards in this space above each store, Retailers love, signs, sometimes I'm, not sure why they think they need them so much, but the sign boards would match the color of the cornice.
We will take out any gypsum board or whatever there is on the inside, so that you could actually read that all the way through here's, a rendering again, the sign boards would match the color of the cornice, the store fronts or aluminum, very simple flat black powder coated, we'll also be putting in replacing there's a rather ugly kind of just metal gate here that goes down to a rear yard.
That the thing that we want to observe very carefully is the frames of these storefronts, which tend to be historic, material, but that you know the storefronts themselves were always relatively fungible.
They were wood, they died, they were replaced, they were changed with tenants, and you know modern retailing really smiles upon having glass go down to the curb, so that you can actually see what's being sold more than any storefront.
Okay, So Paige did you have thoughts first, one first of all, Huntley, And I, think this is going to be a great addition.
It's we're designing them because you know to have to deal with the ADA issue if we need to, and but what I'd love to do eventually, is there that last flag that runs all the way along the building.
Okay and on Committee Board page, Yes, right and Doug.
I, don't know why it didn't come through the right way.
Master plan of 1992 for landmarks that actually make it look now like it's an unfinished elevation and that we might have an opportunity to combine windows.
Think it's a reasonable solution to try to balance the through the north and the south, facade or portions of the facade facing west.
The goal of making it more symmetric is a good one, I think, even though both as originally designed and as approved in the master plan.
There, is an imbalance, though, That will remain because the way that the single windows- don't they move to the right on each side rather than you know, middle and then outer.
In, some places, the windows will already have been have lost the historic fabric, but this will be the universal in the interest of having appropriate waterproofing details, air, sealing and energy efficiency of the new units and to recreate these consistent sight lines and molding depths I just want to be clear, So you did say in response to Kaye's question that there are no six over ones left on the building, exactly correct, I think even in the 1980s tax photo, I could only identify a handful of them, so I think they've been gone for quite some time.
And I see that in two ways: too, because if I can find it right, here, I think that the historic appearance of the building, despite the divided lights, though it always was rather understated.
I think if the windows had been made of a different material if they had been a steel frame or a darker, color.
I know this is a black and white photo, but I think it's reasonable to say that it was a lighter brown tone to a black.
Additionally, I think that there are a lot of precedents in the neighborhood that do have similar subtle, elevations and one over one configurations for windows is not atypical for this building.
My inclination, you know, frankly, is to approve it with the one over ones, and one of the reasons is that unless all of the windows were being replaced at once and I, assume they're, not no.
I agree on these windows and in balance, I think it would be better to maintain the consistency and approve the replacement with new one over one sets, So I would be positive in terms of this application.
Else, I, don't know how they would meet wind loads nowadays, but we'll see, looks like they're not doing so well, like even yes, okay, other questions or thoughts from the committee first.
You could end your screen share for a minute, so we could see each other thanks and that I assume that the remaining attendees are for the next item, but if they want to raise their hand to be heard on this one, I'm not seeing it looks like Paige has your hand.
And I think, Consistency on a big building like this I have to believe it or not.
So we'll have that bead work, detail reintroduced as opposed to that you know harsh square edge, so that I think will go a long way to soften the modern appearance that will follow all the way around correct.
We have a bronze color, proposed, there's black throughout right, now, but I think the bronze tone, although it will create some difference in the meantime.
So I, just thought, I'm, not sure if it's worth, including in our resolution or not, which is that we heard an application to have one over ones in the building, immediately next door to this.
I think this is the kind of thing that we would say we could just go with the committee resolution.
We want a full board vote to go to LPC, but we have a deal with them that we don't insist upon that in areas where we don't think it's as controversial.
You take a look at the history of 775, West, End Avenue, where we approved, based on the criteria that Jay mentioned, we approved one over ones, and the committee sent the applicant back three times before they finally approved it.
You'll see that this lot is kind of the tail to a much larger lot, which is 101 West 87th street, which is a large condo building in which, on the you'll, see that project was approved with a an original.
We just wanted to make it clear that it's part of the same zoning lot and the rear yard of this townhouse is actually the courtyard of the condo building, and so they kind of function as a as again one zoning lot, here, renderings of the of what was approved at landmarks for the condo building, 101, West 87th and then on the right-hand side.
What was improved initially at 110, West, 88th street, So, going back in time, here, 1940 tax photos you'll see that the 110 was really the one of eight really fantastic.
Here we have a shot the tax photo, which is actually showing the remnants of the demolition of the original 110 Samuel Reed Building right in 1988.
So, it's kind of more of a modernist appearance right now, As we looked around for design integration, what we felt would be contextually appropriate for the site we went up and down West 88th and throughout the neighborhood, and what's immediately apparent and something you know inside out from dealing with this district on a regular basis, Is the amazing kind of texture and fabric of the row, houses and the great rhythm, and what we saw immediately was a balance of unity or unifying features along with diversifying features, and so some of the diversifying features are ones of color or painted brownstone.
Another kind of big feature that I think resonated well with you last time and definitely resonated well with the Landmarks Preservation Commission was that we acknowledged that the punched window, the cadence across the same reed buildings, was of critical importance.
We kind of have a band of windows at each one of these floors and these screens that they come down and from the street level.
We did much thicker wood painted wood doors in windows, down below, and so here again, on the right hand, side you see the screen that I was speaking of, which are limestone.
You see it each at each location and the stoops at the same elevation, and so that was one of the problems that we had with the what the townhouse that was previously approved, that it just kind of disregarded all of these datums and conventions established in the previous buildings.
So we want that almost to have like a little bit of a dialogue built into the facade, along with the quality of that street.
Great and most buyers are looking for an elevator, so we're able to kind of fit that in there and the stairs I know.
Okay, just I wanted to make sure that our newer members understood what the history was that in fact this was approved at LPC and is now back in essentially the same iteration.
That looked a lot like a flat screen TV that was on the facade.
You disapproved was kind of different than what we eventually got approved at landmarks.
Looking out, it's actually 50 open, so you appear to have much larger window and in view of the street, so let me get the are you able to turn to the slide that shows the proposed complete proposal as compared.
You show more of the facade of 88th street how it fits with the other brownstones to the West, show the context photos that we have well.
I think this one's better, because it's you know.
So again, it doesn't look like these buildings per se, but it tries to capitalize on and utilize some of the design devices at play right.
And, in this particular case, looks upon these new additions to this streetscape favorably, when the newness, if you will of the design, is clear when you do it, as in this case a new building or a new rear yard edition or rooftop petition, they look favorably upon the distinction between historical and modern, so what we might initially think of as jarring and out of place, they often as they did in this case.
Other reason that I think landmarks was fine with this, and we came to this conclusion is that we are the easternmost of the eight townhouses and we serve as kind of the transition to this larger scale, buildings that happen along Columbus Avenue, and so they agreed that there can be a transition kind of a gradual step up happening to that larger volume that that's appropriate and with precedent related to uniformity.
If, you don't mind one other question, when I look at the buildings to your right, the townhouse is to your right, I notice, quite a bit of arch and roundedness to a number of the designs, and I'm wondering if they're applied to the design being presented or if they are aware they are being applied to the proposal.
Oh I'd, like to comment about the one thing I think that needs some work as the is the fourth floor, I think different from the townhouses to the west.
The good thing about it is at least it has the same coloration of the brownstones or the four-story buildings to the west, and.
It's the top floor that I think needs work.
I know you don't see it unless you're walking from the east to the West, but the party wall, where the gap is between the two buildings.
I think it's the second one of the problems with the height of this building.
Is, the fact that you've chosen not to put a basement level in but start with a seller and then grow the building with a typical parlor floor height, and then you keep going repeating the same height and the thing that disturbs me that to be honest, when I looked at this before it didn't dawn on me, but because you use so much of the center of the building for storage, elevator and stairwell that when you actually enter that room, that great big window, which you say is going to be sun, filled heads up, it's not.
That's an observation because I think having designed the floor plans this way, It creates problems on the facade and now, If we could go back to the facade, There are two things that really disturb me on this one.
I mean you could take the Bay window of the building at what is it 112 and put it in the bay when it would fit right through the bay.
There I know, that's the big thing right now for sustainability and the transition with these beautiful little bricks, but.
The, glass, windows and I agree with Peter the fact that the top floor of this building.
And I think, following up a little bit on what Paige said about a bay window, accepting the overall design of the facade.
I, Don't I still think that large picture window is.
Somebody should make a resolution I think we should disapprove okay, Susan Great.
