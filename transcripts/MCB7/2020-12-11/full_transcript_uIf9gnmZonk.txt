Lucky them so I have the slides for four out of five presentations tonight: 140 Riverside drive I, don't remember, seeing that's the window plan I think it is yes, hopefully they'll be able to share their screen when that time comes. Okay. Let me that's my echo I'll get rid of that sorry boy, there's nothing! Crazier than hearing your own voice. My computer died this morning, so I'm on a borrow one. So I noticed you're in a different room. Yeah I'm on the other side of the room. Oh okay, very exciting, a very handsome bookcase, I guess yeah! Thank you. Is that a real bookcase or is that a backdrop? Oh no. It has real books and everything yeah, but they are all right. I'm gonna go live with the webinar now that'll, let the attendees in which presumably will include the applicants right. We have someone phoning in from San. It's Francisco, Susan I didn't hear from Jay anybody, not one way or another. No yeah, Susan I passed. Your message to Mason spoke to him. Yesterday, how's he doing he's good. He says all right, Doug Mcgowan said he's going to be late. A little bit late as long as we have one dog we'll be all right. That's right, like the precincts. If you get one you get both. If neither of us were here, you guys would all become Douglas. I was gonna unmute, but I didn't get there quickly. There was some comedian about you doing the same thing with ruthless you're right, I would say what is your name I go it's past tense of dig at least you didn't grow up with. If you see K tell him I said hello, oh my well, then there's the other there's another one. What's your real first name, Kay James! How have you been the whole for childhood, though? Or since yeah since I was five I? Think wow? Are you technically a junior? Is that why no it came from the Sandy Becker show if anybody's a local New, York person, yeah character on it called Que Lastima and which, of course, is spanish for what a pity, but my brother decided. That was a good name for me and he couldn't spell in English or Spanish at that age. So I just got the letter. He's an older brother I assume he was not yeah a rival. Nice he's an older brother, it's as good a story, as I've heard yeah that my background may actually be inappropriate. Tonight's, considering that one of the applicants is the Ansonia I, don't want to prejudice anyone's decision, that's right, overly romanticized! You know my same background for all meetings. So what's the first item on the agenda, I know we're waiting for Michelle, yeah I think it is the Ansonia. That's what I got okay. So whoever is the applicant for the Ansonia? Could you use the raise hand function on your participants or your participants button? That's okay! So that's Mr Mulhall, I'm probably butchering that name. Forgive me, I'm promoting him to panelists. Now, okay can I just ask if somebody be able to do notes for us. Michelle is at a family first night Hanukkah. Oh that's right! Michelle's, not with us tonight, okay cool! Is anybody able to do that and then we can work later on the resolutions. I just finished the hss minutes, so you're in mode. Is that what you're saying well? No one else will do it. I will but yeah very nice. Thank you all right. Thank you match that'd, be awesome, you think that's yeah I would do it, but I'm unfortunately I can't do that and run the slides at the same time. Yeah it's okay! I'll! Do it? Okay, thank you! So if we're not waiting for Michelle, then I think we're all here. Are we not I? Think? Yes, all right! So, okay, it's all yours, I'll, mute myself! Now, okay, great well welcome! This is thank you, Community Board 7 Preservation committee. We have an advisory role to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, giving input our job is to determine the appropriateness of any changes alterations to the either the individual landmark or the historic district, and so you're very welcome and we are eager to hear what you've got that you're working on so great. Thank you guys for getting us on the agenda this month really appreciate it. We were a little new to this process, so we didn't realize that we had to go to you guys. First, so I really appreciate that I know. I asked my architects to join as well, so they may be listening in the background. So I don't know if I'm gonna need them for any part of this, but if so I could probably have you guys put them up as well. Is that okay I'll do that now? If it's just to save time later, can you give me their name, so you look for Chris, Waltz or Chris. Waltz is now joining you and what's the other one, I'm sorry mark got him excellent okay. So the team is all on the field. Excellent, all right! So do you want to run your? Do you want to run your slides, or do you want me to pull up your slides for you I think it would be easier for you guys, if that's all right which, if you guys could run them, which I think you'll be all right and I may just pass this off. Let me just I: can if I just make a quick introduction, I'm I represent the Upper West side, Asc, LLC, Mark and Chris are the architects that have designed the center, and our goal here is to have you guys, review the changes to the storefront to me, they're very limited, obviously, but I don't really understand the whole process as much as you guys. Obviously do and I know that the architects are we're pretty clear in how they propose this to landmarks. So what we're going to do is just remove the existing door, which doesn't meet the code requirements for the space that we have, and it mirrors very similarly, the storefronts that are on the 74th street side of the insomnia, so I don't know Chris or Mark. Whoever wants to take over once they put the slides up. You guys can go ahead and do that and I'll be here and support. I can give the commentary mark and you can jump in if I miss anything. So this thanks, it's nice to see everybody tonight thanks for having us. This project is a new endoscopy center and it's actually located in the sub-basement of the Ansonia. So we had a lot had our work cut out for us with that. The only modification we're making to the exterior of the building is the entrance to our suite. It's an existing door, a french door. It probably shows up next on the so you can see it right in the bottom in the middle, that's the existing door. Yes, thank you and the problem with our door for our new project is that it doesn't meet accessibility requirements. The leaves are currently about I, think 31 and a half inches. So when they're open there's a just under 30 inches of clear, we need to have 32 inches clear to meet accessibility requirements, so we are proposing to remove the existing doors and we're going to replace them. So those are, I'm sure, you're all familiar with these they're wood framed french doors and with single pane glazing. So we are going to be replacing these or we're proposing to with hopes, windows and doors, you're, probably familiar with them from Jamestown New York they're, pretty much the go-to for historic preservation for windows and doors and they're steel framed they're, insulated glass, so double pane glass and we're proposing essentially the same orientation. You can see it in the middle on the right there. That's what we're proposing. If you want to zoom in a little bit there we go so you can see. One of the leaves is a little bit larger than the other. It's just about an inch larger so that when it's open we have the 32 inches clear, and then we needed to eliminate one row of the windows of the panes in order to put in the horizontal crash bars for the interior, but other than that we've tried to per you know, maintain the look. That's there as best as we could, and we are also proposing I mean please any questions, as I'm talking feel free to jump in yes, are those the mullions are those wood or metal, the existing or wood. The new are Astia. Our steel, yes they're, they actually divides, or are they just those things that clip on I believe mark? Can you comment on that? I have to take a quick look at the shop drawings. Yes, the true divided light: okay, thanks, okay and the only so actually were there any other comments on the doors themselves, because my last comment was about a canopy so might as well. Stick with the door located on the south facade is that it. These are on the yeah right next to mark Marguerite's Patisserie there on the north side, it's the north on the north side of the opposite, where the fairway delivery entrance is sorry Peter. Are you still going it's okay, Chris on the door? Is there also a proposal to put a banister or handrail down the center of that door? Yes, yeah. Can you see it shows up here as well? Yeah those are poles. Those are vertical poles in the center of the door. That's a door pull right, not a handrail right, that's a pull and yeah, and then the inside has a crash bar, and we also have an automatic operator, that's being put in the floor to operate that oh wow, if you, if I may, it looks like here on the transom that you've got some divider, it's not a clear, not a complete replication of what was there before yeah. If you want to go, if you want to go down to what's there, I can explain we. There is a central panel there, it's basically a large mullion if you just pull over to the left a little bit there. So you can see that's the center there's a little bit wider as well, due to the way it's framed in the transom. So ours is a little bit wider and it's really we're trying to line up the glazing from the windows to the in the transom to the windows and the doors and because the doors are slightly offset, we felt that this arrangement worked the best we end up with that larger mullion in the middle yeah is the mullion in the middle of the transom, the same width as the middle frame for each. You know the interior frame of the door so that, because it looks like over here, this element and the width of this element are the same- is that what you're going for again? They don't line up directly? No, of course not yeah. Of course they wouldn't yeah. So we tried to approximate it and we ended up, I'm not sure mark. You might comment on that. If that was a construction issue from the manufacturer or if that was a design issue yeah in working through the drawings with popes, they indicated they need a certain width for the structural integrity of the frame. So I'm just trying to understand if I hear you under. If I understand you correctly, these two you're right, it's an inch and a half give or take an inch and a 16 difference in width between the two panels of the doors. Is this dead center or does this follow the line of the where these door pulls? If one of a better word line up mark? Can you comment on that? One of the doors is slightly larger than the other, and the width of the upper mullion is made a little wider for both structural reasons and also to capture kind of that discrepancy in the width of the lower, because it looks like this is dead center and I'm just wondering whether that'll look funny with the transom being divided evenly in half above, but the doors below being offset by a couple of inches I. Don't know whether that reads visually or not it's kind of hard to tell from the drawing yeah the way it's dimensioned on there. It is showing up as the top being equal in the bottom being offset I. Think our feeling was that the offset is it you know, is only just a hair over an inch and the with everything that's going on there with the number of divided lights and the in the poles and everything else and the canopy that it it'll be negligible is from a fro when you're looking at it straight on like this. It's one thing you really never I'm sure you guys know this, that you always see it at a perspective because you're not standing seeing it dead straight on all the time you're, seeing it walking up from either side. So it's pretty much. We think that's going to be a wash from a visual standpoint, and will the color be the same? I have a question: did you do that, because you're not making changes to the upper portion or is the upper portion being changed like the doors the upper portion is being changed to the same material in the same manufacturer as the doors I? Think the really the reasoning behind it was just to try to keep it to reflect the symmetry in the space there and trying to maybe hide it in the doors, because that you know it's going to get lost in that the thickness of that center mullion. That was the thought process. I have a question two questions, actually all right: the other entrance doors on the other facades. Are they still wooden doors? You know I. We actually submitted those some pictures of other ones and I'm not sure if they got in to this submission, can you zoom out? Was there one more page, because the only ones that are remaining that are wood are the actual entrance into the Ansonia residential component? I? Think the dry cleaners next door is metal as well, as is the patisserie I think that one's what yeah the patisserie is wood, the one that is wood on the left side? Those are some examples of the adjacent storefronts that have been added in so we've got that which is the very traditional storefront, the first two there that's the existing, which I believe is that matches what we have now and that's that one still would yes, it is yeah I actually go there that it definitely is yeah. So what's the rationale behind not replacing the current door with a wood door that meets the ADA specification, I think it's for a lot of really it's more of the practical side of it is durability, security, strength, those types of things. Putting these doors are extremely tall and I. It's we feel that over time, there's gonna be you know, there's gonna be a lot of traffic and we felt that the steel would be a better functional solution to this. Okay, you mentioned the automatic door opener. Is that that's on the inside it's recessed into this floor slab, so you won't see that it'll, look just like a threshold, I see, okay, and thank you for having that I thought that she wasn't in there. For some reason, oh thank yourself because I got it from you, so I knew we had it. I thought we sent you a different version, and so were there any more questions. I guess! If you want to think of it about some more questions on the doors themselves, you can see in this image here on the right near the that image. You can see the canopy that we're proposing, which is intended. The intention there is to match as closely as possible the adjacent one at the patisserie for color size and location material. It's a fabric material. The patisserie is also fabric. Yes, I believe the patisseries fabric bill I think. Are you getting you're getting this one yourself, I, don't believe we specified this. No that's in the contract. It's not hopes, that's doing it, but that's in contract with the Gc. So that's what I should say. That's very similar to that I think we put that one on them to say match. What's there yep right? Okay, will there be writing on it very similar to what is on the one at the Patisserie yep? Okay, look. This looks like the centennial door at the Vatican. Is there anything that we can do about that? Yeah? I'd love, to put a big sign on that? If you want us to you know, actually a tastefully caricatured sign would be better than what's there now yeah, not neon I proposed that to the landlords, and they said, there's no chance that I get approved, no, maybe even a Wiley, coyote kind of perspective, drawing yeah. We could do that for sure. And can you explain something about the different colors I mean? Is it there's the white and then there's a black door as well? The white is really so the where the canopy is that's our door and the white is really representing the glass. It's just the way that it rendered in this image. No I don't mean this I mean the earlier one of the other storefront. That is not being changed where oh, the at the patisserie. Yes, so they have kind of a grayish tone to theirs. We have a black and the black was intended really to match with some of the interior elements, as well as the fencing that's running around the outside there. Oh so your door will be black, it will be black I think if that's there or other yeah that store front in photo number three is also black and then, if you scroll down there's another one, that's also black. Most of the storefronts that are existing there now are the black. The cafe is the only one with the gray yeah, but the gray is the original. Isn't it looks like what's most, what are the windows above because I would completely rule out the Philistines who decide who designed this one? For example, they don't get a vote. I think that's fair! Sorry, if that's you guys by the way, but I'm guessing it's not. No, probably not is the existing black I can't the existing is gray and I. Think I, don't remember what the window windows are above, be honest with you yeah. It's all. It's exactly like that. One right there, the existing okay right all right, I'm gonna, stop share for a Sec. Stop sharing for a second well just to cut. Are we ready for comments yeah? Well, do you want to do public testimony if there is any? No I'm just sorry, but that's what my next question was. Is there anybody here for this? Oh Paige is with us, I'm sorry, Paige I couldn't see you because I had the share screen on, but I'm promoting page to our colleague, Paige Kelly to panelists, so Paige. You should be able to unmute yourself now. Hey hang on I'll, also Un-picture myself, so you know I'm here there you go all right before you start Paige before you start I'll also say if anybody else in the community wants to be heard on this there's about eight people in attendees. If you would raise your hand, you do the little blue raise your hand thing it's on participants button. Then we will know to call on you, but Paige I think Kay is calling on you now. Thank you. Well, first of all, this is one of my favorite buildings. Only ever and it's picturesque it, you know for a minute you can on that block. You can feel you're in Paris, and my the only thing that I find so troubling is that, while it's a lovely, patisserie and you're making improvements, there's no cohesive, follow through on this on the storefronts. Everything is its own criteria and appearance and right down to the paint colors themselves. Each piece has its own characteristic, and this is an opportunity where we can or I would have thought you might try to unite and follow exactly. The same thing is as probably the best of the what's left of the original wars. So I'm very troubled by my colleagues comments about the different colors, the different materials, the different sizes of the lunettes and the clear story. I'm having trouble getting on board with this. To be honest, so we're only replacing the one door right. That's clear right that, because we showed a lot of examples of other doors that are existing, that we are not touching that are different, colors different styles. More contemporary, we have one single pair of french doors with the transom I. Just it I was I just wanted to be sure that we were all clear because it sounded like you were talking about different colors and different things. We only have the one that's a different color to the ones next to it, but it's the same color as some of the monumental doors, but I would think that, rather than try to create a different variations on a theme that you would try to make the patisserie this is going into the patisserie I did come on. No, it's next door, no, which is a completely separate store. Yes, so all the more reason that this should try to follow, one of the other styles more possibly, but that's not up for grabs right now. No I have a few questions. So this is the wrong I. Have a few questions match? Do you the screen? The drawing up? Yes, I do I have some questions because I went by this afternoon and it looks like there are several doors that are going to be worked on, not just this one. There were other doors in that in the lineup that looked like something was going to happen to them as well, they're put in terrible condition and I'm wondering if any of those doors are part of your project, no they're, not it's just this one entrance that goes into a little small waiting area, that's about 500 square feet and you take an elevator down two floors and that's where the space is so it's. This is the only piece. Is there anything to preclude the colors similar to the Cafe Margot so that they don't look so metal, they might look a little less different and less metallic if they were black, that was a choice we made I. Suppose that's an option. We could consider, it's I think, there's an availability in that color. If that's what you're asking yes. Thank you so I, don't know if it's useful to anybody, but I did a quick look for the existing color of the windows above and I saw this picture, which seems to suggest that the windows above are a darker color. Yes, it does I, don't know if that's useful, but I would okay. Anyway, put the other screen back up again. Can you just remind the us, the reasoning behind increasing the size of each door by and half a half inch yeah or decreasing the glass panels? Yeah the existing doors are equal, but that's always a problem with french doors, as they seem to they're the same size, but neither one of them meets accessibility requirements. So in order to maintain french doors the look of french doors, we had to make one a little bit larger by about an inch and a sixteenth, so just over an inch in order to make it the correct, accessible width, another option would have been to go with a single door that was would have been about. You know in some kind of an infill or a single door that was five feet wide, that spanned the whole thing or sliders, or something like that, but we felt this was the most authentic and the most paid the most respect to the existing building. I, don't know if it's of use so I'll make this real, quick. Looking at this slide and I'll, enlarge it a little bit just confirm for me that I'm reading this correctly that this is the existing facade over here is the TD bank. This is Cafe Margot. This is the dry cleaner. This is actually a recess into a an area way that has a built out entrance with a very modern 1970s door frame like an aluminum door frame, and then this is your space. Do I. Have that all correct I believe that's right, and then this is the those are the dry cleaners. This is the dry cleaner here yeah, and this is that blank metal thing right, yep, that's correct! It's an infill, yeah I think that's right, which unfortunately, is like at on right on the same plane as the wood, the rather the stone around it yeah all right. Any other comments, thoughts, questions, yeah, I, have a comment: okay, I kind of feel about this. The way I felt about the vault heights at the Appthorpe, but given the fact that it's going to be changed, all things being equal without a compelling reason, such as impossibility, I, would prefer and I think it's appropriate to replace these doors with wooden doors in a color similar to the patisserie. Is that gray yeah? That's my opinion. No I can't agree with that. What was that Peter? No I wouldn't agree with that. I think, because there's one bad apple in there that the other one shouldn't join it. You know I think to change. The patisserie is more the goal, if possible, but that's not before us, so I would go with the doors the way they're being proposed and how is the patisserie a bad apple? Well, the patisseries got this very whitish color for the doors for the windows and all the other window frames and the door frames are the participants. The patisserie is the original door. Is that not right? No I, don't know that. We know that one way or the other. It's certainly been there a long time, but whether it's original and no one has opined I would I think we should go ahead with this and make changes or propose changes elsewhere as they come to us keeping everything the dark color that's the building is basically when you look up at all the windows they're, all the same. It's quite beautiful and the base should be very similar Peter. What about the material wood versus metal? Well, I, don't I think it's! The color is more an issue than them. Okay, all right! If I could ask a question of the architects, would it would a change to wood from metal have an effect on the functionality of the doors vis-a-vis their ADA compliance, or is that something that's just a choice that you know can be made one way or the other well I think we'd have to look into that, because you know we have the auto operator on there for people who you know who need to use that and I don't know if the door, if a wood door would have the rigidity that you would need with the auto operator to operate. It and I definitely would have concerns for the owner about longevity and replacement and upkeep and maintenance, because you would, if it's wood, you're going to be painting it extremely often much more so than you would metal and also we're required to meet the Energy Code. The steel doors are, the storefront is thermally broken, so it's made for to meet the current energy codes as well with the insulated glasses. Okay, all right can we vote all right. Is there anybody, let's just make sure, there's nobody in the public who wants to be heard on this? If that's, okay, yeah? Okay? So if anybody in the public wants to be heard on this, please raise your hand your virtual hand. It's in participants under attendees. You should see a raised hand function. Oh there's somebody who's, calling in by phone from San Francisco, raising your hand is Star 9 on your phone. If you want to be heard on this I, don't see any hands k, so, okay, so I see Doug. Okay has a question or a comment. Welcome Clement. So it may be more trivial, but I. Think it's apropos and I by the way, as I said earlier in the meeting I happen, to have this background as a coincidence to in favor of or against it just happens to be in my background, but I did grow up on this block and I'd like to note that this area of the building the north facade this part and I'm not sure if it's this exact door. But it's one of the three. This was the main entrance to the continental baths club, which was where Bette Midler sang and Barry Manilow was her piano player then later became the Plato's retreat, which was the so. This is the actual space and I. Don't know if, on your second lower level, if it's actually where the pool was but I do know that the pool was recently excavated and removed. So I just thought it was this. Is that entrance? It is that it is the same entrance. Yes, it will be the same entrance yep and it is the pool was actually on the garage level, which would be the basement we're below that, but the actual pool physical pool itself was in the space that we're in now, right and I happen to know. I, just by coincidence, spoke to one of the owners and who said that they discovered it by surprise when they were removing debris out of a room. The contractor was digging down and down didn't realize that there was a pool, they couldn't figure out why it kept going below grade, and then he discovered the famous pool with the logo from Plato's retreat, and this was only months ago, so I just thought it would be apropos to discuss. This is the actual space there's a lot of history there and that's where Bette, Midler and Barrymantle have got their start and lots of other things that happened years later, I actually got to see inside that pool. It was right. Certain continuity there, I'm not sure I want to figure out what it is. All right make a resolution. We voting on what we need to figure out. What we're voting for here approval? Well, so there's two things you want to talk about right k: you want to talk about the door and all of its you know, permutations and also the canopy I, wouldn't want to be lose track of that too. Okay, all right, should we try a an approval resolution for the door and the canopy? Yes, okay, so somebody's called. Are we calling the question yeah? Okay, so I? Guess all in favor I'll. Do it? Okay, all in favor of that resolution, which is to approve both so I, see Josh and Madge and Peter. That's a yes and I! Don't see K! Do we lose K is frozen right now, okay, all right! Well, I! Guess we'll suspend the vote for a Sec, because we certainly need the committee chair. What happened I think there's Kay! Okay, I'm really sorry, I told you. This is a borrow computer and I may be sorry. I borrowed this one and not some other. So we were voting on a resolution to approve and so I have three in favor and K. We don't have your vote, I'm in favor. So that's four and I don't see any other hands so now, let's take the nose who's a no on this. So Susan. If you put your hand down we'll do committee first page, if that's okay, so I see Doug as a no and I, don't see any other hands. Abstaining, I'm upstating Mark Jay is an abstain and no one's ineligible right so from the committee. That's four to one to zero, so it would pass non-committee board members that would be page. So, let's go in favor I see none opposed, page abstaining. That would be me and I. Don't think! There's anybody else. Is there? Oh Doug, I'm sorry there you are. Where are you Doug abstain, so from a non-committee? It would be zero to one to two to zero, but it does carry so. This would be referred to full board on January 5th. Are they calendared yeah, let's find out Chris or Mark? Are you guys calendared at LPC at this point bill? Do you know I thought we were I do believe we are yeah. Do you know the date? The first January fifth date, yeah okay, and we're going to ask you to move that date at least a week. There are times in which LPC, where we're comfortable with a committee action going to Fl to LPC before that gets a full board vote. Kay I would urge that the committee, not that we not use both, because it's a split vote effectively. It's a 4-2 vote and because it's an iconic building in our upper West side fabric I would encourage you to postpone that so that you have a full board vote which may reinforce the approval or it may reverse it. We had one of our committee actions reversed at full board this past month, so I would encourage in this particular instance, because of all of the because of the nature of the building and the nature of the application that we not only rely on in effect six years. This is an individual landmark. Isn't it it's an individual landmark as well as you know, and it's iconic, even if it weren't and it's part of the West End Avenue historic district as well I believe so we will be asking LPC not to hear this, and it would be great if you would join us in that and then we'll get a full board vote and then you could, because the problem is that January 5th our meeting is in the evening your schedule, your public hearing, would be during the afternoon, so you would not have the opportunity to have a full board vote and we really think that this is one area where that would be necessary. So with that, okay, anything else on this one I think that's good, okay, mark just real quick. Do we have to do anything with respect to that date, or is that just something that you guys tell the full board? We will tell we well on January 5th you're welcome to come. The chairs of the committee will present the resolution, not the applicant. It is not a bad idea to be present in case there are questions or in case you want to help present or help answer questions or even make the case for why you've made the choices that you have so you're welcome to do it you're not required to do it right. Okay, great! Thank you guys. Thank you all for hearing our case appreciate it very much and stay safe. Good luck, thanks for being here! Good! Thank you all right, moving right along next one I have is the I think it's 456 Columbus. Is that correct the 51,451? Okay? My one looks like a six, so that's Huntley Gill our friend from the Columbus Avenue bid, among other things, welcome to CB7. He should be joining us any second here. What happened there? He is all right, Mr, Gill Welcome, to CB7. Why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself and tell us if there's anybody else that should join you on this presentation there he is no I am alone. Alas, great I'll, pull up the slides. Let's see give me one page, okay yep, so there are several elements to this. Is we make this full screen, so it's a little bit easier to read. There are some big drawings. Okay, let me do my best here and you can go to the next screen. Actually, no, it's not letting me do that. I, don't know if it's the nature of the well. No, it's not letting me do it all right struggle along. You can go to the next page. It's this is a building between 81st and 82nd street. You see the location here it wraps around the corner. It's three tournament houses, one is the north half the block on Columbus, 21st and 82nd. The other two houses are marched down, West 82nd Street, so we can go to the next one. Here you see marked in red. Is the area where we're going to be restoring all the brown stone on the facade and we're proposing a storefront master plan and also there's some handicap ramps that are being proposed on the areas in blue? That's a separate staff approval of brownstone restoration. Unfortunately, at this point probably the client was going to paint it which I don't like, but I'm not in control of that. There are also two sets of railings on the stoops at 78 and 76, we'll look at pictures of those they were replaced without a permit, and that happened. I was just because they were very low and I'm told by my client I didn't know about this. I didn't even notice that they were very low, perhaps 18 inches and one night, somebody probably in his cups, tumbled into the area way below. So they were quickly replaced and we'll take a look at those we can go to the next. So here's the designation photo. You can see that these storefronts had a metal band above them in the sign band where originally where there must have been brownstone before no God knows when that's disappeared quite a while ago, at any rate and most of the storefronts are remain as they were designation. Next, this is looking around the corner at 87th street. You can see the storefront on the corner there and the door to 80, which does not have a stoop and then the other two doors which you have stoops, and if you look hard, you can see the railings that were replaced. They're very low they line up with that band. That goes underneath the sills under the windows. They were small and decorative. We can go to the next. These are tax photos, obviously the 1980 on the right and the 1940 on the left, and you can see that the storefronts were, if you take a look at the signs. What we're guessing is that you can see this small tortoise element. It comes across the three buildings and we're guessing that continued underneath these wooden signs and that at some point it was just scalped off we could go to the next. This is a more of a close-up, so you can get a better kind of look at the how these wooden signs are just propped up and again it's interesting. If you look at the penultimate store down the street, there's a wooden frame there with no sign on it, there's no evidence at all what was going on there now left. It's all just. It goes back to construction behind it. Next, more tax photos around the corner, showing the l and some nice cars and you can barely, unfortunately, of course it as it always happens with the tax photos either. The guy with the cigarette is standing right in front of the element that you want to see or somebody's parked his Pontiac right in front of the element that you want to see, and that's what's happened here with the railings and the Columbus Avenue L right I mean elevated, exactly and the Endicott behind next, and this is the pretty pathetic situation we find ourselves in Glen Siegel, who owns the building says apparently, I am I, probably have the ugliest storefronts on Columbus, Avenue and I probably agree with him one day, those metal sign bands. It was right around Christmas, I think a year ago fell off and Glenn called me and said: can you come up urgently and I said yes, and then he turned to me and said: did you arrange this so that I have to fix it? We're going to do a master plan? The stormy storefront that we plan to replace right now is the mailbox store in the corner, which is a pretty horrible storefront. The others aren't quite as bad and we can probably live with those for the meantime. You can also see that there's a small step up some six to seven inches all the way, along here on top of a vaulted sidewalk, we're going to we're proposing here, metal ramps without railings to deal with ADA, eventually, I think what we'll hope to do is to repair the vaults underneath replace the sidewalk and get rid of those ramps, which is why we're doing something? That's really a temporary, reversible intervention and we'll just slope the sidewalk right up and go to the next one. Oh wait! Well, actually, I! Guess it doesn't matter. These are just details. If you just want to flip through them, it's store by store. You can see the bad condition of what was above, and these we're replacing you'll see that there's this sign band in some of these stores, where it says flights are, then we're not going to have any sign bends in that frame at all. You'll. Also see that the windows are jammed, the existing storefronts are jammed right up against the plane of the building which we're going to be changing. So you can just flip to the next oops, not sure what I just did, but let's try this okay and then next you hit control l. This may fix this, for you, I tried it it's not having any of it. Control L doesn't work, it does not I tried everything. I tried all the tricks in my tool, bag and I. Don't you can see where at this point where the brownstone there's a line slightly different, pink color here? That's where the project ends, the master plan and the restoration of the brownstone is Brownstone goes to that line and there's you can see just a nice broad picture of the 82nd street facade where you can see kind of the height of the existing railings, which do come up closer to being decode next you'll have to zoom out here. Well, I! Guess you don't have to this is the demolition you can see how these the existing storefronts are actually set right up to the front plane of the building, and if you scroll down, you can see that they're being inset back to the their original location, which is slightly in set now all of the doors are in swings. The spaces likely are small enough that we can do that, so you don't have to have any in order any insets for the doors they can all be flush, which, of course, is much preferred in retail next elevations existing above proposed below we're, providing here in store, number three, which is actually part of the linen store, we're providing for the fact that if it ever is turned into two stores that we could put a door back in there, we won't be in the meantime, although he's struggling, so we knows what's going to happen with that, did you scroll down just a little bit I want to see if there's any details on the you know, rams use this up on your screen. Would it be easier if I, just let you put it up yourself if you prefer sure I can do that? Let's do that because I'm not! This is not working so great, so you should now have the ability to share your screen. Oh sorry, does this do it for you right now, I'm not seeing your screen, but maybe it's just taking a second, if not I'll, go back and continue where I was but all right. Well, it's up on my screen. So I don't know what so there should be a green button at the bottom of your screen that says: share screen hold on one. Second, I'm seeing oh here we are there we go okay. Now you've got the controls. Great sorry. This is taking so long. You're doing great. You can see in the plans here. These are the ramps that are really without railings they're ramps and steps. So it's a minimal intervention. We made them as small as we can. We hope that that's a temporary thing, we don't know if any of these stores will choose to put them in, but we wanted to put it in the application. Anyway, here again is the elevation. You can see that what we're planning is to put this brownstone element that continues that will replicate from 82nd street this small cornice continue it all the way across, and then we would put aluminum sign boards in this space above each store. Retailers love signs, sometimes I'm not sure why they think they need them so much, but the sign boards would match the color of the cornice above. This is turning the corner. You can see we'd be replacing this one light here on 82nd street, and then this is where the line would go between the restoration of the brownstone as Brownstone and at least right now, Brownstone restored his paint. If his occupancy rate goes up, we might him into changing that. That's not going to happen soon. Anyway. Here are a couple of details. You can see the storefront being inset so that we can get a view of the existing there's. A nice brownstone reveal here that goes into the storefronts. We would take out as we replace the storefronts. We will take out any gypsum board or whatever there is on the inside, so that you could actually read that all the way through here's a rendering again, the sign boards would match the color of the cornice, the store fronts or aluminum, very simple flat black powder coated, we'll also be putting in replacing there's a rather ugly kind of just metal gate here that goes down to a rear yard where there's a storage tenant. So it's actually it's used and we replace that with simple glass door that matches the existing doors, the storefronts and frosted glass, another rendering there's a signboard missing in this rendering would be another matching signboard there, and you can see here the handicap ramps another rendering here you can see this, it's not drawn correctly. It actually aligns here, it's tried drawn correctly in the drawings, but the rendering wasn't updated. So this aligns here with this mullion a detail. This is, of the center store a few more details. You can see. Here's if this photo here, there's that nice kind of brownstone reveal tucking back into the brick, which is what we want to have. C have people see again here are some others we're doing full height glass, which is you know what you need these days in retail God knows: Columbus Avenue needs everything you can get. A lot of. These storefronts have been approved by the commission that are full height and with in-swing doors. These are just some examples going down the avenue, I'm sure you're all familiar with them. Our philosophy is- and it has been since we advocated for the creation of the historic district on the Upper West side, strongly over the opposition of a lot of our clients. Our position has always been as at Madison. Avenue. Is that the thing that we want to observe very carefully is the frames of these storefronts, which tend to be historic material, but that you know the storefronts themselves were always relatively fungible. They were wood, they died, they were replaced, they were changed with tenants, and you know modern retailing really smiles upon having glass go down to the curb, so that you can actually see what's being sold more than any storefront. This is going on to the legalization, which is the these. Are the darling little railings that were unfortunately replaced after a dramatic tumble as I said earlier, and there are some there were their choices. This is what the client popped in and I didn't even notice that they've been replaced. They wouldn't be my choice, but I find them rather inventive. Inoffensive the staff at landmarks thinks they're rather inoffensive. One of you know the alternatives would have been to bring it up to code is what the commission likes or staff likes us to leave, would have been to leave these and then put kind of rather clunky modern rails on the inside I happen to think, although I wouldn't have designed it. This way I happen to think this is probably a nicer solution in a way because I just find it less offensive than those modern rails reimposed on stuff. You can tell this was taken around Halloween. These dudes will be restored as brownstone as part of the staff approved work. It's all in very bad shape. You can see the you know, horrible patching, that's been done. All the iron work would be stripped and cleaned and repainted. So that's basically it all right! Thank you. So before us, for our input is the legalization of the railings and what other element? The that's, the oh, the legalization of the railings is the only thing that's going other than the master plan of the store front going for the commission. Okay, questions from committee or comments, I'm not the committee, but the master plan for the storefront seems to be a vast improvement over what's there now and it seems to be consistent with what's what what's along the avenue elsewhere. I agree with that all Right Huntley Mr Gill. If you would end your screen share, so we can see if there's anybody in the public who wants to be heard on this I can't see that screen. If you're sharing your screen there we go. So if anybody and the public wants to be heard on this now's the time to raise your little blue hand, okay, I'm not seeing any hands raised. But okay, although there's a that's a panelist, that's Paige, okay, so I don't see any attendees at raising hands so I'll leave it to you for the next part. Okay, so Paige did you have thoughts first, one first of all, Huntley! Congratulations! This is such an improvement and the way you've managed to reunite old and new is I. Think very admirable and I think this is going to be a great addition. My only question it's really a question on for the re restoration of the brownstone components. Are they going to be replaced in kind, or are you planning to use something like a yawn or chyme type? Brownstone, loving paint? You mean on the avenue yeah no on the avenue is going to be Brownstone's cementitious surface to match, we'll save everything that we can and only patch where we have to the guy who's doing. It is a guy that I've used before on several projects so he's my second favorite, my favorite isn't available for about two years, but he's very good and I've been very pleased with his work, and you know and God knows this needs it. It's an embarrassing thing, an Italian by the way, an italian name, no he's Abdul Malek. Oh he's done a lot of work on the Upper West side and a lot of stuff. There are only two people on the west side that do this and yeah, and the other guy I, like is the portuguese guy from the iron side. I forgot his name now it's Lipscomb Hunty right, yes, yeah! That's what I was saying: English I find totally incomprehensible and he's constantly inviting me to dinner. I know he likes to have coffee anyway, I'm all happy with your approach. I think this is wonderful. Well, coming from you page, that's pretty good I, don't know! Thank you, okay. Anybody else, all right Doug was that yeah. That's me this is I'm non-committee I just pursue hello Huntly by the way for those of you who don't know Huntley's a great captain, there's my boat behind me. You see! Oh yes, there it is so it was just a point of clarification. You would I believe it's outside of the purview of this vote, but just quickly on the ramps, the ADA ramps, the metal steel ramps. You had said something about being an interim step and then later on. It would maybe because I see that it is a elevation from South north yeah. It's we're designing them because you know to have to deal with the ADA issue if we need to, and but what I'd love to do eventually, is there that last flag that runs all the way along the building has a vault underneath it, and so obviously we all know that once you start and it's in very bad condition, eventually, what I'd like to do is replace the whole sidewalk from the curb simply increase the slope, slightly fill away from the rams altogether and that's the long-term plan. Thank you. That's what I! Thank you very much good. Are we ready to try our resolution yeah? Okay? This would be a resolution to approve legalization and the master plan right in the master plan. All right master plan voting on the rail and the master plan is that rail on the master plan, okay, while I still have a computer that works we'll go through according to my screen mag. How do you yes, Josh? Yes, okay, Peter, yes, okay, Susan, yes and Doug, Mcgowan, yes, Jay, yes, and I'm a yes as well all right! That's everybody! Seven to zero, okay and on Committee Board page, yes right and Doug yes and mark yes, okay, we have a winner wow. You are very nice people I, like you all, thanks for jumping in with the technical aspect, I, don't know why it didn't come through the right way this time. So it's for the minutes, seven to zero and three to zero. All right long live the John Harvey for those of you who haven't exposed it's a fantastic boat, the old fire belt. Thanks all right! One question: are you on the calendar? Lpc? Oh thanks: yes, I! Think it's the 10th or the 12th. I've forgotten now right, it'll be the 12th yeah! Well, okay, great good! All right here we go next. One I have mark is 140 Riverside drive, that's the one for which I do not have plans Julie. Let me promote the panelists Julie Kell Bearer or Cal Beret. I'm not sure how to pronounce. Excuse me, okay and I. Think that's the Normandy right or is it the Normandy? Yes is the no? Oh! I'm really sorry I didn't get the plans for this. Then you don't have the plans I do not I'm hoping you have them on your computer. Is the person here we're here? I'm sorry, okay, through all of my emails and I, see several emails back and forth between you and the office, but none of them contain the plans. Did anybody else receive the plans among the committee? No I did not all right. Well, I'm sorry. We we're quite sure who did Jesse confirmed that she received them. But are you not at a computer that has them okay? Well, let me see because I can you can now share your screen? So if you can call them up, then we can proceed. Okay. Thank you. I noted that at the top of the meeting, but maybe too early, thank you just for the record, while wearing a pause. Some people apparently think it's impolite to shut off your video. So I just want you to know that I think it would be even more polite for you to watch me devour a sandwich now we'll be doing the same shortly. So what kind of sandwich I'm starving Jay? What kind of what are you eating? Exactly all right guys, I'm eating a tuna lettuce and tomato on a very nice crisp. Roll here sounds delicious. However, I'm sure it's not a pretty sight. Thank you. We appreciate it all right. Could you explain to us how to share sure look at the bottom? If you move your cursor to the bottom of your screen, you should see a green button that says share screen and then that should activate a window. That'll show everything, including pictures of the grandkids that is up on your computer yeah. You got it there. You go all right so now the only thing is there: it is okay, great you're all set, so I'm just trying how do I get to the next page when I have to go either. Try page, are you on a mac or a pc on a mac? All right then try the left arrow. Oh right, now hold on. If I, just scroll, that'll work too right, it will you'll have to align each time but go ahead there. You go all right, I'm really sorry, everybody I thought we were all set with this, no worries all right. What is your name? My name is Julie Calber and my colleague here is Bill Torino and we are just about your name for me: Calver K-A-l liaison boy e-r-e-r. Thank you. Do we need to promote Phil in order to? Can we hear all right? Well, why don't you go ahead and if you need to so we'll just sit here with me, so oh he's there in the same room, perfect, okay, all right so showing you the first page here this is a rendering of the building. This is the Normandy on 86th street, between 86 and 87. It's an individual landmark, it's a 1939, Emory Rock Building and we are doing an apartment renovation on the top floor in the area that is between the two towers facing Riverside drive, and it became clear to us and I will go through these drawings and show you, but that the that changes have been made on that top floor that were then Encaps and captured in the window. Master plan of 1992 for landmarks that actually make it look now like it's an unfinished elevation and that we might have an opportunity to combine windows to I mean obviously is better for my client, but also better for the look of the building. So I'll take you through it here. This was the original rendering you can see that very top floor in between the two towers is the one that we're looking at and I'm going to skip through the plans and we'll just go right to this sheet here the left hand. Drawing here is the existing. What it looks like today and if you look at that very top floor again in between the two towers, you can see that it's a mishmash of windows in terms of the opening sizes is a combination of wide windows which are very typical for the Normandy. But then there are also smaller windows, which was typical up at this level. Originally now what happened was that, sometime before the 1992 plan on the far left on that upper level, the two large windows are, that is a neighbor's apartment and those windows were combined, and so what originally was a series of singular Windows casements with an occasional wider window, all of a sudden became now it's off balance, because you have these larger openings on the left and our windows are the smaller ones that are on the right. And then, if you look yeah we'll go to a it'll, be clear in the next sheet. But let me just say, on the right hand, side here the right hand, drawing is what we are proposing, including the master using the master plan for the windows. So you can see at that top level. What the neighbors will have to do when they make their changes? Okay, this might be a little easier to understand the very top. It shows the at the original windows. Now again, the opening that we're talking about making will be, on the right hand, side next to the terrace door. But if you just look at this whole center section together, the very top shows the singular windows from 1939 and then the next drawing down shows the approved master plan, and you can see so. This is right now, what's on the master plan and it's off balance, we have the bigger openings on the left and in the middle, but all the smaller openings on the right. The next drawing down shows what is existing today and then the very last drawing shows what we are proposing, which is to make a new masonry opening. Then it captures those last two singular windows into one unit that matches the other units now I should say this is actually a it's a few inches wider than the others. It's six inches wider to be exact, but I really don't think you can tell the difference and I think that overall, it's a much more harmonious look to it than leaving the singular windows by themselves. So I think actually it's closer to the original intention that the architects had on the building than what is existing right now and that's why we're proposing it. Do you mind if I ask one quick question for clarification? Sure we're talking about the windows at the right of the rendering and if you go all the way to the bottom, if you look at the last rendering that we're focused on and then you move to the left, it appears the two windows all the way at the left are also changed in this rendering. Yes, the very last one is showing the new opening that we're proposing, but it's also showing what the master plan has planned for the left-hand ones. So this would be the eventual goal is to get this whole elevation. This way, of course, that's not in our application, but thank you, okay, thank you, and where is this visible from other than New Jersey? Like where would I have to it, you can stand down on Riverside drive and look up at it. The left hand. Photographs shows, you know when you're standing in Riverside, just really looking up how far away that top level is. But you do see it. You do notice that there are large openings and smaller openings right. Okay and the right hand is just a it's blown up, yeah beautiful, all right questions from the committee or others yeah I can't so yeah Ms Calver. If you could end your share screen, there should be a red button at the top of the page. There you go now. We can see the Brady Bunch here and if any folks from the public want to be heard so now's the time to raise your little blue hand if you want to be heard and I'm not seeing any hands Kay so back to you all right great. Thank you mark all right. Anybody have further questions or comments about this project. It's fairly straightforward, I think it's a reasonable solution to try to balance the through the north and the south, facade or portions of the facade facing west I would I should say I'm going to eat in the back or here, yeah I. Think it's okay, all righty thanks Peter. Other thoughts like Paige is your hand up. Paige thanks. I was just curious on the sequential movement through time. I agree, I, think Doug your question about the symmetry for the far for the apartment that is not renovating and the one that is one of the things that I think struck me was the fact that of the alignment to the apartment below, and my only concern is that the paired windows seem to fit that module better than the expanded window, which would mean that maybe, in the future, the other apartment on the other end wouldn't work as well. So I think the concern I have is the permanence of this one. There seems to be a lot of changes and I. Just wonder if that triple window, even at six inch increase, is really warranted. Could the applicant say what is the room? That's behind that that's driving the larger window, I'm assuming it's a living or dining room. Yes, it's a living room and just to make sure we're all on the same page that the openings to the left of the neighbors, those openings have already been created and landmarks put those larger openings into their master plan, so those will always be there. Okay, so those are the overriding. That's the party that you're following okay, that makes sense. Thank you and thanks Paige. If I can jump in yes, I could just jump in quickly. The goal of making it more symmetric is a good one, I think, even though both as originally designed and as approved in the master plan. There is an imbalance, though, that will remain because the way that the single windows- don't they move to the right on each side rather than you know, middle and then outer but I, think that adding this additional opening is an improvement. So I would vote for this and I. Don't think, there's any way to solve that other than completely rebuilding that entire facade, which, if somebody had a mind to do it, would be great. But that's not what's before us, so I would I think this is still an improvement. So I would vote yes all right anything else. Or are we ready to take a vote? Okay, I? Okay? So this would be a resolution to approve and once again I'll go through and say and ask match yes all right and Josh yes and Peter yes and Doug Mcgowan! Okay! That's it! Yes! Susan! Yes, okay, Jay! Yes, great I got my and I'm a yes. What did I miss? That's everybody and it's seven to zero, okey, dokey great and on Committee Board members, Paige, yes, great and Doug yes and mark yes, beautiful all right! Okay, and do you have a date with landmarks, we do we have a January 12th date and 12th. That's good! All right see you there. Thank you, sorry for the mix-up. Thank you, okay, glad we could do it. Okay! Thank you. Bye-Bye all right I see two more to go. Well, yes, because the next one that's been officially on our radar is the 375 Riverside drive. Should we do that? One? Okay, I'm promoting Michelle. It looks like Dalai, Hof or Dalhoff pardon my castle. Can you hear me sure: can there you are hi I have to apologize in advance. My office is across the street from Macy's and it is very loud out there there's very frequent renditions of New York. So hopefully it goes in my favor. We'll all get our yankee hats. Well, I'm a Mets fan, so don't hold it against me. I, don't know. Okay, so tell us about some windows. Yes, may I share my screen. Yeah! You want to do that. Go right ahead! Thank you. Okay, do you guys see full presenter mode or that looks good to us? Looks good, okay, I'm not sure which version you can see: it's always kind of funky, so my name is Michelle Dalhoff I work at West, Jenny Elsner, also known as Wje engineers and architects, and I'm here on behalf of 375 Riverside drive owners incorporated. This is a I'll answer, my slides. Okay, we proposed a window master plan that the goals are to unify the building appearance and re-establish some fenestration proportions that have been lost over many years. Pay homage to the building's historic detailing through reintroducing some details and provide the modern service needs for the building. This proposal includes introducing brick to brick replacement windows throughout with new aluminum frame windows, with a double hung operation and the restoration of some paired window. Detailings 375 Riverside drive is located within the morning Morningside Heights historic district. This is obviously newly designated. So a lot of the historic fabric has been lost up until this point here. 110Th street. I'm sorry just remind me it's on the south side of 110th street. It is on the south side. Yes, okay, that's us! Okay! Yes, it is. Oh! Yes, it's just at the edge of the community. I noticed that this morning you just got us. Yes, we just got you all right, so it is a tan brick building with some terracotta detailing it is a renaissance revival, but overall the facade is very subtle and very muted. Here's the 1940s tax photo generally the facade, has remained very intact with very minor modifications. The one thing is, though, that the original windows were six over one and sometimes a four over one in these, I'm not sure if you can see my cursor in these paired windows, which I'll discuss more later. The original windows, though, do have very narrow frames and very small mountains from what we can tell, but we don't have a lot of information or historic photos. Beyond this come the 1980s tax photo. You can see that almost all of the divided light configurations have been lost. So here's a close-up view- and this is very consistent with what is in place now at the facade. So we have typically black aluminum frame. Double hung windows, one over one. These windows, however, like many, come in a lot of different ages, proportions and different levels of historic fabric intact. A lot some places the panning is very deep to cover the existing frames. Where other places it is more shallow. There are varying depths throughout the single units and the paired windows throughout there are some isolated areas where, prior to the designation of the district, that there were single pane tilt turn windows introduced here is the currently proposed elevations for the street facades. This would be the north elevation at 110th and the West elevation at Riverside drive, introducing double hung one over ones throughout the off street. Elevations are also very consistent, no historic fabric other than some wood frames, wood perimeter jam conditions left, but they're. A lot of the existing mullions have also been modified. Here. Are the proposed elevations, also proposing one over one? Double hung aluminums throughout the off street facades. So, although that most of the windows are single units in punched openings, there are two types of paired windows there is these generally proportionate paired windows that are at the off streets, but on the Riverside drive facade, there is a pairing that we've referred to as the maids room. Pairing I believe this was a service space with a accompanying bathroom. So there is one line on Riverside drive that has this unique unusual pairing with the ferry slender window, it's about 12 inches and sometimes that's ambitious depending on the existing panning conditions, and we were maintaining these throughout the proposal, but they are to be noted as one of those more unique configurations they go up and down that whole line. Yes, just one line at Riverside drive, here's actually an interior view where you can see one of the configurations, but they do vary throughout. You can see the current condition of this million. They some have been more severely modified than others. On the left-hand side. Here you can see a mullion condition on an off-street facade where the historic million, the wood framing and obviously the exterior molding profiles have been completely lost in the effort to fully replace the unit where other places there has been panning introduced, both at the millions and at the jams. What's your proposal, my proposal is aluminum one over one windows throughout in lieu of this historic divided light over one, and my question is about the framing that you just showed us. Are you going to change that or unify that in any way? Oh well, I can skip ahead if you'd, like my skip ahead, no I just thought that I was just asking about what you just showed us. So some of the existing configurations have shown a window to window frame and have lost the proportions and the volume and the detailing of the central Mullion and I'd like to reintroduce those. So here are the typical elevations of the single window units, mostly bathroom and kitchen, for the small and living dining for the street facades. They're very proportionate this a type unit, so we're proposing going from the divided light. The historic, the current inconsistent aluminum frames with varying jam head and sill conditions to a more unified elevation, with adjusted sight lines and more consistent jam deaths, and are there any of the existing of the historic six over ones or four over once? No none. There are very few areas where I could see the original wood molding at jam, conditions at off streets at basement levels, but very few and far between and in poor condition. If I can skip back I don't know. This is where we were able to observe some of the original detailing, which is very subtle. Much like the facade, but there was a fine bead detail that I've reintroduced. We were also able to document the width of the historic mullions to reintroduce that a six inch width, which would be more consistent, so these elevations show those configurations both the maids room configurations with the slender window to one side and the proportionate paired window elevations. This section shows the typical detailing, through any of the paired scenarios, where we will be going brick to brick. In some places, the windows will already have been have lost the historic fabric, but this will be the universal in the interest of having appropriate waterproofing details, air sealing and energy efficiency of the new units and to recreate these consistent sight lines and molding depths I just want to be clear, so you did say in response to Kaye's question that there are no six over ones left on the building, exactly correct, I think even in the 1980s tax photo I could only identify a handful of them, so I think they've been gone for quite some time. Can you bring up again a pic just a picture of the building? Yes, current or historic, a big pardon, a current photo or a historic one. A current photo thanks, of course, I asked for that, because if I make cake, can we comment? Yes, please, we general, we generally had two criteria for approving master plans which are not historically accurate, one of which is where the vast majority, and certainly in this case, none of the original originally configured windows are left and the other which and someone correct me if I'm wrong, one of the standards that landmarks uses is whether or not the windows, the configuration of the windows is a major, if not the major aesthetic element in the building, as opposed to stonework and so forth, and that's the reason I asked for a current picture of the building because other than the windows, it looks pretty plain. If I'm not and please correct me, if I'm mistaken, there don't seem to be any no yeah, it's certainly a very subtle and resigned building, yeah, so I. It seems that the certainly it meets the first criteria and as far as the second, it's kind of a bit iffy I mean for a building as simple as this. It would be nice to eventually have it restored to six over one, which is not much else that distinguishes so it's kind of a balance I mean it's understood and I see that in two ways too, because if I can find it right here, I think that the historic appearance of the building, despite the divided lights, though it always was rather understated- I, don't think it has a very strong dominance. I think if the windows had been made of a different material if they had been a steel frame or a darker, color I know this is a black and white photo, but I think it's reasonable to say that it was a lighter brown tone to a black. It doesn't have that strong heavy statement, so I think there wasn't always a resigned appearance to the facade. Additionally, I think that there are a lot of precedents in the neighborhood that do have similar subtle, elevations and one over one configurations for windows is not atypical for this building type, nor this area. My inclination, you know, frankly, is to approve it with the one over ones, and one of the reasons is that unless all of the windows were being replaced at once and I assume they're, not no they're, not yes, we always risk that it would be decades to require six over ones would result in decades of hodgepodge, yeah I agree on these windows and in balance, I think it would be better to maintain the consistency and approve the replacement with new one over one sets, so I would be positive in terms of this application. Okay, thank you, Jay. Thank you for your feedback, those weird awning things. I know they really cover the six over one. What we just reintroduced the awnings and go with somebody else, I, don't know how they would meet wind loads nowadays, but we'll see, looks like they're not doing so well like even yes, okay, other questions or thoughts from the committee first and then anybody else is del off. If you could end your screen share for a minute, so we could see each other thanks and that I assume that the remaining attendees are for the next item, but if they want to raise their hand to be heard on this one, I'm not seeing it looks like Paige has your hand up. Okay and I may have a comment whenever you're ready but go to page. First yeah, let's see your page. What do you think? Well, I'm always sad when you lose a six over one, but, as you say, you probably couldn't see it properly with the drapery of the awning and I think, consistency on a big building like this I have to believe it or not. Jay I agree with you. This might be the only the second time in our mutual sharing of preservation. But my question is really with the details you mentioned that you had looked at and found some of the wood frame details that has the three-quarter round. What is, are you I didn't quite understand the detail that you'd shown is that feature coming back? Yes, we've specified a brick mold. You know an aluminum panning that introduces that round so we'll have that bead work, detail reintroduced as opposed to that you know harsh square edge, so that I think will go a long way to soften the modern appearance that will follow all the way around correct. Well, it will be the three sides the sill will have a and how will you and do you have a detail of what the? What do you I can't remember the technical word, the sill thank you of the window. Is that going to be square or will that be also rounded as well? No, it's a sloped element, it's part of the overall panning and the waterproofing detail, so it maintains the same color and it comes down at a slope and has a square edge, but I don't think that would be inconsistent to any detailing of even the wood window because generally they would have a slope sill and a vertical termination. I agree too much of a good thing and the last question is I. Can't remember: did you say these are going to be plain painted the brown or they're black? Currently, we have a bronze color proposed, there's black throughout right now, but I think the bronze tone, although it will create some difference in the meantime, I think it's more appropriate to us. It's historic I agree well done great! Thank you. Okay, thanks Paige and Mark yeah thanks I find myself agreeing with Paige and with Jay I. Just wanted to add so I won't repeat what they said, but the one thing I will mention is Jay, even though I usually am the one who is holding out for the divided light. I'm not going to do so in this case for the reasons that Jay indicated, but for another one as well so I just thought, I'm not sure if it's worth, including in our resolution or not, which is that we heard an application to have one over ones in the building immediately next door to this yeah 370. right, and that is an example that to highlight what Jay was talking about in terms of criteria. That was an example where we found the level of decoration on the building to be sufficient, that the elimination of the multiple light or divided light would not be missed as much as it might be. Otherwise, on this facade, but I, don't think that we need to distinguish here and go back to the six over one on this facade, because in effect the entire block would now be unified, not just the entire building, and so I think that is to the benefit of the historic district and the individual building, as well, so just to pile on a couple of extra reasons. Why I think that this is the this is appropriate in this case, even though I lament but will not insist upon the return of the divided line. That's a good point. I agree, we're also agreeable tonight, I, don't know! Well, if you insist, K will try to figure out a disagreement for the next advocate. I'm sure that won't be hard. Okay, all right are we ready to go to a resolution if there's nothing else? Okay, so this is a resolution to approve, and so let's go around Josh yes and Peter. Yes and Doug. Mcgowan yes match yes and Jay; yes, Susan. Yes, I'm a yes, okay and that's everybody in the committee and then Paige. Yes, thank you, okay and Doug, yes and mark yes. Thank you also. Is there a date? Yes I believe January, 5th, I think jk. What do you think less? The problem with this one than the Ansonia I? Would let this one go. Yeah I think this is the kind of thing that we would say we could just go with the committee resolution, so Michelle the what we're talking about is that you're likely to have your public hearing in the afternoon and then we'll have a full board vote in the evening. Most of the time we want a full board vote to go to LPC, but we have a deal with them that we don't insist upon that in areas where we don't think it's as controversial I know, I'm not sure you'll find LPC as agreeable as we are, especially given 775. If you take a look at the history of 775, West, End Avenue, where we approved, based on the criteria that Jay mentioned, we approved one over ones, and the committee sent the applicant back three times before they finally approved it. So I don't know that you'll find them, but anyway, I'm okay. If the chairs of the committee are okay, I'm okay, with within the committee action on this one but you're on your own, in terms of whether you want a full board vote instead of a committee vote to back you up on that, you don't have you don't decide right now, yeah I think I will consult with my client. If that's all right with you, if I can follow up nice all right, let us know! Thank you all so much all right! Thank you! Michelle, bye-bye, all right, one more and that is 110 west 88th, a theoretical building. Oh I'm sorry! So I should be promoting people shouldn't I. Give me one second here: Lester Katz is the person who, with whom I was corresponding about. This is a late addition to your agenda and they should all be there's Mr Katz so shall I call up the slides or do you want to do it yourself, Mr Katz, actually, Jordan Rogoff should be promoted, he's yeah I can take over with the screen. If that's helpful, okay, you're all set, you should be able to pull up your screen and share whenever you're ready. Okay, perfect, please tell me if you're seeing my screen. Yes does that work? Yes, although we see your yeah, you want to re-center that a little bit there, you go okay, perfect well. First of all, I would like to thank you for hearing us tonight. We really appreciate it. I know we were relatively last minute in reaching out and if this seems like deja vu to everybody, it is deja vu all over again. We were before you about seven years ago with this project. And yes, it remains a conceptual project at this point, but the owner has every intention of building this, and that's part of the reason that we're back here today after we presented to you, there were a number of comments that were made at that time some seven years ago, and we made a number of those changes which we'll elaborate on through the presentation tonight and ultimately got an approval from the Landmarks Preservation commission in March of the following year. That's 2014, excuse me 2014 now so we'll get into that shortly, but thanks again for hearing us tonight, so starting with this first slide, this is the site in red. I, don't know, can you see my cursor okay, excellent? Thank you so we're right on the northern edge of the Upper West Side Central, Park, West, Historic, District, right at the corner or near the corner of 88th and Columbus, and on the right hand, side of this slide you'll see that this lot is kind of the tail to a much larger lot, which is 101 West 87th street, which is a large condo building in which, on the you'll, see that project was approved with a an original or I shouldn't, say original. But initially it was approved with a townhouse design. Atlanta works prior to our involvement back in 2014, so it that townhouse was part of the same zoning lot of the large condo building the one-on-one building and actually throughout construction, served as an access point for the construction and staging. So it was going to be the last thing built even at the inception of the project and, unfortunately, to date it obviously hasn't happened, but we hope to realize it in the near future. But we just wanted to make it clear that it's part of the same zoning lot and the rear yard of this townhouse is actually the courtyard of the condo building, and so they kind of function as a as again one zoning lot here, renderings of the of what was approved at landmarks for the condo building, 101 West 87th and then on the right-hand side. What was improved initially at 110, West 88th street, so going back in time here, 1940 tax photos you'll see that the 110 was really the one of eight really fantastic eclectic group of row: houses designed by Samuel Reed, initially built in 1886 romanesque revival, style peppered with all manner of different styles and different pieces throughout which we spent a lot of time. Analyzing. And then you see here on the my son. Thank you. We spent a lot of time analyzing on the right hand, side here we have a shot the tax photo, which is actually showing the remnants of the demolition of the original 110 Samuel Reed Building right in 1988. So you can see the debris being hauled away when the tax photo was taken. So the lot to the best of our knowledge has been vacant, since that point here are some more shots of the current state of the site. You'll see that the middle six row, houses of the original eight group of eight by stamina read, are all in pretty good shape. They maintain they've been maintained very well with the exception of the westernmost one over here, which was completely really clad in 1962. So it's kind of more of a modernist appearance right now, as we looked around for design integration, what we felt would be contextually appropriate for the site we went up and down West 88th and throughout the neighborhood, and what's immediately apparent and something you know inside out from dealing with this district on a regular basis, is the amazing kind of texture and fabric of the row, houses and the great rhythm, and what we saw immediately was a balance of unity or unifying features along with diversifying features, and so some of the diversifying features are ones of color or painted brownstone. There's a number of different Bay windows and elements that tend to diversify and kind of individualize each one of the units, so that was something that jumped out at us immediately. The other. The one of the other elements that we looked at was the transition that happens from mid-block to the avenues, and there is kind of a shift in scale and massing and articulation that happens at that transition, so us being the easternmost and right up against Columbus Avenue or the large building at Columbus Avenue, which is 570 Columbus. We looked at this condition. What happens in these? This transition between mid block and block? We looked at the singular material or materiality of a lot of these row houses. How so many different things are articulated with the singular material and thought that that's kind of a beautiful bunching off point and thinking about materiality for the project bay windows? Another you know predominant feature across all of the facades and that very frequently becomes one of those diversifying you know, features on these townhouses and then, of course, Stoops and the idea of kind of a transition from the sidewalk into the home and creating again a transition and a procession into each one of these townhouses. So we knew when we brought this back to do so without a stoop would be a mistake. So in understanding this kind of diversity versus kind of unification, we tried to be very scientific and analytic about it and look at what looks like kind of a hodgepodge of all. These different elements is actually a very finely calibrated balance of features, and so beautiful pediments that really break down to one of three types and then a kind of a rusticated mannerist type base at the bottom, and then the belt coursing, which is continuous. These established datums, where all the windows aligned and all of the windows are the same kind of widthwise horizontally and then very different on a vertical axis, and so here you go. This is starting to kind of set the buildings apart from one another, with the different window, sizes, apertures alignments and so there's a lot of kind of play happening with those elements and when it comes to the color of the facades, we found that throughout a good 15 to 20 of the buildings throughout the this district were actually kind of lighter colors and they were creating that sense of diversity and differentiation and individuality between all of those buildings. So here's some examples. Some of the light facades very frequently again they're painted you know, brown, stone or brick buildings, and so here here's the kind of the first representation of the design that was ultimately approved and is quite different than what we showed you back in late 2013, I. Think one of the big issues that a CB7 at that time had was with the Bay window that we had a projected bay window and I think many felt that it was lacking the charm of a lot of the other, more articulated more traditional bay windows. And so what happened in our conversations with LPC and following your critique was to actually push the Bay Window back. So it wasn't projecting it wasn't as monolithic, and it was more co-planar with the facade and more about the framework. That's around it. The another kind of big feature that I think resonated well with you last time and definitely resonated well with the Landmarks Preservation Commission was that we acknowledged that the punched window, the cadence across the same reed buildings, was of critical importance. But we also know that the that most buyers of property are looking for as much sunlight as possible. Great views and west 88 is no exception to having just beautiful verdant streetscape with trees, and so what we did is we kind of have a band of windows at each one of these floors and these screens that they come down and from the street level, when you're looking up appear to be mostly opaque, but from inside the home at level, you're actually able to see through and get more sunlight and more views from each one of those rooms. So we thought that was kind of a clever way to mitigate those two concerns and observations about how the windows should be continued across with a new building. So here's some more details. The facade proposed is Indiana Limestone and it's done as a rain screen, and so the limestone pieces are very much like bricks that go atop a membrane and the rain screen just means that water is actually allowed to pass behind between the limestone and the shell of the building and so we're shifting scales on the frame and that frame really kind of culminates in this kind of the rusticated base in a more much more contemporary manner. Down below. Along with the stoop, I think, another comment that was made when we presented to you last was that the doors were lacking. Halfton looked a little too commercial because we had initially come in with steel frame, taking your advice into consideration as well as landmarks. We did much thicker wood painted wood doors in windows down below, and so here again, on the right hand side you see the screen that I was speaking of which are limestone slats hi sweetheart. Thank you for presenting, say hi to everybody, I'll be down in a minute. Please just give me a moment. Sorry, everybody! So the these are the limestone slats across the windows, and here is a elevation montage of the site without the building. So this is 110 west 88 site right here and then this is a montage putting the elevation in so you'll see we never truly experience elevation the building in terms of an elevation. So this fifth floor is pushed back 16 feet so I'll show you visibility, studies that show that is actually minimally visible from most vantage points up and down the street. So here we go in alignment again. These this band, coursing and the organization of the facades was a major composition of Samuel, reeds with the original eight buildings, and we want to honor that with this design, so they continue across. You see it each at each location and the stoops at the same elevation, and so that was one of the problems that we had with the what the townhouse that was previously approved that it just kind of disregarded all of these datums and conventions established in the previous buildings. So here is this kind of again more contemporary version of a rusticated base, the thicker framed door entry in into the building and then one other feature just playing off the verdant tree-lined streets of west 88th. We have these integrated flower boxes, so we want that almost to have like a little bit of a dialogue built into the facade, along with the quality of that street. So here's up above again the screen and that's glass behind there and you're actually able to these, are operable and then operable, sashes down below you're able to tend to the flowers and planting. And then this is a detail of what was previously the projected Bay window, showing that we've kind of brought that back in and it shows the scale shift from the base to the kind of body of the building so trying to have that tripartite arrangement of the original, but again more contemporary manner. Here is a site plan, and this is showing the donut of the block, which has been well maintained through the years and the 101 west 87th the large condo building their backyard and then our townhouse of budding that and so that they, this townhouse, will effectively share the amenities in outdoor space of that development, as part of as being a part of the zoning lot and so Lester. Can you speak to this slide? This is just showing the doughnut right. This is just so. This is just the picture of the donut, the back. There got it okay and then these are floor plans showing what it. What was kind of you know quite a challenge. It's a 16 foot wide townhouse. Some people might be skeptical that you can really lay out a townhouse of that size, but we feel very confident very strongly that you can and the layouts work. Great and most buyers are looking for an elevator, so we're able to kind of fit that in there and the stairs I know this isn't quite germane, but just wanted to share here's the building section. It should be noted that the entire building fits within the as of right envelope, which will show in the zoning page, and then these are the visibility studies moving from the east towards the west you'll see that 16 foot setback on that fifth floor renders it minimally visible from every. From most vantage points, you'll see in the case of views, six and seven, which are these two locations. You're able to you know, see just a little bit poking up over the pediments of the adjacent buildings and then finally, the zoning page, showing that we're below Max building height, we're well below far I think Lester we're only about a third of the available, far for the site, if I'm not mistaken, yeah 3.44 and we're at 1.5 I believe got it anyway. That's it that's the presentation and thank you again for allowing us to present tonight. Can we get that the history now are you here, because your permit expired on the original approval? Yes, so it was approved at Lpcc. It was approved at LPC and it expired in March of this year we had been working with LPC to extend that and we missed their deadlines by a matter of two or three weeks. There is an interested party in building this, and so our hope is that in extending this, that deal is culminated and the building is built in the near future. Okay, just I wanted to make sure that our newer members understood what the history was that in fact this was approved at LPC and is now back in essentially the same iteration. Yes, that was approved with a couple of different details. If I may follow on Jay Kay can I follow on Jay. With that, do we lose K? Oh no, okay! Well, then, I'll grant myself permission to do that. It was approved at LPC, but it was over our objection. We heard this in January of 2014 and had a resolution to disapprove. Thank you. I was mistaken. I thought it was approved. It was disapproved by CB7 but approved by LPC, so they are correct in what they said. Just well, there's k: okay, I'm sorry I jumped in when you zoned out yeah. This is the same design. This is their design. They've done a pretty good job of highlighting some of the changes that they made. When we saw it there was a gigantic exterior or protruding or bay window. That looked a lot like a flat screen TV that was on the facade. That's now been recessed and if I may just to continue on that vein to highlight what is the same or different than six and a half years ago, almost seven years ago. At that time the base was not rusticated a brick, but rather some bricks, protruding out and some bricks recessed, and these are roman bricks, if I'm not mistaken, to try to emulate a rusticated effect rather than actually rusticate the bricks. If I'm understanding your presentation today, you're actually you've changed that to actual rusticated bricks on the lower portion of the front. Facade am I correct in that it's not replicated bricks in the traditional sense. It's like a hammered finish Indiana Limestone rain screen, so it gives the effect the there's a scale shift and a finish shift on the stone. So yes, it's where it can. What we had showed you previously was kind of an undulating base and landmarks was no fan of that, and so a lot of the changes just to be clear. What you disapproved was kind of different than what we eventually got approved at landmarks. So we came back a second time to landmarks, coupling both your comments and their comments and that's what led to what we presented to you tonight. Just got it okay, so the rain screen was a part of your presentation back then, which is what yeah, but there was also that undulating brick effect, which now you have substituted with something else, and then you highlighted the wood versus the main, the middle main door and but in terms of the massing and the volume and the I want to say geometry, but the shape of the building from the street. What you've presented other than the things that you just highlighted is more or less what was presented back then I think there was one other change and I think that the impediment that we had showed you previously, you weren't that enthused about either and that was kind of a superimposition of the kind of gable form across the flat pediments. It was a kind of a hybrid and I think somebody actually called it, the ghost of pediments past or something along those lines. You just refreshed my memory, I called it I believe that was me. Okay, I'll shut up now, I just wanted to make sure that we highlighted well I, just wanted to say I really had mark, has a better memory than I. Do I, don't I apologize, because I should have gone back to see if I could dig up all of the history and but I didn't, but Mark's filled in well I. My memory is okay, but it was only extended so far as to be able to find on our website the resolution that we passed back then so anyway, I have it in front of me. If anybody cares but I'll, I'm sorry to interrupt and I'll give it back to the committee. Can we get the rendering up on the screen again for everybody's benefit? Question: do the slots have a purpose or are they just they're decorative yeah? The purpose is both kind of almost like a solar shield of sorts, but since it's not direct sunlight, north it'll just kind of serve as almost like a blind but more importantly, we really wanted to maintain the cadence of the punched openings across the other seven row houses, and so we thought this was a clever way to accomplish that from the street level. When you're looking up those slats actually look a little bit more solid, but from the from being inside the room. Looking out, it's actually 50 open, so you appear to have much larger window and in view of the street, so let me get the are you able to turn to the slide that shows the proposed complete proposal as compared? That's what I'm looking for yeah, the rendering yeah there we go here. It is there we go. That's a good one, no more pediment yep, and we can't. We came back with the cornice. That again is contemporary, but it still has kind of enough half to cap off the serve as kind of the head of the building with the base and body. Can you show more of the facade of 88th street how it fits with the other brownstones to the West, show the context photos that we have well. You could also bring up the elevation that shows the street elevation right. Yeah I think this one's better, because it's you know: okay, the whole block. So again it doesn't look like these buildings per se, but it tries to capitalize on and utilize some of the design devices at play right when we looked at it. It's a balance of elements that try to make all of these buildings. Look the same right and that's lining up the windows, the band coursing, the cornices, the base, like there's certain elements that are repeated on all of them, and then there are elements that are different on all of them to kind of set them apart. You've got the color. You've got different types of bay projections, different stoop articulation, and so it's kind of a balance of those two elements and the composition is finding that balance. So we did that, but we did it more. So in a modern vernacular where it's you know, it appears a little bit simpler. But again it's still trying to use these devices throughout. So it has the same dna but decidedly a more of a reflection of how we build today, rather than you know, doing a brownstone if I make a k. Just a brief comment for the benefit more of our the newer members of our committee, because you look at this proposed design and I think certainly initially it's jarring as far as its place on this role of Brownstone's eye- and this is just a matter of information- I'm not rendering an opinion on it, but landmarks as they do with rear yard and rooftop editions and, in this particular case, looks upon these new additions to this streetscape favorably, when the newness, if you will of the design, is clear when you do it, as in this case a new building or a new rear yard edition or rooftop petition, they look favorably upon the distinction between historical and modern, so what we might initially think of as jarring and out of place, they often as they did in this case. Look favorably on a modern design, superimposed onto a historical streetscape and the proof of the pudding is in the eating because they approved it with some minor changes. So just that's just informational as to how landmarks, what it's not a comment upon, what we should do, but how landmarks receives these proposals? You mentioned uniformity. You looked to build uniformity across some of the representations in the in front of us here on the screen in the and the proposal. Can you go back to a slot? This slide that notes the increase in height of the townhouse as it relates to the their neighboring buildings. Sure I think the rendering shows that well, the rendering shows that I think you're, probably yeah specifically. What are these like exactly? Okay, exactly so the uniformity really has to do with primarily the band coursing. You see, there's a very strong datum here and one of the problems we had with the vine that was approved before us. The brick one that I showed you in the beginning is that there was zero regard for those levels and it was actually kind of a taller building than what we're proposing, and so we felt that there's way too much good stuff happening and there's way too much of an incredible precedent established with the Samuel Reed buildings. To not have that be the framework by which we complete our design. So that's happening here and I guess you know the concern about its height. Is yes, it's a little bit taller, but this fifth story is negligible. Well, given it's 60 feet back and with the visibility studies that we showed is really a non-factor. So it's really just about this distance and we're trying to kind of keep that the same as the pediments all, albeit it's a little bit taller. The other reason that I think landmarks was fine with this, and we came to this conclusion is that we are the easternmost of the eight townhouses and we serve as kind of the transition to this larger scale, buildings that happen along Columbus Avenue, and so they agreed that there can be a transition kind of a gradual step up happening to that larger volume that that's appropriate and with precedent related to uniformity. If you don't mind one other question, when I look at the buildings to your right, the townhouse is to your right, I notice, quite a bit of arch and roundedness to a number of the designs, and I'm wondering if they're applied to the design being presented or if they are aware they are being applied to the proposal. No, we did not go with the arches in this kind of contemporary vernacular that we're using the arch is a little bit foreign and I think that there's ample precedent among these, where you know sections of buildings where it's entirely rectilinear, so I think the fact that it is rectilinear doesn't utilize the arch kind of plays to the diversity. It's one of those again a balance of things that are the same, a balance of things that are quite different and so that you're absolutely right, the you know the arches, even the one here that has no arches per se. Still has you know this eyebrow above the windows here so they're every one of them does have you know that feature, but we felt that wasn't really in line with the vernacular we were trying to establish as kind of a contemporary or a reflection of contemporary building technology and aesthetics and whatnot I have a question about the roof. The top floor. I'm a little confused from this picture. I know it's a little foggy there is that one very tall floor and does it slope back or is it it's recess yeah? If we go back to the rendering or variate the visibility studies here that rendering is misleading, it indicates that that's visible, full height match, but it's actually set back exactly. The elevation has no horizon line. It's not really flat on every floor, so you never experience a building that way what you see up on my screen right now is the most visible that fifth floor will be from up and down West 88th that pink right here that she managed that literally just putting a piece above the pink. Yes is what would be visible yeah. It looks different from the front yeah those flat on elevations. We get that all the time it makes me it makes the rooftop editions. Look like just another story. It makes them look scary, but it's really not. We like to avoid those drawings when we can no they're, always somewhat misleading right. Other thoughts mark well, I think Paige had her hand up first, but yeah, sorry, I've been gone and I'm back on. Peter has his hand up too yeah. Okay, yeah I have oh I'd like to comment about the one thing I think that needs some work as the is the fourth floor, I think different from the townhouses to the west. It's one floor higher and it acts as a kind of a go-between between the townhouses and the entertainment building to the east, but I think there's a missed opportunity here to do something different at the top floor. If no other way than doing something with a brickwork you the way you see the building, you don't see it head-on. You do see the blank wall facing to the west and you'll see that quite a bit from other parts of 88th street and that's going to be fairly jarring. In my opinion, it's like a big blank whitish wall, this right here, yeah right there above the brownstones or the townhouses to the west, and it looms up there and yet the building the tenement building to the east. The good thing about it is at least it has the same coloration of the brownstones or the four-story buildings to the west, and so this, whereas I'm not against the colors of the building per se, because, as you pointed out, there are quite a few of the townhouses that are a lighter color between the reddish and brown other buildings. But it's the top floor that I think needs work and it could be done fairly easily with the brickwork, with a different kind of brick work or something special up there to recognize that it's a transition, it's both a floor and a transition as a transition to the top and as a transition between the three and four-story buildings from the west to the five four or five-story building to the east. So I think there's an opportunity without a major change to do something different at the top floor. I think that I think that's a very fair comment and what's not visible in any of the kind of renderings here, is that there actually is a material shift that we know that one of the kind of established methods of building in this neighborhood and a lot of neighborhoods around Manhattan is that you do a primary material on the street face and you might wrap it around, say the 12:18 inches and then go to a lesser grade material, and so we're planning to do that here, where the limestone wraps that 18 inches and then we switch to a brick. That is the same kind of buff or sandy color of the limestone. So we are gonna have kind of a material shift that happens there. That I think will speak to what you're talking about. So you don't have this monolithic presence, I think you're going to have a much different kind of text related. I'm talking about the front facade too, not just the sides, in other words the fourth floor. It's typical that there are caps to buildings, sometimes a whole floor. Sometimes the windows change, but I. Think in this a mansard arrangement with a brick. You know: okay, Paige hi, thanks for the record, I didn't vote for this last time and I for all the changes that you made. I now had a chance to look at the previous design and this one and I'm going to start off with two questions and then I'll just give you my reaction. First question is against the 100 tenement 100 West 88th Street is the return wall that faces that tenement building faced in the same material as the facade or is it a lesser grand material I know you don't see it unless you're walking from the east to the West, but the party wall, where the gap is between the two buildings? What is that East wall made of the oh, the party, our party wall? That's also brick, so it's the same as the front, but no the limestone will go all the way across the facade and wrap back 18 inches and then we'll transition into the wreck all the way back on both the east and my sides of the townhouse. Sorry, you your voice, trailed off. No, I'm sorry after 18 inches to what material limestone back, 18 inches, then brick, the remainder of the West and East elevations, okay and then the other question is: could you pull up the plan on the parlor floor sure and the reason why I wanted to look at that for the entrance? I think it's the second one of the problems with the height of this building is the fact that you've chosen not to put a basement level in but start with a seller and then grow the building with a typical parlor floor height, and then you keep going repeating the same height and the thing that disturbs me that to be honest, when I looked at this before it didn't dawn on me, but because you use so much of the center of the building for storage, elevator and stairwell that when you actually enter that room, that great big window, which you say is going to be sun filled heads up, it's not, it faces north, it's cold and it's blocked by the tall building on Amsterdam is that big window on this? On the parlor floor that window there is nothing but a grand hallway, and it seems to me that some of the things that you've put in this proposal, a lot of the facade treatment, is glorifying spaces that are really secondary. You know on the ground floor and I'm being very critical and I apologize, but these are my observations. You have a large foyer, I'm not quite sure what the use of the room is on the second floor. I can't read, it just says: second, family room and those. If those are bedrooms they, how is somebody if it is a bedroom going to have privacy as you look, because you're going to be looking into another large building will be spying on the openness of the these floor plans with these huge windows. So that's an observation because I think having designed the floor plans this way, it creates problems on the facade and now, if we could go back to the facade, there are two things that really disturb me on this one. First of all, in my life studying historic buildings and contexts, this reminds me of I. Don't know an infill design in war, war-torn Amsterdam after the war where they had to quickly throw up very modern buildings, and the problem here is as Peter and others. My colleagues have suggested in Jay is one of scale. I mean you could take the Bay window of the building at what is it 112 and put it in the bay when it would fit right through the bay. Your large glass opening there there's just one of one wonders the size of the people that are going to be upstairs with the diminutive door and something that is akin to its neighbors in alignment. But I have a real problem with scale. I have a real problem, I think rain screens are great in certain areas and there I know that's the big thing right now for sustainability and the transition with these beautiful little bricks, but I, don't think you're doing enough justice to it. I'd rather see more of your stone bricks than more of these. The glass windows and I agree with Peter the fact that the top floor of this building- you have this, these large windows, and then you have what I would assume is about eight feet of cornice, a blank wall with a parapet and then the setback for something even bigger at the back side. I just think it's I said before and I haven't, sadly changed my mind that to me this the standard benchmark for quality infill design in a historic district. I'm not saying you have to copy the Queen Anne style or whatever, but this one is just it's too muscular. In my opinion the ground floor, I, don't recall it seems improved from where it was before, but the upper three floors just look like frankly a mistake on the block. Apart from the use of the stone it, it's a misfit and I can't support this. I'm very sorry, as an architect, I know the effort you've put into it. I heard every word. You carefully chose to describe each of these elements, but there's nothing here. That is a precedent or a material or a detail, or a measurement or a treatment that follows any of the quality that exists on our street and I live down the street on the sunny side, not the Chad away side. So I, don't think your tree is going to grow. I. Think it's I think you just need to rethink. You're facing north you've got you're tucked into two beautiful brick articulated buildings, and this just screams I'm different. So I'm sorry, but now you know my thoughts thanks, Paige anybody else, questions, thoughts, Jay has his hand up and then, if I could be heard, yeah I had something k when you get a chance, yeah go ahead, yeah I just now, and let me preface it by saying that my design skills, my artistic skills, don't extend much beyond stick figures, but I wanted to focus on that big window. Again, it's all coming back to me in droves and I think, following up a little bit on what Paige said about a bay window, accepting the overall design of the facade I, don't I still think that large picture window is. It just doesn't seem to reflect any kind of consistency with the design of the adjacent, brownstones and I. Don't see why the Bay window that we didn't like the first time around was essentially because it just stuck out like a big TV screen and it wasn't much of a design element, but I don't see why this that window couldn't be and I. Maybe asked Peter or page what the correct term is for the Bay Window with the two slanty sides and the straight front: if there's a name for it with some division there, I'm sorry I, think you're describing a classic Bay window right, yeah, I, don't I didn't know if there was a particular term for that shape. Absolutely yeah that kind of shape with the division, I think, would still fit the overall design of the facade, but would soften it somewhat and integrate it more into that row because to me it still looks like just a giant void. If you will eve in the context of the facade as it's designed and it's still I still find it jarring and disturbing thanks Jake Mark, you had the thought well in the interim, Susan raised your hand and I think I should wait until after the committee has spoken. So if it's okay, all right, Susan I'll, be brief. Everything Paige said times: 20. Okay, then thank you. So I guess! I'm up! You are oh, so I approach this from I want to introduce one more concept here, and that is that this is not the first time we've seen this application and while it has changed a bit from what we saw before I'm concerned about precedent and I say that with what I would I hope will convey, is respect for the architects and their process here, because we saw the results of their study, there's the alignment of window heights and dimensions so that they are attempting in their modern way to conform to the patterns that they see on the group of eight of which this well, the group of seven of which this is the missing. Eighth, as well as other designs, further down further west on the block and I respect that effort, even if I don't support the design that they've come up with and I do not I, don't for many of the reasons that have already been articulated, although the additional element that I want to add is that the big changes that we've seen in this design from the one we saw in January of 2014 are the recess rather than the exterior protrusion of the Bay Window. The changing of that undulating brick for a more rusticated effect and some welcome changes to the front entrance and especially the main door. All those things notwithstanding, the key bases of our resolution not to approve I, think still obtain here. I'm just going to read one sentence from our disapproval from 2014, which read that which recited the at that time: an appreciation for the research and effort made by the architects at the time. But the conclusion was that we believe that the proposed design of the new row house is over scaled for its context. Overly formal and rectilinear in its design, too, cool in its materials and color palette and lacks the whimsy warmth and variety of its neighbors and I. Think that still obtains here and while I have every reason to believe that these architects are back before us because of the reasons that they stated and not to try to take a second bite at the same apple. My concern is that we should be true to a decision that we've already made unless there is a change that prompts a reconsideration and for many of the reasons that have been shared so far, I don't see a material enough. That's probably a pun. Isn't it I, don't see a significant enough change in the design here versus the one that we considered and disapproved in 2014 to merit a different conclusion: I would like us to be consistent in our appraisals of things that we see I. Think this committee does a wonderful job of trying to rationalize whether something is the same or different than a different president, and so for that reason, I can't find my way to approving it, even as there are other more erudite reasons to disapprove that others have articulated. That's my concern that I would add without repeating others. Thank you mark, okay, other thoughts bench one last one that is a very narrow lot. How wide is the house 16 feet and it's very tall and top-heavy for that spot? It's my film, okay, thank you. Peter. Was that the start of a comment, or that was the stuff yeah I, whereas I focused on the fourth floor, I'm in agreement with the other members of the committee and in principle, I think that one of the problems here is not so much the bulk of the building necessarily, but it's a combination of the bulk of the building and the choice of the material which makes it stand out so much I mean just looking at the photo we're looking at now. It says: look at me how modern and how new I am. You know, and that's not exactly what this block needs. I have to echo what Paige said: I'm I also live on the block, and whereas there are, as we saw in the photos, a number of townhouses that are light, gray and not necessarily red. There are other reasons they fit in so well, because they carry on the same roof line because they carry on many of the same details, just a different material or a different color. But this is all those things you know it's like it's positioned here like it came in for Mars and it doesn't relate to the building to the east and doesn't relate much to the buildings to the west and I. Think it's easy to do it by changing the material that would go a long way by my thinking. Okay, thank you. Peter. Is that everything yeah anybody else, I guess what I find disturbing about it most is that big window on the second floor for the family, room and I do agree with Paige that the rooms behind are gonna just feel dwarfed by the window, on the parlor floor and on the family window. The rest of it, I'm not loving, but I, could probably go along with some of it all right. So where are we at? Somebody should make a resolution I think we should disapprove okay, Susan Great. Do you want to say anything more about that or just no carry on Kay? We had such flowery language in the you know, one six or seven years ago, but the reason why you can't append the one from seven years ago to what you're doing now I sense that we would want to do that yeah. All right. Do people understand where we're at yes, the motion is to disapprove. Yes, it is, but for the reasons that you've already articulated, indeed that we've gotten down, let's start with Peter I disapprove okay, so you agree with the resolution to disapprove. Yes, okay, match approve. I agree, you agree with Peter I heard approved. Jay are you along for the ride yeah? We can't hear you yes, okay done. Yes, okay and Susan made the resolution. I assume she's I agree with myself. Yes, you agree with yourself. I have to I agree with you as well said everybody. Who else did you ask me edge? I did yeah. I did I agree as well, and there's Josh. Okay, thanks I knew we were here. Yes, you disappeared from my screen and now you're back okay. So that's seven to zero. Yes, okay and page agree. Okay done I, agree and I with regret, but I do agree. Yes, yeah exactly mark I go yes! Okay! Is there a date with landmarks? Yes, January 19th, okay, so you'll have a full board, so this will be presented at full board on January 5th. You're, welcome to come and offer comments at that time. The, but Kay and Michelle will be the ones to present the resolution. But, of course, you're welcome to speak, okay. Well, thank you and thanks again for getting us in tonight. We really appreciate it. Okay, all right! Thank you for your time as well. All right, I think that concludes our business. Happy holidays, everybody! Well, the other side. Thank you for letting me crash your party, I'm glad. I was hoping for something better and I'm sad that they didn't modify it I. If just some movement would have given me reassurance, like Peter, said the color or the material or something but yeah I, just don't see it on our street I, don't live in your street and I. Don't see it either yeah if you crash nothing, Paige, yes, always a better party when you're here, oh god, I better start behaving right, I, don't know! No! Don't do that I, wonder who you are I dog all the time you start behaving we're going to have to send you to community board eight yikes, listen, happy holidays! Everyone! Thank you! Good night. All right see you all on Jan, Fifth. Okay, no we'll see you all on Tuesday I hope! Oh on Tuesday. Oh I'm jumping the gun, yeah. Okay. As an added inducement, I'm hoping that we will have a presentation on Tuesday about the exonerated five who used to be the central park five and an effort to have some kind of exhibit that would memorialize their plight in or near central park. I will confirm that and get that out tomorrow, but added reason to come to make a quorum for receiving nominations. Next, Tuesday, lots of reasons see you all there. Thank you. Okay, bye.
