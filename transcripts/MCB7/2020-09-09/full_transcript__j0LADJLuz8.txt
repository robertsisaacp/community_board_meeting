So you want to make me a co-host, yeah I'll. Do it right now, because I'm actually going to only hang out for a few minutes and then I'm going to because you just have a pretty regular meeting right, barbara, hey barbara. So then you need to maybe the host. Then I will yeah hey barbara, all right chris. So are you actually in the woods? Is that just a background I said: are you actually on the woods or is that the background? No, it's I'm! Actually, I'm in my apartment with the terrace here say barbara. I had a nice chat with peter wright the other day that was so nice that you bothered to go over there and see him. We have a meeting set up. I've been in touch with bill castro a few times about the issue, and we have a meeting set up he's not going to be at it, but he's sending his deputy and and and matt genrich, and we invited people from the bull run. The bull moose heads there's two co-chairs and another. So you know I we want to go over it. I have our provided trees on my terrace I'll, show you there they're here. Can you see them there, yeah, okay, yeah and they're amazing and first of all, I got them because my terrace adjoins the main terrace for the building, the common terrace, and occasionally there are parties there and they're really noisy, and it was suggested to me that if I planted these, it would help with the sound mitigation and in fact it does tremendously they're, also beautiful and they they're very fast growing. They grow about. You know between 18 inches and two feet a year generally. Oh that's good, and they are so healthy that it's remarkable. So yours are nicely shaped. Do you trim them or they just kind of grow that way? Oh, they absolutely grow this way and they sort of split off. You see it started. They each had one cone on the top. Can you see where I'm going was a little higher yeah a little higher there we go. Oh there, you go okay, yeah, so there I love them and I had suggested them and we did some research looked into it. There's tons of articles on the internet about how arbor vitae is a perfect evergreen because it's dense because and for sound mitigation so and that's what we wanted for, but I think that you know if bill is not very positive about this. By the way he thinks that you know the parks may turn this whole project down, even though friends of roosevelt park will pay for it in its entirety. So I don't know I've been going back and forth with him and we'll see I mean we understand you know bill was told, even though it may not be so that we can't plant outside the fence in that corridor between the garage and right. What peter was showing me was planting inside the fence. So that's what we'd like to do. It doesn't take up that much room and it really doesn't- and you know it will be in back of the trees in any case, that the existing trees that are there- and I think you know if the if dogs occasionally pee on them- it's not going to hurt them they're very hardy, and you know they will be get natural watering and stuff and also there's a there's the sprinkling system there. So I think it they'll be fine. Anyway, that's what we're hoping to do and I've spent a tremendous amount of time on this, so I really hope it gets somewhere. Yeah clary mentioned that she had gone over there just to take a look-see as well, so hopefully, she'll have a basis of understanding. Meanwhile, I did see the gravel issue that some people are raising yeah. Most of the pea gravel is just fine for dogs, but there were some little ducks well, there are stones like this and I don't know if they're just legacy from the old surface or what, but I sure wouldn't want to walk on that on a barefoot so yeah and peter has spoken to. He may have told you this: he spoke to the people who run three different dog runs and got recommendations, and they say it's an easy fix with two to three inches of a pea: gravel, that's in the smaller size. So hopefully that's that won't be an issue. No crushed fingers. They've probably spent the budget twice over, but so it's not that expensive. I don't think so. So christian do you know how to let people in as attendees, because I or start the recording well, like I click broadcast to start the recording is this. I don't see it saying right. Well, you know you know, let me let me make alcohol hold on. No, it took it. It's recording now, yeah right and we already went, live on youtube right. It's recording! I just haven't. I haven't clicked broadcast yet, okay, so you get the broadcast thing right. So right, you'll do you'll. Do that whenever you're ready right, very good.

You can take a look at it and sure, and yeah christian sent me the templates, so we're good, I'm actually at my folks house right now, so that I don't have my whole setup here, which is jerry. I think you're. The only one who has a template who bothers to set that up that's very helpful, very helpful yeah. I created a template years ago. We've been using it over and over again hey. So this is an apropos, 25 indoor, dining coming back huh. Yes, I know without that wow you know I put something on facebook saturday we were in piermont and you know who I heard from tim mellon, because I said they can do this 12 miles north of Manhattan, but we can't do this in Manhattan safely. Come on, oh, I did. I saw his comment. Yes yeah. I was like hey cool yeah, so do we don't have we have one two, three, four, five: six. We have a quorum right. Do we have folks here who are jerry? It's not even 6 30, I'm sorry! No! I just started the broadcasting, so the attendance should start coming on christian.

He can't hear you. Oh, you may be hurt. Is he muted, by the way, if you press your moot button m-o-o-t anything that you say doesn't make a lot of sense or is just not your main you're, not muted josh is not muted. Nobody got my joke.

We found his voice all right, okay, something like that. Yeah! You know if you burst into singing it's okay, we're good with that. Okay, in the back it's background, that's not pushing the compass avenue song. Let's have a new yeah they're doing some wild things there too, but we've got a forum. Yes, we do. You know seaman's not coming we're, not sure if andrew's going to make it, because it's a little busy a little bit and let's see who's, paul fisher, hey donald, paul fisher, we're just we're missing three people, but I think we're okay. What are you? Are you good with this christian? Yes, we are, let's give it. Let's give it one more minute before we start hi, jeff, hey hello, hey guys, hi, nice, handwork you're in your car yeah I pulled over. Don't worry, be safe. We want you to stay safe, oh my god. I'll make a more fun background. Yeah! Oh that's nice! I'm gonna go buy some right away, much better I'll meet you there, linda by the way this dog is not in the supermarket. That's a fake background. That's a great job too! Don't call the health department. Oh hey! I should get my gal in here. I should get my nosey rosy beady in here and then we'll really. This is a big background that I've got too it's like. This is not really home good to see you abby. I think the last time we saw each other. We were both wearing masks in us in a store. Oh yeah. I've got a whole bowl of masks behind me. I can't wait to tell this ends yeah. I think we all agree. Okay, christian! Are we good? Yes, we're good? I don't see anybody from 373 columbus here yet well now, let's see who's christian and linda, I'm gonna. Leave you to it. If you need me, just text me and I'll zoom back in okay, really yeah, I'm going to the cec meeting going to find out how they're reopening schools great thanks for joining us briefly mark okay. So why don't we start with 25 right yeah? Let's start with that since they're here somebody here we're here, can you hear me hi? Yes, how are you good? How are you, okay, so manny? I see you're on manny. Can you hear us manny, you gotta unmute yourself, so my client manny colon is while he's trying to get on. I hope you can hear us. I think you know manny. So this is the bistro casey space. I think it's been licensed on columbus between 70th and 71st for about 15 years and manny has been working there for just. I believe that, entire time the opportunity has now come for him to take over that space, the prior current owner is leaving and manny has signed the lease for that space with a new company and he's going to effectively take over the operation and and run with it the it's going to be pretty much what you've seen in terms of size, it's 21 tables, 52 seats, there's one bar and far four stools, we'll apply for a transfer of the sidewalk cafe permit. I think it has six tables and 14 seats whenever DCA gets back involved in issuing cafe permits the hours are until 1 a.m. I don't even know that he's going to be open that late, but we're asking for a 1 a.m. Hard close and weekend. Okay yeah, I mean you're sure you're very familiar with the space. That's the application very familiar it is, it is built out and as soon as manny gets the approval from the sla we're going to open. I'm sure you all know at this point that governor Cuomo announced indoor reopening at the end of this month. So as soon as we get our license, we're going to go with it. So I don't know. I don't think I've made this request of this board before. But if you do vote to approve this, as I hope you will, I'm asking that you consider giving us a letter waiving the 30-day waiting period, because the sooner we can file the sooner he can get this license. Otherwise, he's going to be sitting with a fully built out restaurant with dead space effect belief for six months. That would not be a problem because we have to bring it to full board but yeah, but for the 30-day waiver that john has been doing, though so yeah, that's, not an issue. We can do that. Okay, so we'll write a letter to waiver donald emailed john martinez, and I will email him to requesting the 30-day waiver. Okay, we'll do we'll do that tomorrow and is money. What's my position is the owner? He would be the owner, okay, you're muted. Do you want to say anything? Can you pull yourself off mute? You should be able to see a button on the upper right hand, corner manny that says unmute lower left hand lower left too yeah. Can you hear me now yeah, congratulations, hello, everybody! How are you nice to see you again yeah? So I you know I took over the place. The other guys are gone, and hopefully I can open up soon again and bring all my loyal employees back and have some great food for all my loyal guests again and I'm so looking forward. You know I've been here for 16 years and I've been to many meetings with you guys and everybody is so excited. I walk down the street and everybody's stopping me. When are you going to open? When are you going to open? So it's going to be great. It's going to be the same food same team, just a different name. It's a different name. You mean, but it's still going to be bistro we're going to be french food. It's not going to be bistro cassis anymore, because the other company that had bishop assists they have one in long island and it's their name. So I have to have a new dba, but you know it's going to be the same crew, the same people pretty much. Looking the same, it's going to be a little cosmetic work. It's going to look really nice! We're painting right now, as I'm speaking to you, and I can't wait to open, I'm so excited and looking forward to seeing all you guys when we reopen excellent, you will you will and then you know it's 25 for the time being. But then, after that you know, you'll be packed and packed and packed. Yes, mr gas is over. Have you ever been already self-certified for your street seats? I hope you do that as soon as you can. Yes, I will we plan on opening up and when, in the meantime, what about deliveries would there be another only license we're hoping to you know, get that expedited as quick as we can, because it's hard to operate without wine yeah. Yes, manny they're, asking about deliveries, nice we're breaking up manny. We do local deliveries, we just go a couple of block seas, couple of blocks west north south and we may do a little grub hub. Okay, so you're talking about self delivery, short distances and may do third party. Okay. Yes, we don't. We don't do bicycles because it's too dangerous. We just like to go on foot couple of blocks here and there and only background music right. Yes, that's it is there. Is there anyone from the okay? Is there anyone from? Is there anyone from the public? Who would like to speak about this? I'd like to speak about it yeah is that okay yeah go ahead? Yes, okay, hi manny, it's barbara! I assume you recognize me from the columbus avenue bid. Manny is a fantastic operator. I you know. I can't say enough good things about him, but I have one small question and that is that I don't remember any recorded music in your workplace and I'm concerned only about the you know having no sound proofing and I'm wondering if you always had music- and I just didn't notice it. Maybe or what the story is there, it's so low because it's light background music. We just have a couple of speakers because most of my guests prefer not to have music, so we keep it very low and actually I live upstairs, but you know: listen, oh, you do 12 foot ceiling and so but we never raised them your neighbors, my guests, that's great news! Okay, thank you for asking mark miller, just wrote in the chat that he's going to send the template for the 30-day waiver. So I guess it'll be great, appreciate it every week counts! Okay! Should we call the question? Yes? Okay, all those in favor. Please raise your hand, that's a one two, three four yeah! Yes, six andrew, yes, okay, seven so that'll be seven zero, unknown committee members, one zero, so the ball passes. We wish you good luck and we'll move on to the next one. Thank you good to see you all the best here good to see you are you sticking around donald duck? Do you have other? No, that's all right. That's all I've got for now. Okay! Well, listen! I put this on just for you now I get to hang it up again. Well good night, good night. Thank you! Okay! So we have now 375 amsterdam, 373. Amsterdam! Are you here? Yes, we're here hi! This is tamara, I'm the owner of mama on the 14th street and we're very much looking forward to upper west side, location to 373. Amsterdam avenue. Do you have another restaurant huh and where is it again? It's on 14th street, between 7 and 6 avenue. The exact address is 149 west 14th street. So this is great any questions. What's going on about the how many, how many seats well we're keeping it below 75 and that's it, but right now we're doing the 25 capacity with the news, and hopefully it's going to be more in November and we're just going to go with the guidelines. I see he says that you're going to do a live acoustic, music, no people might do the live. Autistic music. The application does say that with a double foam ceiling. Yes, well we're going to have speakers, so you mean it's recorded music. Is that what it is recorded or live recorded? Ah, okay, all right do you, wanna did you is your attorney here? You wanna? Yes, I'm sorry you're having some technical difficulties. Okay, I am here yeah, so the for the most part. So this is tamara's second location of trauma mama. The first is downtown as she mentioned, and so the method of operation is essentially the same neighborhood restaurant and we pretty much like originally. She had mentioned that she was going to have some live acoustic music occasionally, so we included that on this application. If she's changing that now, then we can wait. We can switch that out unless you still want to have the option to do that. Of course, the option is always good to have, but from my operation we usually have the background music. So, okay, but it's not live. It's background music and I can't it's all background music yeah, it's background, not beyond music, and I I'm looking for you. I guess the question: is you want to change the mlo now or leave it as is yeah? I guess we'll go ahead and change that now. Okay, I'm having a hard time looking up. I've got all this paperwork in front of me. So just can you tell me what your hours of operation are? I know I should be looking at this, but is the application says: 11 a.m to 12 a.m, monday, through friday, monday through fridays and saturdays 10 a.m, to 12 a.m and sundays. 10 a.m to 12 a.m? Also, okay. This is the former lavella space right, yeah, okay, and when you, when you plan to open this, is very exciting, not quite coupons, yeah, exactly where we're shooting and we're trying our best to do it probably end of year or very early next year, but we're working very hard, we're very excited and all the chamama fans are super happy to hear about the upper west side location, so we're trying our best to make it happen really soon. Right! Wonderful! Is anyone here from the public to speak about this? Okay, anybody from the committee all right hold the question, then. Second, all those in favor raise your hand. Committee members we have one two three four josh is five. Madeline is six? Yes, seven! Okay, that's seven: zero! No committee members, I'm just listening. Okay obtaining them abstain! Thank you! Okay! So, let's make that zero! Two zero yeah! No committee members, where's your q, excuse zero. Two zero yeah, two zero wait: who's, the other one, I'm stating mark it's he's online there, but okay, one two: zero: where do we have to include marketing? Okay? So we won't include him, then no, I I'll go yes, okay, great! Okay! So now sorry about that, doug is one for non-committee voting members, one zero one, zero mark! The recording won't stop. If you leave, it told me that it would I'm gonna I'll try to leave yeah. I can try leaving again and if you can make it record, then now you know just leave it and then just leave it. Okay, we'll do it. Okay, use a different computer for the other meeting. Okay, and here we are at 201 west 106th street, kimberly summers- not here yet not here. Yet anybody, apparently we don't have anyone for tools for them. Just I'd like to speak in favor, okay, peter area hi, just they I've texted them to, and I hope that they're gonna show up in a moment, but it's a husband and wife couple that have calaveras cafe on columbus that they just opened within the past two months. I believe and before that they had the calaveras over in the old lura space on columbus avenue, between 106th and 107th and they're, taking over the ellington space on 106th and amsterdam. Yeah ellington is moving over to the old henry's space and they still have ellington in the park right. So I just it's a lovely couple, they're doing a great job over there in a difficult time and they I would like to support them. That's all! That's great! Okay, so noted. Thank you. So the next one also is an ocean right now to west 69th street. I don't believe they're here either. Okay, so we're gonna have to come back to them at the end of the. Let's not forget that we've got to come back home at the end of the thing so moving on, we have 15 west end avenue, hi max bulkman. Here I had two applications tonight I got 15 west end. I also have car mines. Can we just do car mines first, so jeff can get back to driving. Yes, we can should take two seconds. We don't want them getting any kicks. Just needs! No introduction. Excuse me before you continue. We have a question from the public. Let me see: what's that's about mario basses, you can speak now. You submit yourself, oh hi. I know I just wanted to say that I'm here to represent to 69th street. Yes, okay, so so we we will we'll do you after after max. Okay, no problem. Thank you yeah! Thank you. So so I was introducing jeff by saying he needs no introduction. Everyone knows carmine's. This is an application. This is yeah. I don't even know why I'm here with him to be honest, but this is an application, an alteration application to the liquor authority. Jeff has taken over what used to be lauren vidal next door to carmine's. It was the clothing boutique. They went out of business. He took the lease and everyone who knows carmine's knows that there could always they could always use more room down in the front there, and so he's opened up into that space to create not only a more expanded lobby area, but to focus it on that new area on takeout and delivery, which he's doing so much more of these days and so to make it a more seamless process for takeout and delivery. He's utilizing that space because he is expanding the footprint of the restaurant as small as that expansion may be. It requires an application to the liquor authority and that's why we're here. I just want to be on record that that's my drawing, so if anyone has a problem with that, take full responsibility for the napkin, drawing that my lawyer yelled at me about everything. This was the second version you should have seen the first version, I'm gonna put it. I want you to put it on your refrigerator. You should be very proud. I tried budget these days, so you know it's a small space, we're not planning on it has nothing to do with. You know we're not increasing our bar we're not increasing tables we're not doing anything differently. I think I'll just give a little more comfort to if we ever get back to 100 of occupancy and it'll make sending takeout orders easier. It's just a technicality that I had to file it for the liquor authority. This is not about increasing a bar business at all. I don't see any comments here from the public. Any questions from the committee well I'll close the question. Second, okay, all those in favor there's a one, two three four of joseph's: five motherland: six android u7! Yes, okay! So that's seven! Zero! No committee, members, luisa! Yes, okay, great! Okay! So that's one zero! Thank you guys! Thank you! Jeff get back to driving! Well done! Thank you! Everyone stay safe and be careful of all the marinara sauce behind you yeah exactly nice to see you thank you guys stay safe, so my second application is 15 west end avenue, that's morton williams, their, but their corporate name for the papers you have is ivory and white markets inc, but it's morton williams on west end avenue. Many of you know avi kaner, he's here on the call with us, so morton williams on their west avenue location that supermarket's been in business for what two years obvi, maybe three one year really no this year has felt like a decade, so it seems like it's longer than it has been so they're currently licensed the entire space, both the supermarket and morty's bar, which is next to it, but the whole con next to contain contiguous the whole space is currently licensed for one giant on-premises license, and there was some logic to doing it that way. Initially and theoretically. That means that someone, while they're shopping for the groceries, could have a glass of wine, even though that's not what they do and- and you know- and that was never really the plan. What we're looking to do now is two things. One is that we are going to file an alteration application with the liquor authority to reduce the boundaries of the premises, we're reducing the scope of the premises. So if you see the screen that you know that christian shared over there all you're seeing there now is morty's wine bar that's on the left, that's the indoor space and to the right. You see the outdoor area in that plaza that we've had since Covid-19 started, and we want to make permanent, so no more supermarket as part of our liquor license. We're chopping that off and you can see that at the top of the screen there through those doors, that's the supermarket, but it's not on the plans anymore, because it's not going to be part of the liquor license so chopping off the supermarket, focusing just on the morty's bar and the outdoor area, which we've had since kovitz started and want to make permanent. That's thing number one that we're doing with the liquor authority thing number two that we're doing with the liquor authority at the same time is we're looking to upgrade the license, which is currently beer and wine and we'd like to have full liquor there. It's something we're seeing a lot more of every dollar counts these days. It's not going to change the overall nature of the business, the hours, the very early hours of operation. I think we have it as 11 o'clock, yeah 11 o'clock, seven days a week, that's not changing the concept and the branding, and all of that is staying all the same. Still just you know, background music inside light as it is, but we would like to have full liquor. So those are the two things that we're doing avi and I are both here and we're happy to answer questions. So this is the really first of the martin williams really kind of one it's next to it. So you can, you can have a martini and then go next door and buy like lots of apricots. That's what you're telling me well, you just can't take your drink with you all right. We do a lot of supermarkets every supermarket. That is actually in, like the higher end, nicer ones like morton williams. That's opened in the past five years has some sort of cafe or on-premises. You know bar component to it that's just sort of where the industry is going, and so that's what they did here, but we are trying to. We don't need the license to cover the entire supermarket anybody from the public. Here, okay, call: the question committee: barbara! No, I'm she's balding me, okay, one two, three, four: five, six andrew! Yes, that's seven and louis says: yes to so committee: seven: zero, no commitment! Members, one! Zero! Okay! Great! Thank you! Everyone! That's all for me tonight! Thank you very much nice to see you. Thank you. Likewise. Everyone be safe. Congratulations! Yes! Good evening, everybody mario before you continue! What's your relationship to so I'm a district manager for lebron cote, d'ion. Okay, your listener manager. Okay, that's great, and can you provide us with your email address sure it's mario m-a-r-I-o DOT? Vasquez? U e v-a-s-q-u-e-z at a left, le pen, cotillion DOT! U s and I know that's a it. That's a mouthful and I can spell it out for you also, you say: USA DOT. U us the u.s, okay got it okay in the USA, so yeah, so the pancakes indiana is a belgium bakery. We were just recently acquired by rfi brands. We're excited to have been able to reopen now 16 locations throughout Manhattan. Hopefully, a couple of more we've. Had we've been operating out of this location for about the last 11 years, with the license previously and now we're just trying to apply under our new ownership at this location we have approximately 92 seats outside 16 seats inside we're not looking to expand that at all. In fact, you know in a couple of months, we'll actually be winding down business as the weather shifts and then we'll be wrapping up next spring. Hopefully, when the climate, literally figuratively, is a little better, our hours of operation are from eight to five during cobid and then once things are back to normal, we'll go back to our regular hours, which are from seven a.m. Until nine pm now, can you tell us a little bit about the location, yeah sure, so it's located in the mineral springs area of central park, so the closest entrance research is going to be on the 69th street west end side of the park sort of if you walk in through, where the. Why can't I think of the name of that other restaurant? This is rain cabin! Yes, of course, if you walk in towards the town and on the green, it's just slightly a little bit northeast of that as you're walking towards bethesda fountain in that direction. It's sitting on top of a little hill up there is this an actual building or what kind of a structure is it oh yeah? So it is an actual building and so in inside of the building. I would say that the building is approximately it's not very big, so maybe like 2 000 square feet, it pretty much encases our refrigeration units, our retail area and then just about 16 seats inside. We recently remodeled it a couple years ago and reduced the amount of seats inside and then focused on the patio area. So you know it we're mainly going full steam ahead in the winter months I mean summer months and then we kind of gear down as one of them. I said: that's that map is perfect. So if yes, there we are in the gray area, but yeah right there, so we're just north of the sheet metal. That's a better way to describe it. We got a little confused because one of our board members went by two west 69th street and said it's impossible, and then we realized that you have to have an address. That's not called central park north of sheep's. It's tricky to give people directions on like how to get there and stuff like that, but that's part of the fun of having such an iconic location like that as well. You opening 84th street again by the way, 84th and amsterdam. You know many of our leases are still being negotiated renegotiated right now. I think that one is still in the process of being renegotiated. So it's a little unclear. I look really sad and everything- and I say please well we'll put in a good one for you. Anyone else has a question, so this is a this is full liquor, correct or full liquor. Yes, and this and you've always had full liquor. Well, actually, it's marked as white and beer, even though we've operated with a full liquor license. We really just specialize in in belgium, beers and belgium. Wine we've never really had anything on our menu or do we have plan on having anything that requires hard alcohol. I think maybe we had a couple of featured drinks in the past, we're mainly breakfast and lunch focus. So we try to capture those dog walkers in the morning the lunches in central park in the afternoon, and then we buy down by seven or you know, o'clock at night during covert hours much earlier than that, but it's mainly just to you know pair up a belgium wine with our chef inspired, lunches and yeah. That sounds so actually, no so you've always had wine and beer you're applying for wine and beer. So it's not full liquor, it wasn't and it, and it's not right at this low, I'm looking at the application right now, because I've gone I've been representing la pakusian which have always been beer and wine. So when I looked at this application, I noticed that it does have tucked on and I know in the past we have had a few specialty drinks which suggest that the intention was to apply for the full liquor license, even though, like we've never really utilized that, so I noticed that that's what the application was for. It was the on premises. Is that the old liquor license? I don't have the can. We put the ammo up, it said hold on hold on. If you have wine and beer you're now asking for full liquor. Is that right or you just look looking for it- was the the acquisition, the ownership change? Oh I'm sorry, I don't know I was looking sorry I had maybe that that's the updated form, so it is just wine and beer. I was a little bit confused on looking at the wrong form. It wasn't updated, that's correct, and that makes perfect sense because that's in line with all of our other locations, that's what I thought it was just apologize for that no problem, no okay! So it's a wine and gear license and very nice of you to come to us for that. Yeah. Thanks for having us we're excited to be operating in the park again soon, absolutely very excited that you're there too. Thank you know I. When we couldn't find it. I looked up all these yelp. I you know I googled you so I found all these yelp responses to. You know yelp reviews and they were like. Oh my god, they love you, I'm saying wow. How long do I know about this stuff? Oh yeah, can you call the question? Anybody else has a question: okay, let's call the question all those in favor, that's one, two, three, four, five, six five you're actually stiff tonight andrew did we lose somebody at five, six, seven, okay, seven, zero and non-committed members. That's one zero! Okay! So thank you very much. I'm confused! Is that okay or not? No? It's not! I don't know the process. Okay, sorry, if you could speak in favor we're against, but you can't vote. Oh okay, yeah terrific little place. You can't comment always but yeah, okay, no, I'm sorry I'll be quiet. Are you joining us specifically for this application? You're, muted, now, unmute yourself, okay, hi, eleanor hello, linda? I was joining in order to understand the cb7 process, both for business and consumer and transportation and a few other committees, so just a commun, just a just a neighbor of all of yours. That's all wonderful, great welcome! Thank you for what you're doing. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Everyone! Thank you. Do we have anyone from 201 with 106 straight yeah, vito martinez? Okay, how are you doing hi? How are you I apologize for making this? I know I was a little a couple of minutes late, I'm sorry about that. Where are you? Oh there? You are hello there. I'm victor! Are you the owner, I'm the owner? Yes, the owner, okay and what's your email address, victor at the calaveras NYC DOT com, so t h, e c, a l, a v e r, a s NYC DOT com? What's it looking great, I also own the calaveras on columbus between 106 and 107. If that's a reference, so you're a seasoned operator and peter armstrong speaks very highly of you. You've already got notes. Thank you peter. When you hear from peter you know it's all good. Thank you all right! So victor the office never get the the questionnaire that there was some sort of misunderstanding and the the attorney's saying the question here. She was also the same attorney for 269 for two west, two west 69th street. So we received that one twice, so we never got the one for you or so. If you can email it to the office cb7 office at the yeah okay, so she cannot send it to us still. Okay, so continue. Please so tell us about your place yeah. So you know we have the calendar, the calaveras on columbus, which you know the neighborhood is going to like very much, and this place opened up where they ellington used to be on the corner of juan street and amsterdam right. We think it's a good opportunity for us to expand. You know with a concept that we wanted to do at the beginning before the calaveras, which was an american restaurant, because you know my partner francisco he's not an active owner, but he's the chef we've been working. You know when we first came to the states 20 years ago. We worked at all american and irish restaurants, so we know you could hear a lot more about that than we knew about mexican food is working very well for us and people love what we're doing, but we think that we have a lot to offer on the american. It's more like a global kind of situation going on which appetizers become tapas and tapas are appetizers, and then you get your main dishes like steak, chicken, pork look variety of you know all the foods global foods and I think we can do a change in the cuisine on the upper west side instead of people having to go all the way downtown, like you know, do a little more and keep it local great. I'm starving it sounds fantastic. What are your hours of operation? Because I don't so we don't have them very similar to this place, so it's noon until 12 on weekdays and then we're hoping to extend that after coffee is gone until 2 a.m, like a bar dating situation. So I'm sorry so we're I mean we're going to get when you get. We get your question here, but just for our information now so monday through thursday is monday, wednesday, yeah so saturday sunday. Well, let's do monday through thursday is 12 to 12., and then friday is going to be 12 to 2 in the morning, okay saturday, it's going to be 11 because we're planning, brunch 11 until 2 and then sunday 11 to 10.. That's perfect. Okay, great! Is there anyone here from the public who would like to speak besides peter you've spoken I'll, say I'll say that I'm really excited that they're willing to open during this time? It's a crazy time. I mean we are seeing well and also that they'll be over in amsterdam. In addition, we haven't been able to close columbus. Yet let's go hey christian well, I have no questions. Call the question then yeah. Okay, all those in favor as a one, two, three, four five, six andrew yes, another big, enthusiastic one for you, and then at least I mean at least is one says: one: zero and seven: zero thanks andrew you're welcome, okay, so that takes us to new business. Thank you I'll. In terms of your business. Let me at least mention one thing barbara and can add to it. So yesterday, at the transportation committee meeting there were questions about bicycle usage in terms of like there's a lot of delivery bicycles that are not following the rules and they go every which way you want the shock. I know [Laughter], and it could be that at some point in the near future, transportation may want to have a join at your meeting with us in terms of disclosing the bikes we're going to have a joint meeting discussing the bugs with transportation. Yes, at some point it hasn't yeah, it hasn't been scheduled. Yet, okay, interestingly, I find most of the delivery guys going the correct way: north northbound south, on southbound, some computers were like warding it and giving me the bird but okay, that's anecdotal. Yes, a dog or a barber. You want to add to that. Well, there were. There was also a discussion. Somebody said I forgot who was said that he's been asking for a very long time to have a joint meeting with bci regarding the the cafes and restaurants and the way they're set up on the street, and you know regarding that there weren't really any details, but I think if you do join transportation for the bicycle issue and also revel by the way which will be put on the agenda, that it would be good to talk about that. Also christian, yes, yeah, you want I'll call howard. Well, I don't believe that it was. It was meant to be on the game that this coming month, but that would be because yeah there's discussions on the safety. Well, the few issues revel motorcycles, the reckless non-registered motorcycles and then the just issue of just safety on the bike lanes all across the board. I think so and if there's delivery bikes then I guess that would certainly constitute a joint venture since they are working with or for the restaurants, whether they're, directly or indirectly, doug was it you last night. Doug spoke really well on this whole topic. He had two near misses. That's why I guess, but with a bike, going the wrong way, but I think I think you also said- and I think this is an important point to discuss when we do have a joint meeting, that used to be that you could veer over to the side. And now you can't do that because it's lined with people and restaurants, so a bike that is suddenly when another bike is coming head-on. There's nowhere to go both bikes have to really stop yeah. I mean I look. I always say that the word is safety and for everyone involved, and so you know I we there's a lot of resistance. I've at least felt it personally when I bring up the issue of delivery, you know bikers that are on the e-bikes, that we want to protect them, and we do. I don't want to see them get hurt. I want them to want them to be gainfully employed. I want them to be safe. I and so there's a lot of resistance in saying. Well, you know you're, they have immigration issues, they have income issues and they're under great pressure. Yes, they are, and I don't want them to be, hurt and end up having a medical issue, and I don't want them to hurt anyone else so we've seen before, but you know I'll tell you the commuter bikes. I find the commuter bikes warning the rules more often than the delivery guys at least stopped in my part of the 80s. I just look is it and this is more of a it's anecdotal. It's an issue, obviously a lot of this veers into bci, because some of these people are working obviously for the businesses, but I just think that we're you know as bikes proliferate, whether you love them or hate them or indifferent. Just statistically speaking, the more of these vehicles, you have the more likelihood you have for conflict and we just you know and the more people that are taking liberties and not being safe, not going the right way. You know we're going to have more accents, so we just have to really think of this in a preventative way, and it's not calling out any particular group of people or it's just you know it's metal on metal or metal on flesh and that's what I'm afraid of happening. Yeah, andrew or peter, in terms of like restaurants, are next to a bike lane. Have you heard any of any problems? Are you talking yeah? Yes, I'm sorry christian! You were asking about residents next to no any of these restaurants. That would be next to a bike lane if they're using this absolutely yeah. That's it's really dangerous and I was gonna pick up on what doug was saying. Just that we've been seeing bikes going everywhere. You know not just in the bike lane, but in the middle of the road and with cars speed I mean I will say that the cars are going much faster than they should be at this point, so that that's a further danger to everybody. I mean to themselves. I, in any case my point is that we need to get everybody back on track and I I'm afraid the electric bikes are going to be the hardest. They are heavy and they're fast, and the riders are too often not paying attention they can be talking. They can be smoking just a variety of things. You're talking about you're, talking about like the rebels, you're, not talking about like no electric bikes, yeah bikes in general. I I'm very concerned about, I mean I will name names and that one name is domino's just drives me nuts, but then the other one is or the other group is the ones that are not affiliated with restaurants, because I've had them driving on sidewalks or light or riding on sidewalks. I've had them going all over, and I just you know we we've been very lucky and we look and I tend to think that we look out for each other, but just the fear that they raise in elderly people and in families with young kids is just really it just raises people's blood pressure so hold on a second. Do you have anything to add to that? No, I think you know, I think it's an issue. Clearly the you know the restaurants, with the with the seating and the bikes kind of flying back, I've seen some restaurants they've put up. You know it's kind of signed, slow down, I'm not sure how much they you know, help or don't, but I think it's probably nice to have them and yeah. I think you know everyone really needs to learn to be very cautious, but we also need to ensure that you know do everything we can to make sure that people are going the right way and not going too fast and they're being cautious too, that people are going back and forth between the sidewalk and kind of outdoor dining areas. We're talking about education and enforcement, there's not a lot of enforcement right now, because we are not likely to be for a long time. They don't they don't want to get involved in this for good reason they get slammed. So it's also that you know, first of all, by the way the slow down signs. When I do ride a bike, I see it and I think it's a helpful reminder- and it's also helpful reminder to the patrons that oh yeah, this is you know, hopefully there's a sign for the patrons too to be careful when you're walking across the bike lane. I want to say something positive when I see all the delivery guys racing through I'm very happy, because I know that translates into some business notwithstanding the third party, delivery fees and all the other things that we have issues with, but I love to see it because it's like a flurry of business, but it you know again it's a safety and look. You know some people deliver. Some restaurants have their own delivery people and many use third-party deliveries. So you now have this whole vicarious liability issue. Where you know I wouldn't, if I owned a restaurant, I would not want to necessarily have my own delivery people, so they go to third party. So now you have the you know the seamless, the grub hubs and the ubereats and everybody else, and you know they're. I understand that the police were basically told to not issue tickets to the individual drivers but more to the restaurant. Well, the restaurant doesn't employ in many cases the delivery workers, so they back again to the bigger third-party companies. Well, although I don't know if you remember, I know that at one point there was a regulation passed where they were gonna hold the the comp, the delivery companies responsible, oh yeah, a resolution, or was it a no? I think it was at the DCA or one of the agencies we've had we've had seamless we've had grubhub we've had people have some of the third parties in, but it's been a long time. You think maybe this winter would be a good time to like speak to them again and talk about new protocols. Possibly there were two other things that they said on transportation. Yesterday, steve brown was encouraging that to write that for us to write a letter to all the restaurants and the delivery companies to reminder their bicycle delivery, people to obey the rules, so that was something that they probably would probably receive a request on that soon. The other thing that it was brought up in terms of bicycles, jay adolf, said he was going to write a resolution in which similar, where in car insurance or actually a similar sense at the low the current law. If you own a car and you lend a car to someone else and that someone else gets into an accident, you as the owner are still liable. Also for that so in similar to that jay wants to do a resolution to encourage legislation to do that for bicycles, so that delivery companies are unliable for like. If one of these delivery people hurt somebody in the streets, that's actual legislation, I mean that's, not community board. That's like I know state assembly, and you know the same folks, we're going after restaurants, et cetera and that's up to the assembly in the state. I know, but I just as we pass resolutions, let's say asking for studies or to have a bike lane. That would be a resolution asking for legislation. You know my understanding of what jay was saying was specifically regarding citibike. I didn't know that he was talking about that yeah like companies. I see the bike right yeah. I thought he was talking specifically about city planning. Exactly yes, people have a contract with the city and for them to have no liability. He wanted city bike to be liable. If someone rents a city bike that it's not the individual rider, it's city bike may have some liability. I thought that's what he meant, but I don't want him. Actually that's what he meant. Yes, I mean yeah, I mean look. I this is may sound controversial, but I personally think that the delivery bikes should be licensed insured. They should have plates, they should have lights reflectors mandatory at night, and you know- and these guys should be like to see more of them as long as they're all safe and careful, I mean yeah me too. A lot of those are requirements as far as like the lights and everything and keeping a log of them, they don't necessarily have to be licensed per se, but you know insured. You know the business or the third party entity should be ensuring that. So I think some of that stuff shouldn't be in place yeah. The problem is that many of them don't have lights, they don't have any identification and you know they're well that always goes back to you know what the enforcement is. You know you can pass any rule or you know, enact any requirements, but if they're not going to be enforced, you know that kind of herein lies the problem that we've always kind of discussed but yeah. It's definitely a challenge, and I think you know just sending a you know a reminder. You know who knows how much impact it has, but you know people have lots going on so if they see something from the community board, maybe they say: oh yeah, you know what let me just bring it up with the kind of delivery workers you know now. Andrew, do you have any idea how many restaurants, what percent of restaurants use outside delivery people and how many use their own? I don't actually not hard. To tell I mean, sometimes people are using a combination of both. I think this whole situation now in particular has really kind of shaken it up, as people start to reopen- and you know some people transition to do more delivery, because one thought was that the restaurant owner be held responsible for his his bike riders, who were not doing the right thing or going the wrong way like if they get a ticket. The restaurant should also be well. I think they are now. I think that was a year or two ago, legislation that passed so they are, they are responsible. You know, two things is enforcing it and the other thing is that so many because of a liability. So many of the restaurant owners did go over to third party so because it's expensive to have your own bicyclist and then you're responsible for it and they get tickets, but they don't stop either we have a dear friend who's. Still, you know who ended up in the hospital who was hit by a delivery guy going the wrong way on amsterdam, avenue and 85th street and got clobbered and broke his leg and just drove away. There was no license. There was no way to discern who it was and by the time you know by the time everybody caught up to our friend and called the ambulance. This guy was, you know, probably in a different borough, so it's it's really hard to enforce because of the speed of it. But I'd add something linda. You know I don't know you know it may be a little controversial, not saying this isn't my opinion or not, but you know, I think, some things you kind of have to accept the reality of that there's, probably not any time soon going to be very aggressive enforcement. It's just the situation, there's so much packaged and tied up in this, and obviously we just last year. You know, perhaps if we had a better connected, you know bike lane system on the upper west side and throughout the city. You know the infrastructure in which people have to operate within also helps kind of control, the safety in a sense and when there's not a connected system, it kind of leaves people up to kind of making their own maneuvering throughout the city. So to speak so and not to justify you know the behavior, but just to point out that having a more kind of coherent and calculated system could allow for better compliance and safer streets, yeah sure so it so the e-bikes are now legal. If I understand correctly, there was a while that they, I thought it was just the pedal assist only well pedal assist and then I think the non-throttled e-bikes that have a limiter on them is that am I is that correct. Does anybody know I don't know about that? One? No, it didn't pass. It was city council that was the germany, the guy in Brooklyn, along with keith powers. That was their legislation. I don't think it was ever passed because they were going to have because the problem was they didn't have they didn't have limitations on the speed and they weren't supposed to go faster than like 15 miles per hour, but there's no speedometer anyway. There's no way to tell when whether they're going faster so yeah, I think it got held up. I could be wrong, but I had heard that I don't. Maybe it was a state, a piece of state legislation that the andrew do you know anything as to whether or not those bikes are legal? Now I forget, I think there was a process. I think that they are. I have to go back and look, but I think it's that they are legal in the five boroughs, but there's some sort of like Manhattan exemption or some details where there has to be specific requirements made. So I don't know, that's just kind of you know. What's messed up what's messed up is that we don't know and what's messed up. Is the this reminds me of the discussion about you know what to smoke in the park that we don't know that there's no coherent legislation and there's no plan for this. You know I remember when the legislation was crawford in city council and I remember when it was held up. I don't remember it passing now: there's the state assembly and they have their rules and all and now we're there's a carve out in Manhattan. Well, there's it, but there was going on. It was a scooter bill and it was actually all bundled together. Yeah the governor at first didn't sign it, but then he I thought he did after there were some changes made, but by the way I also am not clear on what exactly is allowed in the bike lane. If it's I mean pedal assists, I know are allowed in the bike lane bicycles are allowed in the bike. Lane are the e-bikes allowed in the bike lane rebels are definitely not motorcycles are definitely not automobiles are definitely not. I don't know if there's any, but because the delivery guys, I, whether you know whether they have a limiter or not they're, in they're, in the bike lanes as well. I don't know that they're actually supposed to be in there. Well, I guess we can look it up and report next month. Transportation is apparently also looking up these things, so it would. I think it would be a good idea for us to have that joint meeting yeah you want to straight forward for October christian. What do you want? We can, if you wanna, because I don't have a problem with that. I think, though, we're gonna have to have two separate meetings, because I have well in this wonderful world. We have lots of applications for it and liquor licenses. We can do the join with them at their scheduled meeting and we can do our separate for the license. I have a question andrew the governor's announcement today about the opening of the restaurants. Congratulations. They mentioned something about filters. Yeah! Okay, can you elusive more details on? All of those points are going to be released, but I do not would not interpret that at this time to mean that restaurants are going to have to start installing new filtration systems. It'll, be you know, you'll want to use the filters that you know like the thickest size filter that fits your current system. You know you would want to go to you know all lanes to you know, keep doors and windows open where appropriate to allow. You know air flow, but yes, more details are going to be coming, but I don't think at this time to interpret that. As you know, installing a specific type of you know new filtration system. Well, I believe they said that within the current system they just have to have the right type of filter within that correct, yeah, okay, yeah, that that's what the understanding is in the next day or so, but yeah. I know some people are panicking. Thinking am I gonna have to go. Install some new commercial grades, something another, but they should be able to. You know work within what they currently have without having you know, major new expenses. That's what the hope is. One of the things that appears to me from going from eating in this restaurant, the other night, with the open doors overlooking the river, which was quite lovely in piermont, was that in the winter you can't have those open doors, and you can't have those open windows and it's going to get cold, and I don't know how the restaurants are going to deal with it. I'm assuming they will they'll figure out, you know whatever, but so I don't think those are going to be a requirement in the winter that you're keeping your doors and windows open, that's more of a kind of best practice. So to speak and let's hope the infection rates and everything continues to go in the same direction and by you know, November and so forth. You know we'll be at a lower place than we are now so right now, that's clearly and the governor mentioned that maybe they can go to 50 in November. Yes, and that and that's the goal, you know the rest of the state. Obviously 25 is very difficult for people I mean. Look, we all know even 50 is impossible. You know it was difficult when you had 100 to survive. As we know we always spoke about. So you know this is clearly a long road, a process. This is a start. The goal is you know? If we can, you know everything goes as well as possible. You know by November being able to open that, to you know 50 percent and you know continuing to closely monitor it, but you know my opinion. I know it's tough, you know every step forward is better than standing still or going backwards exactly. Okay. Do you have that you wanted to call me andrew? I know you've been in touch with. Thank you christian with a number of restaurants up in our neighborhood. Yes, anytime, you have anything to share about how to extend things beyond October 31st or our the outdoor dining. I mean we've been talking about a variety of methods, some of them really high in the sky, but just it has been a real boon in terms of our neighborhood to have the open streets for restaurants and it's not like they're paying their rent off of this, but they are getting a lot of attention and new customers. So it's been a really positive thing and so we're trying to think about how we can go beyond without using you know, heavy energy use to heat an area, absolutely yeah, no and you're doing a great job. We've been up there a bunch of times, and it's really it's been great, so keep it up there and yeah. You know we are pushing, and hopefully sooner than later, I know that's not a great answer, because it's not a date, but hopefully, sooner than later there will potentially be announcements. You know extending the outdoor dining looking into the heating elements. Currently, as you probably know, only hardline natural gas heaters are permitted. Those are obviously expensive, there's a whole permitting process, but the goal is to look at other things: electricity, there's a couple of issues. There are electric heaters out there, but you know the cost one: two, the commercial grade ones you can't just plug into a normal outlet, meaning that you need to have an electrician common and you need to see how much output your building has and then the third one is propane, which you know, there's always different safety concerns, but there are discussions happening about you know. Is there ways that they could be protected and in a way that you know could would mitigate or eliminate? A lot of you know the safety concerns, but that's something that's been happening. I think everyone is aware of the issue and hopefully, like I said sooner than later, there'll be some announcements. You know at least you know that would be helpful and the thing we can't control, but hopefully we have a you know a as mild as possible winter. So you know the outdoor first time you were still relevant andrew. If I may christian andrew wondering, is there any movement on? I realize it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but there are a lot of enclosed cafes that where they have french doors that open where, if you sit right toward the end, I personally would feel very safe, but clearly they're not allowed now any movement on possibly loosening the restrictions for any of those. Sorry, okay, so like allowing more or using that no just another like yeah, just a little bit so yeah. So I mean those now because that's part of the enclosure that would be part of no. That would be part of the 25. So it wouldn't. You know you wouldn't be able to use those plus 25 percent. But if you have you know, that's a good question, so you know it's based on your certificate of occupancy. So if you know you have the enclosed cafe, I guess that's increasing your occupancy, so you know it's 25, I'm sure this is something you could speak to max bookman about, but I know for a fact that the outdoor cafes do not increase the certificate of occupancy because you correct egress but you're not losing but you're, not losing. So you know you're, not you're, not it's not counting towards your 25. So you know the goal is: if you, if you're fortunate and you have the outdoor dining, you get that plus the 25 you know inside, but what I would say for the people that do have the french stores, the people that do have an enclosed cafe where the windows open, I think, just from a kind of public customer confidence standpoint. You know people will be more comfortable eating indoors if they are next to a window. You know where there's a flow of air, so you know part of the other thing with this, too, is the last thing I'll say is part of you know, I think a lot of it's going to be consumer confidence like yes, of course, you need to comply with the requirements for like what are you doing and showing your customers? How are you going above and beyond, and what are you doing to get make them comfortable? So that's going to be part of the issue for restaurants. That was earl's big thing. I mean he had a whole bunch of you know: customers who were not comfortable sitting in the street yeah, but he, but he didn't, but he did that he was that that's irrelevant, because he shouldn't have done that. He knew we shouldn't have done it. I think it's totally irrelevant yeah, but I was near rosa mexicana the other day and looking at at pj clark's and they hadn't come. I haven't spoken anyone they didn't come to us. I I'm, but I just noticed that there's this massive enclosed cafe and they were not allowed to sit people to sit there and I, as a as a consumer. I just thought to myself: there is no practical difference between sitting right up at the edge of the window, with the windows open or sitting on the street and they weren't allowed. So, but now that you have the 25, I realize that's now. I think they were. I think, I'm sorry, I think pj clark was doing that for a while, because yeah people, someone told me they walked by and asked why we didn't do the same thing. I said you can't do that, so they must have gotten spoken to or find or something. Yes, I'm not sure because they were. They were definitely doing that. I agree with you. I saw them doing it and then for then, all of a sudden they weren't doing it. So they might have gotten spoken. Something about you know. Even if there's a warning, you can't do that yeah. But you know earl got warned I think pj clark's got warned, but they didn't, they didn't lose their liquor license. They didn't have their liquor license suspended a lot of. It is kind of random because all these people are yeah they're, not really training that well- and you know you have 18 people trained and they're interpreting things 18 different ways and that's why you'll have one person go to location, a and they'll, see and location people are doing the same thing and you'll have two different outcomes as to what happens because of the rush job. That's my opinion of the rush child, this training, because most of these people are just being brought in from who knows where to do this and it's it wasn't enough education to do it properly. I remember in the beginning I think, right in late June they were sending out the rep D-O-T, d-e-p and DOB checking out the restaurants before they finally figured out what comprised the proper size the property yeah like you know, 36 inches high and 18 inches wide we're planning all around yeah the whole thing. Well, everything so far, yeah it retro. She got changed three, you know two or three days after it got retroactively, changed the width of the barriers right for the roadside and that's a lot of money. I just anyway did we solve the world's problems. I know peter wants to say good night. What's up peter? Yes, I do want to say good night, but I will quickly say that doug brought up also motorcycle gangs going up amsterdam avenue we've been dealing with this for over eight years and they luckily, over the past two weekends they've come after we've reopened the streets, so they're not coming up while the streets are closed. So it's we, you know, we've already gone through, warned everybody and then all of a sudden they show up, and it is a really difficult situation. We've talked with the precinct over the last eight years and don't have a good solution yet, but it is something that doug had brought up at the last at the transportation meeting, and I don't know how we're gonna deal with it, but it is something that needs attention. Yeah we've got, the dog you've got the kids raves I was in. I was in a car with rosie mendes three weeks ago, and they were you know there was the bicycle race. We get them on the amsterdam avenue too. You get like 300, kids on bikes and they're, doing wheelies and all and they're having a great old time and they're. You know they're yeah and there's something you know, but it's a pain in the neck and you can't cross the street. Well, I I'm personally and I'm not saying that they're totally safe, but I think you know what we're talking about is just is all these: the actual. These are motorcycles and atv all-terrain vehicles and they're unlicensed, and there I mean I've got video of them, taking the sidewalk, taking the bike, lane doing they're, doing wheelies, they're literally they're, doing donuts in the middle of amsterdam and they're, and I just yeah. So I spoke about it yesterday. But it's I think what's happened. Is that because there's no enforcement there's more and more of it, and then there are more. Not only are the same people coming out and doing it more and I counted about 17 motorcycles. That's kind of the average of the group 15 to 17., sometimes there's 25, sometimes there's nine noises they're different. What's that they're noisy as hell yeah, they let yeah they, you know, set off all the car alarms and all that yeah, but I'm afraid someone's going to get killed and and yeah. So now I think it's time that, even though the NYPD has to if they do something and they're going to pursue them, they have to do it safely, but they have to figure it out a smarter way to stop this really reckless behavior and it's they've had their hands full this summer, absolutely yeah. This is why we have an NYPD. They should be doing some enforcement for this and for the bikes we're never going to solve the problems. Otherwise I, as I mentioned yesterday in the meeting, I have been standing with police officers and some commanding officers on the street when the gang goes by and they literally wave and go, we would love to do something if we only could because, but we're not allowed to you know well, the one thing that they've been successful at is tracking down where the bikes are stored and confiscating them there. So they're looking for places where garages, where they're stored, they're looking for backyards, where they're stored and trying to use that as a mechanism, but it's clearly not successful, but it is the one that they've been able to do terrible okay, so I think we should leave it here and we can come back next month. Okay, thank you for coming. Thank you. Have a great fall have a wonderful time or isn't it wow. We got two weeks, yeah, hey andrew ray. Thank you hold on hold on what again hold on just all right there. Ah, there we go. Oh there, that's what I know I know I have that nice fancy photo and then you got it. Here's the real thing. No, it's a good look. Nothing like a flashing mask to really make it exactly andrew. Congratulations on all the great work you're doing for all yeah man, yes andrew, oh you're, all the best! Thank you. I love working with you we're fighting trying to help everyone- and you know it's better to, as I said before, you know- take at least a step forward better than staying still or going backwards. So all right, okay, good night, everyone good night.
