I've been in touch with Bill Castro a few times about the issue, and we have a meeting set up He's not going to be at it, but he's sending his deputy and and and Matt Genrich, and we invited people from the bull run.
Do you know how to let people in as attendees, because I or start the recording well, like I click broedcast?
I do not even know that he's going to be open that late, but we're asking for a 1 A.M hard, close and weekend.
This is the former lavella space right, yeah, okay, and when you, when you plan to open this, is very exciting, not quite coupons, yeah, exactly where we're shooting Probably end of year or very early next year, but we're working very hard Anyone here from the public to speak about this?
If you see the screen that you know that Christian shared over there all you're, seeing there now is morty's wine bar that's on the left, that's the indoor space and to the right.
We're chopping that off and you can see that at the top of the screen there through those doors, that's the supermarket, but it's not on the plans anymore, because it's not going to be part of the liquor license so chopping off the supermarket, focusing just on the morty's bar and the outdoor area, which we've had since Kovitz started and want to make permanent.
Authority thing number: two that we're doing with the liquor authority at the same time is we're looking to upgrade the license, which is currently beer and wine and we'd like to have full liquor, there.
Just you know, background music inside light as it is, but we would like to have full liquor.
You can email it to the office CB7 office at the You know we have the calendar the calaveras on Columbus, which you know the neighborhood is going to like very much, and this place opened up where they ellington used to be on the corner of Juan, Street and Amsterdam.
So we know you could hear a lot more about that than we knew about mexican food is working very well for us, and people love what we're doing, but we think that we have a lot to offer on the American.
There were questions about bicycle usage in terms of like there's a lot of delivery bicycles that are not following the rules I know, and it could be that at some point in the near future, transportation may want to have a join at your meeting with us in terms of disclosing the bikes.
Somebody, said I forgot, who was said that he's been asking for a very long time to have a joint meeting with Bci regarding the the cafes and restaurants and the way they're set up on the street.
Think if you do join transportation for the bicycle issue and also Revel by the way which will be put on the agenda, that it would be good to talk about that.
Well, the few issues: Revel motorcycles, the reckless non- registered motorcycles and then the just issue of just safety on the bike lanes, all acrosss, the board, I think so If there's delivery, bikes, then I guess that would certainly constitute a joint venture since they are working with or for the restaurants, whether they're, directly or indirectly, He had two near misses: That's why I guess, but with a bike, going the wrong way, but I, think I.
Obviously a lot of this veers into Bci, because some of these people are working obviously for the businesses, but I just think that we're you know as bikes proliferate, whether you love them or hate them or indifferent.
You know we're going to have more accents, so we just have to really think of this in a preventative way, and it's not calling out any particular group of people, Yeah, Andrew or Peter in terms of like restaurants, are next to a bike.
I, think you know, everyone really needs to learn to be very cautious, but we also need to ensure that you know do everything we can to make sure that people are going the right way and not going too fast, And they're being cautious too, that people are going back and forth between the sidewalk and kind of outdoor dining areas.
I, want to say something positive when I see all the delivery guys racing through I'm, very happy, because I know that translates into some business notwithstanding the third party, delivery fees and all the other things that we have issues with, but I love to see it because it's like a flurry of business, but it you know again.
The restaurant does not employ in many cases the delivery workers, so Well, although I do not know if you remember, I, know that at one point there was a regulation passed where they were going to hold the the comp, the delivery companies, responsible, Oh yeah, a resolution, or was it I think it was at the DCA or one of the agencies we've had we've had seamless We've had grubhub we've had people have some of the third parties in, but it's been a long, time.
You think maybe this winter would be a good time to like speak to them again and talk about new protocols.
One of these delivery people hurt somebody in the streets I mean that's, not community.
These guys should be like to see more of them as long as they're, all safe and careful, You know the business or the third party entity should be ensuring that so I think some of that stuff should not be in place.
Who knows how much impact it has, but you know people have lots going on so if they see something from the community board, maybe they say: You know what let me just bring it up with the kind of delivery workers.
Up, as people start to reopen- You know some people transition to do more delivery, because one thought was that the restaurant owner be held responsible for his his bike riders, who were not doing the right thing or going the wrong way like if they get a ticket.
You know who ended up in the hospital who was hit by a delivery guy, going the wrong way on Amsterdam, Avenue and 85Th street and got clobbered and broke his leg and just drove away.
You know air flow, but yes, more details are going to be coming, but I do not think at this time to interpret that.
But, so I do not think those are going to be a requirement in the winter that you're keeping your doors and windows open,, that's more of a kind of best practice, so to speak, and let's hope, the infection rates and everything continues to go in the same direction and by you, know, November and so forth.
I mean we've been talking about a variety of methods, some of them really high in the sky, but just it has been a real boon in terms of our neighborhood to have the open streets for restaurants It's not like they're paying their rent off of this, but they are getting a lot of attention and new customers.
You know inside, but what I would say for the people that do have the french stores, the people that do have an enclosed cafe where the windows open, I think, just from a kind of public customer confidence, standpoint.
Think a lot of it's going to be consumer confidence like yes , So, that's going to be part of the issue for restaurants.
I'm, not saying that they're totally safe, but I think you know, I mean I've got video of them, taking the sidewalk, taking the bike, lane doing they're, doing wheelies, they're, literally they're, doing donuts in the middle of Amsterdam Is that, because there's no enforcement Not only are the same people coming out and doing it more What's that they're noisy as hell.
You know, set off all the car alarms and all that So now I think it's time that, even though the NYPD has to if they do something and they're going to pursue them, they have to do it safely, but they have to figure it out a smarter way to stop this really reckless behavior This summer, This is why we have an NYPD.
