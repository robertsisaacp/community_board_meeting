And, they're, amazing and first of all, I got them because my terrace adjoins the main terrace for the building, the common terrace, and occasionally there are parties there By the way he thinks that you know the parks may turn this whole project down.
I think it has six tables and 14 seats whenever DCA gets back involved in issuing cafe I, don't even know that he's going to be open that late, but we're asking for a 1 a.m. Hard, close and weekend.
This is the former lavella space right, yeah, okay, and when you, when you plan to open this, is very exciting, not quite coupons, yeah, exactly where we're shooting Probably end of year or very early next year, but we're working very hard.
That's the supermarket, but it's not on the plans anymore, because it's not going to be part of the liquor license so chopping off the supermarket, focusing just on the morty's bar and the outdoor area, which we've had since kovitz started and want to make permanent.
At the same time, Is we're looking to upgrade the license, which is currently beer and wine and we'd like to have full liquor, there.
You know in a couple of months, we'll actually be winding down business as the weather shifts So it's located in the mineral springs area of central park, so The closest entrance research is going to be on the 69th street west end side of the park sort of if you walk in through, Why can't I think of the name of that other restaurant?
You can email it to the office cb7 office at the You know we have the calendar, the calaveras on columbus, which you know the neighborhood is going to like very much, and this place opened up where they ellington used to be on the corner of juan street and amsterdam.
It's more like a global kind of situation going on which appetizers become tapas and tapas are appetizers, And I think we can do a change in the cuisine on the upper west side instead of people having to go All. The way downtown, like you, know, do a little more and keep it local great.
At the transportation committee meeting, there were questions about bicycle usage in terms of like there's a lot of delivery bicycles that are not following the rules.
I know [Laughter], and it could be that at some point in the near future, transportation may want to have a join at your meeting with us in terms of disclosing the bikes we're going to have a joint meeting discussing the bugs with transportation.
Somebody said: I forgot, who was said that he's been asking for a very long time to have a joint meeting with bci regarding the the cafes and restaurants and the way they're set up on the street.
And you know, regarding that there weren't, really any details, But I, think if you do join transportation for the bicycle issue and also revel by the way which will be put on the agenda, that it would be good to talk about that.
I always say that the word is safety and for everyone involved, and I've at least felt it personally when I bring up the issue of delivery , you know bikers that are on the e-bikes, that we want to protect them, and we do.
Obviously a lot of this veers into bci, because some of these people are working obviously for the businesses, but I just think that we're you know as bikes proliferate, whether you love them or hate them or indifferent.
You know we're going to have more accents, so we just have to really think of this in a preventative way, and it's not calling out any particular group of people, Yeah, andrew or peter, in terms of like restaurants, are next to a bike.
I want to say something positive when I see all the delivery guys racing through I'm, very happy, because I know that translates into some business notwithstanding the third party, delivery fees and all the other things that we have issues with, but I love to see it because it's like a flurry of business, but it you know again.
Where, you know I wouldn't, if I owned a restaurant, I would not want to necessarily have my own delivery people.
Although I don't know, if you remember, I know that at one point there was a regulation passed where they were gonna hold the the comp, the delivery companies, responsible, Oh yeah, a resolution, or was it I think it was at the DCA or one of the agencies we've had we've had seamless We've had grubhub we've had people have some of the third parties in, but it's been a long, time.
One of these delivery people hurt somebody in the streets I mean that's, not community.
These guys should be like to see more of them as long as they're, all safe and careful, You know the business or the third party entity should be ensuring that.
Who knows how much impact it has, but you know people have lots going on so if they see something from the community board, maybe they say: You know what let me just bring it up with the kind of delivery workers.
Up, as people start to reopen- You know some people transition to do more delivery, because one thought was that the restaurant owner be held responsible for his his bike riders, who were not doing the right thing or going the wrong way like if they get a ticket.
You know who ended up in the hospital who was hit by a delivery guy, going the wrong way on amsterdam, avenue and 85th street and got clobbered and broke his leg and just drove away.
You know it may be a little controversial, not saying this, isn't my opinion or not, but Some things you kind of have to accept the reality of that there's, probably not any time soon going to be very aggressive, enforcement.
I mean we've been talking about a variety of methods, some of them really high in the sky, but just it has been a real boon in terms of our neighborhood to have the open streets for restaurants So we're trying to think about how we can go beyond without using you, know, heavy energy use to heat an area, And you're doing a great job.
You know inside, but what I would say for the people that do have the french stores, the people that do have an enclosed cafe where the windows open, I think, just from a kind of public customer confidence, standpoint.
