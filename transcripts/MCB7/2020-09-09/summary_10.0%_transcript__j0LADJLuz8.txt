He's not going to be at it, but he's sending his deputy and and and matt genrich, and we invited people from the bull run and they're amazing and first of all , I got them, because my terrace adjoins the main terrace for the building, the common terrace, and occasionally there are parties there By the way he thinks that you know the parks may turn this whole project down.
Otherwise he's going to be sitting with a fully built out restaurant with dead space effect belief for six months, So we'll write a letter to waiver donald emailed, john martinez Okay we'll do we'll do that tomorrow and is money The other guys are gone and hopefully I can open up soon again and bring all my loyal employees back and have some great food for all my loyal guests.
the same people pretty much We're painting right now, as I'm speaking to you and I can't wait to open , I'm so excited and looking forward to seeing all you guys when we reopen excellent , you will you will Have, you ever been already self-certified for your street seats?
So I, just it's a lovely couple, they're doing a great job over there in a difficult time and they I would like to support them So the next one also is an ocean right now to west 69th street Let's, not forget that we've got to come back home at the end of the thing so moving on, we have 15 west end avenue, I also have car mines We just do car mines first, so jeff can get back to driving.
You know it we're mainly going full steam ahead in the winter months, I mean summer months If yes, there, we are in the gray area, We got a little confused because one of our board members went by two west 69th street and said it's impossible, and then we realized that you have to have an address.
Mexican food is working very well for us, and people love what we're doing, but we think that we have a lot to offer on the american It's more like a global kind of situation going on which appetizers become tapas and tapas and I think we can do a change in the cuisine on the upper west side instead of people having to go all the way downtown, like you know, do a little more and keep it local great and then we're hoping to extend that after coffee is gone until 2 am like a bar dating situation.
I find the commuter bikes warning the rules more often than the delivery guys at least stopped in my part of the 80s An issue obviously a lot of this veers into bci, because some of these people are working obviously for the businesses, but I just think that we're you know as bikes proliferate, whether you love them or hate them or indifferent , Just, statistically speaking, the more of these vehicles, you have the more likelihood you have for conflict and the more people that are taking liberties and not being safe, not going the right way.
You know we're going to have more accents, so we just have to really think of this in a preventative way, and it's not calling out any particular group of people, Yeah, andrew or peter in terms of like restaurants, are next to a bike.
We're talking about education and enforcement, there's not a lot of enforcement right now, because we are not likely to be for a long time It's also that you know, first of all by the way the slow down and it's also helpful reminder to the patrons that oh yeah, this is you know, hopefully there's a sign for the patrons too to be careful when you're walking across the bike.
You, as the owner are still liable so in similar to that jay wants to do a resolution to encourage legislation to do that for bicycles, so that delivery companies are unliable for like If one of these delivery people hurt somebody in the streets, that's actual legislation, I mean that's, not community board That's, like I, know state assembly, and you know the same folks, we're going after restaurants, et cetera and that's up to the assembly in the state but I.
This is, may sound controversial, but I personally think that the delivery bikes should be licensed insured, and these guys should be like to see more of them as long as they're, all safe and careful You know the business or the third party entity should be ensuring that, and you know, they're well you know what the enforcement is.
Sometimes people are using a combination of both I think this whole situation now in particular, has really kind of shaken it up as people start to reopen, and you know some people transition to do more delivery, because one thought was that the restaurant owner be held responsible for his his bike riders, who were not doing the right thing or going the wrong way like if they get a ticket The restaurant should also be well So. Many of the restaurant owners did go over to third party so because it's expensive to have your own bicyclist Still.
You know who ended up in the hospital who was hit by a delivery guy going the wrong way on amsterdam, avenue and 85th street and got clobbered and broke his leg and just drove away This guy was, you know, probably in a different borough, You know it may be a little controversial, not saying this isn't my opinion or not, but you know I think some things you kind of have to accept the reality of that.
I just thought to myself: There is no practical difference between sitting right up at the edge of the window, with the windows open or sitting on the street I think pj clark was doing that for a while, because yeah people, someone told me they walked by and asked why we didn't do the same thing.
