Let's jump in I, think that we've got a little bit of an adjusted group here today for a bunch.
So I think we'll probably have a little bit of a smaller team which will make it very intimate and we will get to ask lots of questions about the libraries which everyone here is super excited about.
And, then we'll go around and let each each committee member generally ask a couple: fabulous questions, we'll let the audience as well or our participants, as we say, and I, think.
We want to welcome you because I know you've been trying to present to the board for some time and for whatever reason it hasn't worked out, but we certainly welcome you here.
So I'm talking about digital collections being available or things like our tech connect classes or career counseling or scan and deliver for research.
We were also trying to reach people who had been adversely impacted by the pandemic, and so we also had a community resources page that had things like information and ways, folks, who may have been now facing evictions, for example, from their homes or food insecurity or may have lost their jobs and need help with unemployment.
While it was great that we got these services up and running, we know that there's people in their homes, particularly in underserved communities, that don't have access to these services, and so, while keeping health and safety in mind and prioritizing it.
But I share that to make the point that we're just as committed to health and safety and taking care of the public and our staff as we are getting services out there any way we can.
We're, currently in talks about learning labs, where parents can bring their students for child care services not provided by our staff, but through partner, organizations.
You know our cluster there in CB7, but right one of the things I found most interesting in reading about what libraries do are the communities you serve and service that we don't associate with libraries, I'm thinking about senior houses, I'm thinking about going into jails, I'm thinking about even giving space in the libraries for pre-k, classrooms.
Those are some of the examples that are top of mind right now, when you say you do things like career counseling and financial advising is that library, staff or professionals in those areas come in.
Now, yeah, really saying that a lot from the very beginning, I think if we did stuff like the book distribution initiative, I mentioned earlier, we should be able to do the get a bookmobile up and running, but you know, unfortunately, the powers that be have made.
So, currently we have 50 branches open across the city across our boroughs of service for grab-and-go, which means that folks can do kind of like a drop-off pick up for now.
It just sparked me as you spoke, but one of the is it possible to do a class or to kind of help people educate them on technology, I mean one of the things that has been a problem is helplines.
And I mean I think sometimes people are learning how to work with technology.
I would just think if there was some resources or ways to do something either an online session on you know how to do a zoom call or how to work devices.
We will have in-person, tutoring and brain fuse, it's kind of how we're thinking about it and with regards to technology, we are doing a lot of that.
I mean that may be taking and coordinating you know with it with a school in terms of anybody who wants to join this session.
I just think we're all going to try and figure out how to do more with not less is the wrong way.
Then you know we work with branch staff to make sure, for example, that all the community boards are covered.
We all know how difficult the year has been for study agencies across the board and would like to hear what you have struggled with there and what has been the impact on you.
Do you like database how to search the internet information literacy classes as I think Amar was saying we might be remote, but we are still there.
You know if you could stay with us, we're going to kind of go around to everyone, and if anybody has any specifics from a local perspective, then we'll make sure that we identify yourself.
I mean it's kind of would be the same thing where we would be searching, we would be making recommendations on what we think he should be putting on hold.
I know that you were offering like senior fitness classes and the book club.
I would say we address that kind of, as a corollary, as in it's a lot of our technic classes, touch on it, but I'm, not aware of something that really gets to the crosshairs of the issues that you're talking about things like cyber bullying, for example.
I think they have digitized something like 25 million books, mainly from university libraries.
You know which serve a different target audience and a very different purpose, and I'm wondering if there's any partnership with somebody like Google who's, already done all that work to expand your library, digitally.
You want to speak, later, I, don't know if you can figure out how to raise your hand, we'll be happy to let you speak when we get to panelists.
You know compared to pre-pandemic if there's more use of those, and maybe what outreach is like to sorry to to students in high school.
But, it does seem like a timely thing, especially considering that today is the first day of classes.
Who then said to me that they were partnering with their sister agencies, including the libraries and that was pertaining to potential testing, maybe down the road, vaccination and things like that.
I think you know with issues like this, the more they hear it from different places, the better chance there is that they'll re-examine it.
Do, you have those very basic classes and do they live online somewhere so that at any given time that is convenient for parents and students that they can go on and my into it and to add on to that like on a local level, when the city distributes well.
I think this is where you were asking about students being able to reach out to New York public library.
We had a meeting last week, I mean last month, and what we you constantly hear from us is one of the biggest problems is around people, the lack of devices to kids and trying to fill that gap, but also very disappointed that the DOE hasn't done a better job, creating more infrastructure for this and as much as you can plug in play or help out or even just say, hey.
I know, I, don't want to put you on the spot, Doug Mcgowan, but any questions because we're going to move to the the participants.
The demand piece and the connecting the dots to ensure folks know the that you're open for business in the way that you are I, think it's a appropriate follow-up great, so mark.
I, know you're, very good about coming to full board and sharing thoughts about what our our local offerings are.
I'll put my email in the chat, have a nice back and forth with everybody here and make sure I get back to folks, and you know things like the bookmobiles that stuff.
Maybe, to have a conversation about it, but I feel pretty strongly about this and may want to think about what type of action we may be able to.
The data itself is coming in that the schools are very safe and if you just look in contrast to others, you know Europe, which we don't necessarily have to model, but Europe actually has very similar things.
You probably already have a obviously an idea of what it would be, but picky backing off of our last resolution and the lack of involvement of individuals like principles, and these type of decisions to me would be a potential way forward.
Obviously, Uft is at the table in some fashion, but superintendents and so forth, and the Cec's themselves, so a teeny bit of pushback, but the larger process point that I would say is that this is something on which I would think we would want to engage the community.
That I may be the only one that Mis interpreted or misinterpreted it, but I got the sense that they were saying that if they had been asked that they would not have endorsed in-person schooling because of the risks that it posed both to their faculty and to their students at a time in which everyone was certain that what did happen today would happen and not being so, I.
That's, not a reason to do or not do anything, but I think that if we want to make a statement about this, we need to do this in something other than new business.
We need to put it on an agenda, invite people to come and say yes or no, maybe even line up a speaker, and obviously we can't couldn't do that in the you know, half an hour that the mayor and the governor finally figured out how to talk to each other and decided that they would go forward with the mayor's decision.
Okay, sorry, New, York, City, school principal assistant, superintendent, teacher, I, understood why the principals had hesitation because they're responsible for all the management of things they didn't feel that they were ready.
I. Think, that's one of the big downsides is that if for a lot of these schools going full remote, it means that students might not actually have like actual interactions with the teacher for days out of time, perhaps.
So I think that I just want to bring that up as a point in terms of this issue, specifically, oh one, more thing.
The other point I want to bring up about school closure is that you know the rates have been really low in schools, as as Steven said, but we are entering winter and I.
What's that going to be like in January, so I just want to put that out there too.
Think right now the decision's been made to shut down schools, I'm off to my head, I.
I, think one path of action would be to go along the lines of communication and talking about the fact that you know decision was made incredibly last minute with very little.
Know, write another letter about that and another point to bring up, which I think would involve a lot.
I understand that writing a resolution saying that percent change should be moved or should be altered is something that should probably involve some input from public health experts in some way or another, but I think that's another type of action that we could take as a committee, and we could take that.
I think you know I'm, not sure who said it, but the summary of it was.
I. Think the one thing I would like to know.
An information session that brought together perhaps public health people and school people, and had some sense of trying to come up with a and parents of course, and as well as educators, would come up with some kind of way of talking about.
Most of the ones that are like red are in certain clusters, so I didn't even want to get into the next layers of the things that I think.
When the numbers first started to go up, we accepted that we could micro target it a bit and, while I understand that there is going to be some threshold at which that's no longer possible, I do think getting some health officials to weigh in on.
I would also point out that there's a real difference between the people who can afford to to throw some money at this problem and the many people who can not and the impact on the adults and the workforce for this kind of last-minute closure and the scrambling that it's going to require of the parents is really unacceptable and to have it have no end and no ability to plan around this is really untenable for working parents, and so I do think there is some and should be some impetus.
And I think you know, mark that.
That saying we would that I would like them to be taking in more of these data points and as they look to reopen schools and as they look to evolve this process that we have grown and educate, grown in.
That I would want them to know that I feel this way that this is not one number blanketed across the entire thing is wrong.
If we were to write some statement to the effect of kind of asking for what the administration should be doing to to improve the process for schools and families and those who support kids I, don't think we should make claims about the numbers.
I think we're saying the same thing, which is you know, I I'd like to see their process and decision making evolve.
I feel like the general goal is to get the most amount of kids in front of like a synchronous class in one way or another, and whether it's through getting people to actually go to school or at home.
The amount of zoom time he has is nothing close to the amount of time he has when he goes to school and going back to the equity point like the more time that I feel a kid is in front of a camera, even though, like a lot like screen time, and all of that is bad on eyesight.
What I think might be a fair statement that we could extrapolate from previous statements and also get out relatively quickly, as opposed to a resolution that has to go through full board, would be something to say that now that you've closed the schools and maybe make some maybe advert indirectly to based on criteria that very few people had visibility to until it was decided.
I think it would not be a stretch from our previous statements to say that parents, or some recognized representative of parents and I, know that that's a dangerous thing, because there are parents on every side of every issue.
And I, think what you're saying at the end is not what I want to do.
I. Do not want to say that what I think is what I would like to do.
Is create a resolution, because I, don't think it's I'd like to do is create a resolution that talks about process that can incorporate the first part of what you said.
But I would like to encourage the DOE and the mayor to include to evolve their process of how they're evaluating closing schools, and that would include new data points that have been discovered.
We now know these rates that are in schools, new thinking around micro areas, as opposed to a one large area, but I, don't need to say what that number should be, but I.
The decision making process pass a singular number, and now that they're closed in order to reopen them in which they open the door to say we're going to have to look at this in a new way, encouraging them to be looking at other data points to bring in, and that's what I'd like to say.
Just trying to say that they're, we have learned a lot since this number has come forward and they should be applying those learnings to reopening the schools and for the year, and that was what I'd like to do.
Were there, any specific medical epidemiology epidemiological justifications for this, because you know, even if the like this, is in my non-medical professional thinking about this, even at the nicest Courtney Sander.
What I was just thinking this through was that if the general population in the New York local area, if the rates are higher than three percent, and then you know it's because it's obviously not compartmentalized, if the school's numbers are low, which is great.
You know whether it's the right number or not, isn't even my point, I, just think when you were there.
So I think we should use like the word families and guardians as much as possible, so I support taking some action as long as we account for what we don't know.
You know, pass a res like past resolution in committee and then bring it to full board and then, by the time we pass it.
If we were able to in a resolution basically say we don't think it should be a city-wide number.
This is definitely a feudal point for me to make, but I am a very strong proponent of student voice and I really advocate for including students in this process when I think of the school system.
You want to know I tried, calling some up over the last couple days to try and get into this meeting.
The process of the involvement of kids and students and all the things that we said, but I would like to include that the decision-making process in terms of evaluating schools should be brought in to take in the newer data, the newer understanding, the evolution of the way that we're looking at.
I'm, not asking to make any I just want to be clear, because I've heard this multiple times, I'm not advocating that any data point is wrong.
I would like to move forward on and vote it on, and you just you know.
If, there's data that you think you need in order to have a more informed, opinion, you're not going to have that.
Second chance, you can hold another meeting, but if you bring a motion or a resolution to full board in December and again in January on basically the same facts, you know the second one is not going to be taken seriously, which is why I was advocating for a letter that expanded upon something that we've already said, which doesn't preclude the possibility of a second I, am very troubled that there's only 16 of us in the room when we're talking about this and that there was nothing on the agenda that gave anybody a clue that they should weigh in.
You, know, I think that the fast action that one can take is a letter that emphasizes the things we've already said, as opposed to trying to raise too many new points.
Julian is right, I'm, not sure I'm going to go with the the first graders, but certainly the high school students I would trust to be responsible.
Other thing that I think we could call for is more information about what's happening for these kids that are now no longer in that.
Julian brother point was that was concern about being vague, but I think we could be very explicit about what how the process needs to be improved from the perspective of the public of people that are invested in education, including the primary stakeholders, students and and the teachers and families, and we could do another, a more specific resolution when we have more information and when policy changes, because in two months it's going to be totally in January, it's going to be totally different.
And I think it's going to happen over the next couple.
And I mean, if you want to know I'd like to make the resolution stronger.
You know I just wanted to briefly say that I'm also in favor of a resolution.
It is a I would call it a process resolution that would then reiterate, including all the voices that we wanted, which are students which are parents which are teachers.
You, know everyone that we feel has not been included and talk about how that occlusion process has to increase, and the second part is that, as we decide to open up schools that we expand.
I mean I think what happens here out in New York will have a ripple impact on all the major school systems and the fact that we paused it.
And I think that sometimes the even the board can be so I'm just very proud of the way that we work through conflict in this committee.
