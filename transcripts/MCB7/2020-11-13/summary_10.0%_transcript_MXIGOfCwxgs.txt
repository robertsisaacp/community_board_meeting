One thing that's holding us up is we have some sidewalk vault lights that have been covered by an existing epdm membrane in an area way on the northeast, corner.
This area way has been covered well before that, my time at the building, my six years, here, I'm, assuming more than 20 years, based on the condition that I'm seeing.
When we were in the boiler room below the area way, we noticed some deteriorated, vault lights, the metal is gone, the glass lights themselves are gone and from the top side, all you see is the black epdm membrane.
Way, itself is kind of difficult unless you're purposely going to that granite wall and looking over.
We wanted to replace this membrane with a modern, modified bitumen system and liquid resin flashings to keep the water from coming into the boiler room.
So, as you can see, the area we're talking about, is on the northeast corner at West, 79Th, Street and Broadway.
That's, going to protect the machinery and the materials down in the boiler, room below all right.
Here we have a historic photo of the app thorp on the left and on the right.
The first photo you're looking on the northeast corner towards the building.
If you look at the photo wall on the right, you'll see what we had to do to stop to temporarily stop the water from coming in.
You know I'm willing to work with LPC and the community as best as possible.
Could, either go back with the railing to give it the historic look or we could right.
Going in to you know around the area.
This clean up the area make it look a little better than it was the management company that we have there now who's running the building.
You see the existing section where we call out the vault lights, the lightweight, topping and the black Epm membrane, and then on the right.
You know what you're right, but one thing that I was saying before is a little different now from when I first started with this project, when I first started with this building six years ago, it was a different management.
I, do not want to say anything about that, but the new management company, I can say, is very much so on top of the security lighting overall maintenance of the building and I do hope, basically from what I've seen that they've been able to reduce drastically the amount of homeless that have been on in the north corner and as far as grading.
The full board voted on the proposal to build that rooftop edition and the vote was 35 to 2 against it and he rest in peace, Tom, Vatulo, Martin and me were the two that wanted it to that felt.
You know coming back to that space and this may be completely out of context, but any way to do any planters or anything there.
We, there was an approval of one at that church on Central Park West right, but it was a very tiny little strip and it was going to be hidden behind a handicap or an ADA accessible ramp, anyway.
Some of you may remember being on the committee when a very modest storefront on Columbus avenue sort of next door to the Dakota bar was an open kitty store the coffee, store, yeah, hello, kitty.
One is restore them as they were, which is the little circles with with glass on them or some sort of transparent membrane, and the other is that sort of it was sort of a diamond pattern was not it Jay. Yeah, which would not, which would not work here, because it has holes in it.
And the issue of appropriateness strikes me as whether or not you see the removal of this historic feature as compromising the historic character of this of this building, keeping in mind that it is visible and on the street from from past to Passersby the vault lights as they were, then it would be visible.
Think the committee voted to say: let the just be covered with a concrete slab, but that was not the result.
Right landmarks gives you the option of either that diamond pattern thing, or the restoration of the little white little round lights.
The other facades, are actually open area ways that you could see into the level below.
On, the other side, we've done work on the granite railings around them, but there was no covering to those areas.
You want to waterproof the enclosed area, ways on the north wall on West 79Th street.
You want to remove the cast iron vault lights that have been covered and replace them with concrete, with concrete and well first and a petroleum-based membrane, with granules and sealed by liquid resin.
Anybody else have a question or a thought before we consider that we, our resolution, is to not to remove the bench but to renovate restore the bench.
Okay, so we'll go with the resolution to remove the vault lights, restore the bench, remove the vault lights and replace it with concrete and, as I said, before, petroleum-based membrane, with granules and liquid resin to seal it as a sealant.
This proposal is at 18, West 75th street to reconstruct the historic masonry Stoop and the front Masonry yard wall.
We want to maintain the elements across this building and our neighbors, and the reason that we're before you and also going to the committee is that a previous owner, an earlier renovation, changed the entire height of the parlor floor.
This is a diagram of sort of what happens on the block and again a photo of our adjacent neighbor, 20 West 75th street.
We have a lot of height differences that we're working with so we're using planters, which are also visible at the 20 West 75th street.
Here is a rendering that we've taken to look in the same perspective as the historic so that you can see we're maintaining these historic lines, we're maintaining the substantial size of the newels, and this is where we say that we've got about three risers that we have to add into our stoop to meet the height change with that 23 inch height change that the previous owner did before the rest of the lines are very consistent and the substantial the sort of heaviness of this masonry stoop and.
This has the decoration, the decorative elements, the Newel posts and on the left is the proposed with the historic outline of the doors where they would have been if the 23 inches that the previous owner had not changed.
Here is the photo where we have the curved element, which is the historic masonry opening with the gate.
Here's a little bit more about the front area way where we're taking out the black iron rail.
It is something that we have to accommodate, but it's an existing condition, and so since it does not match a hundred percent the historic precedent, then we have to go through the process of going to the commission.
They think that the commission is going to be supportive of this, but the process because of that 23-inch height changes, the level of the landing, and so the process is to go through with the Community Board approval and Landmarks Commission.
Why you're, going from a railing to the masonry at the front yard, wall.
You know the configuration of the historic doors.
My assumption is that we will resolve to approve the application to restore the stoop and I would include a strong recommendation to replicate the historic configuration of the doors in proportion to the to the height increase of the steps, and that's just the front door.
Yes, to replace the front door as one pane of glass, one on each side, right.
I just could I just ask that if the client approves the configuration of the door that we've recommended that you notify the committee chairs, so we know that thanks, Jay. Even I think you vote on December 1st from December 1st.
For a long time and looked at the before and after pictures of the building at 3:28 and I.
So the resolution would be to approve the application that, as presented to us today, all right, so I'm going to take a vote, Jay. Yes, I'm, sorry, Michelle.
Yeah December and you know our full board.
