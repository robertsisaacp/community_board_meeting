And it might just be you and me tonight: okay, oh Josh, hi, Josh, hey hello, Whoops got ta mute that sorry Josh you're in a new location, I'm in a different location than the last time. Yes, I'm at the gym mill tonight all right, I'm going to start the webinar too. So we're recording and live streaming yeah. We are okay and that'll. Let the attendees in assuming that at least one of them will be the presenter hi Peter. Okay, all right, Jeff Sherman! You have an old version of zoom. So I could not ask you a question which application are you here for I am here for 108Th Street, West, 108Th, Street, okay, I'm going to return you to attendees, then, and we'll call you back up when they get to that item on the agenda. Okay, thank you. Nothing, personal, no offense taken anthony Vale Reveal or what application are you here for I did not hear I did not hear either. Oh thanks! Michelle you put the the agenda in the in the chat, great hi, Julian nice to see you and Mr Lombardi. What application are you here for? Yes, hi? I'm here for 2211 broadway, very good, all right we're going to. Let me see what I can do here. I did not do that I. Did it yeah? Thank you, tricky whoops, okay, hello, Michelle, hello, how's, the grandkids, wonderful, wow, you're, a lucky man, yes, Jay could I share something with you and have you not react? Probably not yeah? Okay, that's not going to happen without meaning to start a discussion. I thought I'd tell you that I received an email today from Ed Pinkard, the borough, commissioner of the Department of Transportation, who tells me that, because there is no community partner on West End Avenue, they are ceasing that open street as of tomorrow. But if a community partner comes forward, they'll reevaluate, actually I saw a note from Andrew on that. Just as I was opening my email, so I already reacted loudly excellent. So you do not have to be concerned very good. Let's see who else is here, Mr Lombardi? Is there anybody on your team that I should be promoting to work with you on the first application, 2211 the appthorpe better? If you unmute there, you go yes from my team, was Anthony Velli, okay, I'll promote him thanks there, although we could not hear we could not hear Mr belly when we called on before so. Do you guys have a quorum and do you have somebody to take minutes? I'll, take minutes. Okay, I, do not you do have a quorum yeah. We do have a quorum, hello, doug. So once you get started all right, I'll start I'll. Kick us off! Welcome everybody! Thank you. We're the Preservation committee of Community Board. Seven, our job is to determine the best we can the appropriateness of any proposed modifications or additions and or renovations. Our role with the Landma Landmarks Preservation Commission is advisory. They sometimes listen to what we have to say, and sometimes they do not so, but we're very glad to be meeting with you all and to hear hear about the projects that you have in mind and ask you some questions as well. Thank you. Thank you all right, so you're our first, our first one on our agenda, the F Thorpe, time-honored, West, side institution and we're glad to hear what you've got going. Thank you very much again. Thank you all for having me I just wanted to give a brief history of my experience with the appthorpe. It's you know, I hold it in a special place. It's one of my favorite projects that I'm working on I'm an architect registered in New York and I've been working on the app dwarf for about six years. We did the facade renovation which brought it back to a safe standard. We replaced roofs and now we're dealing with leaks that we're having in the below grade space due to the sidewalk. So we've been provided permission to do work on the south and the West, and we're currently just finalizing permission from the MTA to do work on the north and the east. We feel like we should have that approval shortly. Hopefully, one thing that's holding us up is we have some sidewalk vault lights that have been covered by an existing epdm membrane in an area way on the northeast corner. This area way has been covered well before that, my time at the building, my six years here, I'm assuming more than 20 years, based on the condition that I'm seeing. But when we were in the boiler room below the area way, we noticed some deteriorated, vault lights, the metal is gone, the glass lights themselves are gone and from the top side, all you see is the black epdm membrane. In closing that area is a four foot plus or minus four foot granite railing. So to see the area way, itself is kind of difficult unless you're purposely going to that granite wall and looking over. So we wanted to replace this membrane with a modern, modified bitumen system and liquid resin flashings to keep the water from coming into the boiler room below. So our acquaintances at the Landmarks Committee said that it was just something that they wanted to put forth towards the Community Board and we were hoping for permission to remove the waterproofing, the deteriorated side lights and put a new lightweight, topping and waterproofing membrane to stop the leaks. So do you want me to bring up your slides or do you want to do it yourself or if you could, that would be great. Thank you. That would help. So this helps me out significantly. Thank you. So, as you can see, the area we're talking about is on the northeast corner at West, 79Th, Street and Broadway. Currently, in this area, there's a black Epm membrane and if you go to the we have some can I interrupt for a second. What is it Etm? Oh excuse me, excuse me I apologize epdm is a yeah. Epdm is a single ply, rubberized roofing membrane that is was popular 20 years ago, or so even more, but now, with new technologies and roofing systems, they've gone to a modified bitumen type of membrane, which is a petroleum-based membrane with granules that protect it from uv degradation. So it's a better world system for the area and in conjunction with the modified membrane, we use liquid resin flashings, which is a liquid, applied waterproofing at all terminations seams and joints. It's just a more robust waterproofing system. That's going to protect the machinery and the materials down in the boiler, room below all right and I assume whatever happened way back whenever happened without landmarks involvement, I can only assume, because I've been working closely with landmarks and we've done a lot of research and there's no photo documentation or anything. That shows a time when this areaway was closed over because on the rest of the building, all of the areaway is accessible and you can see into the lower level. Okay right so here we have a historic photo of the app thorp on the left and on the right. We have current photos after the facade, repairs have been done. I'm proud of this building, I'm happy the way the restoration came out. The biggest achievement of this was the copper cornice at the top of the building. It was in terrible condition when we got there, it was filled with holes and causing terrible leaks into the penthouse area of the roof, and we completely repaired it coated it anything that we repaired. We pre-patented the copper. It was a really interesting renovation project, restoration project. So, if you go to the you should have some photos of the conditions I'm talking about. So here we are I just wanted to give you guys a reference. Your the first photo you're looking on the northeast corner towards the building, so you're looking southwest towards the building and you'll see that granite wall. That I was talking about. That's it's about four feet: high I myself, I'm not the tallest person around so for me to actually see into that. I have to stand directly adjacent to it and look over to see what's going on in there and if you look at the photo wall on the right, you'll see what we had to do to stop to temporarily stop the water from coming in. So you can see the black below the clear polyethylene sheet and we've tried termination bars and whatever we could to stop the water from coming in. So that's where we currently stand with this area away. I have a couple of questions in photo number one: I'm not the tallest person in the world either, but I did glance over before you put that structure there over the wall. There were people living in that area. Yes, there was and there's, and that's why I thought you put. That structure was put there. No, that particular structure you're seeing in this photo was this event below that from the boiler room space so that perforated screen around that is to allow the airflow not to house any. No I did not that would that would be a deterrent from somebody sleeping there. That's what I meant correct, also in photo number two. You have a bench and according to your description, that was not in the original plans of the app store, but you do not know when that bench was built. Nobody at this point and we've been doing a lot of research on this bench. Nobody knows when that bench was installed. I do know, there's a bus stop directly across from this bench right between myself and all my LPC friends over there, we've not been able to find when that bench was installed, and you want to remove that bench as well and put the granite wall back up. Well, there's two options at this point: we I'm you know I'm willing to work with LPC and the community as best as possible. However, you would like so I gave my client who manages the abdo adoption of we could either go back with the railing to give it the historic look or we could right now. It's a coated. Excuse me it's a concrete bench that has reinforcements showing the rebar is poking out everywhere. It's spalling everywhere, so I had recommended. Maybe we repair the bench and coat it to match the existing adjacent railing, so one of those two options and LPC seems to be happy with either one we just have to provide direction from ownership, how they want to go with that yeah. Sorry, one more question: Jay, sorry yeah! You said in the beginning that you needed MTA approval. Yes, what I know there's a bus? Stop there I happen to live around the corner. Great. What approval do you need from them? They just want to see that we are taking into consideration their bus, stop structure the subway structure, which is adjacent on the northeast corner. That I just wanted to be conscious of all the adjacent structures, so we're not disrupting anything during our renovation work at the sidewalk. Okay, sorry, no I just want to make sure I understand. So under this temporary protection. Is this membrane? Yes, and under the membrane we still have the vault lights yeah, you know what, if you could go to the I have a section that might I'd like to see the vault lights. Oh one more photo. Okay, so actually photo number six. If you go back, I'm sorry yeah, two slides, please there you go photo number six in the bottom right corner. If that's from the boiler room, looking up and you'll see, do you have do you have a photo of the actual vault lights? Yes, so this oh there they are okay! Yeah, this is from the bottom up. Do you have any? Do you have any photos of them at the sidewalk level, no they're all covered and encapsulated by this black rubber membrane, which is in the picture adjacent to the left? Okay, and are the other vault lights generally intact? No they're, not what I'm actually showing is one of the better areas of it in most areas, they've completely either rusted out, because they're cast iron and fallen out or they're missing all the glass and just not in very good shape, structurally or aesthetically. Okay, thanks, thank you. So if you could please zoom out so in this picture on the left, you'll see, that is the condition of the membrane prior to that clear plastic sheet that we just put down temporarily to stop the water from coming in it's just a black membrane. Going in to you know around the area way. This is actually clean. We cleaned this out very well. It was becoming a garbage bin. You know people were just tossing their trash in there. Unfortunately, sometimes people were found to be sleeping in there. So what we're hoping to do is put back a membrane, that's clean! Just this clean up the area make it look a little better than it was the management company that we have there now who's running the building. They really care about this building as much as I do and they are they're really taking care of the building. Maintaining very well I do not foresee that happening in the future. I hope not. How does the drainage work from the area ways? There is a dream in the aerial way. There's one dream: okay, it's not shown in his photos, unfortunately, but there is one drain in the area. So how do you encourage drainage into that drain? Now, when we go back we're going to have a now? Could you please go to the section please and I'll show you how we intend on doing that? Okay, so on the left, you see the existing section where we call out the vault lights, the lightweight topping and the black Epm membrane, and then on the right. You'll see my proposed section where we're putting a new corrugated deck lightweight, topping waterproofing membrane and then a new topping on top of that, so we'd be encouraging drainage with the slope of the lightweight, topping yeah I, can't honey. Sorry, no worries no worries, so that's pretty much. It we've definitely taken drainage into mind. With this excuse me close the door, please, honey! Sorry, no worries this is I have children. So it's like this for me every day, that's my husband, my wife and I have children. My wife said so that that's pretty much what we're trying to do. We just want to keep it clean. Here's a better close-up picture of! Oh that's, good, yeah, some of the better locations of the vault lights, and you can see. There's no glass left, it's just really oxidized and dangerous. I would say you know: I would not walk on it. Those contractors do with a little braver than I, so that will be just removed or covered over or I would like to remove everything down to the existing steel structure. You know down to the existing and then we're going to put a new corrugated metal deck lightweight, topping and then waterproof got it. So what what's going to be permanent and visible is corrugated metal? No, sir, it's going to be a lightweight concrete, topping with waterproofing on it, and the waterproofing will be light in color. It should brighten up the space. What material I mean? Is the water proofing a separate material on material on top of the concrete? Yes, it's a liquid resin flashing, which you could get in white or gray. Okay, have you have you guys considered putting any kind of like elevated grading or something that would solve the problem of people sleeping in there because they sounds like once? It's all done. You have the same issue. You know what you're right, but one thing that I was saying before is a little different now from when I first started with this project, when I first started with this building six years ago, it was a different management company. I, do not want to say anything about that, but the new management company, I can say, is very much so on top of the security lighting overall maintenance of the building and I do hope, basically from what I've seen that they've been able to reduce drastically the amount of homeless that have been on in the north corner and as far as grading. On top of that, I'm willing to do anything but I know landmarks will not will not be probably too excited about putting a grating on top of that and I know the building itself as much as I love the building the people who live there love this building just as much, if not more a lot of them, so I do not know if they would like us to modify anything like that. But I have thought about something like that. Yes, just as an aside were you there when, when the rooftop edition was proposed, I was not there when the rooftop edition was proposed, but I know all about it and I have some associates of mine. Who did try to get that and I'm glad that they did not, because right now, in addition to the cornice work, that I did there's two collinated masses up at the top of the building. You guys family yeah, we're very familiar with I, was on the committee at that time and we actually took a tour of the roof as part of the process of trying to get that rooftop edition approved. So one of my associates, Lee, Ping Kwon, he was I think he was involved with that as well. He was on our committee at the time yeah he's a member of my church. Okay, just for the record, the full board voted on the proposal to build that rooftop edition and the vote was 35 to 2 against it and he rest in peace, Tom, Vatulo, Martin and me were the two that wanted it to that felt. It was appropriate and I actually felt it was well. It was I felt it was. Let's get back on topic here, though, just for history I apologize, but if you should see the work we did up there too. If you ever have a chance to go up the roof again, it's clean and nice and oh yeah, excellent, all right all right! Sorry, questions yeah! If I may, I'm not on the committee, but I'm on the board. I just wanted to get a better understanding. So this the purpose of this vault was for light and ventilation to the to the vault area. It was for light into the low okay and so which is generally not visible to the public unless you peered over right. So now those vault lights are going to be removed right and it's the okay. So the regarding the bench, I would just say again as a non-committee member here, I would be in support of restoring the bench and not removing it. I think it adds a nice thing when I when I was a child. I, remember waiting on that bench with my mother, taking the waiting, the crosstown bus, so good, I think and that's more better. Those experiences are invaluable and that's why I was thinking about, let's just repair it and then, if LPC approves and if everybody approves we code it to match the granite railing. Maybe that tells us something about the date of the bench. I do not know you know what. Actually, when was that, sir? That would be in the mid-1970s. You helped me out a little bit. Thank you. Thank you appreciate it. The only place, but besides the apart from the bus, stop that's the only place for people to sit on the route between Broadway and West. Oh yeah, so I would be in favor of restoring it as well. The only other thought I had with regard to you know what Jay brought up about, possibly having a recurring problem of homeless. You know coming back to that space and this may be completely out of context, but any way to do any planters or anything there. You know that would be attractive and functional. I'll tell you the truth, I'm not against that! Either. I have to see how the building feels about security. You know, maybe somebody could hide behind a plant or something I do not know. Maybe I'm thinking too deep into it. Rats and defecations and urination good point, maybe an elevation. It would be at an elevated it right if this is like three or four feet: high yeah and we're a little off topic again, because whether or not the homeless occupied the space is not really whether or not the renovation proposed is appropriately appropriate or not. Thank you. The the thing that I'll share if I may with the chairs. Yes, thanks is that we've seen a couple of applications to remove these vault lights, and it's not a it's not a surprise to me that this could not have been approved at staff level there. We there was an approval of one at that church on Central Park West right, but it was a very tiny little strip and it was going to be hidden behind a handicap or an ADA accessible ramp anyway right and there I think they let it go. But some of you may remember being on the committee when a very modest storefront on Columbus avenue sort of next door to the Dakota bar was an open kitty store the coffee store, yeah, hello, kitty. No, it was the it was a. It was a. It was next to hello Kitty. It was a brazil right. It was a brazilian coffee place which I just remember that part of it and they were all ready to open, and then the there was a concrete slab over the vault lights. So the vault lights had not been seen in a generation, and then somebody stepped on it the wrong way. It all caved in and they discovered the vault lights and then LPC would not let them remove the vault lights, even though our committee I believe voted to, allow them to remove the vault lights and Jay was actually the guy. Who did some research on this and found out that there are two things that you can do with vault lights. One is restore them as they were, which is the little circles with with glass on them or some sort of transparent membrane, and the other is that sort of it was sort of a diamond pattern was not it Jay that metal diamond yeah, which would not, which would not work here, because it has holes in it and then the water could go through. So I'm pretty sure that's what Mr Lombardi is in for when he goes to LPC. Is that there'll be a desire to keep these things even though vault lights like these are part and parcel of the character of the Soho historic district? But one could argue not necessarily a recurring element or popular theme of upper West side, historic districts, but that's for you guys to decide, and so that's if I may and the issue of appropriateness strikes me as whether or not you see the removal of this historic feature as compromising the historic character of this of this building, keeping in mind that it is visible and on the street from from past to Passersby the vault lights as they were, then it would be visible. The fact that they're covered up now is the existing condition, but not the historic condition: yeah I guess if you worked at it, they're visible Michelle. You know like. If you really wanted to see them, is it possible to restore them mark my recollection, it's possible to restore them. My recollection was, but a replacement is not doable. A replacement is, and you know anything is doable enough time and money, and if I have access to that time and money I will restore everything throughout the city, possibly I'm a restoration architect. First, most of my buildings are all I'm all existing buildings, the art, deck quality, so I lean that way always and if my building and the clients and everybody had that feel to go that way and the money to do so. I would definitely like to go that route. Thank you mark. My recollection was that the committee approved a replacement with with the diamond embossed medal. I know I voted against it. I felt that store that the that the sidewalk vault light should be, in fact replaced, and my recollection and correct me if I'm wrong and I'll defer to your recollection, was that landmarks approved the diamond embossed medal. The second part is correct. I do not remember what our resolution was, although I think that you were in the minority on that, because I think most of it was I, think the committee voted to say let the just be covered with a concrete slab, but that was not the result. Hey Doug, that was not the result at at landmarks. Right landmarks gives you the option of either that diamond pattern thing, or the restoration of the little white little round lights right. So they do not insist on the little round lights because, as I understand and Mr lombardi can tell us they're quite expensive I looked into it. They are yeah, yes, you're right mark. This is not a hardship application. This is a this is whether or not this is appropriate standing up as it is okay, so anyway, I talked too much go ahead. Yeah we're sympathetic, but you know I, guess I myself, I'm not that to the idea of replacing the mankind, but others may feel differently. Yeah well, I did then with the other project and I feel the same way. Now that all things being equal and generally, we we've always had a policy of not considering the possible expense of doing things with whatever it is. Whatever the project is conceitedly, it would be more expensive to replace them, but I felt that and I felt now, if it's historically, that was the that was the configuration there. It should be if you're doing a restoration, it should be restored to the way it was historically so that that's my opinion. What happened to the other facades was work done on the vaults there. No, the other facade, the other facades, are actually open area ways that you could see into the level below. This is the only area that's covered up because of the boiler room space below, but the so you re retained and refurbished the volts. On the other side, we've done work on the granite railings around them, but there was no covering to those areas. There's no there's no vault lights. There's no vault lights is to water. You want to waterproof the enclosed area, ways on the north wall on West 79Th street. You want to remove the cast iron vault lights that have been covered and replace them with concrete, with concrete and well first and a petroleum-based membrane, with granules and sealed by liquid resin. Yes, thank you for getting all that yeah. Absolutely right. Yes, all right! Anybody else have a question or a thought before we consider that we, our resolution, is to not to remove the bench but to renovate restore the bench, even though that was not part of the original structure it we watched that on it. So it has historical value adds to the meaning of the building. Are you proposing a resolution then to approve the application to approve it? Yes, with the with the, so is everybody in favor of you're, not in favor. Today of Rep of removing the vault lights, you want them, replaced correct all right. Anybody else want to weigh in on that one way or the other I'm a great I'm in agreement with Jed philosophically really do not like to agree with Jay, but I do yeah once in a while yeah Doug. Do you want to consider that separately or Michelle? Should we consider that separately then or not, Michelle I do not think it's appropriate for me to weigh in I was not a part of the conversation. Okay Peter. What is your philosophy about the vault lights? I want to prove, what's been keeping the bench right? Sorry, but I want to hear what you have to say about the volt lights Peter. What do you have to say about the vault lights? Removing them not replacing them, I! Think it's! Okay! Thank you! Sir! Okay, so we'll go with the resolution to remove the vault lights, restore the bench, remove the vault lights and replace it with concrete and, as I said, before, petroleum-based membrane, with granules and liquid resin to seal it as a sealant. I appreciate I, appreciate that everybody, okay, do not appreciate us yet. Excuse me: excuse me: okay, so I'll call by Name Jay, no Josh, yes, Susan, no Peter, yes, Madge, no Doug, you're, abstaining. I'd actually turn to mark should I abstain or not be counted for the vote. I've heard none of the conversation, so you so I. This is a tricky thing, but I think what you should do is turn off your camera and pretend you're not here for a few minutes because yeah, oh no, but I'm staying as a no and he's intending now: okay, yeah, okay, yes, and I'm yes, so it's the one two three four yeses three nos well, the slimmest of margins, yeah and mark. What's your vote, non-committee vote I would vote in favor of the resolution and Doug in favor of okay, so non-committee vote is two zero and the committee vote is four: three zero? Okay, so the resolution passes: when are you land? When are you going to be at landmarks? Do you know I can talk to them. I'll, send an email right after this and tell them yeah. So let me just let me jump got some emails as we were sitting here. Oh, did we okay yeah, but the the full board meeting is on December, okay. First, yes, so you would need to schedule this after December 1st, with a 4-3 vote. It would not be fair to send just a committee action down to LPC you would. We would want to give all of our full board colleagues an opportunity to either affirm or revise the resolution. So please do not schedule your public hearing for any time earlier than December 8th, December, 8th or December 1st first Saturday 8th, because December 1st would have been the afternoon before the full board right, yeah I know at LPC yeah right. Oh that's right! So they meet on two on the following Tuesday, which is the eighth you're right, okay time thereafter, all right all right! Thank you very much now I would like to thank you all. Thank you very much. Yeah one of us will be at LPC excellent, I'll. Let LPC know what's come of it and just let me know if there's any action on my side, all right, yeah, just as Mr Diller said, keep in mind your scheduling absolutely will I appreciate it. Everybody thank you time. Thank you. Thank you. Take care everybody bye-bye! Thank you all right! That's the next one Us 18 75.! Okay! This is for to recreate the stoop in a historically accurate manner. Indeed, so, let's I see a bunch of folks in the oh Julian's still with us great, so Mr Sherman is for 108Th Street right. So I'm not sure who, among these folks, are here for 75Th Miss Cohen. Are you here for 75th? Yes, that's correct, okay, so we'll bump you up and is there anybody on with you here that I should include in our in our in on the panel for now? Okay, so is it just you no I think my I have colleagues, but they were going to stay quiet, although my my boss may still be in his office Juan matis I. Well, if he's your boss and I'm promoting him to panelists and anybody else, Jayesh Jane, are they part of your team Jayesh's, but that's I think he was. He was fine to be a silent observer all right. Well, then, if I can share okay, I'll, let you share. You should now be able to share okay and everyone is seeing my screen, and this is Juan Matis, Hilda Cohen will be presenting for us and I'm going to sit very quietly here in case something comes up but she's managing this presentation for us. Thank you very much. Thank you. This is our presentation that we are giving to LPC. We have a date of December 8th in case. You wanted to know that and I will go through this briefly touch on the images that we've given to you. This proposal is at 18, West 75th street to reconstruct the historic masonry Stoop and the front Masonry yard wall. Based on these the 1940s tax photos. We have some very good historic details in these photos. We want to maintain the elements across this building and our neighbors and the reason that we're before you and also going to the committee is that a previous owner, an earlier renovation, changed the entire height of the parlor floor. So they raised that floor, 23 inches. So what could be a very straight forward? Historic stoop reconstruction? We are accommodating this 23 inch change and without further ado we will go through. So this is 18 West 75th street. It is on 75th between Central Park, West and Columbus avenue, the a larger scale picture of the historic Stoop, the Mason renewals, the Brownstone columns, and then what you can see. The small picture in the middle is the existing conditions where the stoop had been has been completely removed and the basement entrance. I'm sorry can you can you tell us if, because it looks like the arrow is pointing to the to the box stoop the stoop that turns the corner. Is that the building or is it the one next to it? That has a streets too. So that is actually our neighbor, and this is the tax photo of our neighbor, and it's just that the tax photo label covered over all of the details. So we've been using this one, but our block is actually our lot is 44. So good thanks a lot. I'm sorry I started interrupt, no problem straight. Stoop drinks correct in that photo and we'll see the historic photo again so we'll we use it. A couple of times in the presentation, okay, the top photo- is a photo montage of the south elevation of the street, so our building is outlined in red. This is 18 West 75th street. You can see 20 22 24. These were all built by John Byrne, the architect 1889, to 1890 and per the LPC designation report. This is a renaissance revival with Queen Anne Elements, and you can see across all of these facades these horizontal elements we want to maintain those. We are trying we're using all of these existing precedents. In our proposal, you can also see the bottom photo is the north side. It also shows consistent elements across the elevations these next sheets show- or these next photos show a lot of the existing conditions that we have now. So this is the sidewalk. We have a tree pit. What is existing is a black rail over a masonry curb and at the front, is in front of the masonry curb we have and the red line take note of that red line. We will show you where that is on the survey a little bit farther on the other photos over here on the left. We have a photo of the existing conditions. There is a lot of detail. A lot of detail was put back in this earlier renovation that was done by the previous owner, and we will be using a lot of that detail. It's across the facades across the bay we've got the enlarged stone. We will be replicating all of these details along there and then, and the bottom is a photo montage so that you see the basement entrance. You also see these really substantial masonry, stoops of 20 and 22. both of those have been recreated in the past 10:15 years. So again, this is a larger scale of the survey in order to do a real examination of how far out it sits with our neighbors, we asked our surveyor to take five different building properties, and here a bluff up left photo. You can see this red line is this is a blow up of it, and this red line is the extent of where the curb sits now, and we are not pushing past that we worked, we've been speaking back and forth with D.O.T. They asked they said that this was a really good line to hold on to. So that's also what we're working with. However, we do show that this block has undulating stoops the stoops push out. This is a diagram of sort of what happens on the block and again a photo of our adjacent neighbor, 20 West 75th street. So here's the proposal in a in more or less one photo or one example. We have the we are putting back doors instead of where the window is. At the parlor floor, we're replicating the larger scale of the Brownstone columns, which is directly adjacent at 20 west 75th we're replicating the masonry stoops, the substantial masonry renewals we've got the masonry wall coming around. We have a lot of height differences that we're working with so we're using planters, which are also visible at the 20 West 75th street. Here is a rendering that we've taken to look in the same perspective as the historic so that you can see we're maintaining these historic lines, we're maintaining the substantial size of the newels, and this is where we say that we've got about three risers that we have to add into our stoop to meet the height change with that 23 inch height change that the previous owner did before the rest of the lines are very consistent and the substantial the sort of heaviness of this masonry stoop and just like our neighbors, it does not feel overwhelming to have those extra risers, here's a few more images of the renderings again. This is the red line, which is our current extent and or the current extent of the front yard. We have. The planters which you can see are visible some of the decorative elements that we would be matching a lot of the detail, a lot of the colors that we would be matching and here's some more details, some more details. The sections show what is existing, which is just a simple rail down to the basement entrance, and then we would be putting back this the masonry stoop. You would still have an entrance. We would have a metal gate at the basement entrance Rep everything is replicated based on that historic photo, with the exception of the change in height that 23 inch change in height, which is what brings us here again. These are some plans that show what is being replicated we've tinted it sort of the brownstone color. The there are planters at that front area way. We would be keeping those we would be changing the metal rail to a masonry wall with some small newels to match the larger newels. The difference we have now from before is that we used to have a stoop adjacent to us, but our neighbor to the East has completely removed their stoop as well. So adding a newel post here really was able to sort of finish that wall. A few more sections just to show the difference between our existing on the left and our proposed, and this elevation starts to talk again about that. The only real difference that between the historic and our proposed is where those doors and those three risers are so the center elevation is the existing with the basement entrance and then and the black rail the proposed is at the right. This has the decoration, the decorative elements, the Newel posts and on the left is the proposed with the historic outline of the doors where they would have been if the 23 inches that the previous owner had not changed and I can just I can have you look at this if you want and then I, if you want to come back to any of these, we can as we're talking about the doors we still are looking to have two double doors, which is in keeping with the types of doors that we have at the stoop. But because of that change in height, we are lining up with the decorative elements within the door rather than having a transom above. But the light is similar, we're using all of the same language, all the same details and all the same horizontal lines may ask you a question: I'm just having a hard time following the 23 inch increase, which is the heart of the matter that I can see the 23 inch I believe increase in height on the steps. Is it also reflected at the top of the new proposed door so that new proposed door be 23, inches yeah, and this picture is where I'm having a hard time? It's not what ends up happening. Is it used to be that you could have about an eight foot door and a two and a half foot transom? But we do not have that transom above so the top of the door still lines up with the tops of the windows, so that horizontal line that you would see as you're walking up the side. That would be consistent, and so we just have shorter. Our doors are not as well. The doorway is not as tall, but the lines are hard hi. It is high, yes, and that means that the floor is at the floor. Of the parlor is at the bottom of the window, whereas in a typical condition, if the previous owner had not done that renovation, it would, you know, come up to about your knee when you're on that parlor floor. Does that better explain it does? Thank you. Is this a single-family residence? It is a single-family residence thanks and then just a few just to there's only a couple more photos with that. What we're doing at the gate, the precedent was a historic lattice and then more of a modern take on the on the lattice work. We have some precedence because we are putting some glazing behind the gate. We here is the photo where we have the curved element, which is the historic masonry opening with the gate. Here's a little bit more about the front area way where we're taking out the black iron rail and we're putting in the masonry wall we're using planters once again and I will go back to another photo at the end so that you can see all of these elements put together but we're maintaining sort of this separation between the outside and the inside and but just instead of the black rail. It is. The masonry here are a few of the details, so the renovation that was performed previously is in keeping with all of the original detail, but it is all at the stucco there's no cast stone, there's no real stone! That's left at the surface, so our finish would be matching that our profiles would match that any substrate would be covered with the stucco that stucco would match in color and it would match in details decorative elements all across the face, and so here again is the comparison with the historic tax photo and then the proposal. Other questions, yeah, just okay, I, have a question. Oh wait go ahead! Doug just are we on this particular request? Are we will we be discussing specifically the appropriateness of the 23-inch increase? Is that the heart of the issue, or is it in the and this cohen, in your in your brief you mentioned specifically, that was why you were here at the preservation committee, that specific reason. So, in our conversations with landmarks, they consider that 23-inch to be an existing condition. It is something that we have to accommodate, but it's an existing condition, and so since it does not match a hundred percent the historic precedent, then we have to go through the process of going to the commission. They seem to you know our feedback and I do not want to have you be biased one way they seem to be completely supportive of this. They think that the commission is going to be supportive of this, but the process because of that 23-inch height changes, the level of the landing, and so the process is to go through with the Community Board approval and Landmarks Commission. Thank you. If I may, this is Juan Matisse and if I may add one thing, so this existing condition. Basically, the prior owner raised the parlor level so that the floors are co-planar with the sill of the windows, which are landmark, accurate and historically accurate on the exterior, but our doorway happens to be these 23 inches higher and therefore that difference does not allow our owner and us to provide you with a exact and historically accurate condition, and therefore that oddity is what we're dealing with yeah Susan. Did you have a question thanks? I did I'm just curious? Why you're going from a railing to the masonry at the front yard wall yeah? It's a I think it was the condition of the historic nature of it. He's also next to a multi-family building and he prefers to have the masonry I think he's had people lock up their bikes in front and find it quite disturbing. So it's and it's very taken with the masonry action. Thank you. I have another question about the masonry on the I. Guess it would be the West side. Is that? Can you go back to that picture, please that shows the metal railing one of the existing conditions photos. Let me see just so. We could see the railing on the West side. Well, this is okay, it is having masonry. There will block some of the light from going into the window. Won't it we he's aware of that. The owner is aware of that. What we've? What we've done is we've not raised it as high as we absolutely have to for code. We have raised a certain height and we've put planters there, which is one of those conditions. That is it's actually what we have. This is our east side, where the planters are right here, yeah and on our on our west side. There are planters, so it's he's aware it's going to block a little bit of light, he's accepting of that, and could you go back to what you're going to do with the doors and the window to the basement entrance that will remain an entrance correct. The basement entrance will remain an entrance. It will be underneath the stoop we do not have specifically a drawing of that with a new masonry, but we do not anticipate having to change that door. We will have to change the masonry around it because the masonry, the new stoop, will sort of take its place, but there won't really be a change in height to that door. We were, we were going to keep the door, you have a room to get in there under the stoop. It looks very tight, it's it's actually after they raised that floor, 23 inches above it's quite a tall. It's quite yeah but I think that's an eight foot door right. We have steps down. I can go to one of the sections, so you can see it actually is quite high. The space underneath the stoop. Well, because you have the three additional risers we have yes, the basement with that. With the rays of the parlor floor level, we have a taller basement. The existing condition is that the basement floor is taller than typical right. Can you explain why you have the door in four panels of or two by two panels of glass instead of one tall panel of glass on each side for the front door? Yeah it was. It was a selection. We do not have I do not know if that ratio has been discussed well, I, I'm just sort of looking at your precedence and the one that seems the most applicable is the tall thin single panes on either of the french doors and the the divided light ones or the divided pane ones are very decorative, very you're sort of curved and and carved a bit and like that, and it seems like you're, proposing a much simpler door and the simpler doors seem to be the ones that have the single pane on either side. So I'm wondering what is there precedent that you can cite for that particular configuration or functionality, or why is it that way? We were the client said that he liked his basement door, so we were mimicking some of the heights and sort of cleanliness sort of more modern lines of the basement door, which has a it's almost split where it's wood to about halfway through the on this photo. If you can see here's the existing door, so it is a higher wood, it's not as low as what we have at our neighbor yeah I understand, I. Just got to tell you that the that a basement door and a front door on top of the stoop strike me as different different things, they're very different yeah. You said what was the configuration of the historic door yeah it was a I can go to the best photo that we have for that it was a. It was a taller. It was taller glass than what we are showing in the proposed. Would you want it to be the same or similar? We certainly can I do not know if that becomes. One of those issues that is I can certainly propose that to the to the owner I do not there there's not an absolute set. It's much more. At this point, LPC has told us that it's really about the masonry Stoop so but I definitely will make note of that. Yeah I think it's a very good point. This is Juan matis. Additionally, the doors from having been a part of many of these kinds of restorations. The doors have have a very lax leeway on the type of panel, the amount of glass, even the color, and so we find that there's usually not a very specific type of door. That goes with a very specific type of building, and you all are familiar with the neighborhood more than us. The doors is quite a variety as long as they're, properly material properly proportioned. They have the elegant kind of hardware. That's appropriate landmarks is fairly lenient with the actual geometry. Unless you do something that completely is out of context, but if you're replicating the stoop- and you know the configuration of the historic doors, why not replicate those also? Well, they can't because they have a much shorter door and they do not have a choice. Well, they can yeah, they can do it proportionately, but the basic configuration of the single pane yeah, like a glass rather than the divided lights, could be done. Is that correct? Yes, we will discuss it with our owner, but I just wanted to just sort of make it make you all aware. From our vantage point, the doors are a sort of ha. There is some leeway we'll speak to the owner and see if we can increase the size of the glass. This is just in the basement. So hey, could you tell me the terminology on this michele they're at the top of the steps front door, the main door we're talking about I know it's premature since we do not have a resolution yet, but it my assumption is that we will resolve to approve the application to restore the stoop and I would include a strong recommendation to replicate the historic configuration of the doors in proportion to the to the height increase of the steps, and that's just the front door front. One on each side. I could go along with that. The proposal does not bother me for one thing: it kind of mimics the detailing on either side of the door, and it also suggests to me it's got a little bit reminiscent of the transom, but I could go either way on it. Yeah I would not suggest making it a condition of approval yeah, but with a strong recommendation on stating that would be a preference great. We could do that. That's my one man's opinion and we're okay with the materials they're. All the excuse me. These soup will be emit. It's all masonry. Well, Stucco, I'm sorry! It's stucco! It's still considered masonry. But yes, it's a it's a stucco finish to match the existing stucco finish. Can we get the historic trash cans back? Is anybody going to do any detail? Work on the staircase like detail? Pardon yes in the in the rendering in the computer, rendering areas that have panels these sort of areas that have panels those actually represent the decorative elements that would be matched so where we have decorative element here. We've created sort of this rectangle of decorative element so, instead of rendering it in the computer, we've got these rectangular areas, it won't be blank, but it's a it's very heavy same with the Newel image. Correct, yeah, great all right, any other questions. Are we ready to move forward with a resolution? Yep? Would you please stop sharing your screen so that our colleagues can see each other? Thank you. Okay, all right, Michelle you've been working away. Do we have a resolution that includes the recommendation of the? Yes, to replace the front door as one pane of glass, one on each side right. That would be our strong recommendation, a recommendation and other than that. It's an approval resolution. Man did, you want to say anything, nope just vote. Okay, I'll call names Jay, yes, Josh! Yes, thank you! Susan yep, Peter, yes, madge! You! She already called you already called her. How come I called you twice mitch. Maybe you wanted to vote. Did I call Susan, yet yep? Okay, all right match doug? How about? Yes? What? Yes? I'm sorry all right, so your vote is what match. Yes and my first apartment in New York was number 24 third floor, Bay window, that's exciting! Hey, yes, and I'm a yes. So it's one, two three four: five: six: seven, eight zero and non-committee board members, Mr Diller, yes and Doug. Yes, thank you. So the non-committee vote is two zero. Thank you. Thank you and we'll see you on the December. 8Th, December 8th is your date. It falls. December 8th is our date. Yes all right and you expect to start this work. Do you know when nice I'm not quite sure, but it's we would like to have everything sort of set up for the spring? Definitely when, if there's any, you know if we have a cold winter, definitely in the spring, if it does not seem that cold, maybe we could start it earlier, but we're very aware of the weather conditions for this type of work. Yeah. There are a few things up in the air these days. I just could I just ask that if the client approves the configuration of the door that we've recommended that you notify the committee chairs, so we know that thanks Jay that will yeah great help. We can even have more of a response. Even I think you vote on December 1st from December 1st, okay, so we'll try. We will work hard to get something back to you great. Thank you appreciate it. Thank you Jeff. Thank you all right, thanks very much good evening. So I see a few folks in the in the attendees Annabelle winfred. Are you here for the 108Th Street proposal? You have to unmute Mr Sherman. Do you have anybody on your team who I should promote to be on the panel with you if Sanam Javadi is still with us, I think that's the only member of my team, okay and Ms Winfred. Are you with us for this application I, I'm just sitting in very good. Thank you very welcome. Thank you very well. Have you here pleasure? Thank you guys. Okay, shall we get started with our last application yeah. This is an application to approve a paint front, facade brickwork, an application to approve the painting of the front Facade Brickwork correct. That is correct. All right! All right and I have I have a total of one slide from you. So if there are any more please either let me know, and you can share your screen or yeah I'll share my screen. If you do not mind all right, let's I'm going to pull mine down, you go ahead great and you are who to this project. Mr Sherman, I am the architect of record and and the project is a completed project. So this is actually our second application for the address. What we are now seeking is approval for the coding that was used to repaint the bricks on the front. Facade landmarks had approved repainting the brick facade, but the painter used a product that turned out to be an elastomeric coating and landmark staff can not approve elastomeric coatings, so we're seeking approval from the commissioners. Now, in a public hearing and first from you, could somebody either you Mr, Sherman or one of our colleagues, explain what an elastometric coding is and why why it's not something that staff can approve sure I could try an elastomeric coating. Is it tends to be a little thicker than paint they actually vary quite a bit. The reason they do not like it at landmarks is because of the thickness, so it has a slightly different look than paint. Although I think the coating that was used on this one you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference but b, that is a made. Staff can not approve it. So it has to go up to the commissioners. I think part of the problem is removing. It tends to tear away at the brick. That's exactly right and that's our concern that at this point stripping the bricks, which is what we would have to do to get a staff level approval risks damaging the fire skin of the bricks, which would lead to a premature decomposition of the of the masonry so leaving the coating in place causes the least harm to the historic facade and that's what we're advocating at this point. I went up to, hunt I live on, 80th I went up to 108Th, Street and stared at that building and the one next to it. For a long time and looked at the before and after pictures of the building at 3:28 and I, the first thing I thought was it's going to take some maintenance to keep things like plants from growing on it. You know vines and I wondered what effect if any of the buildings to each side would have on the paint that was used. Maybe that's: there's none, but well the building, that's to the left of ours, and you can see here the in the before photo and in the after photo. That project is going through a very large renovation. At the moment, I'm sure you've, probably weighed in on this- it's actually two or maybe three row houses that are being combined into one very large project. It's currently a painted facade, and presumably it will continue to be a painted facade. The building to the right is a brownstone that is not painted, but but in terms of vines growing up the building they used to be right. There were vines that growing up the building. There were no plans to to grow new vines on the building, and this shows you what it looks like in its current configuration. There's a tree planted in the front yard, but no vines planted I. Do not imagine. Vines would grow any differently on an elastomeric coating than they would on a painted, brick facade, but they may tear away at that type of paint, which is only like a sheet or in terms of texture. It does not really penetrate that paint does not penetrate the brick does it is. It is a non-penetrating coating, but then paint is a non-penetrating coating too. So there's really little difference. It is a breathable coating and that is why the the Gc actually chose it, but but no I do not think it would be any more susceptible to damage from vines than paint wood. It's a spectacular building, yeah, it's a lovely building and they did a phenomenal job, because there's a lot of preparation has to be done for that type of thing. Yes, yeah I mean the it looks, terrific and really does, and the quality of the work is really very high. Yeah, because there's a lot of detail there, they could have mocked up at any point and I stayed at that building for a long time. Yeah I did the same thing. Michelle I went up looking for a problem. It's very striking yeah all right questions. I've got one. This is mark. If is there a difference in useful life of the paint of this elastometric coating, as opposed to good old-fashioned paint from Benjamin Moore Elastomeric coatings will generally last about twice as long as a painted coating thanks. This is a private building, a private residence. It is single family, single, lucky family, spectacular building. What's the width of the building? Oh it it's quite wide I, I'm thinking it's 18 or 20 feet wide, but I do not have that information in front of me. It's been a while since I. Oh, you know what it may be on this. The survey that we have here 22 feet wide all right, other questions, all right, I'll stop. Sharing there we go. We you think we're ready to vote or what what's her feeling I do not see her Susan's here, okay, Susan, do you? Oh you have a question susan or you want to say something: I wonder what matches up with dinner, but no nothing really! The question is the appropriateness of the type of paint. Is that correct if I could share, I'm generally, not in favor of painting bricks for any purpose using anything, but it looks like the issue here is not whether or not it should be painted, but with what and I certainly lack any wisdom to guide that conversation. Did we see the picture of what it looked like? I was with a paint. Can you show that? Can you see that picture mark the one photograph that I had did not yeah the one corner, the one side, the left hand? No, the only thing I have there's a drawing. This is all I. Have oh I apologize, my wife I cut out? Could you ask the question again: yeah I just wanted to I wanted to see that picture again of the clothes everyone's frozen for me, oh I can I'll share the photo again. Yeah am I the only one. Thank you for indulging me team. Oh please, not at all. Yeah doug I think you are okay, nothing! Oh this one on the left. That's the after photo! That's what the wall outside looks like it's spectacular and that's the before above that yeah. Is it that shiny? No, it's a satin finish: yeah, okay, it's yeah! Sorry, okay, right I mean I. I'm ready to the resolution would be to approve the elastomeric coating. When was this painted I forgot, it was painted about three months ago three months ago. No would have been a little bit longer than that sorry, five months ago. Yeah! I'm sorry. Did anybody already ask the obvious question why the raw material was used? We we gave a performance spec, it was to be a breathable paint for Exterior masonry and the contractor chose this mistakenly because it was actually sold to him as a paint and it is breathable and it is exterior and it is for masonry. But frankly our main concern was about the color of it. We never even checked to see if he was using an actual paint thanks. Sorry, it's more expensive yeah it is, and it's I rather 10 could be 10 times thicker than regular paint it can be, although this does not seem to be anywhere near that thick but thickness is measured in one thousandth, one thousandth of an inch so wow michelle I, have to look up like every other word. All right, revolve a question. May I just ask one very quick question: man go ahead. Yes, of course, just hypothetically. If this were disapproved tonight, you'd have to remove all this paint and then reapply, not if the book the board disapproves, if landmark, can still approve it at a public hearing understood. Thank you and Jay. You were going to say something: I was just going to comment on Mark saying you did not have the wisdom to to make the distinction, but we've done a lot of things without having with no wisdom at all. We make all kinds of decisions without having the wisdom anyway consistently. On that happy note, okay, so the resolution would be to approve the application that, as presented to us today, all right, so I'm going to take a vote Jay. Yes, I'm sorry Michelle! I'm sorry. Can we put something in the resolution saying sort of along the lines of what mark was saying that in general you know we do not. We do not encourage people to paint brick, but since it's already been painted. Yes, we could do that. Yeah, everybody's okay with that yeah. That would be part of our I'm, not okay with that, because it sort of encourages people to do it ahead of getting approval so good point. We did similar things for mark when he was a member of the committee anytime. Anybody proposed anything in Stucco Mark is an anti-static, oh yeah! That's why I asked rooftop fire application on rooftops yeah anyway, I'm still a yes, okay. Let me write that all right. Let me continue so Jay you're, a yes and Josh, I'm a yes! Thank you. You're welcome Susan, I'm a yes, and that means I've agreed with Jay on everything tonight, I'm deeply uncomfortable Peter you're, not alone right, yes, Doug, yes, Doug Mcgowan k, yes and I'm a yes, so that said, eight zero and Mr Diller Bye and our veep Doug K. Yes, thank you! So non committees, two zero. Okay and you are in front of landmarks when I think December 12th somewhere right around then 15th, 8th or 15th. It's December 8th, oh the 12th of Saturday, so yeah December and you know our full board meeting- is December 1st, so we'll present this resolution to them and then we'll see what that marks great hey. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot good night, oh God did we just screw up. Did Miss winfred want to speak on this? Oh I'm, so sorry, I did not think of it. I think she said she was just too much but you're just observing, but we should ask her. I'm sorry, no I just wanted to confirm the December 8th date for our public hearing meeting very good. Thank you, Javadi Ms Winfred. Did you want to be heard on in on this or no I'm all good? Thank you for including me very good, pleasure till now. All right come again good night. All right! Everybody are you turning. Thank you so much. Thank you! Good job. Okay, see you all soon good night, bye-bye.
