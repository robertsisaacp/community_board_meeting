And it's good thing, that there was some questions that the community board raised at some of these listening sessions with the community, where you're able to speak to higher ranking members in the police, department.
Give you just a quick overview of kind of what the NYPD transportation bureau does in regards to traffic safety, and then we can maybe hear some more of your questions and concerns.
Would, the let's say the 20th precinct know what is happening in the 24th precinct because, as we know, certain streets, certain avenues throughout the entire city and they're in every borough.
We know how many school children and it's it was true before the current pandemic situation, and it's of course very true right now, so I did want to at least let you guys know that your voices were heard.
Can you tell us our officers dispersed on the basis of need, or is there a predetermined amount that each precinct gets sure, so each precinct will have a traffic safety team and on average the team usually consists of four to five officers and they are deployed at kind of on a data driven approach to where they're needed most and, of course, the sector officers as you're familiar with the response.
You know, I think we both agree that, as a patrol officer who handles the 911 calls sure you could be focusing on a traffic condition and then be called away to a missing person, a domestic situation or any combination of other 911 calls which will take you away from that traffic.
I think you just answered my first half of the question, but just to be sure so officers who are not traffic safety officers can still make traffic safety stops like if they see something while they're on patrol.
Miss lind, because we do have approximately 3,000 traffic agents throughout the city, and these are the light blue shirts that you see and they mostly address parking violations which, as we know, can contribute very heavily to traffic safety, be it blocking a bike lane double parking, someone in a crosswalk parking on a sidewalk, so that is a whole nother aspect of traffic safety.
If a pedestrian like you mentioned, is hit at 40 miles per hour, which would be over the speed limit on the street.
So I certainly do not want to take credit for those, but even though that there's more and more speed cameras in each neighborhood, especially by schools, we still continue to focus on speed enforcement, maybe not just where that speed camera is set.
Like: motorbikes, okay, blaring down the street, going through red lights.
We do take motorcycle enforcement very serious and there are certain times where you're right, where a vehicle may be speeding so fast that we do not engage in a pursuit at that particular moment, because it may further endanger that person, who's, speeding and now other community members like that person may be going.
Enforcement takes a little extra time to kind of set up legally to observe the vehicle and issue the violation.
A lot of that speed enforcement is handled by our traffic safety officers in the precinct.
I'm going to begin with letting you know that there's been 43 motorcyclists this year that have lost their lives.
I'm glad you brought that up about the bicycles, because each time that I'm fortunate enough to attend these type of community meetings, many people raise the issue about the danger of delivery.
And I just checked the data in Manhattan north and this year, 84 of pedestrians that have been injured in collisions were injured by motor vehicles, trucks, suvs, cars, etc and 16, and not to say that 16 is nothing have been injured by bicyclists of the six people that we've unfortunately lost in northern Manhattan to traffic deaths.
Now we're going off traffic safety, but the only time we take someone's car and not give it back would be like a drinking and driving situation.
My understanding has always been that when you're operating a bicycle, you're subject to the normal traffic rules, you have to go the correct way on a one-way street, stop for red lights, yield to pedestrians, etc.
Just for some context, we've had many discussions at this committee and on our board on bicycle, related issues, bicycle lanes and enforcement and operation in the parks, etc, and we've actually from time to time, had cyclists, who very candidly have told us that you know if an intersection is clear, they do not see any reason to stop and wait for a red light to turn green or stop at a stop, sign, etc.
I'm sure the Narcotics unit has their things, but from a transportation aspect we will continue to serve with every resource that we have, even if it's a slightly less amount of resources, and we will be more fiscally responsible than ever, not that we were not in the past to make sure that we stretch our resources and stretch that budget to every community across the city number two, the e-bike legislation.
Having to do with West End Avenue, open street, but I'd really like to ask you this question in case.
Are these shared streets open streets where it is for pedestrians to exercise more space in their community and vehicles are allowed to locally access, it.
I just wanted to bring up one use case that I think is specifically unique, particularly with Covid-19 and the outdoor seating, and that is delivery.
I think is a challenge, and you know I understand that 85 percent of the people are our transportation and should do so.
But I do think it's a case that you know I just wanted to bring up that.
We have an open street for restaurants, and we are seeing cars coming through.
My main question is that I know that this is not something that the local precinct is going to be able to address.
I had posed the question of whether the the parking meter police could be engaged in this I do not know how that could happen, but I'd be very much interested in hearing whether you have any other alternatives.
Point well-made, speed enforcement is at the core of the Nypd's traffic safety program that and failed to yield to a bicyclist fail to yield to a pedestrian.
If you're working on educating your colleagues within NYPD on double parking and abusing placards and parking on sidewalks I, really think that people lose faith in the police when they act above the law, and it would go a long way if they were actually part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
All, yes and knows: Does the police department consider itself overwhelmed by traffic safety issues.
No, we're not overwhelmed, but more needs to be done, and you know I have a question about whether cam you talked about taking license plates and a gentleman before me talked about park cars not moving for street sweepers.
And I would just think the street sweepers should have a camera with them and take video as they're going a gopro just stuck on constantly taking videos.
If sanitation looked into that, it's very low, tech, very low tech and on an open street, a bicycle can't go the wrong way like on East on West 103Rd. I could get a ticket for going east 103Rd on a boy.
I've never seen a policeman probably issued to a bicyclist on an open street for going the wrong way.
It's where it's more of a park, more of an open space than a street which is subject to the vehicle and traffic laws, so.
Yes, okay, captain I'll be very quick right and my question is a two-part question: I'm, a block away from Amsterdam at 96th street and on a regular basis when the barriers go.
You, know they're pissed off, and the part two is that on that particular open street between 96 and 97, you have a holy name.
You know what I kind of look things from a city-wide level, all the boroughs.
They would then get out of their car again and then move the barrier back to the way they found it or a community member and not, you know.
Or we're going to have to move our agenda because everybody wants us to get to West End Avenue, yes, rich great.
It's, not necessarily, in my mind at least the best for traffic enforcement, because within two minutes someone can drive out of one precinct and into another, and also you know.
This meeting really appreciate your joining us definitely want to keep the dialogue open to see how we can play a role and coordinate our efforts, both with analysis and prioritization and with D.O.T for street design.
That, would be great one example, I mentioned when we spoke was we've had some issues and Andrew Alpert has been for years trying to get D.O.T to put up signs as cars drive into our neighborhood.
A lot of them are coming from, especially out of the neighborhood, but even out of state, and they might not know about the no right turn on red.
Having said that, as engaged as our community is, you are especially popular so do hope that you come back, had a really good conversation with you and just want to.
This is a matter of life and death and I want everybody to know that all your concerns are important, be it.
Something is I, do not want to say it simple, as someone not moving their car for a sweet, a street sweeper or to a speeding vehicle that could unfortunately rip a family apart by injuring a child or God forbid, even worse to a child which I won't even mention.
Item number two on our agenda: is expansion of the city's open storefronts program to allow retailers to use street space.
I do not know what more you need to do other than announce the program and unless there's comment or concern that the community has about this I agree.
Howard I think you already actually answered this, but I'm, most familiar with the stores in the Columbus avenue bid, as you know, and those merchants have merchandise which is so pricey that they're not going to bring it outside.
I. Just wanted to thank the Community board for all its work on the program to have restaurants and stores have store, have curbside and street uses.
I've been a member of this community for years and I am so excited to see our streets change from being private storage for p, public storage for people's private property, their cars into something that actually can benefit.
It really makes it feel, like a brand new city, and it's so magical to see so many people out and actually enjoying the streets.
If you're, going to start opening up more space for the stores and the restaurants, which is great, then you're going to have to balance it out and definitely reopen West End, Avenue and I.
I know that you guys are going to go back to Western, Avenue and I.
Are you going to balance that you know if you're going to open this all up, then you need the pedestrians to feel safe to walk and shop and eat.
This was one that actually fell through the cracks between the 24th, precinct, D.O.T and City Hall, and my office could be to blame completely because I was asked what streets I'd like to see be used as open streets, and this again was what in April, when they just started.
There we've asked the people who love the West End Avenue open street program if they would take responsibility for the barricade, because that's really at the heart of the issue, and so far we've not heard back about that which is too bad.
At the same time about a half a dozen people, or maybe 10 have emailed me saying: Please keep it open and not with cars, with no solution with no solution to addressing really the problem of taking minding.
You know cars going through the barricades, so I walk through that area.
If I could just add one of the community folks brought up the issue of congestion on Amsterdam earlier and even prior to the closure of west end Avenue from 87 to 96.
The open street and traffic was starting to build on other northbound avenues.
And I certainly understand the need for a community partner to move the barriers, but I'm thinking that as the cold weather is coming and folks are not going to Wanna.
I mean there are some streets between Columbus and Central Park West that are closed down by schools, and there is school staff there.
Motorists are still traveling through the streets and they're not seeing the pedestrians as they're crossing and one last thing we're going to try to put a barrier on 86th street on the northbound side, because that would let people decide before 87th whether to go east or West, to avoid it if they get to 87th street in West, bend they get into a choke and they have to proceed westbound on 87.
You know my position on this Western Avenue Street is pretty much the same as it was back in April in May that my concern is on safety and for emergency vehicles to have quick access to homes.
You know we're very lucky to be in New York, City now, and a lot of us would not have did not feel the same several months ago when it was the epicenter of the world of Covid-19 crisis and to echo Helen's point that it is crucial for us to have partners to control.
It is not really the case and if we can have partners, this can be something that's very successful, but it seems like it's very difficult to maintain at this point, and Helen has spoken to plenty of neighbors who love it, but it's very hard to find those who want to support it and be there and do the work and maintain it takes a lot of work to keep the community together.
So I think this Western Avenue, open streets should be retired at some point or at least have a game plan on when it should be retired if Covid-19 crisis and continues to increase again.
And, you know, for those who are interested in volunteering I would urge you to reach out again to Peter Arnstein from the Columbus avenue bid who, even in the chat, is saying that he's created his own signs and all the things he's tried to do to make it work.
I have not heard a person talk about the effect it has on the residents of West end avenue, of course, everybody's concerned with safety.
If closing down the streets and eliminating traffic was the primary concern throughout the city, we could just ban cars.
Call, it an open street, but it's really closed because ostensibly the pandemic, and the rationale was that people needed more space to maintain social distance from each other and to have additional space for recreation, because at the time there were limits on park.
Avenue Helen said that people have contacted her office to say how much they like this I contacted Helen's office to suggest that the time has come to close this and open it up to its normal operation.
The fact of the matter is that you know we live in a busy city and the traffic on west end, just like the traffic on all the other.
What's, going on now, I park, a car in a garage on 89th, street, I'm fortunate to be able to do that.
And I saw two cars waiting in the northbound lane on 90th street and westland Avenue for the light to change the light changed and not one of those vehicles made a right turn onto 90th.
There was never any reason to have an open street on West End, Avenue.
I think that when the parks closed and these opening open streets initiative, opened, I was happy with them.
I can tell you that Lucas and my son went over there many times in the middle of the day, because we were going to kill each other and threw the ball around and sat down, and there was people sitting in the streets and some I remember somebody in 80th and 89th used to bring a little pool out put his feet.
You did that I was happy that street opened, but I think things have changed.
I did not even know that these were issues as well, so I think the time would be.
I have concerns that people who have bigger issues have been advocating open streets for 10:15 20 years.
I, personally, love, open, streets, I'm, lucky enough to live on one on West, 103Rd Street, and it's just wonderful to be able to walk with more space, to be able to have more space from people who may or may not be wearing masks, and in general.
It was their first time in New, York city since February, and the open street was great because they're at an age where they just can't be exposed to Covid-19.
You understand that these open streets are not necessary and beyond the safety, issue.
You know, I first came to you guys a couple years ago to talk about the problem happening in the upper 90s with all this traffic and congestion.
If you look at 90 actually it's listed as on your birth, 96Th, Street and broadway, there are people trying heading Southbound or trying to make a right-hand tourney I have that one circle in the wrong place mark.
There should be like a no left turn onto Riverside off of the exit from the highway at 95th street people should not be allowed to get off the highway there and make a left to try to do that.
In the meantime, please, initially, you can open west end and alleviate real safety issues for us that are up above this barricade at 96th street.
You know the street western Avenue I.
We've heard a lot tonight that the current instance of West End Avenue, open streets is not working, but I think that you can see in the data that we've collected and.
People like the ability to have more space to seed, reduce traffic on West End Avenue, to have the opportunity to chat with neighbors in a safe way, and a lot of people like that.
If you go to the last slide, people are curious about what else could be happening on these streets, and you know with all due respect to the drivers this.
If it is done, well, I think could be a really wonderful opportunity for for safety, for safe socialization, for people to have community, and I'm also going to add, because I know.
We are proposing that perhaps the west end open streets be made weekend only in the winter.
We could reduce the length to address some of the concerns about people being able to get onto the highway, I'm in that 95th to 96th street stretch, and if we could go to the you know, there are just some basic things that we think could help improve.
You could have double barricades on both sides, because, right now, cars are using it as a slalom course, and on the weekend there is, you know, just less traffic.
And I think that the open street does help increase that sense of neighborhood.
You know that people are saying: oh, it's great in the summer, time.
You know I think winter time your apartment starts to feel small again.
And I think that a lot of the comments that we even saw in the survey and that I've heard tonight are talking about well I, do not see people using it.
You know we want to work with NYPD on this.
So I think it's great, that you know.
But if open streets is not going to continue.
So in the event that open streets does continue great and there will be some solution and I trust Jessica and you know, and members of the Comedian and Christina to move that forward and with our support.
So I'll- be brief on this, but construct, but rush hour traffic on West, End Avenue, either going to or coming from the highway results.
We're not going to get to unanimity, but I think we need some board resolution that gets approved so that we have some guidance of where things go, and you ask: What's the resolution we as a board at the very beginning of the crisis, call for more open, space.
And I think it would have more weight if we as a board, you know discuss especially those three things of you.
We want people to support the MTA and to come back and feel safe.
And they're talking, you know that particulate matter actually comes right back into your face, so I, just I just have not seen anybody doing it and the bus drivers who I've spoken to most of them.
That, you know, there's much more use of the street.
We moved on and I want to propose a resolution, just see what people think about it, but number one.
Our submission is that it would be easier if this is what the city desires for them to allow these cars to go park on 72nd street or use Riverside boulevard south, which sees almost no traffic and the west side of that street does not block any building.
Do, not know of how many other religious reasons people get I do not see this happening in front of any other religious community.
Edict show me the legal edict under which this is allowed to change the signage on the street and say double park at your will and make it open for everybody.
I'm, a new CitiBiker I've, never biked in the city streets before it's way too scary, but I also do not want to.
Last Wednesday I was biking out of the central park on 100Th Street and, as you know.
So, then you're, you know really tight in there with all the traffic and then going up to 106Th Street.
