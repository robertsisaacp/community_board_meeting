Hi, hey there good to see you Peter hi Richard, all right, I'm, going to press start the webinar, which will start letting attendees into the room.
Meanwhile Christian, Could you put the link to sign up yes sure and if anybody who's, not speaking, could mute, please so, okay, well, it's 6:31.
I think those who, Let me know about that.
Okay, America you're, going to record both the a bolt this way for each boat and use the form also right, absolutely because we won't know the results of the form until the end of the meeting.
And, then I'll count the rest of the votes, all in favor, okay, Marco, Christian.
You want to explain the voting sheet that Christian sent around.
Okay, sorry, yes, I, vote, I couldn't unmute there.
You, know I'm just going to go over some things that have been happening in the last month.
There's a link that Christian's going to drop into the chat right now, not to waste time.
You want to speak or have a question for either the 20th of the 24th precinct, You can raise your blue hand right now and we'll call on you until we can get the sign up sheet.
The second floor, the third floor that is invisible from the street, because once the person does manage to buzz into the building, they're relatively free to roam the hallways until they see something that looks to them like they want to steal.
One hundred percent, keep your per your belongings on you or in front of you, okay, just so much as having your jacket on the back of your seat as you lean forward, and you lean back, you don't realize that somebody just took your jacket with your wall and your cell phone, just like that.
I mean overall injuries and collisions are down, but you know, as things have started, to open up and people have started to travel again.
Well, okay, any other questions from either board colleagues or from the community for just for NYPD.
Right now, we'll have public comment later Christian dropped into the chat, the sign up sheet for public comment, so you can sign up now for any of the other items that are going to be following.
So, that's very helpful, but I think we'll move on with our agenda unless there are other questions for the precincts which I'm not seeing so with our thanks.
But I could I say, okay, that in effect, this new owner is trying to replicate the tax photo from 1940 and meet the lines and elements of the two other buildings that were also designed by the architect.
Okay, all right, I'm gonna, stop sharing any questions or comments before we take a vote not seeing any.
So I see, Madge has your hand up, Your, muted, bench, Yes, okay.
You, know four foot wall made out of granite so, and we considered this on another property on Columbus Avenue between 72nd and 73rd street, a few years ago, which also discovered that there was vault lights that were hidden by something and then and our board I think actually recommended that they not have to replace them.
And I would encourage the committee to reconsider that, Okay, I think Jay had his hand, that's the next one.
And I was one of the three committee members who dissented from the majority and in addition to what page said, while this is a small piece of the total architecture of the app Thorp, there's, not only a physical benefit, as Paige described having it, but it's also historical.
Got my pupils, dilated and there's no other area that has these vault lights and, in fact, If everybody can kind of picture between going west between the parking garage and the corner, West end.
I agree with Kaye that he, the architect loved the building and wanted to do the best for the building, but I, don't think it makes it personally.
I, don't think it makes a difference whether the vault lights are there or not, because nobody's going to see them.
Room, which is dangerous, I, see Barbara, Adler and I, see Paige as her hand up again in general, I'm, going to discourage us from having multiple times to speak, Although we are doing okay with time so perhaps a little bit, here.
To say that in the future that boiler may disappear and the natural light is going to be better again, So I, don't think it's our generation that should dictate removal of things which are pretty much intact.
I didn't know it was cement until I looked at it more carefully, It's, not granite, but they're going to resurface it and color it the same color as the granite wall and add the plaque for a dog, and this was it your grandma that used to yes, there.
And, then I'll start, So I'm a yes, let's see any other yeses in physical hands, I'm, not sure if you can hear but looks like that's it.
I think we should do that, but it's not quite as straightforward as that, because the resolution and I think nobody disagreed with this, or at least wasn't what we were explicitly voting on spoke favorably about the bench I think recorded the fact that they said they would keep the bench.
So I think the resolution needs to be rewritten to be in praise about the bench and disapproval about the removing of the glass.
Chris you're, saying that if for the next vote for this particular vote, number three for the app store, we're going to be voting at number, eight, yes, correct Christian, maybe I'm looking at the wrong form.
Say, if all right: okay, just a quick question: How does this new resolution get recorded in this.
Is it one of the new resolutions that Christian says number okay, so those of us who supported would vote no on three and yes on eight.
Oh golly, okay, I, don't think I got it, but, Okay, Richard, I'm voting, early, oh and often great.
So, those in favor of the new resolution, which is to disapprove the application to remove the vault lights.
Clary I, Don't think you mean to vote against this.
You know it's a okay paint to use, but it's not one that the that was approved on staff or could have been approved on staff level at LPC.
If that's the fastest way through to a phrase, the resolution in terms of approval legalizing legalized code with that, Thank you Larry sure we can make that alteration.
And I think the reason why the landmarks is asked CB7 to weigh in on it, even though it's a highly technical issue, it's just the wrong thing to do, and the other problem is when it starts to peel.
So I think we should take a much stronger stance and put the technology in the hands of the commission and ask that the paint be removed and the work done properly is originally specified.
I have to thank the La. The landmark submission via rich Robbins, help seconding what Paige said because I was going to second.
We, it was discussed and assurances were given on the durability and breathability of this particular paint, And what we're hearing tonight is I, don't want to use the term diametrically opposed but inconsistent with the information that formed the basis of our decision.
This was the building owner's choice and as long as it subscribes to the basic parameters of the aesthetics of landmarks, I think we should vote for it.
It, might have been a contractor or contractor off the books or something else, but I, don't think it's also right for the community board to be put into this situation where we have to determine this highly technical, thing.
Because people have already spoken, I, think you know it's getting to be 7:45.
But I can't tell the difference between when we are speaking about preservations issues or if someone is sharing their personal preference on what they think.
I, don't think so, whether the contractor got it off the back of a truck I, don't know, but I think that the hook here is that there are certain means and methods that the landmarks have worked very hard to help in various brownstone manuals sign manuals, all sorts of things to help the applicant.
We can say that the community board 7 questions the appropriateness, but leaves it to the commission to determine that something like that.
So, as I understand it, The resolution is to approve the appearance of the paint on the wall, but to defer to the LPC, to note that the LPC has included this specific kind of paint as one that is not approved for this kind of use and to defer to them on to whether the appropriateness of the actual choice of paint is appropriate in this setting.
Let's continue with the vote all right, so anybody abstaining on this, I'm, sorry, very good.
I'm, sorry I think well hands down, because we've gotten the no votes.
Now we're going to take abstention, votes, If I change, to an abstain from a yes, that's.
Okay, Jeanette, yes, sorry as soon as I went to hit on mute, like an email came and it opened up a website.
Fisher voting looks like I got.
We, had a board talk around those concerns and we came out with a resolution, specifically speaking, to a couple things that matter.
I'm not going to go through the whole resolution, because I think it would take some time, but I'll do some highlights.
I first want to start out by thanking Catherine who wrote this, And I'd say the word lovely resolution.
I'll quote a couple of lines: here: the New, York City has not presented or executed a plan for meeting the education or and comprehensive needs of all students remotely including students in district 78 district 79 schools, which are very unique for people that may or may not.
I'm gonna run through and highlight and speak to the last one then open it up for question, specifically we're asking for the mayor, the Department of Education Department of Health and mental hygiene, health and human services to develop a robust and evidence-based approach to school bus.
It asks for the video he should survey administrators, teachers, staff, students, families, guardians they should continue to consult with superintendents and the Cec. We think it's very limited in terms of how they're making these decisions a handful of other things that are asked for as a DOE to develop and a target education plan for New York city.
Constituents, again ask for more people in the room, but it said it should consider how test positivity rates are determined for what geographic areas as well as whether or not schools should be closed for the population and level.
It talks about a handful of other organizations such as the who, which has different metrics, that they're giving guidelines to, but they wanted to make it appropriate for New, York City and, according to the standards of fairness and I, think a really nice line to end it with is that children and you should not bear disappropriate burden to New York City's effort to reduce Covid-19 transmissions and outbreaks or suffer unnecessary consequences for New York City's response to the pandemic.
A lot of what you were proposing is still should go forward, because, even though they have come with a new plan and which probably aligns with a lot of what you were asking for, I'm sure they know they're not still involving enough people on it.
What you're alluding to Christian is that the elementary schools will be opening up middle and high schools are still not, and there was some conversations, but by some of our committee members to ask me to put some friendly amendments to address that I think we agreed to that.
That I would only suggest that in order to have I, think I really respect this, but it would be helpful to focus target and make some of the points that you want to see continue in the future.
There was a friendly amendment between the committee members and we're going to add it, but I did want to mention one thing: Ethel.
As of now there's a difference between what is the criteria and then what people are talking about and as of today, even though you may have read, there's data coming out in the New York Times.
They just opened the schools and it causes parents to continue a parent like myself and others that you don't know what the metrics are.
And I know that they're saying things, but there is no formal presentation of the criterion explained and that's what I'm saying I see more hands: up.
Families are not consulted, Students are not consulted and knowing from my niece who's a nurse whose assignment is a good part of New York City, to advise as a nurse to advise the school districts and schools.
Do remember, mark that we have somebody in the community, so I haven't forgotten: that, Catherine, Captain, So far, It's so helpful to get comments both on the issues and also on the resolution.
Schools, don't know where they are and with this level of disruption, New York City is going to lose some students that are in the system that just aren't going to come.
So I just want to emphasize that the process does need to be improved not only and both in terms of taking into account recent research by public health experts, but also taking into account the rights of students and families, and there are a lot of options for improvement, and this is going to continue for the next year, because this one instance could be resolved and.
I. Think in light of today's announcements, Does it make sense to offer a friendly member of the resolution recognizing the lower grade reopening for some and the movement away from a blanket three percent rule as positive first steps.
My question is more of whether we would consider I, don't know if it's a friendly amendment, but for those of you who have been reading about this issue in the news over the last weeks, this has really been a movement that started with parents and a group of parents.
So, for example, If you have a kid, a school classroom with four kids in a classroom, now you might be able to go to that 12 and have those just those remote seating, six foot with masks and all the other stuff which is a bit different, but from many schools, particularly in our community board, where there has been a fair number of students who have signed up for the full-time or part-time in school, whatever part-time they've got is what is gonna stay.
I think those last two points were very in sync in the sense of, but you know, I, don't think the papers are an accurate assessment as well, and let's keep moving okay.
Other main factor that we're not discussing here is that the teachers union has massive control of the situation, I'm, not sure of it, but I think that the three percent guideline was what it took to get the teachers union to agree to open the schools at all.
I. Think Ken's point was one that I was going to make as well, which is we've got to balance the call that we want for them to make robust evidence-based decisions with getting viewpoints of a lot of different groups, and those two often can be at odds, and it might be a case where the more people you have involved, the more of a cluster f.
I think your point about De Blasio, you know not having to pandemic.
Maybe I know that mark is really wants me to keep moving.
Those are really great points in this case like there is a lot of debate about whether there should be mayoral control of schools and whether the mayor should be able to make decisions on his own we're, not questioning that we're not getting into who's involved in the ultimate decision.
Then the mandate changes a few days later, and parents may have no idea what's going on, and so you have to involve people in order to have a functional process and the process does need to improve like it didn't work this time.
We don't have evidence that it's going to be okay next time and the priority of this resolution is to advocate for the process to be better in every way.
Someone want to call the question because I know I think we're ready to call the question.
Let me see any other physical hands, abstaining, Christian and mark.
So yes, If you could pull up the resolution, This is written in response to a recent Fbi report on hate crimes, and the facts are crucial and so I'd like there to be kind of a visual representation of what I'm sharing.
It further resolved that community board 7 calls on the mayor to include more robust, anti-hate crime and community resilience, which is art curriculum, which is already committed to appropriate for in-person and remote learning in New, York, City schools, and we also call on the Manhattan district attorney's hate crime unit to provide more education, outreach to schools, community groups and religious organizations on strategies for reporting and identifying hate crimes to law enforcement, as well as information on available resources and supports which they already do.
7 Manhattan also calls on New York City to provide the Manhattan borough president's office with resources needed to continue to build on their effective diversity, equity and inclusion.
The Manhattan borough president's office also provides board members with diversity and equity and inclusion training in collaboration with the New York City Commission on human rights.
As we've discussed a lot as a board with additional resources, They could provide even more support for our board and for other community boards to address issues specific to our boards and districts and more guidance for us to develop diversity, equity, inclusion, task force and committees, so that boards, including community board 7, can take more proactive stances and also develop strategies to address individual and community bias that biases that lead to discrimination and hate crimes.
The assumption in that resolve is that we all have responsibilities here and we appreciate the work of the Manhattan borough president's office and would like to see even more of that via further resolve that community board.
And I want to hand it over to Shelly and then hear any questions and comments.
You know, hate crime- is something that's very terrible and anything that we can do to help educate people on diversity.
Believe, not in the language of protected groups, according to New York City Human rights law, but that doesn't mean that we can't include that in the resolution.
You, know I think we could say something to the effect of that.
I. Think we can incorporate that into in what we condemn and also what we're asking to educate people.
Then I'm gonna move us along if I can, I, just the, whereas portions of the resolution all addressed hate crime, which you know which we all would decry and the first part of the resolve, addresses ways to reduce hate crimes which is really important.
Okay, Our health and Human Services committee meeting for this month will take place, This Thursday, the third at seven pm, we're going to meet, to discuss ways to respond to child abuse and support the mental health and safety of children.
Unless anybody has a, as has an issue or a question, so we will mark this on the number nine on the voting.
I, think that's everybody, but let's lower hands.
I have a chairs report that I would like to make, but I'm going to call on Gail, Brewer and Mark Levine first.
I've been in touch with people in this Westchester we've been in touch with people who are complaining, The 311 calls are way we're going to try to put together a discussion in December with New York people and then early in 2021, with the New Jersey people and obviously, If there are folks on board seven who want to be involved, Gonna have the Faas actually agree to participate in quotes, meaning they'll, listen and obviously Eastern Helicopter Association, some of the companies and so on, and elected officials, I have to say Congresswoman Saf has always been very supportive.
It is an endless challenge, but we are going to keep trying I want to thank Julie, Vettila Martin who's, a West Sider who just got something to say.
I think you know only too well in terms of education in the general sense.
Scott Riverside who got killed in this said people come because they work.
I think you know only too well.
It's a board member I, don't know who it is, and many of the men at the Lucerne are now working at forgotten Riverside in their green keepers, program, so to lose all that not good.
My opinion, in many ways, I want to mention, of course, there's something that Ethel and I worked on recently, and only that push got me to look at the research.
Thank, you for president we'll go quickly to mark Levine, Thank, you, Mr chairman, and thank you Borah president, for that outstanding, update, I'm, going to be brief and just focus on a single topic which is Covid-19 specifically the coming vaccination program for New York City, which I'm sure.
There are over 1200 Covid-19 patients in New, York, City, hospitals, that's the highest number, since early June, Thanksgiving surge, probably won't feel that until next week, So this is real and in fact the health department today made an important change in its guidance for the public they're.
Let's make sure we build equity into this plan, something I'm working hard on with colleagues on the council and again, which will be focusing on in the hearing on Friday, which I welcome any of you to participate in thanks for having me.
But I'll circle back to my colleague, councilman Rosenthal, on this and to the health committee staff to find out about this resolution, but in the meantime, just want to make sure you understand.
Although we're probably going to follow most of it, I, think in practice, The government will have to make decisions about broader public vaccination, which will be a later phase, but I do expect that most employers will require this, just as you know, you're required to get your measles vaccination.
I, don't know how this distinguishing between those who are working remotely exclusively and those who are in person, but certainly the guidelines that are coming out of the CDC do include teachers as essential workers.
So much councilmember, Thank you for president we'll hear from representatives of other elected officials as part of the public session, but I'm going to pivot to the chairs report, Now a couple of quick things.
What it means, though, is that we need all of our committees to submit their materials, especially resolutions for the next full board or any kind of agenda items for the coming meetings further in advance than we have already been asking you for.
Who I think wants to address his view or his committee's view on this.
My decision to do this in the way that I have outlined I think is in the best interest of the board, but I deeply respect the amount of time and effort that has been put into an opposing point of view and.
Sorry in your hand, go ahead and second, that I will set up a website for flattering mark later, but right, now, I'm, going to call on Senator Hoyleman and try to stall for a little bit of time.
People like tony Fauci, but today, I announced a package of bills that I have introduced with a number of colleagues, including assembly, member O'donnell and Assemblymember Gottfried around the issue of pre-exposure prophylaxis, we're going to try to make prep universal, universally accessible to New Yorkers, particularly New Yorkers, who are in communities of color, who have suffered disproportionately currently under the Aids HIV crisis.
And, I, think they're still taking participants, but I'm hopeful that the results over the last couple of weeks, showing that these vaccines have over 90 percent efficacy rate are going to hold, and that will be out of this mess sooner rather than later, particularly with a new federal administration.
Christian I, don't see, I, don't think I have the list of people who've signed.
I think you have, that is, that correct, you're still, muted there Christian Nicole painter, signed up by the way.
I've been working on advocating for a resolution through the New York City Council, So I wanted to just bring your attention to that.
It's really hard for us to know right now that if schools are teaching nutrition education, either in person or remote learning, so I'm urging for this community and all communities with schools to urge their council members to support a bill that would have schools report to the Department of education, What they're teaching in terms of nutrition, education, the frequency, because it's needed so that we can prevent from our children having obesity or diabetes, so.
Sorry hang on one more second Christian, because I think Bob Robert SBA has got a question, maybe for.
Sorry christian hold on a proposal about with respect to the 1326 bill and the one the students presented that we proposed to the speaker of the city council that we, what the term we use is bundled, but put them together for an omnibus nutrition, bill, That I think would make it more attractive.
K is with us, I'm, not sure if she wants to speak, but I'll give her the chance probably need to unmute okay.
And I know you don't like the attention, so I'm just going to say thank you for what you've done.
