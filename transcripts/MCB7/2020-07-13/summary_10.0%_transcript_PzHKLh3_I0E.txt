Members, yeah, Susan, IRA, the leader, I, do not think we'll leaders on housing, anymore harvest, going on twice: Coming to all the meetings And there's trees at the Foot Board mark.
Is that mark make sure that the full board meeting that there was affordable housing going up on 79th, Street and I asked him where okay conversion, it's building on 79th Street?
I guess, starting, come September I feel like it's kind of a new community board year and I.
We want to embed into both of those discussions a lot of thoughts about weaving NYCHA and the needs of residents into our work.
This year, with so little city money likely available next year and to sort of really think through what should float to the top of our list.
Sorry 's, where a law project also suggested, like rental assistance or eviction prevention funding for people who are in rental housing in our district judge Are. They like big asks that are sort of like larger policy issues, or are they more concrete things that are actually in our district that we think we could maybe get as opposed to being more of a coalition of voices?
Okay, I just want to talk Terkel, okay, because I looked at that list that Cindy sent around and everything that was the five of them for housing and that included the playground in the Senior Center of Frederick Douglass.
I made a comment of what I would like to add with respect to another sector, the Mitchell- Lama, which I know a lot about, but it's I'd like to stay on the night, Racine yeah, let's hold on for a second I I.
Statements are a little bit of a procedure that city agencies and Ownby have to go through, but the easiest thing is when a community board gives a big rambling discussion, and the agency's response can be okay.
I'd, be curious, II, hear from the Nitra presidents here, but I know, for instance, and the ones and Queens they constantly talk about the surroundings and no longer having tweeny centers and the playgrounds being run down and sashed.
The Housing Committee should ask should send a recommendation to park any that particular playground is our number one priority and that we'd like parks to consider that, because I think they're always upset that Outsiders coming in suggest.
The mayor has allocated 150 million dollars right for broadband expansion within nature developments throughout New, York, City.
Do feel that part of that statement should include a statement that money should be allocated to the nature development C on the Upper West Side, to improve conditions as clause capital, because well as the former chair of the Housing Committee, we always spoke about repairs all the time we always focus at cetera, but whatever happens downtown with the agencies.
A second sure- And. Some of this is to be followed up Don for sure, but the collegiate money was, as I understand, it- to build or preserve, meaning to retain affordable housing that would otherwise become market rate.
Okay I do not want to invalidate this discussion because it is very important, but it is also a bit apart from what our goal is here: tonight, which is to nail down our budget priorities and I to the second piece of our agenda tonight, I'm, very open to making this a whole meeting like in September Sorry Much more first in this than I.
She won't come and help her neighbor Nothing is personal, so you need to make sure please there is a board here that works include us.
We will do our best to include you hurt Let's not bring any personal animus, I want to reinforce what Melissa said , there's a lot of good work that needs to get done, and so.
We've had floods in them, we've had floors, collapse, ceilings collapse in our community rooms, and we have been working with our elected official and the heads at night Chuck to get our rooms renovated and without asking anyone for a penny just again to I guess to clarify in the district You know, we do not have any money to allocate ourselves.
It's just how we basically tell the city agencies what we think they need to prioritize in our district Also, they can be used as a tool to push elected officials occasionally to also help fund things without what, With, whatever discretionary funding, they have parry be funny with the funds when they get designated to playgrounds.
You know that needs to be addressed with capital, funds, okay, to put and secure entry doors to the building's.
My understanding is that people forget their keys or their letting somebody in who does not have a key You know they're forcing the door open after it's been fixed, so it might be nice to take a new approach to this and not just be Oh. It's a security, issue.
So like front entrance coverage, we could say something, You, know, I agree that everybody's there to help people One second I just want to hear from anyone on the call who wants to speak to any buildings in particular that have elevators or constantly broken, and if we could get an address and we could include it as a capital item.
I mean that's a bad elevator design issue I think, and we should know that one of the trends in private housing is what we call virtual.
You know we see as important projects in our community The meeting I want to actually discuss the funding.
Let's talk about it in September, okay, And I wanted to speak on that Sharon Austin wrote, she's a Douglas House resident.
I would like to see money allocated for some kind of program, especially for the youth, all right to be engaged, whereupon this way they can clean their own buildings after they've, gotten training, of course, but I do feel that that's a direction that we should go in I like that, any other thoughts on what it means as the president of the brownstones and because we have to walk up.
That's my two cents, but if other committee members feel differently, so what we're looking for right now is somewhat long term projects to put into the hopper the Our two district needs budget priority options.
You know smaller capital projects in our community district that maybe we could get funding to, but it's a valid point.
I do not know that we can put it the DNS, but it might be something you little and that not only do you need to help the people that might be evicted.
Maybe there's some room for collaboration with you know our Health and Human Services, Committee and but The tenant leaders, said, look at the social services being provided on site And Oh, open it before again, one last time and say any other housing, items, Nitra or otherwise, that anyone in attendance, committee, Non, committee, attendees, public ta presidents, wants us to consider, including please speak up.
Any public support, so movies has a lot of programs that they're, initiating and other people have Okay, that's something that can be put into the DNS statement, because it's important you know again because of the cold vid, but prides of codes that we still have problems with garbage and rats, etc.
So, that's a long- term project If you had money, you know That's to be an item that you we should work on.
