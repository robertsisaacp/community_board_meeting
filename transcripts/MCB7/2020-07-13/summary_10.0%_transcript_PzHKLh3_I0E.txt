Is that mark make sure that the full board meeting that there was affordable housing going up on 79th, Street and I asked him where okay conversion, it's building on 79th Street,?
So I, don't know the agenda, never got posted I We wanted to look at the DNS and budget priorities one and then to talk about what we want to be doing in our committee.
We want to embed into both of those discussions a lot of thoughts about weaving NYCHA and the needs of residents into our work.
You know just based on our committee to me it would seem the needs of NYCHA, both capital and operating in our district would be a major priority and I sorry I'm just reading a message from Larry wood from that's, where a law project also suggested, like rental assistance or eviction prevention funding for people who are in rental housing in our district judge, agree.
They like big asks that are sort of like larger policy issues, or are they more concrete things that are actually in our district that we think we could maybe get as opposed to being more of a coalition of voices?
Just first want us to sort of establish what our scope is right now of like what we're looking to drill down on If, we just like all start speaking without knowing what we're working towards and just again to assert my initial question.
And I think if our community board is going to put it its money where its mouth isn't saying that we're looking at a fair, equitable approach to improving our public environment.
Procedurally, the Housing Committee, should ask, should send a recommendation to park any that particular playground is our number one priority and that we'd like parks to consider that, because I think they're always upset that Outsiders coming in suggest.
Do feel that part of that statement should include a statement that money should be allocated to the nature development C on the Upper West Side, to improve conditions as clause capital, because well as the former chair of the Housing Committee, we always spoke about repairs all the time we always focus at cetera, but whatever happens downtown with the agencies.
Okay, I don't want to invalidate this discussion because it is very important, but it is also a bit apart from what our goal is here: tonight, which is to nail down our budget priorities and I to the second piece of our agenda, tonight: I'm, very open to making this a whole meeting like in September Sorry Much more first in this than I.
Is that if you guys can have an open policy for the tennis to sit down with you when you are making these type of decisions, because most of us are hands-on all day long and it's only right if people are making decisions for our developments, we need to be there.
Please, let's not bring any personal, animus , no I want to reinforce what Melissa said , there's a lot of good work that needs to get done, and so.
You've had a housing night of task force for years now, and you don't even have the database where you know every single president.- So, you need to work together with us.
We've had floods in them, we've had floors, collapse, ceilings collapse in our community rooms, and we have been working with our elected official and the heads at night Chuck to get our rooms renovated and without asking anyone for a penny just again to I guess to clarify in the district You know, we don't have any money to allocate ourselves.
It's just how we basically tell the city agencies what we think they need to prioritize in our district Also, they can be used as a tool to push elected officials occasionally to also help fund things without what, With, whatever discretionary funding, they have parry be funny with the funds when they get designated to playgrounds.
If you had to name some capital, neat, I, guess I, don't know with packed going on It's harder to think through like how to add something to our budget.
You know that needs to be addressed with capital funds, okay, to put and secure entry doors to the building.
You know the right thing might be more to have like a doorman service there of these buildings, rather than some security cameras and punitive way.
My understanding is that people forget their keys or their letting somebody in who doesn't have a key You know they're forcing the door open after it's been fixed, so it might be nice to take a new approach to this and not just be Oh. It's a security, issue.
You know I, agree that everybody's there to help people One second I just want to hear from anyone on the call who wants to speak to any buildings in particular that have elevators or constantly broken, and if we could get an address and we could include it as a capital item.
You know we see as important projects in our community The meeting I want to actually discuss the funding.
I know we mentioned early, especially Cynthia with the brownstones I do not have elevators, they have stairs where there isn't any cleaning going on, so money does need to be allocated so hire individuals.
I would like to see money allocated for some kind of program, especially for the youth all right to be engaged, whereupon this way they can clean their own buildings after they've, gotten training, of course.
That's my two cents, but if other committee members feel differently, so what we're looking for right now is somewhat long term projects to put into the hopper the Our two district needs budget priority options.
Preventing evictions prevents poverty, so I think if you know that might be something we want to look at I, don't know that we can put it the DNS, but it might be something you little and that not only do you need to help the people that might be evicted.
Run right and The tenant leaders, said, look at the social services being provided on site And Oh, open it before again, one last time and say any other housing, items, Nitra or otherwise that anyone in attendance, committee, non-committee, attendees, public ta presidents wants us to consider, including please speak.
So, that's a long-term project and You had money, you know, and if it's not as costly as one would think, that's to be an item that you we should work on.
