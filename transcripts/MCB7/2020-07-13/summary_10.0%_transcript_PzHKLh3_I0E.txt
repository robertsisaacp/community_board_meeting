So I, don't know the agenda, never got posted I We wanted to look at the DNS and budget priorities one and then to talk about what we want to be doing in our committee meetings, especially well I feel like it's kind of a new community board year So I think, let's start with the DNS and budget priorities, and we can look at we did last year, but I think you know for context.
And, you know just based on our committee to me it would seem the needs of NYCHA, both capital and operating in our district would be a major priority and I sorry I'm just reading a message from Larry wood from that's, where a law project also suggested, like rental assistance or eviction prevention funding for people who are in rental housing in our district judge, agree Are. They like big, asks that are sort of like larger policy issues, or are they more concrete things that are actually in our district that we think we could maybe get as opposed to being more of a coalition of voices?
Item I'd be curious, II hear from the Nitra presidents here, but I know, for instance, and the ones and Queens they constantly talk about the surroundings and no longer having tweeny centers and the playgrounds being run down and sashed and I think if our community board is going to put it its money where its mouth isn't saying that we're looking at a fair, equitable approach to improving our public environment, That back playground should be number one on our list, but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a housing item.
Part of it goes up and is read by the community and is a guiding principle for us in our actions throughout the year, So I think we have to focus on both of those Any other kind of overarching thoughts before I would like to drill down on like the nature budget priorities, I read it the playgrounds need to be restored or rebuild, or whatever the wording you want to use and I.
I think that's most important, Okay I like to add something to the conversation Basically, the mayor has allocated 150 million dollars right for broadband expansion within nature developments throughout New, York, City, That HPD is holding okay and I.
Okay I don't want to invalidate this discussion because it is very important, but it is also a bit apart from what our goal is here tonight, which is to nail down our budget priorities and I to the second piece of our agenda: tonight: I'm, very open to making this a whole meeting like in September I cut you off okay, Roberta's much more first in this than I Think any of the rest of us, but I, remember having a conversation with any number of people before I had any involvement with a hundred a screen and that and not any involved coming after 108th Street.
We've already had money allocated to having our community rooms we've had floods in them, we've had floors, collapse, ceilings collapse in our community rooms, and we have been working with our elected official and the heads at night Chuck to get our rooms renovated and without asking anyone for a penny just again to I guess to clarify in the district You know, we don't have any money to allocate ourselves It's, just how we basically tell the city agencies what we think they need to prioritize in our district and also they can be used as a tool to push elected officials occasionally to also help fund things without what, with whatever discretionary funding, they have parry be funny with the funds when they get designated to playgrounds.
We very helpful bb7 wrote a letter to Helen asking her What's going to happen to the previous money that was allocated for playgrounds, which now is at a stalemate, because they're going through the pat prob progress and money from HUD is being allocated for new playgrounds, I'm happy to do that-- or at least maybe even just speak to Helen about it without a letter and then decide if that's the best way to get a response from nature If you had to name some capital, neat, I, guess I, don't know with packed going on it's harder to think through like how to add something to our budget priorities.
I just want to interject, because the West Surrey building site, a B and C also are in need of new front entrances as well all of the night again sites here on the Upper West Side need capital renovation of their front entrances and security, What service site, a B and C We need to it's a quick question Melissa if I may so we're not looking to for capital to install or repair cameras, They get access, but the management is not reviewing it and then.
So it leaves it leaves us - and you're, taking away money that we can use for something else like I , don't know if having more security staff would address the camera problem, we could definitely think about putting in an expense for the personnel.
I agree that everybody's there to help people one second I just want to hear from anyone on the call who wants to speak to any buildings in particular that have elevators or constantly broken, and if we could get an address and we could include it as a capital item well, elevators are always being vandalized If you, if you keep the door open it automatically shuts down.
If I may and we're talking about Amsterdam Douglas Weiss, you know massive units and that 14 million dollars, if it belongs to my tree, belongs to my trousseau We could help I think extract that out of HPD I Let's again I want to table this until we're all more informed and I also want it to be an open debate over what the right thing to do is in terms of honoring a previous agreement and what you know we see as important projects in our community and That's beginning the meeting I want to actually discuss the funding and I wanted to speak on that Sharon Austin wrote, she's a Douglas House resident It's.
You know I myself have taken money and other ta presences were out of our own pockets to keep the system up and running, need priorities or budget priorities in terms of kovat and safety and food security things get really bad again or continue to be bad if, since they are sort of still very bad on night campuses in terms of kovin, my opinion, as you definitely need to focus on sanitization and cleaning, that is an area That's always lacking, and that's very important.
You also have the landlords who are family by people not being able to pay their rent and I'm right Some for a second especially comes to the senior the Senior Center I think it was the biggest mistake, taking senior centers away from presidents and giving it to swish fish most of my own residence My senior that right here in a 68, they don't get It's, not the same for the people in Douglas when wish fish is on a hunt, sick, Street and She does her job I have nothing against I 'm the tenant leaders said, look at the social services being provided on site and Oh open it before again, one last time and say any other housing items, Nitra or otherwise that anyone in attendance committee, non-committee, attendees public ta presidents, wants us to consider, including please speak up, but I think that it would be very valuable if we could actually get something like that so program funding, or is it more like a DNS item?
