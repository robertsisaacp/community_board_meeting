Hi mark hey Lee, there's madeline, hey. How are you hey? You could not find me well. I was on the live stream page. We're live streaming by the way. So, oh, okay, I just want to make sure that everybody knows how are you doing? Okay, thanks yeah, you know it's same old, same old. I guess with this job about you. Are you, okay, yeah, I'm waiting for things to change. It's just the election is not coming soon enough. Yeah and I think we're putting a lot of a lot of stress on that election. You know, yeah I've been trying to I'm working. The polls and I've been trying to find out about the training and I can't get a hold of anyone. They can't find a building to do the training. So I said why do not you do zoom? You know. I know I noticed the board of election, but yeah it'll be interesting to see how they how they arranged that right or what did they do in in June? For the primary did they do training? It was bad. It was bad. I did not feel safe, health- wise the way they set it up was it in person yeah, wow yeah, and we were too close to them to the voters. We were too close to each other and at the end of the evening I'm usually chair at a table, and I and I tally up the votes. They turned off the air conditioner. It was so hot. I went to the coordinator. I said this is not safe. I said you could talk them if you want to, but I'm leaving and I'm frightened. You know because everybody was smiling around. What did they do about training, though? Did they do that in person too? Well, they did not do it for that one, but they would do it for the general. I got you. Okay, yeah hi, Louisa Aloisa, I'm you hi Mark hi Madeline, I'm Lisa. So there are a bunch of people signed up for this meeting tonight. I'm not sure if they're here for the agenda or if they have another thing they want to talk about, but just fyi there's. No. I was noticing that on the on the zoom page, that I click on, so you mean I can't fall asleep. Well, if you do, you have to turn your camera off yeah thank God for that. Yes, all right, I'm going to go, get some water before we start that's a good idea, so maybe just the three of us yeah. It's just well for us now: they're neighbors, hi, Susan, really, hey sylvan, hey guys and hello, Ira, hello, Ira, okay, I'm going to start us start. The webinar that'll allow the attendees to start joining us too, although you do not have a quorum just yet mark. I have a question sure but DNS. It says that we need the three top priorities, but looking over what we've done for housing before is we have a list of seven or eight different priorities, which are we supposed to do it's the top three for everybody, I'm sorry, it's the top three for the whole board, so you can list whatever you want and then the board picks the top three okay. So, tomorrow night, I think Cindy's going to lead us through a discussion about planning to have the top three in advance and then we'll do our usual process of budget priorities going down. You know 20 expense and 20 capital trying to get a head start on that, because when Cindy goes to put the DNS into the website that the Department of City planning requires of us, it asks for the top three overall priorities, as well as budget priorities that we discuss later on. Okay, let me see: okay, let's see we are recording good. Okay, we're live streaming, where's Melissa is here, we have a quorum, you have a quorum, you have two co- chairs, and so I will mute myself and say welcome to Community Ward 7 and thank you for all being good to see everyone after the summer. What summer I know I know so the agenda had two things on it. The first was about NYCHA and how we could sort of refocus our efforts as we, you know, look forward this year, so Louisa Madeline Mark and I had a just a quick conversation about what could be a useful and helpful way to really recognize and perhaps answer some of the needs of the NYCHA community in CB7, and we were all kind of inspired by you know what they had done at fulton houses in Chelsea, where they had formed a working group and though that was a slightly different situation, because that development was facing a series of, I think infills and new construction projects. We still thought it's a helpful model so, and we also wanted to discuss just how we can get other stakeholders beyond NYCHA residents interested in you know, moving this forward and advocating on the issue. So we kind of split up doing some initial outreach conversations to get more information. Oh- and I should add, this is all in the context of the blueprint that was released by NYCHA in I think August. This sort of re- envisions how like the corporate structure of NYCHA, could work and that they would form something similar to like the school construction authority that would manage the capital projects of NYCHA so actually mark. It would be helpful if you can tell us quickly. You were on the webinar that NYCHA intergovernmental affairs did correct. Was there anyone you learned about like implementation or community consultation? That should inform our work? I did not. Let me back up for one second, because I noticed that in the among the attendees or several Ta presidents. So I want to acknowledge and thank them for being with us and at the right point, Melissa and louisa. You can figure out. You know how you want to handle public comment and so forth and I'll be glad to facilitate the presentation. Webinar that I attended had a lot to do with the mechanics of it and how they see the implementation of their proposal, and they kind of acknowledge that there have been a lot of different proposals that have been made over the last several years and that this one seemed to have been. First of all, a lot less radical than some of the others and also seem to have involved or contemplate the involvement of more direct input from the actual residents who live in night shift facilities, both of which seemed like pretty good ideas to to go to go forward. I'm seeing a message in my okay: it looks like folks who are in the in the among the attendees would like to like an opportunity to comment so whenever you're ready to open that up, we'll, certainly we'll certainly make sure that we hear from everybody who wants to speak on this issue. Where are you seeing that? I'm not so I just. I just got a text from somebody who said that they would like to comment. So I'm sharing okay, if you guys could type it into the chat or the Q&A, because you know louise and I are co- chairing the meeting. So if you know you want to be promoted, please let one of us know and we'll make sure you have a chance to speak thanks. Sorry, Mark! I did not mean to cut you off, stop not at all, not at all. So[ Applause], the the thrust of the webinar, was a combin, a combination of trying to do things in with much more visibility and accountability than previous efforts have been. I think that a lot of folks have commented in previous of your readings how other NYCHA proposals dating back many years now were done Offline and then were sort of presented, as opposed to a request for input to design, and they are they're looking for. It seems like anyway, that they're looking for a more holistic approach that combines an opportunity for new jobs to be brought to the NYCHA community, along with energy efficiency and green building technology, along with the opportunity for having health services right there on campus and, of course, the whole point of this is to shift funding from section 9 funding, which seems to have been dwindling for years and years into section 8 funding which everyone seems to be confident, is harder to cut harder to harder to circumscribe and so forth. Those are my impressions of what oh and the other thing, though, that I will say is that one of the things I heard on that webinar and I'd be interested in other people's understandings. Of this, too, was in effect, the focus was so was to start with the unit that people live in and move outward from that in terms of trying to meet needs, especially capital needs and repair needs a couple of years ago, at a budget consultation, I understood, and I'm not sure, if I'm the only one, but I sort of heard NYCHA was talking about nigerian management. Now it's talking about trying to fix things from the top down from the outside, in so the roof and the walls, and then eventually they would get to you know, sinks and bathrooms, and kitchens and so forth and in terms of the residence experiences this seemed like it was trying to be responsive to to those kinds of concerns of what it really feels like to live in these in these buildings and to have needs not met for for some period of time. So I do not know if that's responsive to your question, but that's the best I can offer you in terms of my quick summary of what that Webinar was about. That's helpful. Thank you, okay, so I could just briefly speak to again what our discussion was back in August, which was sort of how do we pull together the right stakeholders and then also how does this blueprint fit into what our work should be, and I think we just wanted to have some initial touch point conversations madeline, louise and Mark. Do you have anything you want to report out about? You know whether people had interest in potentially participating in some future on what mark just said that the trip we took to Cambridge is the same principle and that's where Greg Ross was when they initiated their program. They took residents out and they took them all in the building. All the residents together. It's not one over here, one over there. They took busloads in other apartments and they fixed their apartments like Mark was saying they would fix the whatever the bathrooms and they had terraces, which was beautiful. Public housing have terraces and they did the work there, and then they brought the tenants back. It was not like misplaced in a building here in the building there or you staying in the building. They made sure everything was great for them in the transition that they were going through. So I think it's a good idea. How did they organize the tenants to be involved in this working group? They had a fantastic tenant association. I met them also, and they worked with the developers, not the developers, the contractors they do not call it niche. I forgot what they call their particular whatever yeah, so they all met. They had several meetings over at roberta. If I can remember they had like 25 meetings, they met with the Cambridge Housing Authority held meetings constantly with the tenants in including a building that was more seniors showers, instead of instead of bass because they felt it would be easier for the seniors to have showers and the seniors were against it. So they fit they fixed one apartment with a bathroom with a shower and then all of the residents took turns going into the bathroom to see the shower and they all voted unanimously that they wanted the shower, because they did not realize how much easier it would be for them. They also did that on in one of the other buildings about a different item where they wanted to have a little opening in one place and the residents were not sure they liked it, so they fixed up one apartment, but they met regularly with the tenants and and they voted on solar panels. They had paddled on a roof. It was really a great process that they went through and Gregory. Ross is well aware of the process. Okay, but are they applying it? I mean how did how did not yet? No, I did not think so. Not yet, maybe no, I know, but I meant for New York City. No. So if we think that this is a great idea- and I personally I'm not going to speak for anybody else, I personally think it's a good idea. Sorry, just to drill down on what you guys think is important to be implemented here. Was it the engagement process or was it the apartment renovation process? Was it the piece of like kind of having model apartments? People could look at all of it all of the about all of it. I think you start with the engagement process, because that's exactly where the design comes from right, I was going to ask. Did this is Jeanette? I was going to ask: did the engagement process involve a consultant or did they work directly with the housing authority? So people in the housing authority in Cambridge are some of the most incredible people. I've met, yes, they and get. They really did not need an outside consultant. They really had already established a close working relationship with the tenants. There was never you know and us versus them kind of kind of so they knew the tenants ahead of time. They had a good working relationship with them and they just developed an even stronger relationship, exactly yeah in New York, where you do not have that kind of relationship you might want an outside facilitator. Well and one of the things that the blueprint does seem and I'd be interested in other folks take on this, but it did seem like the blueprint was what was committing to or premised upon, having decisions being made at the local level at the as opposed to yeah, which sounds a lot like what you're describing with respect to cambridge as well. So I do not know if maybe they learned the lessons from the partners up north, but that, but that was that is a part of the blueprint, as I understand it and as they were presenting it. Yes and then sorry, I know I asked this already, but maybe I missed the answer. Was there anything said about like implementation process if it is going to be more community and locally driven like what would that look like? When would that happen? Anything like that was that provided because that would be like to me. That's the jumping off point for like where we could potentially be helpful and like meeting stakeholders Melissa. The concern is that if you do not move people very far away because then they're not near their family they're not near their resources, roberta I'm sorry, I'm not! I'm not trying to drill down on that right. Now, I'm just trying to ask about the engagement process and whether NYCHA has put forward an idea for how that would look. Or how could we better to answer that since he was on the webinar? That's yeah right. I was asking mark yeah and I do not have a note on that. I'll have to I'll have to loop back it'll, be interesting to know if any of the Ta presidents who were with us tonight, for example, have been approached by this or in connection with this or whether that's something that we can be useful in trying to make sure that happens at a local level, since they seem to be committing to or premising their initiatives on the local level who better than the than the folks right there in our district yeah, that's a great segue. I also just want to make a comment before we open the floor and I actually should have just started the meeting with this. Please, let's all speak to each other respectfully. I know we have very strong opinions, and this is housing is like a very tough issue to discuss, but please, let's try to be respectful to our peers and our fellow community members. So with that, I would love to hear from NYCHA tenant leaders, tenants whomever, especially if you have feedback on the process and whether you've been consulted- and I do not know if the two people who raised their hands already wanted to speak on this specifically but I'll I'll start with carmen and unmute you good evening, everybody, I hope everyone had a blessed weekend. I've been actually in contact with Greg West and about the blueprint. There are a couple of things that we're looking at the section. Eight that is being proposed would not be transferable. Like traditional section, eight vouchers, tenant participation vouchers will not have safeguard protections to ensure the rent state, affordable and protections from evictions. However, currently under Hud 964 we have guaranteed regulations and grievance protections. The section atpa vouchers are only attached to your apartment unit. If you decide to move away from the your Nitro apartment, the unit will no longer have the section atp voucher. You can not use these vouchers to move out of the state or to any other development. The section 8 vouchers are not transferrable. With these current proposals, there will no longer be public housing developments in New, York, City, Public housing will be privately owned and operated by private investors and banks. If the federal government under this new program does not fund these Tpv section eight vouchers at any time in the future, the residents will be responsible to pay the subsidies. Widespread evictions will occur. Acrosss the city under these new plans residents will be offering you kitchens a new bathroom and cosmetic reservations, like always, of course, but it will not address the major repairs that our infrastructure needs. If Congress does not fund Tpa vouchers program, we will you be able to pay. Your rent. Is the question right. We've been talking to Greg Russ for a while. A lot of this will be. We even talked about presidents. They wanted to do a away with a lot of the presidencies and again our board, which is Danny Barber and so we're working diligently. I like greg rusk, because one thing he does is he listens and we are working diligently to make sure that these things are implemented in this in this public trust fund. So, hopefully, a lot of the presidents are working to make sure that this does not happen. Remember public housing equals reasonable grant right. 30 of your income with federal protection with the NYCHA trust project based Tpv vouchers, NYCHA residents will know, will not have rent protections. These are things that we really need to look at. There's a lot of things that we really need to look at before we say yet. I spoke with Hud officials. Also, who are right now are not on board, are not saying yes to this plan. Well, this is going to be something that maybe in the next five years will take place, but Russ is definitely listening and we're working diligently with presidents to address our concerns and the concerns of residents. So thank you carmen that was super helpful can just to return to the original question. It sounds like there has been some initial engagement that has begun and I do not know if that's more just like a general, you have a constant kind of running line of communication with greg Russ or if it's focused around the blueprint rollout exactly it's focused around the blueprint. But again you know it there's a lot of things that need to be worked out and a lot of the protections is really where we at because a lot of us are really looking at home ownership and you know resident management, and so that's something that we have put on the table. We're looking at it. There's a lot of things to look at, because one thing I can tell you is: he listens, he's very engaged with the President's. I and I like that about him, but I really do not have anything bad to say about him. I think that the plan can work if we all sit down and work it together, but there are a lot of provisions to this public trust that we really need to look at, because when you talk about going from section 9 to section 8, we lose a lot of our protections. Right, definitely hear that concern and I think that's something important to work through. It sounds like it could potentially be thought through, and maybe some kind of solution could be formulated for it. So that's a helpful thing to focus on. Could I jump in for a second there sure. Thank you just real quick and thank you carmen for sharing that what I'm hearing, because you know the documents that have been produced, try to speak to some of the issues and what I'm hearing from you is that more work needs to be done to make sure that everybody's comfortable, that what is being proposed is what will actually happen. Has that come up in your conversations with whoever it is you're speaking to with Russ and with his yes, a lot of it has come up even with Hud. I've spoken with Hud, and we are you know our thing is you know we can not afford to lose our protections. That's number one. We have so many seniors living in these developments and we really have to look out for them again and to lose protections from section nine to section eight, it's a big thing. As we know section, eight has been in trouble for a long time, so we really wanna a really sit down and a lot of the presidents feel the same way and again we're looking at equity. Okay, we're looking at. Definitely you know resident management. Those are a lot of the things that we're looking at Greg. Russ is very open to that. To tell you the truth, he's very open to a lot of things. One thing he is doing and he is listening, and so as long as as long as the presidents are engaging in the process, I think we'll get through it. I, like actually some of the things that he's talking about what I, what my thing is the protections right. We want to make sure that we are fully protected before we go into a section, eight that takes our protections away. Okay, thank you very much. It's really helpful. Can I just ask and forgive my ignorance, but who would is this federal legislation that has to be passed? Can it be done in the city? Can NYCHA just put in new rules and protections by itself? Well, it's legislation that definitely has to be passed again. Legislation yeah it has to be it has to go to Congress. So we are talking to the congressman and you know looking into a lot of the stuff we making sure that they know what this partnership really looks like right, because everyone can talk about what they've done, but the people that live here actually know what's going on, and when you talk about protections we ought to know about our 964 regulations right, and so they need to look at that. We need to make sure that they're looking at that and again we just need to make sure that everyone is on board that everybody knows exactly what's going down right, because one may say one thing and another may say another. You know these are different. Infills we've been doing infills for them for the longest already there's another. This is another aspect of it right but, like I said, I think that the ideas are good, except we have to really think of the protections and what do we lose as public housing residents, because under the 964 regs we are protected once the protection for public housing, section 9 is gone and goes into section eight. We have no tenant rights on the private and public partnership. Thanks Carmen Mark made a quick suggestion. I do not want to put you on the spot Erica, but I'm going to put you on the spot. Do you have you? Has your office at all like waded into this blueprint, and do you have any idea about like a state legislative piece that would be required to enact parts of this plan? I honestly do not yet. I know I can check with the legislative team, but this has not come up at all as proposed state legislation, so I have not even heard anything of it but I'll. I can find out for you guys for sure. Oh that'd be great. Okay, let's dig into that, and you know return to it in our subsequent discussions about like what are the federal state, whatever legislative pieces. I do not want to get too caught up in that right now. Anything you guys need just. Let me know really appreciate it. Carmen Cynthia you've been waiting patiently, I'm going to allow you to talk hi. Can you hear me yep, hi, okay, so, first of all, we have to realize that, while you guys love Cambridge is under that program, which is rental assistance demonstration, it has nothing to do with the blueprint. Greg. Russ has three things going on rad pack and blueprint now under impact. That is section 8 that is privately managed and new city is not Cambridge. Massachusetts Cambridge was done with rad on a small scale. Yes, it was beautiful and gorgeous and all those great things, but that can't be applied here. What was applied here was ocean bay, that is the Cambridge version for New York City, Ocean Bay, and if you do not know there has been an outsource of problems at Ocean, Bay number one, they have the highest eviction of all the NYCHA developments since they came under the rad program. Okay, that's first problem. Second problem is all the agreements that NYCHA was supposed to adhere to under the southern district of New York becomes obsolete once you get put into the rad program, which means NYCHA no longer has to re, do mold remediation or any of that they are being compelled to do during the southern district of New York's rules. You were removed from that immediately. So, while they do give you brand new refrigerators and do a huge cosmetic upgrade, the new boilers they got, the elevators they got was all Fema money that had nothing to do with rad money. And yes, we have, as presidents talked to Greg Russ a million times, and if there's one thing he always brings up is Cambridge Massachusetts, because he's used to doing small developments. He was never in New York before this is his first time dealing with large city and we are on a scale that is nothing like Cambridge, so you're not going to get the small intimate quality of life that Cambridge has to offer here in New. York City believe that number one number two with pact, which is permanent affordability, commitment, togetherness that they have slated just for Manhattan, that's 62,000 apartments and under pact, and I keep asking you guys to reach out to wise towers to Unesco. Well, that's currently undergoing pact, and they have had problem after problem after problem during Covid-19. Therein was called a bundle. B Bundle B is also 338: east 29th, 344 East 29th street. They went and got a lawyer because they have been mowed over by Greg Russ and this pat problem. So everything is not always silver linings. On the other side, all right, if Hud stops funding section 8 tomorrow, all these section, 8 vouchers will no longer pay the remainder of the rent, which means that a NYCHA tenant will not only be responsible for paying the 30 of the rent as they pay now they will be responsible for paying all of their rent. If Hud stops funding section eight, if Hud want to fund section nine, which is public housing, what makes you think they're going to want to fund section eight for the rest of their lives? That's why we're being thrown into private management? This is a real estate deal. We are nothing but a dollar figure at the end of the day, and nobody cares. If we keep our apartments or not, we definitely hear you and we definitely care. I think the thinking I do not know. If this is, you know it's. Obviously you probably do not agree with, but the thinking is that section 8 funding is more secure. I think it's until considers. Otherwise I think it's very unlikely. It would be defunded and that's the thinking between behind using it to fund developments, but I do not want to debate you. I hear you and I hear your concerns the same way and they all lost their apartments under cabrini green. So you have to look at the bigger picture here if it was done in Chicago wrong, and it is currently being done in Minneapolis wrong. What makes you think that everything's going to stay great in New York number One, that's the that's the bigger picture here, because New York is on a scale and we have more to lose yeah. I think you make a few really good points about New, York being a very different scale and like magnitude of issue, and also that we are confusing a bunch of different things and I do think that they need to be pulled apart, which is like rad versus pack versus blueprint and well. Compact are almost the same exact thing: it's just that pact is only designated for Manhattan. It's not good everywhere else is called rat and Manhattan is the only place it's called Pac and then, when you have the blueprint, the blueprint is specifically designed for buildings that are now considered undesirable or obsolete, that it would cost more to repair them than it would be to put them into this tpt program. It has never been tried before and if it does not work, then what's going to happen when all the buildings are deemed obsolete, so Cynthia, sorry, I want to stop you for a minute. I do not see how the third- party transfer program, like is part of this at all. I think I read in the blueprint that every single building is supposed to get a plan, so I do not know that it's supposed to be like only desirable. I'm sorry! I do not want to debate. I appreciate your feedback needing buildings that were not put into rat. If your building was not designated rather packed. If you was not designated infill or air right, then it's been designated undesirable and that's what qualifies you for the blueprint program? That's the difference that Greg Russ explained to us. You have to remember that the meeting that you guys are looking at that's being held now on the webinar is being held by lobbyists run by Lobbyists, Greg rust was in on it, but the meetings we had with greg Russ were entirely separate. That's right on the webinar and that's what I'm trying guys to understand, which is kind of hard to do when the housing committee keeps. I Wanna say this real fast you Wanna talk about being respectful is when tenant presidents talk. The housing committee does not decide to remove themselves from the screen, because, if you guys were having your meeting on 87th street right now, would you be permitted to get up and walk away from the table while we were talking? No, but that's why I'm looking at you on zoom and I'm also looking at you on Youtube, where I get to a broader picture of who's removing themselves, while Ta presidents talk- and this has been going on for months now- I've been doing a comparison and you have board members that every time we speak you remove yourselves from spring and exactly because I'm watching it right now. Yeah, I hear your frustration. You know, I think you know you could be right. Sometimes people are not focusing completely other times. I think people different technology capabilities or different technologies available to them. So let's do not think that our voices count and they get up and they remove themselves from the screen every time I'm on here she does the same thing. Well, it's not it's a more, but if you're a house city- and you were having the meeting on 7th street, would you be permitted to walk up and walk away from the table when we're talking? So do you think it's fair that you do it every time we speak? It's the same carmen. I really appreciate your feedback and I really want to keep talking with the issues. I understand if you have some issues with our meeting management and you are free to bring that up with me Lisa and Mark, but I prefer not to do it in this venue. No problem, okay. As far as what's going on with the blueprint, the blueprint is designated for those buildings that are deemed undesirable or obsolete. That's where the blueprint comes into play, packed in rad or for the other 62,000 apartments. If you're not designated infill air rights, rat or pact, you have now been designated for the blueprint. The blueprint is a public trust where the where NYCHA has done a deal that once the trust, whatever bank decides to hold this money into trust. You still turn around and you hire NYCHA workers to fix things. Well, if NYCHA can't be responsible enough to do right with the money they currently have and the repairs they are currently supposed to be making, why would you set up a public trust and hire the same crappy people to do the work again? That is absurd and that's what the blueprint is. That's the part they're not telling you on these webinars that we were able to pull out of greg Russ when we met with him privately. He admitted that and your guys are not getting that on the webinar. I'm not sure I quite understand the last point you were making about the public trust and then the hiring of tenants. Can you just repeat that the blueprint once you get the tpt vouchers, if Congress approves it? Let's say they approve it and they're awarded it? It's four times the amount for each apartment that money gets put into a public trust that is going to be overseen by the Bank of Nycha's choice or Greg Russ's choice actually because he's the head of NYCHA. So the money goes into a public trust, but then the trust which would be the bank turns around and hires NYCHA to make the repairs and that's what people are not understanding. If NYCHA can't make repairs correctly now when they are essentially in charge of all the tenants, how are you going to turn around and let a bank rehire NYCHA officials to make repairs? That makes absolutely no sense and that's what we brought up to greg Russ. If the money goes into a public trust, then the president's there should be a subcommittee made up of presidents that decide who we are going to outsource this money to make repairs, because you can not trust NYCHA to repair themselves. They have made a mockery of it for decades. So to turn around and allow them to be the ones that are going to be designated to make repairs again under the blueprint program makes absolutely no sense if we are not permitted to decide what vendors should be brought in to make the upgrades got it. That was helpful. I think just make a brief statement to kind of return to our original theme, which was like what could be a helpful way to have this conversation or for us to have a better understanding of what's going on. You know it's a little bit difficult to piece together the information between just reading the reports from nature, and then you know we hear from the Ta President who have a very different view and that's where I think it could be helpful to have us sitting down at a digital table. I guess at this point hearing from NYCHA and then having you in the same room, to also give your opinion and kind of like have that all happen in one place, as opposed to very fragmented conversation. Our concern are our tenants. We are not. We do not profit, we do not make any money off this deal. We are not real estate brokers. That is what the higher ups have a stake in the hearing. Certainly that there's a job support can I just say something for a second: there are Nitro pros and NYCHA trust cons right, one of the biggest pros that we have right as resident leadership, input owned and operated by NYCHA, funded by Hud at state and city. Although funding has been cut, Congress continues to front the subsidies to NYCHA public housing, which is section 9 right now in private public and private partnership. It will be at the new owner's discretion to provide services, no resident leadership, input at all owned and operated by private investors and banks under this program. If the federal government does not fund the Tpv section, eight vouchers, the residents will be responsible again to pay all subsidies under this new central plan. This section, eight is only for the unit. It only works for that unit. You can not take this anywhere else. That's it here. You are. I hear you on that. The concerns about section 8 versus section 9 and about oversight on the public trust. So I think those are important questions you know in our I'm sure. We've said this to you before meetings, the community board. We do not really have any power to make anyone do anything, but we can try to pull together leaders and elected officials to sit down and have conversations. So you know using that. You know platform that we have. I think it could be helpful to again bring together NYCHA elected officials. You all- and you know, talk some of this out and hear what their responses are and discuss some potential solutions Melissa. That would be great. That really would be great, like that everybody can hear it all at one time and nobody can say something different when you're not right, because these webinars that they have are based for different audiences and at the end of the day, keep in mind. Ocean Bay has the highest eviction rate since they were in the Rad program. Cambridge is not New York Cambridge works. It does not work in New York when Ocean Bay has the highest eviction rates. They went into rad yeah, that's definitely troubling, and I think you know that was the first attempt, and I hope that you know through these conversations, something better can be what they did is falling apart. They got brand new windows, they do not open, they got brand new radiators that are leaking okay every other week, it's a cosmetic upgrade. It's a shiny penny with the same rotten copper in between and none of them pipes are being none of the pipes where all of the leaks are coming from all right. The infrastructure is not being addressed and you can paint it. You can do whatever you want to it. If you do not change them pipes baby, you will have leaks for the rest of your life and it does not make any sense. It really does not, and so until they address the infrastructure, there is no deal. What is the deal, so we really got Ta. It would be great Melissa. You got a great idea. I think you should all be in one room, yeah Mark. I would love if you know you have any thoughts about like the best way. To start like what the next steps would be, if we wanted to try to do some kind of initial task force type conversation that would let me rephrase working Group, not task force. What are your thoughts? My thoughts are that now I'm on the spot, because I'm right, you know the I want to. I want to make one thing that, in fairness to the webinar- and I am very attentive to what carmen and cynthia have shared about the different audiences to which the webinar was intended. One of the things I did take away from that was a recognition that state legislation, perhaps federal as well, but certainly state legislation, would be needed to to have protections to continue the protections that they're promising, and I hear you saying that is first and foremost among any other issue, and I appreciate hearing that, in terms of in terms of answering Melissa's question about how to move this forward, it strikes me that the next step would be to for us to have a conversation with elected officials and try to figure out the right ones to have partner with our attempt to bring folks together. I think the last people we need to bring into the fold would be NYCHA itself, and so we would try to figure out from our perspective, who you know, how can we get a reasonably sized group that can be nimble enough to actually have a conversation, ask questions and get that information involve Rta presidents and as many other stakeholders as we can get, but certainly the Ta presidents and then to invite NYCHA to have a you know, blueprint 2.0 or a blueprint follow- up or whatever the right way to envision this, and I would leave that to you and louisa to be to direct on a more granular level. But my my instinct tells me that if there are issues with what I perceive to be a well- meaning, even if not necessarily perfectly thought out proposal, then we want to have, in effect all of our questions at the ready, with a reality check from elected officials about what is and is not possible and then to have that conversation with NYCHA. Does that make any sense to anybody? If I could jump in and tell you what we've done before so when we came back from Cambridge, we were very concerned because what Cambridge did was it's not section eight when they do the rad? It's a combination, so it's basically keeping it a section. Nine. We were very concerned. We had several meetings, madeleine and I met with Jerry Nadler last January 2019 and told him all of the concerns when we came back and he his office has been very helpful. They have attended every task force, meeting they're well aware of all of the concerns about section 8 and that you can evict people on section 8, which you can't on this section, 9 it's harder. We were concerned that the building that the, if the developer, who takes over a rad, does not care, then the development stinks, which is often happens if, when people do not care, we met with we've met with victor about many of these problems, and I think going forward. You need victor. You need Congressman, Madler's office involved. You need definitely the state senators and states assembly people, because these are where stuff happens. You probably need a stringer's office speak for the audits, there's not a lot that we can do, but we can certainly advocate and then I think that's the main thing we need to do. We do not have we tried, we got seven of the 12 community boards in Manhattan met over a three month period. We had three meetings. We tried to get gayle's office to set up a meeting with Greg Ross, which never happened, but I think right now, meetings are not that important, but I think advocacy on behalf of what we're seeing that's, not good and asking for what we know is good yeah, I guess just reverted to respond to meetings are not helpful. I do think that there's just like a need for us to all get a better understanding of well. I think we can do that. I'm just saying okay, meetings with Greg Ross are not always productive. I think we have to have a plan of what we want going forward and I think once we have that plan, we do not want to see evictions. We want to see adequate development. We want to see the roofs fixed, we want to see elevators at work. We want to see boilers at work we want to. We do not want people to not have hot water or heat in the winter, and I think we make a list of those things. I think we reach out to the other 11 Manhattan boards and we come up with a plan for our neighborhoods. So I'm going to stop you just for a moment agree. I feel like you're right. We do know what we want and also very much like what it sounds like nature, leaders and residents do not want you know, which are these cosmetic repairs. They want rights, etc. I would rather focus our effort on the developments in our district just to as a jumping off point and I'd prefer not to start pulling in other boards and other electives that do not represent our constituency, and I think we can revisit that later on, but I would prefer to start with, like a working group, that's really focused on, like our local needs and kind of build out from there totally, because this is a big. This is something this is not something small. This is a big thing and we need to start with home right, because we have enough issues here that we have to get together. We have enough presidents here that can sit down with you guys we can. We can run everything by you, so you can see what we're talking about. Let me first at least sit with the leaders that know what's going on and that are data at the forefront of this, because, again you're going to see a lot of different. Let me tell you: Greg Russ had a webinar and on that webinar all he had on there were investors and bankers. I ran acrosss that by mistake and kept myself muted and heard everything. Okay, and so you know this is way bigger than we really can imagine right, and so I think that if we can just keep it at home, like Melissa says, keep it at home. Let's do our district first, because we are in dire need of help we are, and if we can sit down, everybody here is knowledgeable when it comes to the 964 rex. We have everything that we we're good, we're saving our stuff. We know our stuff, so if we could just sit down with you so that whatever you do not know, maybe I this I'm quite sure, there's things I can learn from you right, but if we can sit down at a table or I do not enroll on zoom right and get these things on the table, so we know what we're talking about before we invite the elected officials- and we really remember a lot of these- are like the officials are on the take too. I'm not you know me see that's why people do not like them, because to tell the truth right. So we do not. Let's not go, let's not go there. Okay, I'm not going to I'm not going to go there. I just I was just going to say that, but we definitely we definitely want to keep it at home and so that we can at least address the issues that are happening right now. Before this blueprint, this blueprint is presented again because it's been presented in so many different ways. Melissa, I think you're muted, sorry, so I think, as a next step, we can potentially do some outreach and try to figure out who could be like helpful conveners. For these conversations and again this is meant to be like a working group kind of discussion format not like a meeting not like a town hall or something like that, and I think you know Linda's office and Jerry's office. Those could be good places to start and you know mark. I might look to you for some assistance in lending your power of the chair shift to those requests, for you have a real desire for being frustrated because the power of my chair is you know it swivels, that's about all. I can say for it, but I'm glad to I'm glad to be useful in any way, recognizing that that there, that you and louisa- and many of our many of the folks on this on this zoom are much more familiar with these issues and with the with the fine detail than I will be, but I'm glad to do whatever. I can to make sure that that's a productive conversation great, and I think we can talk about like what the specific ask is. We can maybe like draft an email and workshop it and yeah, and let's try to have that before the next Housing Committee meeting next month. Although timing may be a little awkward with the way that you know it's a little late this month and a little early next month, but we'll make sure that this works. It does not a question for everybody in my ignorance, which is it's because of the webinar and the documents that I've read. It struck me that legislative initiatives would need to be passed before this goes anywhere, which in turn suggests to me that we got a little bit of time. Am I wrong in that, because if this is going someplace next week, I do not want the train to leave the station while we're still trying to figure out. You know what car we're going to be in it's going to be a while before this passes anyway. Okay, so then we have a little bit of time if we use it wisely to to make sure that we hear from the right people and then I think, Melissa's idea of a bottom- up or ground not ground was grassroots. Excuse me, grassroots, inspired a list of prioritized concerns and then start working on how to make sure that each of those is addressed and figure out who will address which one roberta's point about making sure that the federal issue is covered here there are elected officials representatives on this zoom, so we do not need to reach out to the president's office to the council, Members Office to the assembly member's office, because they're already here, but we can sort of we can. We can I'm glad to work with Melissa and Louisa to make sure that all happens. I appreciate that and I'm willing to work with anybody that needs a list of what a lot of our demands are and what we've talked about and whatever you need on that list, we can put it on so that we can address it. Yeah it'd be great to know what ground you've already covered. So that we do not get stuck in a loop, as you were suggesting earlier carmen, where you know we, you know they present something to us that they've already presented to you and you've already found issues with be great to be all on the same page on that amen. Okay, with that, I'm going to put this agenda item to rest. Unless anyone else on the committee wants to comment or weigh in before we turn to the budget and DNS. I do not see any other raised hands among non- panelist attendees, so great whoops. No sooner do I say that then we have lourdes, who has raised your hand, whereas you can unmute if you want to speak Hey lourdes. I think that's you if you could mute your live stream while you're talking to us, because there'll be a feedback. Okay, how do I should be a button on the lower left? No, you need to unmute the live stream, not to unmute the zoom yeah Laura's. You might have youtube open, in which case you should just close youtube and just use the zoom and unmute yourself on zoom. That might be the obvious or just mute, the mute, the youtube, if you can't close it, hey hi great. I think we can hear you now. If you want to go ahead. You hear me now yep, okay, I just have a general question. How do I know which the rad, the pat or the blueprint is my development on there, because we have not had meetings because of the whole pademic thing with my tenant president, so I do not know which one does absent houses fall under and where do you live some houses? Roberta? Do you know I? My understanding was that Amsterdam houses is not in red or packed, but but I learned a lot tonight, so I want to make sure I got it right. This is Cynthia. I think I muted and got rid of my video, but I'm here, Amsterdam houses is actively right now, not in either program and we have some major concerns about Amsterdam houses. The good news about Amsterdam houses is that they're very tight with God Riverside got a Riverside is like the big angel watching over them, but I I'm glad to talk with you. Learn this about it if afterwards, if you want, but our big concern right now is that they may sell air rights because it's in the prime location on the upper West side, that was not prime, when Amsterdam houses was built and we've been monitoring this and as have several other organizations. So right now, people have their ear to the ground and are closely watching it. Because of our fears that air rights could be sold or buildings could be. The space could be used by their buildings, great question, but roberta you mean that they would sell the air rights and use the money from the air right sale to fix the buildings. Is that what's the problem as what happened with homes on the east side, they sold the they were going to build another building on the property, which would be a multi- multi- use. So some of it would have been market rate. Some would have been affordable and the amount of money coming in from that selling that land and using it would not have covered the cost of repairing the buildings. So while they might sell air rights or they might knock down a building and build an affordable multi- use, which would have some affordable of some market rate, our concern is that there would not be enough money to pay for all of the costs that are needed for repairs and work at Amsterdam houses got it well with the current real estate market. I would probably must, but we are monitoring it very carefully. Okay, thank you appreciate you. Can I ask you a question sure doc with regard to city property being sold much with the defender project? Would not air rights also have to go through public review process and Community Board inputted, no, a different process so that land is not owned by the city, it's owned by NYCHA yeah. They do not go through euler and they do not go through euler. So that's one of the things we that's a that's a big ass that we should be asking for. That should be part of our. You know when we have our list of things we want with. Certainly I mean Fred Douglas and Amstram houses are prime sources of landfill and infill and air rights. Can I make a statement? First of all, holmes was supposed to go under euler, which is why Gail got lawyers and has currently been put on hold because they did not go through euler. They have a Hb action against the city, so nothing's happening with homes right now and Fettner's been at a standstill. They have not been granted the playground as they originally de Blasio, because they did not go through euler homes, a little more complicated, but it's sort of Kinda, okay. Okay, with that any other questions from panelists attendees. Okay, all right with that, I would like to turn to the DNS and budget, which are very much on the same. I think general theme of our earlier conversations. We had a conversation with this committee. I think in June, where we just did some preliminary brainstorming of what our budget requests item should be, or perhaps July actually, and I just want to read off quickly what are the capital items we had identified and I can also paste it in the chat- and let me know if like these are seem wrong now, if there are ones we want to add, but so one was new front entrances at Douglas. I think that was to deal with some doors not closing properly and security issues related to that another was restoration of HPD funding for affordable housing. That's you know, just generally, for the district again in night show was trash receptacles for the brownstones of wise and then four was a virtual doorman system and five was broadband for Douglas, Amsterdam and wise so or was a virtual assortment. Okay, so just any initial thoughts, anything you guys would like to see removed. That is just a stopping start. Jumping off point sorry, Cynthia common, because these are very small, specific things. It is not that they would be really good to have but you're on the ground. So we'd appreciate your opinion regarding what the trash receptacle for the brownstone yeah, I think carmen and cynthia were on the call when we came up with that list just for contacts but yeah. If you have any more recent thoughts or other items, you think we need to be including please oh well, that was basically it. We did the doors we did that the trash receptacles. It is up to the acting director of mixed finance to approve the money which he's not doing. I can give you his information. Every area has what's called mix finance they're the ones that have the money for our developments. They have to approve things like fixing the doors trash, receptacles fixing, buzzers upgrading the systems in Manhattan. His name is Carl Walton he's the director of mix finance for NYCHA Carl Walton is the man with the money. He decides. What he's going to allocate money for repairs of doors that tend to get broken a lot and getting extra garbage cans put out since Miss Walton has gotten the position. He does not speak with presidents. He does not communicate with us. He thinks he's on a higher plane and he does not release the money, which is why we're all at a standstill with broken doors and no garbage cans and etc, because he refuses to spend the money to get this man to even spend money on getting them to clean the buildings. We have maintenance workers that can't get mop. Heads can't get cleaning supplies, that's a bigger problem than trash receptacles right now. Our buildings have not been mocked. In five months. We have written countless letters to Mr Walton regarding cleaning supplies for our caretakers, and he does. He does not even answer us. So I went to Vito Mr Tolino, the general manager who came by here and did a surprise walk through and confronting him because at the end of the day, if you're not going to do your job, then someone else needs to be put in that position, but we can't get them to fund Mop heads and brooms and cleaning supplies and that's a shame. Our buildings are filthy and I mean filthy yeah. On that note, we also had sorry on the expense, side, cleaning supplies and services for NYCHA. You know for regular maintenance and to prevent the spread of Covid-19., so that will definitely. I think the biggest issue is that we are lacking in workers. Okay, we do not have enough work with on staff, and even now more so I've been on a regular almost every day with Greg, Russ and Vito about management does not even answer the phone. You know we have ghost town. So it's about getting more people to come to work. We have the same maintenance workers that right now, a lot of them are going out sick. Our doors continue to be vandalized, but again they fix the doors and they break them and every time they break a door. It's us a lot of money to fix these doors and I keep telling the residents the same thing. They break these doors. Like he's all right, we could we could sit here and we can talk about what they, what they're not doing, but the residents have to do their job too and stop breaking these doors every time a door breaks baby, it's money to fix it so close to. May I ask a follow- up question thanks: Cynthia was talking about releasing money which made it sound like the money was sitting there and that it was not a budget request to fund these kinds of expenses, but rather a problem that allocated funding was not being spent. Do I have that right, yeah without cleaning supplies, the money is there. He just has to release it to the superintendents which he won't when it comes to doors. That's a different issue, because doors are expensive, so you know, and even then veto has gotten aggravated at the fact that the doors have gone so long without being repaired, because it's a security issue right. It's a massive security issue, but cleaning supplies should not be an issue and it is when you can't get and yes all our developments, our caretakers have been hit hard by Covid-19. We are all severely under manpower, but with the ones that are here. We can't get the mop heads. We can't get the cleaning supplies because and his na I'll give you his email and everything he's Carl Walton and he's the acting director of mix finance. The original director retired, so this is a man that who used to be what was called a ram, which was a regional asset manager. He is also he's like assigned certain developments and he walks around and he decides what the issues are well now he's got an even higher position where he is over the rams and he still won't release the money I mean, for instance, I can't give food out anymore. I can't do anything with my community room because we had a flood and our air conditioner broke. My community room is supposed to be a cooling center and it has not been a cooling center at all this summer because I need three pieces put into my HVAC unit and Mr Walton somehow lost the paperwork for an entire month and we still have not gotten the three: it's a belt, a little motor and a fan to make sense. Okay, no, I understand what you're saying and it sounds horrendous, but this seems to me a somewhat different issue that we can handle separately, that we could contact him as the community board, urging him to release this money. That has already been allocated, but what we were talking about is budgeting in the future, which is the 2022 year right, yeah louisa. I want to also just kind of push back on that a little bit. If, but please finish, no, it was just that. Looking ahead, what do we think that we will be needing? Because we have to ask for that, and that contacting Walton is a somewhat different issue, because the money is there already and we have to urge him to release it. We have to urge something. Yep can I say I agree with cynthia and carmen saying what we need and the money's on the whole and what we need, but I think NYCHA is looking at it. This is a pandemic. We should not release any funds, they do not care about us. We should not release any funds until we know what the city budget is going to be because we're not getting any money from the federal government like we should so, I think they're just holding onto money just like that, their hoarding apartments that are empty the same thing they they're waiting to see a better program in order to spend the money. They feel that we're not. I do not want to say necessary, we're not that important for them to focus on that. Their focus. Look like they're focused on a bigger picture. How are we going to pay for NYCHA and not even in the near future and in the far future, so I think they're not going to release any monies until they know what they're doing there's going to be more cuts of services? I kind of think that's where that's probably going to come down the future. This money is already there. Nycha is given every development is given a certain amount of money for mop heads, light bulbs, light fixtures, cleaning supplies gloves that money care. He is a simple thing of putting it on the credit card that or every superintendent has in the development, and he won't do it. This is simple. This is not an act report. It's fair. There is money being given by the federal government, thirty thousand dollars, thirty thousand a week a week. Where is that money we that money is being given? They do not feel that we important for them to use it. That's what I'm trying to say, but that's different funding, that's different from what they're already given in a budget for cleaning supplies. They have that money and we have to just there's no reason why they should not let it go. It does not matter whether we we do not matter or anything. I think that you know we need to just push back on it right and I just to bring us back to you know what we're focusing on, which is the budget priorities for the next fiscal year. I hear what some of you are saying and that like. Why would we make this a budget request when it's something that seems like it's already been budgeted for? But I would say to that our budget request is again just a way to elevate issues to people to elected officials to OMB. We are not going to get new things put in the budget. Probably so is this the correct vehicle to include some of these items that maybe should have been allocated funding or were allocated funding. It was not released, or is it not? I think it could still be helpful to include items in the DNS and then use that as a tool to push NYCHA to push our electeds to make sure the money is released. I'm that's my opinion and I'm you know absolutely right, you're, absolutely right, you're, absolutely right! It's there already. The elected officials can do a push and get it released. It's different. If it was not there, it's there there's. No reason why it should not be allocated, so it would be very helpful. You hit it right on the name Melissa. They we need to make sure our elected officials start pushing back on that and getting that money released as it should be, and I do not think putting it in our budget. Priorities precludes us from also other kinds of advocacy which could be reaching out to Carl, and you know, or I get having all kids reach out. I think it's just like one more tool we can use to advocate. That's my opinion, and you know I would we can do both well, I'm in love with you, girl, yeah, okay, any other items that people think we have not touched on Jeanette, I feel, like you, always have some good thoughts on the DNS and budget. Those were just budget also. We had some notes from the DNS also that I will quickly read off and then I want to hear from other community members so for DNS items. These are not budget items they're just things that we think are important. One is preservation of NYCHA as a source of deeply affordable housing in community district seven. So this is just like a general. You know value that we do not want. You know to be converted to something else: we want to make sure it stays as a resource for those who need it in our district then. The second was the need for more newly constructed, affordable housing and preservation of existing, affordable housing in community district 7, which would include senior housing, preservation of sros mixed income, housing and support housing. So those were the two like major DNS items. I also had written from our last conversation. So if anyone wants to Susan or Jeanette yeah did you include rent stabilization in that Melissa? I did not catch it. If you did no. What specifically, I guess I feel like a lot got dealt with in the 2019 changes, the rent laws, so I like do not have much on my wish list when it came to that. But if you have things and yeah I mean everything from last year: it has not been resolved, it's still hemorrhaging, so I would say that should definitely be included in that list of housing, affordable housing that you just mentioned. I also think perhaps something about the homeless situation should be included in our DNS. I do not know what can be done, but I mean that's the elephant room as far as I'm concerned. Nycha is a huge issue, but the homeless situation is becoming it's getting out of hand. Well, this is supportive housing that we have to look into and looking at what we did last year and the year before. A lot of it has to be updated because nothing is ever resolved, but we also should be looking at Mitchell Llama and getting some updated information on it and how we can preserve what we still have and also maybe we could try to look into something of actually changing the rules and so that any building that goes over a certain height must be 80 20.. In other words, really I know that this is it's not going to fly, but I think we should even start mentioning it. The fact that, as a right, they can build as high as they want and in our 10 district and not be responsible for providing anything that benefits the community. It's ridiculous, I mean Louise. I think that asserts a value that height is inherently bad, which I do not personally agree with. So this is not a bad height. This is not you just said they can build as high as they want without giving anything back. So it's like behind. That is an assumption. That height is bad. Therefore, they need to give something back: no I'm just using height as a vehicle to get 80:20 to get some kind of affordable housing included in market rate housing and that's the most visible way to forgive the punt for doing so as we lose light, but we've also launched a lot of housing and I think Louise and I are going to try and look tomorrow at the numbers to see how much we've lost in the last year or two and figure out where that is. What do you mean rent stabilized units that are now no longer unstabilized? Do you mean like demolition of buildings? What do you mean 80:20, affordable et cetera, because the older 80 20s many of them have gone out of you know: okay, so expiring regulatory agreements exactly a whole bunch of other. You know we're just going to take a sort of a grand look at okay, that'd be great and I'd love. If you guys could present what you find at one of our upcoming meetings. I think Ira wants to speak. Sorry Ira either speak Ira, please. I think you muted yeah. Why can't we at least start small in what louise is thinking about and get rid of that stupid paragraph? You cut out Aura either here you are. We watched you after paragraph yep and he's still frozen. It's always when you're making your point that it cuts out. I suppose you do a stupid. Paragraph is what he said. So I really am muted. No, I'm not muted. Oh, he throws right after the word paragraph. I think there's the remember the paragraph where the where they got the extra 30 or 40 feet for having one unit at 96th and broadway, which we had a few months ago as a point of discussion. Yeah can we start modestly and get rid of stuff like that? I do not disagree and I actually, I do not really have an opinion, because I do not remember the discussion well enough, but I just like I'm not sure, is the DNS the right place for that, or is it this like a separate discussion that should result in like a resolution or an ask for an elected to make like a policy proposal? I think it's probably both but yeah could not talk about the DNS. The whole purpose of the DNS, in addition to part of it, goes down to the agencies and the agencies answer some questions, but part of it is a roadmap for what we're thinking and where we're going and this year with Covid-19 team with so many people more people have lost their homes, they've lost their jobs. We have two and a half million New York City residents who are food insecure every night we have a hundred thousand students who are homeless. You know, I think we really have to look at housing as a right and really anything we can put in the DNS is value- added. I agree with all of that and I'm sorry if I did not. You know kind of start us off on that note that you know I do not in any way under value the need for like homeless housing and just in general creation of more housing. That could therefore help lower rents in general, and I think you know we should definitely in light of the recent controversy. Around shelters and homelessness in the world side, make a point of drawing that connection between creating more housing and homelessness and make that, like a really significant piece of our section, and I think absolutely DNS excellent yes thumbs up on this. Okay and the other thing is that I'd like to focus both the affordable housing and senior housing, which also works with the homeless population, because the people that I'm seeing on the street some of them are failing. Elderly yeah. You know the homeless population is aging yep. This is Jeanette speaking. I do not have any great ideas to add to the district needs statement, except I was thinking, maybe there's something related to it. I mean in the summer time it was cooling centers, but maybe in the winter time you know if people's heat is breaking or something that there's more funding for emergency services, because people can't go in and say shack up with another neighbor or something if there's no heat in their apartment because of Covid-19 that there's more services to fix things quickly. Okay, so that would be like a budget item for like I do not know what I do not know. If it would be HPD, I think they do. Emergency repairs are completely they do, but are you talking mainly? I do not know like there are cooling centers. Are you talking about rooms, areas that say the homeless could go in the winter without having to go to a shelter? Or do you mean just people who take breaks other than libraries? Actually, I was thinking about how the city was providing people with air conditioners or with students with the ipad, so they could do their schooling online, okay and well. That was haters, so yeah like emergency space, heater provision, if necessary. I think that would come under Hhs. So my thought was like glass last. I think it was last winter, like people went without heating for like weeks or maybe it was at Queen's housing, not in Manhattan or something, but it was a man yeah. So when you think about Covid-19 and such they're, you know this the budget's going to be slim this year, but there might be something that Tac can tap into. If the federal government ever passes a new stimulus bill and such that it could feed into okay Susan, you had your hand up yeah. I just wanted to really make sure that we include the same wording. We have last year about the importance of reclaiming and preserving the run stabilized units because they're really diminishing and then the other thing was. I felt like the comment he made about the homeless situation. Just got sort of shoved off shoved aside, not to be too blunt about it. But this is a big issue we just faced and we are facing in our neighborhood, and it's really important to me that if we have homeless people in our district, they need to get proper services. I mean I do not know how you want to address that, but I think that the housing committee should be addressing this issue and should be discussing it. I I'm just sort of surprised we're having a housing community tonight, we're not talking about it, I'm not sure what how we could address it more like. I think we definitely want to include in our DNS that the importance of supportive housing, which is you know, affordable housing with embedded social services for generally homeless people who have special needs, so I think that's a way we can address it and then the other way we can address it is, you know, more housing generally, especially deeply affordable housing, and then you know things like you mentioned like ensuring we have a rent, stabilized stock, which serves as kind of naturally occurring, affordable housing which can help prevent homelessness. So can you just sorry, can you say more about what you think we need to speak to it's two separate points. One is, I would like the DNS, the district needs statement to include wording about reclaiming and preserving of rent stabilized housing. That's it's diminishing right and then fine, it sounded to me like. Maybe it was being taken out because, oh we already addressed it, we have not already known that ongoing need. Okay, great no! A lot of this is ongoing. Unfortunately, great okay, I mean it's not great, it's ongoing, but fine, and then the other thing was just to say. It seems to me that the housing committee is the appropriate form or one of the important forms to discuss the homelessness issue that we've been facing. So I just you know, okay, what about it? I guess, like. I think everyone has very strong opinions on it and I do not really want to wade into something that we do not have like a constructive reason to address or way to address. If so, I just I'm not sure what like what would be helpful in having this conversation like. Is there something sorry I do not know, I'm just not going to jump in on them. I got you. What strikes me as appropriate for this committee is to is to perhaps tie together a lot of what we're experiencing with respect to homelessness. In general, with your push for additional, affordable housing of all the types of affordable housing that you're identifying one of the one of the issues that I think everybody can agree on in an in an environment where there's a lot of strongly held, perhaps differing opinions is that there needs to be more affordable housing available so that when people who are in shelter or who are otherwise ready to live independently can actually find a place to live that they can afford and that stabilizes all of our communities with diverse populations. Socio- economic populations- I'm not talking about. So that strikes me as the right focus, at least as a suggestion for you with respect to what the housing committee would be doing as opposed to what Hhs may be doing, which probably will focus more on the kinds of supports available and how it is. We try to get people to accept those supports and how the outreach is conducted. Does that make some sense? I'm not sure I do not know because it's hard to find out, but the Bill Claire, for example. I know had for a very long time a number of rent- stabilized tenants in the building and they have a rent reduction in place. It's been in place for like 25 years. It's a freeze on the rent rate because of reduction in services- and I do not know what's happened to those people in the Belclair. They still seem to me like the housing committee should be, but they are still there. It seems to me the housing committee would be discussing long- range issues and Hss is doing immediate services. We can not construct housing, we can, but we can advocate for it, affordable, housing. I understand Susan. I think you're concerned that maybe these shelters have displaced long- term, rent stabilized tenants in some of the hotel buildings. I think they're still there in the bank right louise, I think you're correct I've heard from a few tenant association leaders actually in those buildings have been part of the Community Advisory Board meetings that were going on, so they did have a seat at the table. I do not think anyone was removed, but, like I hear your concern, I guess I guess. Personally, I mean I'm a member of the housing committee. I've not. I have not been invited to those meetings. I do not know, and you know you're just it's a frustration of not knowing what's going on, whatever those residents were not permitted to be their permanent residents they're, they can not be removed, and I know that I've seen residents from the Belclair that I know live there. I do not know about the Lucerne, but I think we, I think it's a fair question to ask, and I think Martin could ask it. I mean I know that I know that my building is not that you do not have enough to do Mark, but I know that in my building you know we face harassment from construction, and so I think in the belcher, for example, that could be a form of harassment to bring in a large group of people who need a lot of help that are not being given the help and whatever it's just it's a housing issue. Somebody else can I'm a member. It is that hosting issue, but I know at the belcher I've seen some of the residents that lived there and they still are there, I'm not familiar with the residents of Lucerne, but I think it's a fair question to ask. In particular, I'm a member of the Facebook group, Upper West siders from safer streets and I've read a lot of comments from people who are rent, stabilized tenants who live in these buildings and they're in peril because of what's happened to them: they're, rent, stabilized tenants who have been threatened by this influx of people, it's a housing issue. I hear you, I see the connection you're drawing I do not. I do not really want to entertain this here. I think this is a very difficult topic and it has been talked to death in our community. I it's a temporary situation. These people are not staying permanently at these hotels, the run stabilized tenants are not being forced to move out. You know if they feel that they're in an unsafe situation, like I'm sorry that it's really unfortunate. I do not think there's any stand for us to take here. You know, I think it's a public policy decision. The city has made to relocate people to those hotels, I'm not going to. I just. I do not have much to say beyond that. If I could just further to say that some of the rent stabilized tenants in the Lucerne were invited to one of these a small group, we can't call it a community advisory board but to the small group meetings to at least one of them and shared some of their concerns as well. That is definitely on the radar of the elected officials. As all of this moves forward, I do know there are a couple of hands in among the attendees, so whenever you're ready to address that, oh and I see Ira is waving his hand at me, and I switched. I switched computers. So hopefully I can finish this without this thing crashing on me. So I do not know if either of the comments I'm going to bring up have been discussed at all or not. I think at one of the previous housing committee meetings somebody brought up that some of the collegiate money was still out there and not committed to anything yet so with that said, I do not know the answer. Sorry nothing, but I thought we were discussing the DNS. So that's not really the DNS. You can use that money to purchase a small, SRO or makers for one of the non- profs project. Fine music project, fine, has been using some of that money. Wishfish has been using some of that money and I'm well aware of some of this. As you know, I spent many years working on the West fish project, which was my lead into the next one, it's at the three- year window and I'm and Shelley's not here to answer this. So that's unfortunate on my part, but the three three- year window on the second garage on 100 on the third side on the third garage on 100 a street is coming to a close where they said that was not going to be developed. So I just want to remind everybody that there is a piece of city land that is supposed to be available and in play for the previous euler is not that the phase two of the project Ira, it's not phase, two of the project. So if there's, I do not know if there's enough, because I'm not involved with that project anymore after having spent about 10 years of being involved with it. So I'm just saying for those of you who are in the know these days, getting some funding for that or helping support funding for that project certainly could be something that goes into our DNS yeah. That was a good point, part of the DNS, because the funding was in place and the reason that phase three phase two has not started is that they were not going to. They had made an arrangement with the community that they would not start phase two, I'm very well aware of that roberta, and I would- and I- and I was much I was as involved as anybody else was in that, though, on a different perspective than you. Okay, so please respect that. I do not hear any disrespect and I would like to echo what Melisa Melissa said at the top of the meeting, so it sounds like there is some Melissa. It sounds like you were amenable to having some mention of this in your section of the DNS. So let's accept that and move on yeah, and I think we should maybe just check in with HPD about like where things are. I think it's just not a bad idea to get a status update and I do not know whether that the second half was financed or not. So we can just double check that excellent, okay, great Doug and then we'll jump to the attendees, and this is just I'm just echoing with what mark said and also sensitive to it. Susan said I think we all agree that we have to preserve our affordable housing stock in many sub categories, including Mitchell, Llama and rent stabilization and rent control and Nitra and everything else. So you know it's, it is a broad stroke. You know, and it's very obvious and I'm sorry to bring up Melissa, which would I agree with you has been overtalked, but clearly that's we've seen very you know with a crystal ball now, just you know how housing is such a problem so yeah so for you know, preserving the stock and then building new stock and there's a lot of sub categories. That's all, I think yeah, I think. Definitely that's you know our starting spot, our centerpiece and I'll make sure that a few of you have mentioned. Mitchell, Lama, Senior housing will make sure that those are included. You just think that may be helpful just to inform the future I used to be on the Mitchell Task Force. I was the president of the Mitchell Initial, I'm a ta, and one thing is that buildings in Mitchell Llama that were constructed prior to 1975 by definition, are rent and stabilized and because of the rent laws. I believe that stock is a little bit more. Those that those that would be bought out have less of a likely to be likely to be bought out, because the incentive is not there as much financially because the housing stock can't be displaced now, because rent stabilization is kind of locked in with the state law, so the those buildings that would be built post 75, I think, are going to be a lot more vulnerable, okay, just to jump to attendees. I do not want you to feel like you're, not being heard I'll start with Megan Martin. Again, I'm just going to ask everyone to be respectful to your peers, to our colleagues to the community board, but go ahead, hi everyone! Thank you so much, I'm listening in and it's just been very informative, so one I just want to echo what Susan said that we also have heard that the rent stabilized tenants in the Lucerne and the Belclair they were not notified before the shelters were relocated to these hotels. So that was a deep concern of ours and I'm glad that this topic has been raised yeah. Actually, that is true. I can everyone that can see on zoom. So I just want to make sure that that's something that we all kind of are, as a community have been addressing and just that you know, since the topic was brought up, that you know, affordable housing is definitely something that I'm happy that you know it's being discussed here, but hotel, shelters and affordable housing are clearly not the same thing just this past week. Sadly, three deaths were occurred in the hotel shelters, something that very disturbing. So you know when we're talking about affordable housing. I just want to make sure everyone is not discussing them on the same line, and so that's just something. That's really important. Thanks all right. Thanks megan, I think we're all pretty aware of the difference between you know, shelter and affordable housing. Appreciate you still. You know ensuring we're thinking about that nuance as we put together our DNS, and you know I think, as Mark mentioned elected officials. Are you know, cognizant of and trying to advocate for the rights of the rent stabilized tenants, so Peter hi? This is Peter Arnstein with Columbus Amsterdam bid, and I've got a one comment that I stuck onto. The chat was about the ability to purchase buildings. It was done back a number of years ago by goddard Riverside of a building down in the, I believe, the 80s on the upper 80s and just looking at that as a model for creating more affordable housing that was under local control might be something worthwhile. We have three hotels that were not addressed when there was the whole hullabaloo about the Lucerne, and two of them are on West 107Th Street. One of them was mismanaged by department of homeless services, and just it contaminated a really good relationship with the Block Association, so that they have been very antagonistic ever since and distrust both help USA and the department of homeless services. Because of the way that was handled. So I would love to have the community board trying to re- establish a relationship there. I have one of my workers lives in the building. That's not was not part of that shelter, but was next door, and it has been just about emptied and has very difficult bad conditions, and it's some it's a mess. The other one that I'm concerned about is the hotel on Central Park West between 106Th and 107Th. I do not know what the options are or the possibilities are for that property, but I would hate to lose it to an if they if they decided to sell, because they could not keep things going. I would hate for that to happen without our having a chance to take it over yeah. I think you bring up something that I've been thinking about. A lot which is like, and talking with some of some of my friends about is: is there potential in this like horrific economic crisis, which has really crashed the tourism industry for the city to support non- profits in buying hotels and converting them to deeply affordable housing? And I think that would be a really interesting topic for us to take up. Maybe at a future meeting I will say that I I think that the Community board has a real role to play in mediating with local block associations, because department of homeless services has just proved to not be a good player in this yeah Peter. I think it's generally not in our domain, it's more in the Hhs Committee. I think they deal more directly with shelter issues more incorrectly if I'm wrong and also than in the district manager's realm, but that's correct, but melissa. If these could be, you know like a project fine or got a Riverside or wish fish. It then becomes affordable. It then becomes permanent housing which is different than a shelter right. I understand that I think Peter's making two points. I think one point was about poor shelter operations. If you could just let me finish: poor shelter operations that have really fractured a relationship with a community because of how DHS and the nonprofit ran the shelter and then the other idea is that if hotels were to be converted to housing, it would be great if local nonprofits could take the lead in doing that exactly and Peter. Maybe you and I can talk offline about the first of those things and I do not want to take the housing committee's time now to do that, but you're absolutely right that that's something that we could at least take a stab at and try to be useful. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to as a next step Lisa and I guess our role to work on the DNS for housing and try to circulate a draft quickly. I think the DNS sorry, the budget priorities can be quickly kind of like listed out, but the DNS is always more of a process all right and we might kind of delegate some. We have to upgrade some of the information, and so we may call on people like Doug. We might call on you for Mitchell Llamas, since you have that background yeah, because the information must have changed from the time that we first put it in two or three years ago. So that would be very good everybody. So you just signed yourself up for Mitchell section or my knowledge of Michelama when I was the active Ta was is dated, but whatever I can offer. Of course, I'm happy you'll have the contacts to be able to check things out, that'd be great whatever. I can absolutely okay with that. Unless there's any new business I'd like to Adjourn, but please I do not see any so if anybody wants to raise a hand about new business now's, the time Lord is yeah. I know I just have a quick question. How can I get in touch with roberta seemer, so I could ask some more about amson houses. Lord? Is you have my email right? I have you on Facebook. I do not recommend it. My email is, are you ready sure mark Okay, Diller, D-, I-, l-, l-, E-, r, okay, Cb, Numeral, seven, so Mark, Dillard's, Cv7, okay at gmail.com, okay, and so send me an email tonight and I will forward it to roberta and make sure that you guys get connected. Okay. Thank you mark. Thank you all. Thank you for the time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think if there's no other questions or needs, I'm going to adjourn us Louise. Thank you all good job. Okay, all right! Thank you. Stay safe.
