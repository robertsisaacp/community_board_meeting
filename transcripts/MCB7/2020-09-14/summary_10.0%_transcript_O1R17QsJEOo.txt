And I had a just a quick conversation about what could be a useful and helpful way to really recognize and perhaps answer some of the needs of the NYCHA community in cb7, and You know what they had done at fulton houses in chelsea, where they had formed a working group and though that was a slightly different situation, because that development was facing a series, of, I, think infills and new construction.
We still thought it's a helpful model so, and we also wanted to discuss just how we can get other stakeholders beyond NYCHA residents interested in you know, moving this forward and advocating on the issue.
This is all in the context of the blueprint that was released by NYCHA in I, think august, this sort of re-envisions, how like the corporate structure of NYCHA, could work and that they would form something similar to like the school construction authority that would manage the capital projects of NYCHA, so actually mark.
Webinar that I attended had a lot to do with the mechanics of it and how they see the implementation of their proposal, and they kind of acknowledge that there have been a lot of different proposals that have been made over the last several years and that this one seemed to have been first of all, a lot less radical than some of the others and also seem to have involved or contemplate the involvement of more direct input from the actual residents who live in night shift, facilities, both of which seemed like pretty good ideas to to go to go.
I think that a lot of folks have commented in previous of your readings how other NYCHA proposals dating back many years now were done offline and then were sort of presented, as opposed to a request for input to design, and they are they're.
It seems like, anyway, that they're looking for a more holistic approach that combines an opportunity for new jobs to be brought to the NYCHA community, along with energy efficiency and green building technology, along with the opportunity for having health services right there on campus and of course.
They had a good working relationship with them and they just developed an even stronger relationship, exactly yeah in new york, where you don't have that kind of relationship you might want Take on this, but it did seem like the blueprint was what was committing to or premised upon, having decisions being made at the local level at the as opposed to yeah, which sounds a lot like what you're describing with respect to cambridge as well.
Yes and then sorry, I, know, I asked this already, but maybe I missed the answer was there anything said about like implementation process if it is going to be more community and locally driven like what would that look, like?
The concern is that if you don't move people very far away because then they're not near their family It'll, be interesting to know if any of the ta presidents who were with us tonight, for example, have been approached by this or in connection with this or whether that's something that we can be useful in trying to make sure that happens at a local level, since they seem to be committing to or premising their initiatives on the local level who better than the than the folks right there in our district I also just want to make a comment before we open the floor.
I like greg rusk, because one thing he does is he listens and we are working diligently to make sure that these things are implemented in this in this public trust, fund.
We are talking to the congressman and you know looking into a lot of the stuff we making sure that they know what this partnership really looks like right, because everyone can talk about what they've done, but the people that live here actually know what's going on, and when you talk about protections we ought to know about our 964 regulations right, and so they need to look at that.
I. Think you make a few really good points about new york being a very different scale and like magnitude of issue, and also that we are confusing a bunch of different things.
If NYCHA can't be responsible enough to do right with the money they currently have and the repairs they are currently supposed to be making, why would you set up a public trust and hire the same crappy people to do the work, again?
Let's say they approve it That money gets put into a public trust that is going to be overseen by the bank of nycha's choice or greg russ's choice.
I think just make a brief statement to kind of return to our original theme, which was like what could be a helpful way to have this conversation or for us to have a better understanding of what's going on.
I think the last people we need to bring into the fold would be NYCHA itself, and so we would try to figure out from our perspective, who you know.
Now, meetings are not that important, but I think advocacy on behalf of what we're seeing that's, not good and asking for what we know is good We want to see elevators at work.
Just to as a jumping off point Like, you know, I think we can revisit that later on, but I would prefer to start with, like a working group.
These conversations and again this is meant to be like a working group kind of discussion format not like a meeting not like a town hall or something like that, and I, think you know linda's office and jerry's office.
I can to make sure that that's a productive conversation, great, And. Let's try to have that before the next housing committee meeting next month.
So then we have a little bit of time if we use it wisely to to make sure that we hear from the right people, Excuse me, grassroots, inspired, a list of prioritized concerns and then start working on how to make sure that each of those is addressed and figure out who will address which one roberta's point about making sure that the federal issue is covered here there are elected officials representatives on this zoom , so we don't need to reach out to the president's office to the council members office to the assembly member's office, because they're already here, but we can sort of we can.
I think that was to deal with some doors, not closing properly and security issues related to That Another was restoration of HPD funding for affordable housing.
We shouldn't release any funds until we know what the city budget is going to be because we're not getting any money from the federal government like we should so , I think they're just holding onto money just like that, their hoarding apartments that are empty.
I think it could still be helpful to include items in the DNS and then use that as a tool to push NYCHA to push our electeds to make sure the money is released.
You, know, I think we really have to look at housing as a right and really anything we can put in the DNS.
Okay, and the other thing is that I'd like to focus both the affordable housing and senior housing, which also works with the homeless population, because the people that I'm seeing on the street some of them are failing.
You know this the budget's going to be slim, this year, but there might be something that tac can tap into if the federal government ever passes a new stimulus bill and such that it could feed into okay susan, you had your hand up I felt like the comment he made about the homeless, situation.
But I think that the housing committee should be addressing this issue and should be discussing it.
I think we definitely want to include in our DNS that the importance of supportive housing, which is you know, affordable housing with embedded social services for generally homeless people who have special needs, so I think that's a way we can address it.
You know things like you mentioned, like ensuring we have a rent, stabilized stock, which serves as kind of naturally occurring, affordable housing, which can help prevent homelessness.
Perhaps differing opinions is that there needs to be more affordable housing available so that when people who are in shelter or who are otherwise ready to live independently can actually find a place to live that they can afford and that stabilizes all of our communities with diverse populations, socio-economic populations- That strikes me as the right focus, at least as a suggestion for you with respect to what the housing committee would be doing as opposed to what hhs may be doing, which probably will focus more on the kinds of supports available and how it is.
That was a deep concern of ours and So I just want to make sure that that's something that we all kind of are, as a community have been addressing and just that you know, since the topic was brought up, That you know, affordable housing is definitely something that I'm happy that you know it's being discussed here, but hotel, shelters and affordable housing are clearly not the same thing.
Think we're all pretty aware of the difference between you, know, shelter and affordable housing.
Don't want to take the housing committee's time now to do that, but you're, absolutely right that that's something that we could at least take a stab at and try to be useful.
