You know 20 expense and 20 capital trying to get a head start on that, because when Cindy goes to put the DNS into the website that the Department of City planning requires of us, it asks for the top three overall priorities, as well as budget priorities that we discuss later on.
This year, I had a just a quick conversation about what could be a useful and helpful way to really recognize and perhaps answer some of the needs of the NYCHA community in CB7, and we were all kind of inspired by You know what they had done at fulton houses in Chelsea, where they had formed a working group and though that was a slightly different situation, because that development was facing a series, of, I, think infills and new construction.
We still thought it's a helpful model so, and we also wanted to discuss just how we can get other stakeholders beyond NYCHA residents interested in you know, moving this forward and advocating on the issue.
I think that a lot of folks have commented in previous of your readings how other NYCHA proposals dating back many years now were done Offline and then were sort of presented, as opposed to a request for input to design, and they are they're.
It seems like anyway, that they're looking for a more holistic approach that combines an opportunity for new jobs to be brought to the NYCHA community, along with energy efficiency and green building technology, along with the opportunity for having health services right there on campus and, of course.
They also did that on in one of the other buildings about a different item where they wanted to have a little opening in one place, and the residents were not sure they liked it, so they fixed up one apartment, but they met regularly with the tenants And and they voted on solar panels.
I, think you start with the engagement process, because that's exactly where the design comes from right, I was going to ask.
They had a good working relationship with them and they just developed an even stronger relationship, exactly Take on this, but it did seem like the blueprint was what was committing to or premised upon, having decisions being made at the local level at the as opposed to yeah, which sounds a lot like what you're describing with respect to cambridge as well.
So I do not know if maybe they learned the lessons from the partners up north, but that, Was. There anything said about like implementation process if it is going to be more community and locally driven like what would that look.
The concern is that if you do not move people very far away because then they're not near their family, Now, I'm just trying to ask about the engagement process and whether NYCHA has put forward an idea for how that would look.
It'll, be interesting to know if any of the Ta presidents who were with us tonight, for example, have been approached by this or in connection with this or whether that's something that we can be useful in trying to make sure that happens at a local level, since they seem to be committing to or premising their initiatives on the local level who better than the than the folks right there in our district Before we open the floor.
So, with that, I, would love to hear from NYCHA tenant leaders, tenants whomever, especially if you have feedback on the process and whether you've been consulted, And I do not know if the two people who raised their hands already wanted to speak on.
We are talking to the congressman and you know looking into a lot of the stuff we making sure that they know what this partnership really looks like right, because everyone can talk about what they've done, but the people that live here actually know what's going on, and when you talk about protections we ought to know about our 964 regulations right, and so they need to look at that.
We just need to make sure that everyone is on board that everybody knows exactly what's going down right, because one may say one thing and another may say: another.
He was never in New York before this is his first time dealing with large city and we are on a scale that is nothing like Cambridge, so you're not going to get the small intimate quality of life that Cambridge has to offer here in New. York City believe that number one number two with pact, which is permanent, affordability, commitment, togetherness that they have slated just for Manhattan Well, that's currently undergoing pact, and they have had problem after problem after problem during Covid-19.
What makes you think they're going to want to fund section eight for the rest of their lives?
I think you make a few really good points about New, York being a very different scale and like magnitude of issue, and also that we are confusing a bunch of different things.
If NYCHA can't be responsible enough to do right with the money they currently have and the repairs they are currently supposed to be making, why would you set up a public trust and hire the same crappy people to do the work?
Let's say they approve it It's four times the amount for each apartment that money gets put into a public trust that is going to be overseen by The Bank of Nycha's choice or Greg Russ's choice.
So, the money goes into a public trust, but then the trust which would be the bank turns around and hires NYCHA to make the repairs and that's what people are not understanding.
I think just make a brief statement to kind of return to our original theme, which was like what could be a helpful way to have this conversation or for us to have a better understanding of what's going on.
I, guess at this point hearing from NYCHA and then having you in the same room, to also give your opinion and kind of like have that all happen in one place, as opposed to very fragmented conversation.
So I think those are important questions you know We've said this to you before meetings, the community board.
I think the last people we need to bring into the fold would be NYCHA itself, and so we would try to figure out from our perspective, who you know.
Now, meetings are not that important, but I think advocacy on behalf of what we're seeing that's, not good and asking for what we know is good We want to see elevators at work.
These conversations and again this is meant to be like a working group kind of discussion format not like a meeting not like a town hall or something like that, and I, think you know Linda's office and Jerry's office.
Okay, so then we have a little bit of time if we use it wisely to to make sure that we hear from the right people, Excuse me, grassroots, inspired a list of prioritized concerns and then start working on how to make sure that each of those is addressed and figure out who will address which one roberta's point about making sure that the federal issue is covered.
Do I know which the rad, the pat or the blueprint is my development on there, because we have not had meetings because of the whole pademic thing with my tenant president, Houses fall under and where do you live?
Our concern is that there would not be enough money to pay for all of the costs that are needed for repairs and work at Amsterdam houses got it well with the current real estate.
I think that was to deal with some doors not closing properly and security issues related to that Another was restoration of HPD funding for affordable housing.
Thanks: Cynthia was talking about releasing money which made it sound like the money was sitting there and that it was not a budget request to fund these kinds of expenses, but rather a problem that allocated funding was not being spent.
We should not release any funds until we know what the city budget is going to be because we're not getting any money from the federal government like we should so , I think they're just holding onto money just like that, their hoarding apartments that are empty.
I think it could still be helpful to include items in the DNS and then use that as a tool to push NYCHA to push our electeds to make sure the money is released.
You, know, I think we really have to look at housing as a right and really anything we can put in the DNS.
Okay, and the other thing is that I'd like to focus both the affordable housing and senior housing, which also works with the homeless population, because the people that I'm seeing on the street some of them are failing.
But I think that the housing committee should be addressing this issue and should be discussing it.
I think we definitely want to include in our DNS that the importance of supportive housing, which is you know, affordable housing with embedded social services for generally homeless.
You know things like you mentioned, like ensuring we have a rent, stabilized stock, which serves as kind of naturally occurring, affordable housing, which can help prevent homelessness.
Perhaps differing opinions is that there needs to be more affordable housing available so that when people who are in shelter or who are otherwise ready to live independently can actually find a place to live that they can afford and that stabilizes all of our communities with diverse populations.
I, think you're concerned that maybe these shelters have displaced long, term, rent stabilized tenants in some of the hotel, buildings.
I. Do not think anyone was removed, but, like I, hear your concern Personally, I mean I'm a member of the housing committee.
That was a deep concern of ours and So I just want to make sure that that's something that we all kind of are, as a community have been addressing and just that you know, since the topic was brought up, That you know, affordable housing is definitely something that I'm happy that you know it's being discussed here, but hotel, shelters and affordable housing are clearly not the same thing.
Thanks, megan, I think we're all pretty aware of the difference between you, know, shelter and affordable housing.
