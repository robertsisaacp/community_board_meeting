I just wanted to briefly go over this application. I want to make sure I have the correct number of pieces. I'll wait. We are. We are now okay, so the live streaming is now working. Okay, I'm not gonna. Let anybody in just yet and then we'll start recording as soon as we do. What were you? What were you? I just want to make sure I got all the parts to this application. There's a basement excavation, there's a stoop rebuild, there's a roof, new roof or additional roof and a rear edition right. So it's a rooftop edition and a rear yard edition, which is why it was referred to us generally speaking if they want one or the other, it can be approved at a staff level. These days, the just for benefit of anybody who watches this on playback, but not anything else. Oftentimes. I get worried about full width additions, but in this case it's not a b, it's aaa so by in filling hey match by in feeling the rear yard for a full width. Addition they're not creating a little alley next door because they're going right up against the existing l extension next door, so it's not as bad as it could be, as if the space was taken entirely taking. It was already sometimes yeah. Sometimes they create those little teeny slivers anyway, I'm gonna go get some water I'll, be right back great. To see you great to see you madge, you're, muted, unmute yourself. Can you unmute yourself, I'm trying to use my eyes instead of my phone, I'm getting bigger and bigger on this? Are you home? Are you at your sisters? No, I'm today how's your sister feeling no improvement. Oh I'm sorry to hear that yeah. But I've been away a lot, so that was fun banana yeah out of town. It just came back. Oh nice, yeah, very nice. It is so bustling. It's funny I left like 10 days ago. I came back and was more lively than it was 10 days ago. I know I know you did what cross streets do you live on? I live on 67th between the park in columbus, okay, oh yeah. It's crazy busy there, yeah and even with how much is how much of lincoln center is open at some point. Really at one point you couldn't get near the fountain area, but now you can, you know you can walk over there. I was actually on the phone today with the inter-gov person from lincoln center, and I understand better why they were closing it off now they had to furlough virtually all of their well a huge number of their employees, including most of their security, and so they can't in good conscience, leave the plaza unattended yeah. So I kind of understand it. Even though it's a it's a rotten shame, it's 6 27, I'm going to start the start, the recording and let people in so that the because, hopefully the presenters will be among the attendees okay great. I noticed we are recording in front of the museum of natural history. There are skateboarders, always right and I'm sure they'd be at lincoln center too. If it wasn't closed off, they sure are there. They are always at the columbus circle, fountain and thing so for sure. Hey king yeah, the side of dahmer's park side is open. You can go and sit around there around hammers park yeah and I think that they've got. I think they've got josie robertson, plaza open now too, it's just not by the the vivian beaumont and all that yeah back to with the committee tonight. We're gonna be we won't have doug or josh susan will be here for an hour and we won't have peter so that leaves jay susan should be here in a second and the three of you, yeah I've asked paige to join us. No, I didn't. I of course welcome her, but she asked, but she asked you right. No, I wrote to her. I said to her. This is what's going to be in front of the committee when I knew that peter it was unlikely peter would be here. I mean I guessed a couple of hours ago. I asked her what she had to say about this application. Okay, only one right, just one, but it's got four parts. So it's a little confusing because some of it some of the stuff they on the plans, has already been approved by landmarks. It's over. This is and do we have anything to do with the basement excavation. It would be something that we would include in our resolution for sure yeah. I see that sean corsandi has joined us, hi, sean and I'm sorry, I'm not sure. I see chris mindzyuso excuse me men's useful. That's close enough! Sorry, and that's all right. Are you a a neighbor or are you a presenter? I am an architect for the project very good. Then I'm going to make you a panelist, so we can see as well as hear you yeah I've. I asked paige. I don't know if she'll appear or not, but I made the overture she'll be welcome hello paige's place. Oh no, I think they're just coming yeah, okay, I'm just gonna! I'm just gonna, promote everybody, hey susan and asoph drawer. Are you a part of the project or are you a community member? Can you help me? I am actually the owner of the property. How are you it's my time to meet? You I'm gonna, make you a panelist too, then everybody's all in the room. Of course, you don't have to turn. Your sean has a very interesting screen image I yeah as one who grew up with lots of lego around the apartment. I completely appreciate the self style minifig. It was a 3d printing. I got done very nice, very nice good to see you sean. I didn't know: legos drank coffee but or whatever that is whatever they can get. Yeah. Okay, one two, three four we're just waiting on jay right yeah! I haven't heard that sorry, we're also waiting on jackie. She is the consultant where my consultant who's presenting us as well here today, very good. She was helpful in getting me the the materials that I could in a way that I could access them so mark. Is there anybody else in the queue? There is no one else in under attendees, okay, so we're just waiting on jay. So I've been working on my zoom lighting, everybody whenever they take the pictures and put the pictures in the hollywood squares and west side rag, I always look orange any tips. Do I? The wrong kind of light bulbs only that I've seen on late night, television that they actually now sell a thing. You can clamp onto the back of your laptop and it has sort of a light that will create the image you want for it and you can do it like mood lighting like you can come up here, blue if you want to be scary or flesh tones. If you want that, and so the Covid-19 is now spawned yet another cottage industry is the short answer, see madge your lighting looks really nice. You look like a nice healthy glow. I always look like I ate too many carrots. You look great! Oh! I just have oh one lamp in here a little. Where is it in front of you? It's in front of me right. It's convenient as convenient as the zoom is. Hopefully we won't have to worry about the lighting too much longer and we'll be able to meet in person, even though it is convenient, I'm still, I'm still hoping that we'll be able to meet in person. It's gonna be a long time, hey good evening, jess, hello, all right kay! You want to do this. I think they're waiting for jackie are you waiting for jackie yeah. She should be on any section. I don't know what you're doing here. She is okay. Here she is okay, so I will be the guy who will put up your screen when you're responsible when you're ready and with that I'll shut up and give it to the chairs of the committee, who are michelle, parker and kay carpenter. Okay, you want to unmute yourself would be good. Oh welcome, thanks for being here. Our purpose as a preservation committee is to consider the appropriateness of the proposed changes or alterations, and then our role with the landmarks commission is advisory. We give our opinion. They often listen, sometimes don't, and so we're very eager to hear about this project you're the only project in town for us tonight, so you have our somewhat undivided attention and the rest of the committee members want to just introduce yourselves click hi, michelle parker co-chair with kate carpenter, madge, rosenberg, steve you're, the committee susan schwartz jay adult, and we have another board member with us paige. You need to unmute yourself hi. There paige thanks for being here and then, of course, our chair mark yeah, just for reference for the folks who are joining us. I am not a member of this or actually any committee except steering so and paige is a member of the board, but not of this committee, so they will take two separate votes whenever that time comes, so don't think that it's in that we're saying anything about your project by not voting when the committee votes all right. So it's your show tell us what you got great ready to begin. Let's see is chris here: can he share his screen or do we need to bring him to chris unmute yourself, chris? Okay, wonderful, so does everyone see the presentation? Yes, okay, wonderful, so hello! Members of the committee, my name is jackie puduvalin, I'm the preservation consultant on the project, I'm here tonight with chris mensuso of graso mensuso, architects and a soft drawer who's, the owner of the property. Thank you for hearing our application tonight. We really appreciate your time and and also just thank you for continuing to serve our city during this difficult time. Thank you, jackie. Let me just I'm sorry: let me just interrupt quickly. Is there somebody able to take minutes? Did we take care of that michelle it'd be good to have somebody do that for us I'm going to take minutes. Okay, great michelle! So sorry, no problem, it's all right, so this project is 26 west 95th street, which is an 1890s row house which stands on the south side of the street between central park, west and columbus avenue. The proposal you're seeing tonight is for the installation of a straight stew, a rooftop edition, a three-story rear edition, with a deck and stair and rear yard. Excavation now, in the 1920s, the facade of this house was stripped recently lpc issued a permit to restore the front facade of the house. That's why you're seeing that in this elevation, drawing here on the left and then also farther to the left, you see the house in its current condition and next to and the next two images you see are the existing rear, facade and the proposed rear facade all right next slide. Please page two, I'm sorry what was lpc's previous role in this project. They have already issued a staff level permit for restorative work at the front facade so, in other words, recreating and brownstone stucco. All of the details that were originally on this house, great okay, so the the facade work that they've approved is represented by this proposed north elevation. Yes you're, seeing that here because you know we need to show you existing and what's proposed and what you're always yes, we're glad that you did. I great I just want to know if it accurately runs. Yes, that's great. I was there for a visit this afternoon and the house presently really stands out on the block and it's going to be a nice yeah, nice chair right. I should point out on this elevation what you're, also seeing in addition to the facade work, that's already been approved, you're, seeing the straight stoop, which is not approved by lpc, yet, which is what we're part of what we're showing you here tonight, and you also see the rooftop edition in you know in these two elevations, okay, so page two, please and here's the house's location in the northern end of the historic district. As you see outlined on the map and also photos of what the rest of the south side of the block look like when you're looking west and looking east next slide, please- and here are photos of the north side of the street, which is characterized by row. Houses with a variety of revival. Styles next slide. Please, and here are some historic photos to give you some background. Unfortunately, the 1930s tax photo was the earliest photo I could find of this house, so we don't have a photo of its original condition. However, all the historic documentation and the designation report from the landmarks commission cites that it was originally obviously built as part of this row with what you're, seeing in the middle photograph, which is 28, 30 and 32 west 95th street. So originally it had a facade, pretty much identical to number 30., so the one in the center, which meant it also originally had a box stoop, and currently we do have a permit from landmarks to restore a box stoop, but there's a wrinkle so I'll get to that next slide, please. So basically, we were we've been told that we need to now ask landmarks to consider installing a straight stoop because there's an issue with ada compliance on the sidewalk. If there's a box stoop installed, where there's also a tree pit right in front of this house, so so there's not the right, I'm sorry! This is not the right one! It's okay! I'm getting! There! Don't worry about it! Well, okay, why don't you look at these details? Let me know if you have any questions I'll move to the next slide, which assaf is right, explains it more clearly, but, as you can see, there'd be a rustication on the side of the stoop and a straight. You know a straight run. So in these two images you can see that what's currently proposed, which is the straight stoop and the proximity of the tree pit and next to it on the left, you see the box stoop, which we actually have a permit from landmarks for, but found out after the fact would not comply with me with necessary ada clearance requirements because of the location of the tree pit. So and all this really only came to light late last week early this week, we realized we had to come up with a different strategy because it was you know have. This was all coming up very quickly. That DOT was letting us know they couldn't approve the stoop installation because of the proximity of the tree, the tree pit, and then that meant reaching out to the parks department who regulates the tree, pits and parks department, basically saying it would take a lot of effort and probably a lot of expense to move this tree pit. So for that reason, parks department has encouraged us to apply to the landmarks commission for a straight stoop which would restore the presence of a stoop on the building but at the same time allow the necessary five foot ada compliant clearance on the sidewalk. So again, what we're currently proposing is the plan drawing you see on the left next slide. Please now, let's transition to talking about the rooftop edition, so this is second place. I'm sorry! Yes, did you promote doug as a panelist he's here and while we've paused, you have a better drawing of that straight stoop from the front? What it would look like, can we go back? Can we just go backwards? I'm sorry miss that's! Okay, one! Second, I'm sorry! I can't see the panelists when we're sharing the screen, because otherwise you'd see my share of the screen thing. So thanks for letting me know that doug is here. I am promoting him to panelists now and then I'll go back to sharing my screen. Okay, sorry, no problem! So I'm sorry, someone had a question about what the stoop would look like. Can we go back? Why don't we go back? Two slides go back to page five? Okay, so here, hopefully this answers your question. So if you look at the bottom, elevations east elevation and west elevation, that gives you the you know, details for the stoop. Also, if I may jackie page number one gives with the with the front facade profile, she has the whole stupids as well she'll, be able to see exactly what it looked like on the building. Looking straight onto the building, yes yeah, looking straight on, if you could go yeah page one she'll be able to see it, so this straight stoop would be articulated with the same details as the box stoop. It would just be straight rather than a box as it was original, so it would have rustication on the side. It would have this raised panel, which you know follows the line of the steps, the same articulation of the newel post. Should I go on to a rooftop edition? Yes, okay, can we go to slide seven please. So here you see in just close-up elevation. The rooftop edition viewed from this partial north elevation, rooftop edition would be a little over 10 feet tall and then have above it a glass railing with a stair bulkhead behind next slide, please how what's the height with the stair bulkhead, the stair bulkhead is an additional nine feet so just to clarify, if I may, none of this is visible from the street or any angle industry. This is not visible. You want. This is not visible to anyone on the street. This is set back in a way that nobody will be able to see it. Yes, you'll see that later in the presentation we have documentation on that. Okay next slide, please. So here is just the plans, so existing roof plan on the top in the middle is the new rooftop additions plan and then the roof plan showing the location of the bulkhead on top of it on the bottom next slide, please, this is the existing roof looking north and south, and the axon on the left is to show you the massing of the addition and at the roof and at the rear. Next slide. Please here are the rooftop edition in sections, so the top is just a section through the existing roof and on the bottom. Is the proposed just to show you the outline of the edition next slide. Please now here is the rooftop edition that was constructed shown from the roof. I have to say it looks really nice. This is one of the nicest rooftop mock-ups I've ever seen next slide. I was going to say that myself, I've never touched it. You could close it up and that's your addition right. I know that was done. You guys have done me proud. Thank you. So now here is just the mock-up visibility photos showing you in the key plan showing you where these photos were taken from and demonstrating that this rooftop edition is not visible from the street next slide. Please and now, let's talk about the rear addition, so there's an existing three-story l. The proposal is basically to square that off and have a three-story full-width edition. I apologize since we're going now to the rear edition. Can you talk on the rooftop edition, the materials? And? Oh yes, good questions? Okay, let's go back to so we can do it one at a time. Okay, let's see where's she. So it's going to be just clad and stucco, because that's a typical, more utilitarian material to use for a rooftop accretion, something that will you know, look like something you typically see in the roofscape. There will be glass railings, there's a glass railing on top of the addition, then the bulkhead itself would have cement stucco as well see. Does that answer your question? Well, it's stucco and what color I'll be matching the brownstone matching the brown just a dark, so it's a dark yeah, a dark brown and just quickly the location of any windows doors. Yes, there are windows. Well, glass door is located at the front of it, which you can see partially in this elevation, and why don't we go to the rear elevation slide advance to which page? Let's see we won't see it here? Actually, no, actually, no I'm sorry. We do see it here. What am I saying so at the back? It's no wait. No brick is that correct, we're showing brick at the back of it as well stucco in the front brick in the back, so we're showing brick up to the fourth floor. One two, three four. I guess we're showing brick also on the fifth floor fifth floor as well. That may be a mistake by the way jack. I'm not sure I think we've been so consumed with the stoop this week, though I think so. We forgot to question this yeah. So it's where it says that it's a brick on metal wall, that's not accurate, I'm not sure if it's gonna be brick or metal wall or it's gonna be stucco chris. I think that you're gonna have a problem with brick on the metal wall. Am I correct? I mean there are a lot of ways to deal with that detail. It's a question of what the product is going to be acceptable and we can make it work so, okay, I can make it away. This was I can make it work either way, it's what's going to be acceptable. If the committee, if the committee has any strong opinions on the cladding for the rooftop edition, we would be, we would welcome hearing it. I mean all things being equal. I mean just the personal preference. I prefer a brick to stucco. Okay, I would say we often like the top edition to you know stand out as an edition, but in this case the brick might be a better solution. I mean typically, as I'm sure you know, the landmarks commission typically asks applicants to articulate an addition and a different material to make it stand out from the body of a building yeah, I mean it, you know if you, if the committee feels it's appropriate, we could definitely keep it as brick at the rear stucco in the front. My concern is that, well I don't know I mean I guess. If it's not visible, it doesn't really matter what it might look like from the street, but well you're, restoring you're, restoring the facade, yes as a brownstone. Yes, so a stucco in the color of brownstone would be, in my opinion, less articulated than brick. Yes, so in that sense I echo what k said and what landmarks always says what they is. They like a new edition to be recognizable as a new addition and contrasting materials. So you asked what our preference would be. I can only speak for myself. The difference here is that it it looks like the entire rear facade will be considerably altered, and so that makes me think about it in a slightly different way, and that looks like it's going to be brick right at the rear. I mean yes, you'd have the new three-story full-width edition, then you'd have the fourth story: rear facade, left alone, leaving that brick undisturbed and then and then have brick at the rear of the edition. So you know if you have any comments about leaving it as brick at the back. Please let us know there's nobody from the community on this issue, because there are people from next street over we'll be looking at this right. Anybody who backs up on the donut might have a thought, but I don't think there's anybody here. Paige. Do you have any comment about that? I have comments on each topic. I wanted to hold my tongue until you guys had asked your initial questions, and some of mine have been built on things that your committee have already raised. So I have six parts, six questions. If you don't okay anyway, thank you for inviting me to my lending committee. Thank you mark, okay, so for the scoops I've had this problem before and there's more than one way to get around D.O.T. If you could go to group issue, sorry are we done with the with the with the presentation, or should we yeah? We haven't, you know we haven't. Actually we haven't gone through what's happening at the rear? Let's let me go at the end. Okay, my final request is before you go on to the rear yard edition. Just give us the the height depth and square footage of the rooftop. Okay, the height of the occupiable space portion of the addition, would be ten foot four inches and then there would be a nine foot, stair bulkhead above that, okay and how many square feet is the new edition. The proposed edition, maybe chris the architect, can answer that. I don't know. Let me see if I can get you that information give me a moment sure I don't know if we have square footages on these plans, while he's working on that should I should we just advance- and I just show you the you know the rear yard excavation the changes? Okay, so, okay, so here's just some more photos to give you context so, where you're, seeing the gentleman standing on the top of the l, that is, that is the house in question: you're, looking at the rear facade in the upper half and lower half on either side of these either side of the page. Next slide. Excuse me and looking at the view from standing on top of the rear, l, looking east and west next slide looking into the donut. Of course, that's all foliage right now. So it's hard to see what the backs of the neighboring houses look like. But on this slide I would like to point out that in the photo on the left, which I think that is maybe that's 40 or 41- I'm not sure what the address of these this is. But where you see this, where it looks like there's two houses that have been unified? Yes, where he's circling? Thank you. This house has well both houses, in this view, have sizable rooftop additions, but also within the green space. You have what looks like to me a one-story rear edition that spans both backyards. I'm assuming this house is inside at the interior, serves as one building because it has a rooftop edition. That's but spans both houses also, but it's just interesting to me that there is a rear yard edition that is built from the lot line and going in and not actually connected to the rear l's of those houses and that's obviously relevant for us, because we're proposing a rear edition right nearby next slide. Please now. These are just historic maps to show you how the site has how this block has changed over time. So you're, looking at the 1902 sanborn on the top 1951 sandborn on the bottom next slide, please 1980 sanborn on the top and 2005 sanborn on the bottom next line, and this is the current block plan where you can see highlighted in purple the existing one-story editions that are in the block the locations of well. You can see them at really either end of this side of 95th street. There was a recent two-story edition approved at number six and, at the other end of the block at number 44. There's a three-story addition, full width very similar to this project, approved at number 44 west 95th street. I also want to point out that there were also recent rooftop editions approved on this side of the block, which you see highlighted in the red, the red hatching on top of the buildings, including at number 34. That edition has been approved. That was a c of a that was issued within the last month or two. So my point in showing you this blog plan is that there have been recent additions within the last few years for full-width editions within this block and also rooftop editions next slide, please. This is just a section giving you the sight line, also another demonstrating again that from across the street, you would not see this rooftop edition next slide, please. This is just seller plans. Next slide basement plan. There will be extension of of the landscaping, I should say hardscaping in the rear yard. Next slide. There will be some excavation associated with this, so you can see that highlighted by the color coding in this in these two plans next slide- and this is just the condition of the existing rear yard next slide- and this is our final slide just to end on being able to show you the proposed front. Elevation proposed rear elevation and the axon that shows you the massing of the additions. So should we go back to the question of how many square feet is the rooftop edition about 650 square feet? 650.? Okay, now, should we do paige's questions hi, paige, nice, to see you? If I can, since paige herself said she wanted to be last okay I'll try to use up, you mentioned hardscape in the in the rear yard and over the over the years. Our committee has always encouraged as much green space as possible and where, where it's not pure green space, trees, plantings, etc, permeable surfaces. So can you elaborate a little bit as to what the plan is for the rear yard? Well, really just to pave the entire thing in blue stone. We can. We can reconsider that since the owner's right here we can talk about that. My wife would definitely not just approve. If I decided to just blue stone, she would definitely want planters around and plants around for sure. We now live in the suburbs and green is very important to us. Obviously, you know with within the maintenance issue, it's very difficult to maintain cutting grass and things of that nature in the rear yard. However, we will have planters around and definitely greenery around, just not just blue stone. Have you considered, I mean there are there are, and maybe paige can help me out on this. There are stone. You know based surfaces that are more permeable than just solid blue stone, and I haven't considered that no jay could you consider it please sure, like what would you suggest grass and a weed whacker grass will be more difficult for me to maintain I'll, be very frank with you, but maybe a smaller section of planting. I think was that a bigger section of planting that I would consider, I think, a very typical formation of rare yards. I know my I live in a I live in a high rise building, but the rear of my apartment looks out on a doughnut with several between west end and riverside with the backyards and several brownstones, and at least a few, the ones I can see several have hardscape, but around the perimeter. You know they have a border. If you will, I don't know I I'm guessing. You know three or four feet of plantings, some trees, which that I would definitely consider absolutely. I would do planting around the perimeter for sure. I would consider that. Well, that's good! I mean that's helpful and I frankly, I think it enhances the property and makes your neighbors happier makes us happy. Also yes. Well, I appreciate it. It's good that you would consider that. Thank you anything else from the committee questions from more questions from jay or anybody else from the committee. I think I'm. I think I'm good no questions for me. Okay, I have a non-any, maybe a little unconventional. You said that the additional total addition is 650 feet. Obviously, that's doug. Can you turn up your volume? Oh yeah. Can you hear me now? That's a little better, I'm sorry! No! This is just maybe an unconventional question, but I know you're as adding 650 square feet to the addition. Do you do you know what the total cubic square footage is to. You know obviously got the footprint of 650. at 650 square feet. Yes, 650 square feet is the footprint. What is the cubic square footage? I would not yeah I can I can get about 6500. I think the question jugg is asking really is: what's the what's the ceiling height because we know 10 4 is the is the height the overall height, but some of that's going to be structural right yeah. So what's the ceiling height inside the edition, so probably somewhere around nine and change, okay, yeah that makes sense to nine times, 650 right! Okay, thank you all right. Should we go to page if everybody else is, okay, she'll probably raise some things that we want to know about anyway. Paige tell me what where you want to go to the first slide with the stoop on it, please I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but this is what I got that's good for me, and I also want to thank the applicant for being so thorough with the comparisons. It's really very difficult to follow these, and it makes my job easier to comment. Thank you. The first thing is about the student and I and I appreciate the angst and tribulations of D.O.T but being a preservationist in new york. You have to deal with them as gently as you do with the landmarks commission, but there may be a way before you decide on changing this stoop to respect the original architects, neville and bags original design, and by way of three questions, did you do a tally of all of the buildings of the brownstone buildings on this block, both sides of the street that still had the stoops, and we we're in process we're in process of that this issue just came to a head really late last week and the determination was just made early this week and then the drawings were just completed literally today to be able to show this to you today, but we do intend to do a survey of both sides of the block to include in the in the hearing presentation. We just didn't have time to do it for tonight. Okay, because some my experience has been that if you demonstrate that your incursion on the sidewalk is no greater than anyone else, they can't deny you because we're doing a restorative building and my problem with this is that all the care that you've taken to put the detail back, even though it's going to be stucco and not rebuilt brownstone, it's a cheat because you're not actually restoring this building yeah. It's not it's. Definitely not our preference, it's not our preference, but I just wanted before you go on. I just want to tell you that we did make this decision in consultation with senior staff at landmarks, who encouraged us to take this route and see what would happen at public hearing. Basically right, that's their prerogative, I'm not a member of the commission. I just know that our street, I have a brown stone on 88th street with the box dude and I wouldn't be able to remove it even though it's falling down my co-owner can't pay for it. It's going back in a narrow spot and it's not the only brown stone in new york that has that condition. So I find it unusual that, with all the effort and the money and the time that the owner is putting into this building that you're not making one last try to be able to make it work and the way you can make it work is frankly tighten up on the dimension of the landing. It doesn't need to be as big as you have drawn. It. That's one way that you can minimize. If you look at your own drawing you have the the one on the right first floor, proposed in large scoop. Instead of going sorry, you had one that had the stoop dimension on it, the dog leg box, one. Where is that right? There you go! So if you look at the dimension five foot ten for the upper part to the bottom step, and then you have six foot two. You can actually narrow that six foot two to create the extra foot and three inches that you need and also since it's a replication as long as you follow the profile of the knee wall and I'm assuming it will probably have railings on either side, because these two new walls tend to be low. It's a much better idea. You also don't need the wide landing pad as it were, as you enter to that first step. So it's only a suggestion, but I've seen this work in the past and on the east side with you a hundred by the way, I'm the only assistant. How are you I agree with you? Our preference was and still is the box too. The problem is we and by the way it was approved with the box stupid landmarks initially, because that was our intention. Still is our intention. However, senior people at landmark have spoken to senior people and probably one of the head people, the department of transportation regarding this matter and parks, department and landmarks and parks department and the parks department as well correct. I'm here I'm here to offer advice and I'm here there's a way and they're, not the department of parks and landmark and transformation are not the landmarks commission. There are ways that you can get have your casing. Enough said that you're on yeah, your suggestions, I you know, I don't have an expertise in the compliance but you're summing it up you're, saying that there is a way to do it so that it so that it comes out to be compliant because that's a statutory requirement. It is, but you parks department does give waivers. I've done many buildings on madison. Do they have the authority to waive ada compliance right? It's not! You can't no, not waive this design. You have to change it so that you have the passage that is a ada accessible. Okay, that's what I thought. So that's why I'm suggesting modify by squeezing these the lower staircase narrow, because they don't have to be that big and this I've seen this in greenwich village in all sorts of places. If you provide when there's a room, you're correct. However, here we don't have enough, you create the room, because I think it's more even by amazing, even by going ahead and actually making that stoop a lot lower, you a lot smaller, you cannot. They are very strict about the five foot clearance. They will not allow it less than five feet. They told me that when I spoke to the head of the department of transportation, as well as the head of parks department, as well as landmarks, that one of the heads at landmarks, they all said to me, unfortunately that because of the location of the tree in you know, in with the stoop, it is too close, and even if we modify this two, unfortunately, the only way to modify it will be will be very small. It will not be. It will not be a real stupid point in time, any longer a box tube. It would be approximately two and a half feet as opposed to 60.2 feet and that's for me, that's not expensive. You you're not listening, but that's, okay. I I'm going to put this in my statement. You can choose to ignore it, but I there are ways and DOT will work with you. If you reach the right people can we move on, because I have some other concerns: go ahead paige, so the other one is the rooftop edition and frankly the setback in the doughnut and again he went to a great deal of trouble to point out all the modifications and track the width and type. But my concern with this roof composition and the rear edition is that I believe when I looked at the mapping on a different map, not yours, because I tried to do some homework before there are only at least three buildings in the donut that have the very large build out. Everything else is a dog leg: either left or right or paired. Could we talk? Can we go to page 19 please? So everyone can see what she's talking about. Thank you. No, I appreciate it there you go that one. If you look at the doughnut is relatively intact with the space, because these yards are only 30 feet deep and then there's usually 18 or 12 feet for these smaller additions and when you start closing them up, given the fact that okay, the building on, I think it's 29 and 27 that have done this super mansion trick. All the other ones are very diminutive and what they do is they allow light and air to get to the properties. So my concern is with the because when one person does it, it starts a whole rush for everyone to start expanding it, and I think, even if you are gonna expand it, I have problems with it, going all the way to the rooftop and if we can go to next to the elevation that proposed of the rear yard. No, the addition would not. It would not disturb. The top story. Is that is that what you're saying it would be three stories and then right with the terrace on two of those floors which have terraces, and then you have the setback with another terrace, and then you have a rooftop with another terrace, but no construction only to access, I'm assuming the recreation area and the bulkhead for the lift right, the elevator. That's the only thing on the top, as well as maybe mechanical equipment. There's no scout! There's there isn't. There is no shaft. No, there is no elevator to the staircase, nothing else that is for the staircase. Okay. That was not made clear anyway. I and then I think here you went to a great deal of trouble to argue for brick, even though I know landmarks doesn't always or used to always specify a less noble material for the rooftop edition, but in this case you're doing a restoration and a continuation of a facade that carries its original, I'm hoping that you're and because I know that you're having to replace all the windows and shift them they're not going to be the way they currently are. I'm correct. You have them aligned on the lower three floors with the two, the new windows, I'm sorry, the new doors to the backyard and your turrets, and that is adding an enormous amount of bulk and, frankly, glass is very reflective. When it's used like this as a as a barrier and I'm concerned, I don't know what the neighbors will think or what they, the people living directly across the way, but it can be an environmental issue for the rest of the block to have that- and I also question as to whether or not the rooftop edition needs to be so all four. What is it three floors, not just the bottom two at least that keeps it lower and not and the sight line down the rear, doughnut, a rear yard doughnut is more or less preserved. I think the other questions my colleagues have answered, oh and for the front, and the back since this will be south facing. Are you planning to put awnings on these windows and the doors at the on the rear, facade? No okay, and for the front facade? Are you planning to put security grills? No just only work, every word exists, there's an existing security grill in the basement level, it's being shown the only one that's existing and the cautionary tale owning the a brownstone where we do have the clear yard. Is that make sure you have adequate drainage because in disturbing the ground, you're going to need not only the main sump or drain in the center, but an overflow, because your neighbors will not think kindly when your backyard starts to overflow into theirs, because they have more press from what I could peek into the most of everybody's rear yards. Have the perimeter very narrow planting with the perimeter pavement in the middle is grass or some other local piece, so we would do we will have an overflow drain in the backyard they're going to be two drains one regular drain, one overflow drain? Okay, because that's important! Yes, as far as far as I'm around your backyard, it's go. It's going to be very similar right now. You can see a fence in the backyard. Now I believe it's going to be very that's the neighbor's yard, we're just going to basically put a fence on our side in the same height. I know, but it's that the picket one or the one that is much taller I would I would I would go with the picket height. I would not go with a much total one that needs a variance to be able to get that height you'd rather have no yeah. That's too high. For me, six feet is the maximum permitted height yeah right. I would go that's what I would do. Okay, thank you. No problem and they're still clarified to the board with regards to the 30-foot setback that 30-foot setback will only occur after the extension. Is there right now there's more than a 30-foot step back once the extension is built, then you'll have a 30-foot setback in the backyard and just to clarify to the board as well 44 west 95 has that was approved and built almost an identical proposal, proposition to what I'm saying with reference to the rear yard and the rooftop edition, and that was done very recently and that's at 44. West 95th report, yeah and I'd just like to. I would like to thank paige for her very thoughtful comments. As usual, it's nice to see you again paige, it's been a long time, hi. With regard to your concerns about the rear yard edition, I hear what you're saying about the importance of maintaining rear l's and retaining that type of interior blockscape, where there are a predominance of rear l's, but I would say that this is not a case where you have a pristine interior block. The commission has already approved full-width editions, there's some other incursions of additions within the block and we're also not going to be diminishing, really the light and air for the neighboring houses. By doing this addition, because it's not going to extend farther than the existing rear l, it's just really going to be squaring it off. So it will. You know if any, if anyone's going to lose light and air, it's this own house's backyard in terms of yeah. The other question was while you're describing this. Are you making any windows in the party walls of the new edition? No, that's never been a consideration. No great, thank you, okay. I think I think that's it for my comments. Does the owner of the architect want to share anything else? I thank the boards for their time. I really do. Thank you so much for everything and yes, thank you for your time. Questions. Okay and michelle. Didn't the description include an excavation yeah. I thought so that's only for the rear yard. We it's! The commission has to approve the change in grade at the rear yard. So that's why we included those plans at the toward the end of the presentation. So there are one two three four five different parts to this application. If I may well the straight stoop the rooftop, the straight stoop, the rooftop edition rear edition excavation in the back. Oh, I have basement excavation the basement. That was that was a mistake that was taken off because it's really going to be a crawl space. It's not really going to be excavating to a point where the commission has to make it part of a hearing review okay, but there is a rear yard, excavation, okay. So one two three: how deep is that? How does it really contribution? So it's really three parts that we have to consider: the stoop, the rear yard and the rooftop. How deep is that rear yard excavation and the straight stew right christine, is and also the rear extension? Yes yeah. I really think of it as four things, but whatever we'll get there whatever, when I said rear yard, I meant rear yard. Yes, sorry, I apologize it's okay, I should have been more so can we get an answer to this question? How deep is the excavation in the rear yard yeah? I would like I'd like chris to address that. Give me a moment. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, give you that answer. Okay, thank you. Okay, thumbing through the slides with respect to the real yard excavation, is solely a change in grade. Yes right, that's correct, yeah, okay, so 105, let's see changing grade. I think we better add a section to the presentation for this yeah, because we see we see sorry, you sorry mark. Can you add the staircase from the second level down to the rear yard, because that's not shown in your diagram, the axonometric. What's on the accent, I didn't see it, but maybe I'm blind no you're right. It should be there. Okay, oh say that again, I'm sorry on the proposed south elevation. You see the staircase coming down. Yes, but it's yeah, because there's a setback and the and the ground floor in the rear yard sticks out more and then you have the staircase to the halfway point or whatever it was. I can't remember the plan, but it sticks out on the. I guess it would be the west side of the you know the east side of the building right: okay, paige. What you're saying is that this should be considered separately. No, I just want to make sure that it's included in the presentation, because the axonometric doesn't conform to the rear edition that shows in paris. Yes, there's no place on the second floor that prescribes step back to the terrorists. Okay, thank you. Good! We're gonna have to cut a section to give you those exact numbers with respect to that that excavation, because I I need to see the existing elevation is roughly 105.32 and we're going to bring it back up to 105.32, but I'm going to have to excavate down to get proper curves in there and proper drainage, obviously and pitch. So I really need to cut a good section in there to get that final answer for you, based on these drawings, I'm looking at now. Okay, we sometimes see proposals that include swimming pools underneath the rear yard. That's not what you're doing don't give anybody any ideas mark what happens after all right. I can't tell you buddy how about if it's only grass around the we'll pool in a lawn mower for you [Laughter] somebody else had a question. I had a comment. If somebody has a moment please, I just thought that that the fenestration on the top floor and then on as I'm as I'm viewing it. I assume this is the rear yard of dish, the rooftop edition, the rear yard part of it. It would look so much more in keeping with the usual run of these things in rear yards if the, if the post, I'm sorry if the lentils were were all in the same blind and even better if they lined up with the building next door on either side, I can't tell from the way it's presented whether they are whether they're intact. That way and then again here I assume one of these is a door and the other two are windows. It just would seem more unified and more in keeping with the usual rear yard presence to have that lined up in some kind of way, whether it's increasing this or decreasing that I'm not sure. Well. If I sorry, if I'm understanding your question correctly with that, can I just test for understanding? Are you saying that at the fourth story, with the top floor of the existing building, you'd want to see the you'd want to see the lintels you would you would want to see the lentils lining up yeah on the top? Yes, I would want to see the lentils lining up, because the terrace is going to obscure the bottom of them, so creating a door out of one of those window. Openings is something we see quite frequently, but generally we make an effort to keep the especially the top plane, which is, I assume, going to be coplanar with the buildings on either side that it that have a unified approach there. I feel less strongly about the rear facade of the rooftop edition, but why not? But certainly with that, because that's the unifying element that brings your new building back into plane with the with its neighbors on either side. Well, the thing is: landmarks always asks us applicants doing similar work to leave the top floor of your facade intact and untouched. So that's where the lintels line up currently and we're trying to leave them alone to you know to leave the top floor as it is yeah but you're creating a whole new facade back there. So if you were, if you were preserving the l extension, then I would completely accept that argument, but you're not so. If that were the proposal, then yeah, then that's how I would that's how I would see it, I'm I you know no but mark if I may well, if I may, we are only changing the first three stories. The fourth story is staying, as is so we are. We are enclosing the alpha of three stories. Okay, that fourth story stays, as is mark. I hear we are not net landmarks will not allow us to touch that fourth story. So what we're imposing fair enough? I'm sorry fair enough. I still think that it would look better the other way, but if that's what landmarks is going to draw the line in the sand, then I respect that. Okay, thank you. Following on mark's question, can you just confirm, because I'm now confused the first floor above the garden level, has a tariff setback with stairs and then it was. Does that right, paige? I thought this was a metal thing that jutted out it's metal, it's a staircase that comes down no, but I think the platform is also sticking out of the facade of the building is because it's not shown in your drawings. The second on the first second third, the fourth floor being it should be level with where your little hand is now and on your exonometric. But it's not if there's cancer, it would appear that access where the door is a cantilevered terrace as well a balcony. I think some of this has to be looked at and planned if we started slide 29, I'm just age, 29 you're, my colleagues, I'm getting confused. Okay. Take me through the rear editions, please so just to start on the on the on the first. What we're calling the first floor, there's a basement and then obviously a first floor. So this is one level up. This is the deck with the stuff go back and go back one. This is the deck that we're referring to with the stair, it's not on the axon, but it definitely is shown in plan. And then, if you go down one, we go back one slide, which is the basement level. You went up there, you go. You see a portion of that's there because now we're cutting below it and we're seeing the line above for the entire rear yard. So the deck is also going to be stone, and how far does that protrude from the rear of the existing or whatever the new the depth of that is? I can give you that if you actually can you zoom, can you zoom you go up one? Can you go up one slide? What do you mean go up? I think it's it's seven. It says seven feet at the bottom of it on the bottom of it, you'll see it's a seven feet, something like it's very hard to see on the plans. Let me see if I can zoom yeah, I can I'm gonna try going into my plans. It looks wider than seven feet. I'll get I'll, get you the right size I'll, get you the right size now, because your neighbors will be interested in that because, that's another sure, seven foot, ten, okay, there you go. Thank you, okay and then keep going up on your proposed. So that's the living room level, the parlor floor all right now, there's no balcony here! There's no balcony here! This is the this. What would be the third level basement, one and two? Yes, the fourth floor, which is the top that's where the roof of the existing enlargement stops right. So I'm confused then, what's shown on the third floor. Where are the windows the win here door window correct? So it's the door, that's at the different height. That is correct! Yes, and it's that good, you have it as a terrace with a deck on it. I mean that looks like an epdm roof rather than a terrace, but it would presumably be used as a terrace. That's being used first yeah, okay, so I'm still confused then with where that third floor glass balcony railing is that is correct yeah, so it now covers just the entire edge of that, even though it's not shown as a railing, it's not a coping! Well, this there has to be some depending on where you cut this. There has to be some kind of curb right. I have to be able to flash my roofing properly and get my cam strip in there and then, on top of that is a railing it doesn't. It doesn't read that here this doesn't show that there's any protection except it shows that on the facade it shows it on facade work, yes, as there's a glass panel, but it doesn't grow teeth to cheek. It goes to the cheek from one side to the other. Well, then, you should look at your elevation. I might I may be wrong for 40 minutes. Okay. We appreciate your comments, so we'll look at that. Thank you. Did you consider something more like a railing than a than glass assault? I believe that landmarks actually aiming at landmarks proposed glass versus railing because of the visibility aspect of it. Yeah, it's not typical for rear yards. Is it no? I wouldn't mind on the rear yard to do a railing by the way that doesn't it. Doesn't I wouldn't mind that at all yeah I would second mark on that. I have no issue with that in a funny way. I think I think a railing would blend into the woodwork as it were more than a glass railing would, especially with light bouncing off it and so forth on the south facing that's a good one. I would agree: I'm a hundred percent, I'm with you 100 no issue at all. Okay, sorry, because I'm taking notes and looking at the same time, these glass railings are on what floor now top of the third floor and the top of the rooftop top of the of the main building. If you will right just mark, I think you want to differentiate the front from the rear. I think the rear in the rear, the rear yeah. I would, I would argue, all of them, but I feel more strongly about the rear. I think I'm with mark all the railings on the rear should be metal. Okay and you'll know that he would consider that and actually maybe even prefer that, and that is correct. Okay, thank you. Okay, michelle. How are we gonna move this along through? Maybe we should end the plans for a minute yeah, that's fine! I think we, I think we got it okay, so my wife is sitting next to me, keeps on saying, can I say: hi can I say hi. She wants to say hello, okay, great! Welcome to the neighborhood. Yes, congratulations! So thank you. I just want to say thank you to all of you for this really fruitful discussion. I think I think we were lucky tonight to be your only item. I want to ask you if there could be a way for us to do this a little less according to the usual routine, which is. Could we come back to you in a few days with some drawings and show you some revisions we've made based on your comments before you move forward on your resolution? I don't know if that meets your parliamentary procedure or whatever I'm just asking. If we can do that, are you calendared? We are we're calendared for October 6th. It's not going to work, no when's, our full board, October 6th! Oh so you wouldn't okay, yeah. What I think would make sense here, michelle and kay tell me what you think. What might make sense is to have a resolution tonight that lays out your whatever. The committee's thinking is about all the issues that have been discussed in the form of either recommendations or conditions. Whichever you all decide, they should be as to variations from the plan. Given the number of them, I'm wondering whether this is one where we maybe should make sure that we have a full board vote, but I'll leave that to you as well and then jackie. If I can call you jackie. Yes, if you wanted to confirm between now and full board, which is the evening October 6th which of those recommendations you're going to accept and we can eliminate them as conditions, then we can always pivot on that michelle in case that makes sense to you guys. Yes, I mean, I think, that I think that we can do it in the form of recommendations with noted that they've been accepted, and if the, if the presentation to landmarks is revised to reflect that the applicant didn't get that to us and we can present them as as being done at full board yeah. I agree with jay so mark if full board isn't meeting until that evening. How do we do anything at landmarks or do we have to take so there is a procedure. Jay can explain it as well as anybody on earth can that, because it was his handiwork in negotiating with landmarks, about waiting for a full board vote for some things and letting going forward with a committee resolution without a full board vote. Considering the number of discussions we've had tonight, I leave it to you to decide whether you're comfortable with just a committee vote on this. It would seem to me well it's yours to decide. I should shut up well, one of the considerations in the agreement that we made with landmarks about honoring. Our request, when we feel full board is necessary, is that we would be judicious in our request and we've always wanted to consider the situation with the applicants we don't want to. One of the one of the standards was not to create unnecessary delay in the application process because we just want to be fair. Thank you dave. I guess my question is: there's no way for us to know tonight. For example, I don't know what the schedule is of landmark hearings. Typically, they do at least and mark correctly. If I'm wrong, they typically they can do them every tuesday, but they generally don't. I mean sometimes they're. Two weeks apart, we can look that up. I'm looking up right now: okay, great okay, so October hold on October. The dates are the 6th, the 20th and the 27th. So the first thing is, and without you know, we never want to put undue pressure on the applicants unless we feel so strongly that it needs a full board vote. But if you would you be willing to ask landmarks to put it off from the sixth to the twentieth? My only issue with that jay is that if I can get landmarks approvals by the by the third, I may be able to close the envelope before the winter time. Okay, I mean that's, you know. As I said, we don't. We try as much as possible not to interfere with the logistics and moving the process along. So I would revert back to a resolution with recommendations which we will deem acceptable and if whoever testifies appears on that day, we would present them as such and should assume that you would that you know by the time you get to your hearing. You will have changed the plans to reflect those agreements. That'll be great. Thank you jake, so I think I think that's a reasonable way to handle it. Thank you so much paige here are there any comments from the neighbors? There are no neighbors in. We received nothing in the office and and there's nobody else here. Okay, that makes it easier yeah, I'm nervou. I just want to go on record. I think this building is being completely re-clad, be built added to changed, excavated, decorated and I'm concerned that we don't have the full board, because this is a minority project. I hear the applicant's frustration, but I don't know if there's going to be another shutdown with the building department, there may be other factors that may impact is not being able to resume construction if Covid-19 comes back as it expects can only work without having this calendar. Yeah, I can only work with what I have. If cover comes back and there's another shutdown, then that's what I have to do all bets are off yeah, I'm going to defer to the chairs of the committee on this. I would always I mean I'm the chair of the board. Of course, I prefer a full board vote on everything, but I don't think it's unreasonable for the chairs to take the position that they are so I will defer on whatever you want to want to do michelle. What's your feeling, I I'm I hear what paige is saying. I guess, depending on what the recommendations are that we come up with, and I guess I'd be all right with moving ahead, but what's your feeling? Well, we don't want to lose our chance to say what we have to say at lpc, which we won't right. The owner does not want to lose the opportunity, except for things that are. We can't account for we can't control. He doesn't want to lose the opportunity with the weather and the work people that he needs to do the job. I think that really, I think we should go forward with our resolution and be as detailed as possible. I agree with jay that we should put and paige that we should put our the recommendations that we would accept. I think that the applicants will come back to us if there's any changes in the next couple of days and or will say yes, we've decided you recommended x, y and z, and we decided to do x, y and z. I trust that this is a process that has to continue notwithstanding what we have in the rest of the world and unfortunately, it happens in July, June, July august and September that there's sometimes conflicts of scheduling, but I think we should go forward with our resolution. Yes, okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. So now somebody needs to figure out what that resolution is going to say. Yeah, let's go, it would be easier for me to take notes on what our acceptable recommendations are, and maybe we could start with these stoop, and what I have in my notes is that, pursuant to pages recommendations, the applicant would consider ways to respect the original architect's design. Well, I guess there's two things you need to figure out michelle. If I may, one is there's a proposal for a straight stoop and the other is a an idea or a recommendation as to a way in which the original design could be accommodated and still meet the requirements of the departments of transportation and parks. I think mostly it's transportation. If I'm understanding it correctly, parks owns the tree, but the tree lives, but the box the tree is in is going to stay there, no matter what, oddly enough, even if the tree is fully ada accessible. Well, that is correct. Well, if I may yeah I mean if on, I think that we are assuming. We would approve the straight stoop on the on the basis, not of necessarily of a preference but of a since it's a compliance issue, and I think we can say so and I think we can express a preference for the box stoop and, in essence, instruct the applicant to explore whether there is in fact a way to do it so that it is feasible and compliant, and in the absence of that we approve the straight stew yeah, I'm okay, with that. I think especially the building on the well for two reasons: the building on the left of this one. If I recall my visit today, it has a straight scoop: that's what the photos show yeah that is correct, and the other thing is a straight stoop would be so much better than what's there now yeah exactly, and I think we should request an exploration case. It's a major positive, so my wife maggie says that who the heck would go ahead and script that building it hurts to look at it. So, with respect to the stoop we have a, the resolution would be that we have a preference for a box stoop the applicant and their architects will look at a way to re, to respect the original architect's design and be so that is feasible and compliant with DOT the parks department, of course, lpc and an yeah and the absence of feasibility. In the absence of feasibility and compliance, we would approve the straight scoop. Okay tonight I think it's brilliantly worded, but I think the distinction between the straight and the and the box is that the buildings that were similar are to the west, the bag, neville and bag, and none of his buildings had straight stoops. From my I checked our landmark west database, so I just want to be very clear that you know this is an exception to an exception committee. My recommendation as a community member that we need to distinguish between what's could be an adapted reconstruction versus a piece of fiction because it really does change the ground floor. The way it works, it's not as protected as it would have been yeah I mean, I think we agree. There's no question that would be the preferable result. We just have to deal with the reality. The reality clarified to all the board. That is our preference as well. If it was yeah, if it is feasible, we would do it. We heard that, yes, okay, let's do the rear yard edition wanna. Do that next sure. So in my notes, it is really an application to square off a three-story l. The current l edition is the same height as the proposed full width edition. Yes, yep. Okay, that's nice so say that the proposal is to do a full width addition, the same height as the current l extension yeah. I think if the chairs are planning on entertaining a motion, a segment of the motion to approve the rear yard edition, it would be with a recommendation which has been accepted by the applicant to replace on the application glass railings with metal railings. That's correct! Not only is it accepted by me, but it's preferred by me. Yes, okay, I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. I prefer the verse to the block. Yes, okay, so it would be a matter of presenting that to lpc right correct. We would argue for that at lpc as well. Do we have to say anything else about the rear yard edition I would like to put in the word for a permeable surface, not stone yes, or at least a partial permeable, mostly that would that would be a recommendation, not a condition right. Yes, recommendation for the use of permeable material, including plantings, permeable material in new york reference to boost them, yeah, okay, I just realized another topic that we've had in the past. Is there going to be lighting in the rear yard? All right? I I'm a little slow tonight and say that page and there will be no lighting in the rear. It's fine to have lighting, but you want night sky lighting, which means that all the lighting is low and environmental, because you don't want it to be blaring. I mean people do use their backyards in the summer with birthday, parties and barbecues, but we don't want flood lighting or spotlighting or whatever. We will not have flood lights or spotlights. So would you put if they consider lighting in the future? It should be yes, it should be. It should not be flood lighting or spotlighting in reality who's ever going to police this. What are we talking about a few years down the road that was my thought, I'm willing to assume good faith yeah you do there, you go jake. Thank you. That's a good point yard, although I'm a little conflicted to say and if they consider lighting in the future, they will not have spot or flood lights. I think we should just put the lighting we'll put the lighting into the drawings that we submit to you guys in a few days. Okay, great and you guys can see what the lighting's going to be. Okay, great, I'm not mistaken. I think we may have the lighting in the back and in the passage right. I don't remember though, but I think it is going to happen. You can have wall mounted, you can have pole lighting as long as it's night sky. That means that you don't see it from you, don't see the light source, that's what's really needed and it can be quite lovely and the neighbors will like it because it adds security to the donut right. I agree: what's the technical term skylighting no night sky? In other words, you can see the night sky when you look up, but you don't trip and fall with your lots of songs. So the lights are pointed down, the lights have a cover on them and they point out. Essentially we always say that okay and nobody ever does oh you're such nice people. I promise you. I will try my best to remember. Let's keep going guys, let's keep going sorry, michael you're right, so we're up to the roof. No, I wanted the rear, I'm doing the easy stuff. First, with respect to the rear yard excavation, it's going just going to be to grade yeah, just the grain okay and now what we've all been waiting for. The rooftop. Don't forget mark's alignment on the fourth floor, yeah. We can't do it landmarks already, yeah landmarks. Won't let us do it. Wait we're doing say that miss something. This goes. I had an idea, but it turns out that it's been rejected. So, let's just leave it leave it as this. Okay. So, with respect to the rooftop edition yeah there's the do you want to deal with the color, both the materials in the front and the back yeah? Are you kind of stuck out? What would that material crop all right? Let's deal with the materials, that's easy front, it's the front and brick in the back: brownstone stucco, brownstone, colored, yeah stucco, not brown, stone, brown, stucco right, that's the front and the back will be all brick. Essentially, a continuation of the brick facade. Presuming landmarks. Allow us to allow us to do. Yes, of course, what are the jaclyn? What are the side sheets? The party walls going to be covered with that face its neighbors of the rooftop edition yeah? This is a good question. I need to ask the architect. I was wondering that myself, I was hoping you wouldn't ask. We would be continuing the same material. The same stucco finished material on the sides, so it's stucco. Okay, that's correct! Thank you! What color stucco, I would say, a color that matches the brown stone on the front brown colored stucco, yeah brown, stone, color brown, stone, color, okay, let's just make sure to say just if you would, I'm so sorry, just make sure to say it's brownstone, colored stucco, but I'll transform. It makes a difference. Yes, okay, let's do the rooftop edition now and I thought that's what we just did. We are. That was part of it. If you guys are comfortable with those with those materials, then I haven't heard any other suggestions, so just be to approve right yeah right yeah did you mention the metal railings throughout on the rear? Yes, we have. That was for the rear page. Yes, I didn't hear that it was on the list. Yes yeah. Thank you. I have that as replacing the proposal for glass railings with metal railings on both the top of the third floor. On the top of the fourth floor, I have that on the top third and fourth floor right we got that we could just, let's make sure, to differentiate from the front. I apologize if we can yes hold on for a second while she's writing what color are the windows on the front in the back good? That's the correct answer. Thank you! That's the front and the back yes good. Yes, what kind of windows yeah the front they're going to have hella windows that are the architectural series with the wood? Okay, aluminum, clad wood? No, I won't worry front or ward right. That's another right answer! You're! Moving out yeah you make you're actually making paige happy. I can't believe it. Thank you tell your neighbors about how great it is and the back windows black also yeah, also wood. No, the back is going to be aluminum, clad in the back black again. A third right answer. Thank you can get a different score here, get a prize. I have no humor. Thank you so much your reputation. I think we're ready to vote now. I'm gonna, I'm gonna call the roster and if you agree to all one two three four, so it's one resolution to approve all the things with those conditions, right conditions, recommendations, I'm sorry right match. Yes, okay, yes sue was she left yeah? She had a letter. Houston's gone, I'm a yes peter! Yes, thank you. So I think that's everybody on the committee, so yeah! No, you didn't call me. Oh yes, thank you. So the resolution passes one two, three, four: five to zero to zero to zero. Now non-committee board members page yes, doug kleiman. Yes thank you and mr diller. Yes, so the resolution passes three to zero to zero to zero by non-committee board members. Thank you very much. You said this is calendared. On October 6th, you said, miss duvall call me jackie. It's a great name thanks that you're going to send us an email to confirm some of those recommendations. Yes and anybody else have any other questions. We did what we came to do yeah. So I appreciate everybody's input. Thank you very much paige. Thank you, doug. Thank you, mr taylor. Thank you, team members and apple. We appreciate everyone's time and effort in this. I really do. Thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you, sister welcome and I look forward to to join the neighborhood. Thank you so much all right. If the committee could hang on for just one more minute, I would be grateful we'll be in touch in a few days. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How do I leave so? We have upcoming the the budget, the district needs statement and the budget priorities in some years. We ask for the budget to consider additional staff for lpc this year. The budget has got to be they're talking about laying off tens of thousands of city workers, so I don't think this is the year in which we ought to be asking for more. We just shouldn't be trying to protect what we've already got so with that. Would it would it be acceptable to the committee members to leave it to not have a budget recommendation with respect to this committee? That makes sense yes mark. Typically in the past we would. We would reflect what landmarks told us they needed, which is going to be tomorrow during budget. The lpc is coming tomorrow to budget consultations, but unless they come in with a story that I don't expect, I don't expect to push back on them and to think that's correct. What's up paige sorry cindy sent me both DOB and landmarks to review. My only concern is that in your meeting, if landmarks can be candid to tell us what it is that we want to support them to keep, because in the past, they've been stripped as a non-essential environmental review as it were so okay, I just cautioned that and let the committee know or the community board. So we know what we should support. Great cindy's been great about sending around to everybody as many of those responses from the agencies as she's gotten. So I'm grateful for that and I'm glad that you got them too. Okay. So that's a that's a fair point and that fits right in with what we're saying we're not trying to add staff we're just trying to keep what we already have right, all right, very good. All right! That's all I've got. Thank you very much. Thank you. Everybody have a great weekend. Thank you. Thank you, hi thanks. So much.
