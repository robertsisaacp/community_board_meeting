Our purpose, as a preservation committee is to consider the appropriateness of the proposed changes or alterations, and then our role with the landmarks commission is advisory.
So don't think that it's in that we're saying anything about your project by not voting when the committee votes all right.
They have already issued a staff level permit for restorative work at the front, facade so, in other words, recreating and brownstone stucco.
All the historic documentation and the designation report from the landmarks commission cites that it was originally obviously built as part of this row with what you're, seeing in the middle photograph, which is 28, 30 and 32 west 95th street.
We were we've been told that we need to now ask landmarks to consider installing a straight stoop because there's an issue with ada compliance on the sidewalk.
In these two images, you can see that what's currently proposed, which is the straight stoop and the proximity of the tree pit and next to it on the left, you see the box stoop, which we actually have a permit from landmarks for, but found out after the fact would not comply with me with necessary ada clearance requirements because of the location of the tree.
Department has encouraged us to apply to the landmarks commission for a straight stoop which would restore the presence of a stoop on the building, but at the same time allow the necessary five foot ada compliant clearance on the sidewalk.
The landmarks commission typically asks applicants to articulate an addition and a different material to make it stand out from the body of a building.
The difference here is that it it looks like the entire rear facade will be considerably altered, and so that makes me think about it in a slightly different way, and that looks like it's going to be brick right at the rear.
Let us know there's nobody from the community on this issue, because there are people from next street over we'll be looking at this right.
Sure I don't know if we have square footages on these plans, while he's working on that You're, looking at the rear facade in the upper half and lower half on either side of these either side of the page.
There's, a three-story addition, full width very similar to this project, approved at number 44 west 95th street.
I also want to point out that there were also recent rooftop editions approved on this side of the block, which you see highlighted in the red, the red hatching on top of the buildings, including at number 34.
The first thing is about the student And I You have to deal with them as gently as you do with the landmarks commission, but there may be a way before you decide on changing this stoop to respect the original architects, neville and bags original design, and by way of three questions, did you do a tally of all of the buildings of the brownstone buildings on this block, both sides of the street that still had the stoops, and we we're in process We're in process of that this issue just came to a head really late.
If you look at the doughnut is relatively intact with the space, because these yards are only 30 feet deep and then there's usually 18 or 12 feet for these smaller additions and when you start closing them up, given the fact that okay, the building, on, I, think it's 29 and 27 that have done this super mansion, trick.
Then I think here you went to a great deal of trouble to argue for brick, even though I know, landmarks doesn't always or used to always specify a less noble material for the rooftop edition, but in this case you're doing a restoration and a continuation of a facade that carries its original, I'm, hoping that you're and What they, the people living directly across the way.
But it can be an environmental issue for the rest of the block to have that- You planning to put awnings on these windows and the doors at the on the rear, facade?
The commission has already approved full-width editions, there's some other incursions of additions within the block and we're also not going to be diminishing, really the light and air for the neighboring houses.
Well, the thing is: landmarks always asks us applicants doing similar work to leave the top floor of your facade intact and untouched.
That I think that we can do it in the form of recommendations with noted that they've been accepted, and if the, if the presentation to landmarks is revised to reflect that the applicant didn't get that to us Do we do anything at landmarks or do we have to take Jay can explain it as well as anybody on earth can that, because it was his handiwork in negotiating with landmarks, about waiting for a full board vote for some things and letting going forward with a committee resolution without a full board.
Well, if I may We would approve the straight stoop on the on the basis, not of necessarily of a preference but of a since it's a compliance, issue, and I think we can say so.
If the chairs are planning on entertaining a motion, a segment of the motion to approve the rear yard edition, it would be with a recommendation which has been accepted by the applicant to replace on the application glass railings with metal.
Only concern is that in your meeting, if landmarks can be candid to tell us what it is that we want to support them to keep, because in the past, they've been stripped as a non-essential environmental review, as it were so, okay, I, just cautioned that and let the committee know or the community board.
