Members of the committee, my name is jackie: puduvalin I'm, the preservation consultant on the project I'm here tonight with chris mensuso of graso mensuso architects and a soft drawer who's , the owner of the property Thank you for hearing our application tonight, Sorry, no problem, it's all right, so this project is 26 west 95th street, which is an 1890s row house which stands on the south side of the street between central park west and columbus avenue.
What you're, also seeing in addition to the facade work, that's already been approved, you're, seeing the straight stoop, which is not approved by lpc, yet, which is what we're part of what we're showing you here tonight, and you also see the rooftop edition in you know in these two elevations, okay, so page two, please and here's the house's location in the northern end of the historic district You see outlined on the map and also photos of what the rest of the south side of the block look like when you're looking west and looking east next slide.
However all the historic documentation and the designation report from the landmarks commission cites that it was originally obviously built as part of this row with what you're, seeing in the middle photograph, which is 28, 30 and 32 west 95th street Originally it had a facade, pretty much identical to number 30, so the one in the center, which meant it also originally had a box stoop, and currently we do have a permit from landmarks to restore a box stoop, but there's a wrinkle Basically, we were we've been told that we need to now ask landmarks to consider installing a straight stoop because there's an issue with ada compliance on the sidewalk There's a box stoop installed where there's also a tree pit right in front of this house.
You see the box stoop, which we actually have a permit from landmarks for, but found out after the fact would not comply with me with necessary ada clearance requirements because of the location of the tree pit That DOT was letting us know they couldn't approve the stoop installation because of the proximity of the tree, the tree pit, and then that meant reaching out to the parks department who regulates the tree, pits and parks department, basically saying it would take a lot of effort and probably a lot of expense to move this tree pit For that reason, parks department has encouraged us to apply to the landmarks commission for a straight stoop which would restore the presence of a stoop on the building but at the same time allow the necessary five foot ada compliant clearance on the sidewalk Please.
I mean just the personal preference I mean typically as I'm sure you know, the landmarks commission typically asks applicants to articulate an addition and a different material to make it stand out from the body of a building.
It doesn't really matter what it might look like from the street, but well you're, restoring you're, restoring the facade So in that sense, I echo what k said and what landmarks always says what they is The difference here is that it it looks like the entire rear facade will be considerably altered, and so that makes me think about it in a slightly different way, and that looks like it's going to be brick right at the rear.
Then you'd have the fourth story: rear, facade left alone, leaving that brick undisturbed and then and then have brick at the rear of the edition Let us know there's nobody from the community on this issue, because there are people from next street over we'll be looking at this right.
The first thing is about the student and I You have to deal with them as gently as you do with the landmarks commission, but there may be a way before you decide on changing this stoop to respect the original architects, neville and bags original design, and by way of three questions, did you do a tally of all of the buildings of the brownstone buildings on this block, both sides of the street that still had the stoops and we we're in process, and then the drawings were just completed literally today to be able to show this to you today, but we do intend to do a survey of both sides of the block to include in the in the hearing presentation Okay, because some my experience has been that if you demonstrate that your incursion on the sidewalk is no greater than anyone else, they can't deny you because we're doing a restorative building and my problem with this I just want to tell you that we did make this decision in consultation with senior staff at landmarks, who encouraged us to take this route and see what would happen at public hearing.
I just know that our street I have a brown stone on 88th street with the box dude So I find it unusual that, with all the effort and the money and the time that the owner is putting into this building that you're not making one last try to be able to make it work and the way you can make it work is frankly tighten up on the dimension of the landing Drawing you have the the one on the right first floor, proposed in large scoop.
Think here you went to a great deal of trouble to argue for brick, even though I know, landmarks doesn't always or used to always specify a less noble material for the rooftop edition, but in this case you're doing a restoration and a continuation of a facade that carries its original I'm, hoping that you're and what they the people living directly across the way.
Yes I would want to see the lentils lining up, because the terrace is going to obscure the bottom of them, so creating a door out of one of those window I feel less strongly about the rear facade of the rooftop edition.
landmarks always asks us applicants doing similar work to leave the top floor of your facade, intact and untouched, but you're creating a whole new facade back there If you were, if you were preserving the l extension, then I would completely accept that argument, but you're not so, if I may well, if I may, we are only changing the first three stories.
I hear we are not net landmarks will not allow us to touch that fourth story: I still think that it would look better the other way, but if that's what landmarks is going to draw the line in the sand, then I respect that Following on mark's question.
Think if the chairs are planning on entertaining a motion, a segment of the motion to approve the rear yard edition, it would be with a recommendation which has been accepted by the applicant to replace on the application glass railings with metal.
