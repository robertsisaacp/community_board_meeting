You're seeing tonight is for the installation of a straight stew, a rooftop edition, a three- story, rear edition, with a deck and stair and rear yard.
And you also see the rooftop edition in you- know in these two elevations, okay, so page two, please And here's the house's location in the northern end of the historic district, as you see outlined on the map and also photos of what the rest of the south side of the block look like when you're looking west and looking East.
We were we've been told that we need to now ask landmarks to consider installing a straight stoop because there's an issue with ADA compliance on the sidewalk.
Viewed from this partial North elevation, rooftop edition would be a little over 10 feet tall and then have above it a glass railing with a stair bulkhead behind please how what's the height with the stair bulkhead.
The difference here is that it it looks like the entire rear facade will be considerably altered, and so that makes me think about it in a slightly different way, and that looks like it's going to be brick right at the rear.
While he's working on that You know the rear yard excavation Looking at the rear facade in the upper half and lower half on either side of these either side of the page.
A one, story, rear edition that spans, both backyards, I'm, assuming this house is inside at the Interior, serves as one building, because it has a rooftop, edition.
It's just interesting to me that there is a rear yard edition that is built from the lot line and going in and not actually connected to the rear.
I also want to point out that there were also recent rooftop editions approved on this side of the block, which you see highlighted in the red, the red hatching on top of the buildings, including at number 34.
So you can see that highlighted by the color coding in this in these two plans- This is just the condition of the existing rear yard, and this is our final slide just to end on being able to show you, the proposed front.
The first thing is about the student and I And I appreciate the angst and tribulations of D.O.T, but being a preservationist in New. You have to deal with them as gently as you do with the landmarks commission, but there may be a way before you decide on changing this stoop to respect the original, architects, Neville and bags original design, and by way of three questions, did you do a tally of all of the buildings of the brownstone buildings on this block, both sides of the street that still had the stoops, and we we're in process We're in process of that this issue just came to a head really late.
If you look at the doughnut is relatively intact with the space, because these yards are only 30 feet deep and then there's usually 18 or 12 feet for these smaller additions and when you start closing them up, given the fact that okay, the building, on, I, think it's 29 and 27 that have done this super mansion, trick.
Even if you are going to expand, it, I have problems with it, going all the way to the rooftop If we can go to next to the elevation that proposed of the rear, yard.
And, then I think here you went to a great deal of trouble to argue for brick, even though I know, landmarks does not always or used to always specify a less noble material for the rooftop edition, but in this case you're doing a restoration and a continuation of a facade that carries its original, I'm, hoping that you're and, I'm sorry, The new doors to the backyard and your turrets, and that is adding an enormous amount of bulk.
I do not know what the neighbors will think or what they, the people living directly acrosss the way, but it can be an environmental issue for the rest of the block to have that- And, I, also question as to whether or not the rooftop edition needs to be so all four.
Is that make sure you have adequate drainage, because in disturbing the ground, you're going to need not only the main sump or drain in the center, but an overflow, because your neighbors will not think kindly when your backyard starts to overflow into theirs, because they have more press from what I could peek into the most of everybody's rear.
West 95 has that was approved and built almost an identical proposal, proposition to what I'm saying with reference to the rear yard and the rooftop edition, and that was done very recently.
The commission has already approved full- width editions, there's some other incursions of additions within the block and we're also not going to be diminishing, really the light and air for the neighboring houses.
It's not really going to be excavating to a point where the commission has to make it part of a hearing review But there is a rear, yard, excavation, okay.
It's really three parts that we have to consider: the stoop, the rear yard and the rooftop.
Because, there's a setback and the and the ground floor in the rear yard It would be the west side of the you know the east side of the building Yes, there's no place on the second floor that prescribes step back to the terrorists.
The rooftop edition, the rear yard part of it.
I feel less strongly about the rear facade of the rooftop edition.
Well, the thing is: landmarks always asks us applicants doing similar work to leave the top floor of your facade intact and untouched.
The number of them, I'm wondering whether this is one where we maybe should make sure that we have a full board vote, but I'll leave that to you as well and If you wanted to confirm between now and full board, which is the evening October 6th, Yes, I, mean, I think, that I think that we can do it in the form of recommendations with noted that they've been accepted, and if the, if the presentation to landmarks is revised to reflect that the applicant did not get that to us Do we do anything at landmarks or do we have to take Jay can explain it as well as anybody on earth can that, because it was his handiwork in negotiating with landmarks, about waiting for a full board vote for some things and letting going forward with a committee resolution without a full board.
The applicant and their architects will look at a way to re, to respect the original architect's design and be so that is feasible and compliant with DOT, the Parks Department, of course, LPC and an We would approve the straight scoop.
If the chairs are planning on entertaining a motion, a segment of the motion to approve the rear yard edition, it would be with a recommendation which has been accepted by the applicant to replace on the application glass railings with metal.
Do, we have to say anything else about the rear yard edition I would like to put in the word for a permeable surface, not stone yes, or at least a partial permeable, mostly that would that would be a recommendation, not a condition.
Is there going to be lighting in the rear, yard?
So, with respect to the rooftop edition You want to deal with the color, both the materials in the front and the back Essentially, a continuation of the brick facade.
Its neighbors of the rooftop edition I need to ask the architect.
I think we're ready to vote now, I'm going to So it's one resolution to approve all the things with those conditions, right: conditions, recommendations: She had a letter.
