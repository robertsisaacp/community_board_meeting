She, also advises the comptroller on policy recommendations that change how new york city does business with women and people of color through reports such as making the grade.
I also know that, for the last three or four months, I've initiated on the bonsai bank, the ppp program, which is for payroll, and if you any of you, are interested in that we are open at this point in time and accepting applications, but that is only to complete payroll, not for working capital.
If you're gonna have a larger loan, I'm going to leave it at that and tell you that, basically, with that flash drive and that binder you can be prepared at any point in time to provide your package to a banker that may be interested, learn what we call your elevator pitch, learn to talk about your company in one to two minutes and highlight that keep it current updated when needed and copy when needed, and I will end with that.
You can lead to personal liability for things you didn't intend and if you're going to have a partner make sure you have a shareholders agreement, you may never look at it again until there's a problem between you and your partner, so you can confidently look at both right, but in getting into a small business.
But the main reason that you can succeed in the business is using learning to use management tools, and it starts with having the necessary accounting information at your fingertips and making sure that your accountant understands how to produce these invite these items for you, one of them Okay, issuing to yourself, let alone to the bank, a regular, quarterly financial statement, so that you know exactly what you're doing right, Okay, all right.
When you go to the bank, okay, the bank returns to you and says: Well, what do you need the money for okay Will tell them that you're going to use the property, the money that you're borrowing right to make a successful business which will produce an income and the cash flow will tell you how what income you will have available at the moments that necessary to be able to service the obligations of the from the bank or the lending institution and putting those two ideas.
Thank you, robert richette, and thank you very much and now we're going to hear from sherry, lane, executive, director of capital, access and center operations for new york, city, small business, services, sbs, who will explain some of the available opportunities and how to get different types of access to these great well.
And I wanted to start with talking a little bit about the business education piece, because I know we're talking mostly about financing here, but I want to just emphasize that hand in hand with any either application for a loan or taking on a loan, particularly now.
We have business solution, centers that are staffed with finance account managers that offer free one-on-one assistance to go through a lot of the binder that madeline was talking about, and the purpose of this is that's a lot of work, sometimes when you're starting to apply for a loan, especially for the first time.
So we provide that service for free both in terms of helping you put that package together, but also to try and navigate the space of a broad variety of lenders in the city so again to madeline's point.
Our panel is patty daley from the office of new york, city, comptroller, scott m stringer, so patty tell us about mwbe university to start with yeah.
If, you don't know the comptroller controller, scott stringer is the chief financial officer for the city of new york, he's the chief auditor chief accountant and the fiduciary to the city's pension funds, and our team's focus is to ensure that the city uses its financial power from contracts to investments really to level the playing field for women and people of color.
Sure robert is very busy these days, and so we wanted to take a look at mwbe, specifically in new york, and this will give you some context on why it's important to reach out to people like sherry and madeline, for support on financing and for city contracts.
We saw that 65 percent of respondents that shared information about their services said that they were ready and able to do business with the city.
I always wanted to open my own business, never thought about a bank, I'm, just giving you a scenario of what type of people are out there that are needing help, but I went to my father and I presented him, I'm.
Finally, I went to work at new school university for 10 years, but there are people out there like me, never think about banks, and that this is what my concern is because if there were people like me, as far as their self-sufficient and funding their own business, but this webinar here is so informative.
I. Think the irony of small entrepreneurs not utilizing banks to the to the extent they can is that they're still opening up bank accounts to maintain their funds and operating their businesses, yet are limited to the access to capital from within those same banks.
