It is a minority deposit institution and Mdi, and a certified community development, financial institution of cdfi And we're going to hear from Sherry Lane executive, director of capital access and center operations for New York, City, Small, Business, Services, spds and Ms Lane Oversees, the city's network of business solutions, centers and industry business service providers, which provide free services to entrepreneurs and business owners in all boroughs.
These free services include business, courses, legal assistance and help that help navigating and selling to government and financing.
She also oversees Sbs's capital access program, which includes managing multiple funds that aim to reduce the financing barriers for underserved business owners and rounding out.
She, also advises the comptroller on policy recommendations that change how New York City does business with women and people of color through reports such as making the grade so previously, Ms Dalek served as the advisor of diversity policy at the Office of New, York, City Comptroller and the assistant director of policy at the coalition for asian, american children and families, and so without further ado, we're going to start with Ms Marquez, Madeleine, Marquez and she'll still help us with that, and I will be right.
The other thing that you need to be aware, of course, is the actual three entities that are going to provide credit information on the personal and or owner of that entity.
I also know that, for the last three or four months, I've initiated on the Bonsai bank, the ppp program, which is for payroll, and if you any of you, are interested in that we are open at this point in time and accepting applications, but that is only to complete payroll, not for working capital.
Attitude, if you're going to have a larger loan, I'm going to leave it at that and tell you that, basically, with that flash drive and that binder, you can be prepared at any point in time to provide your package to a banker that may be interested, learn what we call your elevator pitch, learn to talk about your company in one to two minutes and highlight that keep it current updated when needed and copy when needed, and I will end with that.
But the main reason that you can succeed in the business is using learning to use management tools, and it starts with having the necessary accounting information at your fingertips and making sure that your accountant understands how to produce these invite these items for you, one of them Okay, issuing to yourself, let alone to the bank, a regular, quarterly financial statement, so that you know exactly what you're doing right, Okay, all right.
When you go to the bank, okay, the bank returns to you and says: Well, what do you need the money for okay , Constructed projections will tell them that you're going to use the property, the money that you're borrowing right to make a successful business which will produce an income and the cash flow will tell you how what income you will have available at the moments that necessary to be able to service the obligations of the from the bank or the lending institution and putting those two ideas.
Thank, you, Robert Richette, and thank you very much and now we're going to hear from Sherry Lane, executive, director of capital access and center operations for New, York, City, small business, services, SBS, who will explain some of the available opportunities and how to get different types of access to these great well.
So in terms of access check out our website, it's 888 SBS for NYC, so I will I'll post these things in the chat once I'm finished speaking as well, so that's reopening for business education, again That usually are in person, but right now we've brought them to a virtual space, but they are interactive.
To start with talking a little bit about the business education piece, because I know we're talking mostly about financing here, but I want to just emphasize that hand in hand with any either application for a loan or taking on a loan, particularly now.
So we provide that service for free both in terms of helping you put that package together, but also to try and navigate the space of a broad variety of lenders in the city so again to Madeline's point.
Think of new revenue opportunities as well , so we try and help hand hold through that process and again in terms of access, there's also a form online.
You do not know the Comptroller Controller Scott Stringer is the chief financial officer for the city of New, York He's, the chief auditor chief accountant and the fiduciary to the city's pension funds, and our team's focus is to ensure that the city uses its financial power from contracts to investments really to level the playing field for women and people of color.
Sure Robert is very busy these days, and so we wanted to take a look at Mwbe, specifically in New York, and this will give you some context on why it's important to reach out to people like Sherry and Madeline, for support on financing and for city contracts.
We saw that 65 percent of respondents that shared information about their services said that they were ready and able to do business with the city.
The city did, for a very brief time, have funding available for businesses.
We saw that only 40 of the businesses that we surveyed were able to put in an application for the city, business continuity, loan of the 40.
What did Mwbe's ask for what do they want from the city of New York?
I always wanted to open my own business, never thought about a bank, I'm, just giving you a scenario of what type of people are out there that are needing help, but I went to my father and I presented him, I'm.
Finally, I went to work at New, School University for 10 years, but there are people out there like me, never think about banks, and that this is what my concern is because if there were people like me, as far as their self, sufficient and funding their own business, but this webinar here is so informative.
I think the irony of small entrepreneurs not utilizing banks to the to the extent they can is that they're still opening up bank accounts to maintain their funds and operating their businesses, yet are limited to the access to capital from within those same banks.
Another thing is that if I can not do that loan So, you have the right to ask whoever you're submitting your package to and control that you have to manage expectations unless they're going to give you a firm, offer.
