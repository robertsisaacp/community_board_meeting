The the first order of business and the thing that I want to make sure that we have plenty of time to discuss and understand is the is preparation for the district needs statement.
Needs statement and about the preparation for the budget priorities that need to be voted on at the October steering committee, so that we can vote on them at full board in November, I'm stalling for time, so that cindy can plug in, but I think she is now plugged in and I did not want to bother my family with listening to things about the DNS they're, not interested in the dulcet tones.
One of the things that city planning went through was talking about the timeline They talked about attending the borough budget consultations in September and how our community boards need to schedule, meetings for review and votes on the issues, the needs and the budget requests, which is what we're starting kicking off now and that internally, we're supposed to be collecting input and enlisting support from elected officials and stakeholders on our key priorities.
All of the committees have reached out to maybe elected officials or NGOS or any other groups you can think of for input in order to help formulate your district needs statement and budget priorities.
Sure most of you who are on the board last year will recall that during steering we were voting on top priorities that the board has to decide on what our number one priority is like the majority of community boards last year , our top priority was was a housing issue was okay, but there are other choices we can have other.
We ultimately have to ratify our final budget priorities during a public hearing, and my understanding coming into this role last year was that in the past and what we did last year was our first November meeting.
And then in November OMB, actually distributes our budget priorities to the agencies, which is why that deadline of October early November is so important, and then city planning distributes the city- wide community board perspective reports to the agencies and the agencies review and respond to the budget requests.
We have a unique opportunity this year to have our opinions, considered more so than other years, because they're going to be making tough budget decisions in a tight time frame, and this will be a document that ostensibly reflects the will of the community, and I- think that when you have to make a tough decision, it's a lot easier to make it with the strength of some support than to just make it.
A streamlined approach where you have a good rapport with your corresponding agency is, of course ideal, and I would encourage everybody to do that within the framework of whatever makes sense for your committee, And I'm happy to have people reach out to city, planning, and I can give you know.
While, the budget priorities need to be voted on at November, full board, I, both out of out of gratitude for cindy and the committee for taking on this very difficult and time- consuming task, and because you know, we've been kind of working on this.
Pleased by by October steering I was going to say by October full board, but I'm being realistic, because that would give us an opportunity, as a committee, to assemble our own standalone document as well as input the relevant sections into the right parts of the online form that Cindy was showing and that actually christian is now showing you.
Any of the committees would like to develop a budget priority around what BSA can or should be doing or a need statement.
One question is I'm trying to get my arms around this and not make it too difficult, but I think the BSA not that I want to throw them under a bus, But they're not doing their job, because city planning can't make their decisions And Neither can preservation, because the other issue that I want to table- And I do not know if it's something that I'd like to reach out with Jay and Michelle- is air rights transfers, because that's why we're getting these ziggurat upside down?
I see Sima's on tonight, because I need to touch things with her as well, but is this something that we can Jay and Michelle would be willing to work with me on certain areas that impact city planning You're one letter off I think it would be good to share, because I was shocked by the DOB that was so detailed and this preservation Let me.
You need to come to October, steering with your budget priorities done and while you might have a little bit of grace period with respect to the written narrative part of it, that needs to be done more or less at the same time as well cindy if it's okay with you I'm sort of taken with the calendar right now, because November has become incredibly important for several reasons.
If that's necessary, You know we get agency responses every year to our requests to our budget requests, and generally they say we need to study this or we do not have sufficient money at the time or go to your council member and see if they have some money.
It is the last of those things that Cindy mentioned that that council members with their member items or the borough president with her funding available, will sometimes look to our statement of priorities as to when they are deciding among different projects.
They said their responses, say, there's insufficient money for this budget, As Beverly said, it's important this year, particularly to at least let them know what our priorities are, so that hopefully in making their decisions, they will consider that great What's the best way to submit to you the budget items because they'll be entered into a form Just any way.
The next is a agenda item has to do with full board meeting planning, and that was where I was going to mention November, but we've already covered.
The idea being that we would have the elected officials hear the community and then respond rather than then, and try to make us their last stop, rather than bouncing from one meeting to another to another, which I know that they need to do.
You want to continue well, just as the situation has changed and the point is: do we support keeping homeless in the hotels in our community board rather than doing this kind of round robin that the mayor had advocated well.
There's any move right now to do anything different, but this is this absolutely will be topics for continued conversation as we move forward, When I see Susan go ahead, I know that you've been having what are called small group meetings with various stakeholders in this, but I'm wondering if we should perhaps have this on our agenda for the full board meeting, so that the community feels at large that they can be heard, because I've heard comments from a number of people that they feel that those smaller group meetings are really contained.
You can't have 1300 people come to what is effectively a community Advisory board kind of meeting.
More thinking, work about the the community at large have an opportunity to let the community board know how they feel about.
The community session people can know to commemorate.com is very different from putting on the agendas and actual items.
If you put that on the agenda, you need to make sure that there are people there who can answer questions with facts who are from you, know, different agencies from the service provider.
Yes, I just wanted to say that this is the biggest issue that has come before our community in a number of years, and certainly the most profile one city- wide, and it just seems amazing that we have not taken a position on it.
I'm, going to vote in favor of a request that that the mayor include Community, Board representatives on his reopening panels or his reopening committees to make sure that our voices are heard and through us, our community's voices are heard.
It's, especially important to Our It's a message that we care about people deeply, that we've made mistakes, And I'm sure that it's going to involve all of the all of the community boards that surround the park in any decision.
, that's something that is yet to be considered absolutely, and there are a lot of people whose approval, besides ours, but typically anything that gets added to the central park in the way of this kind of a thing, requires a referral to all five community boards that border the park with a view toward it eventually being approved by the Landmark Preservation Commission, which then writes a letter.
