Hey Audrey you're in the city by the bay again, okay, all right, Catherine, I'm going to start the webinar just that'll start letting people in as attendees. We are live streaming and recording. Now so hi everybody have a light behind me on. You can't see me on the screen, see somebody who has logged in as Lg G-pad f2. Could you let me know your name please, and maybe you should turn it off. If you don't mind screen this, the screen name coming in is Lg G-pad f2 8.0. Oh sorry, let me put my name in sorry. Can you update your name? Thank you. Thanks for your assistance mark, oh yeah, I'm the amateur I.t guy. Welcome everyone good to see everyone here. So Mark is Shelley here. Jelly is here: okay, great and I. Think you have a quorum so start whenever you're, ready, I didn't realize. I, muted I was saying so many things. Oh no, okay, it's very interesting! So Shelley do you want to start sure if you have there are things that you wanted to say and then I'll provide an overview of the topic and the agenda? Okay. So we welcome you to this important meeting. The captain will go over the overview, but this is again consistent with our meetings consistent with our district needs statement, our priorities that we've set forward and that's how we're setting our agendas. We are glad to see our committee members, but other board members and other people join us I. Think the issues that we're touching are ones which we can all learn from, even though even those that are experts learn, agencies can learn from one another, and people with different experiences can learn from one another. I feel tonight's topic's a very sensitive topic and we, needless to say, we expect that everyone will be utterly respectful, but understanding no question later on is a stupid question or not an appropriate question. If it's a sincere question and they'll help us learn and help us understand, we, the format will be that each of our speakers will present. If you have a question and afraid to lose it, please jot it down. Okay, so you can ask it. After all, the speakers have spoken and then we'll have questions and comments to follow. Are there any? Are there anything if I could jump in on that last point, thank you sometimes folks put questions in the chat, and sometimes they put them in the Q&A. My strong recommendation is that everybody put questions into the chat, because, at the end of the meeting the chat is saved. I am not aware of an ability to save the Q&A, so it would be better. If, especially, if there's questions that need to be followed up upon by saving the chat, we will be able to save your questions, but the Q&A is ephemeral and disappears when the meeting is over. So with that I'll give it back to you. Thank you all right. So are we ready so I'll always start please. So we envision this today's meeting as an opportunity to discuss ways to respond to child abuse and support the mental health and safety of children. We're looking forward to how we look forward. We're excited to have safe, Horizon, New, York, City alliance against sexual assaults and the Mount Sinai sexual assault and violence, intervention program and others with us we're especially interested in learning how the city and our district can increase. The availability of forensic examiner and trauma-informed practice, training for doctors, physicians, assistants and nurses, child advocacy, centers, child-centered facilities and more free and affordable mental health care for children and youth, especially those who have been abused or in challenging situations. Our meetings can, as Shelly mentioned, our meetings can serve as a forum to provide education to the community and brainstorm methods of advocacy, so we're hoping from this session. We can learn how to support the important work of these organizations. Doing this great work so from safe horizon, we have with us John Pickett and please let us know if we mispronounce our name your names, because it's important to us to get that right. We have John Pickett, Michael, Pollenberg and Nancy Arnow from New York City alliance against sexual assaults. We have Sarah Zadie with us and from the Mount Sinai sexual assaults and violence intervention program. We have Lynn Frederick, Holly and Angela Fernandez. We may have a pediatrician with us later, whose name is Olga Jimenez. The protocol for the discussion, as Shelley mentioned, is that the speakers will each speak in the order that I just read. Shelley will call on them and after everyone finishes we'll take questions in response or comments from the health and Human Services committee, we'll call on each person and then we'll and then board members will have the opportunity to ask questions and then the public so I will hand it over to you yeah great Madge. Would it be too much of an imposition to take minutes? I'm taking minutes, but I'll have to get the names all straight from great. Well, I'll. Send them to you. Thank you very much. Okay, we're going to begin with safe horizons and John Pickett John. Could you identify yourself? Yes, okay, everyone and we're not going to put a limit on time because we asked for the infant we outline. The information we're interested in, but whatever you have to share with us is very important, so please don't restrict yourself, absolutely necessarily yeah, and if it's okay, I'm gonna I'll, have my actually my super budget. Nancy are now start from safe horizon just to kind of give. She can speak to some of this and then I'll follow up with her. If that's okay, awesome so hi everyone, I'm Nancy Arnell, it's a pleasure to meet you and I'm the vice president. At safe, rising of our child advocacy and mental health services, I actually have grown up and grown old at safe horizon. I've been there over 30 years. It's kind of remarkable and I must say in all these years. These past, eight or nine months have been some of the most challenging. That I can remember so I just applaud all of you for even being on this call it's kind of cool to see kind of inside your homes and our homes. You know we enter a new world this way, but so I'm just going to give you a little context and I want to apologize. Michael Pollenberg had a death in his family, so he's our vice president of government affairs, but I, don't think he's going to be able to join us. So I'm going to just give you a broad overview of safe horizon touch on a couple little points of child focus programs that I think you might be interested in and then John. My fabulous colleague is going to give you an inside view of what's going on at our Manhattan child efficacy center, which he is the senior director of so for those of you that have been around safe horizon was really established back as victim services back in 1978, and over these decades we've really tried to stay true to the needs of what are the needs of child victims, adult victims, all kinds of victims of crime and abuse and I think you know. Back in the day, we were kind of the only game in town. Now I'm thrilled to hear some of our colleagues on this call. You know that there are more services available in our community, but I think the needs of victims of crime and abuse are more complex now than ever before, and I think the amount of loss and trauma and the cumulative impact that we're seeing in our programs across the agency are just profound and I'm deeply concerned about the financial impact that I think we're all bracing for so just very broadly, you know, victims are well, it was victim services. Safe horizon is really the nation's leading victim assistance program. We have about a thousand employees. Now we provide services in all five boroughs and I think we've done a pretty remarkable job, even throughout the pandemic of primarily providing remote services trying to knock down every barriers. There are for victims to still access help. We have 24-hour hotlines all of our services that we're primarily providing in-person services are providing remote services, but we have had some of our key essential programs remain open every day throughout the pandemic and those are our eight domestic violence shelters. Our street work program for homeless youth, which has both drop-in centers in the lower east side and up in Harlem, as well as an overnight shelter and our five child advocacy. Centers, have also stayed open every day during this pandemic that investigate respond to the most serious cases of child abuse. All of our programs are really there to provide assistance, advocacy and support to victims, whether you're, really infants and toddlers all the way up to elderly, and we deal with every kind of crime, domestic violence, child abuse, rape and sexual assault, human trafficking, youth homelessness and our staff are now in every precinct, they're doing it remotely right now, but every police precinct through our crime victims, assistance program where we have advocates to really try to help crime victims of all kinds. In the precinct we have community office programs in all the boroughs. We are in the family, justice centers, that many of you are aware of we're in the criminal courts, the family courts. We have an immigration law project and domestic violence law project where we have attorneys and paralegals who are providing free expert legal assistance. We have a counseling center that has been very dear to my heart that provides evidence-based mental health treatment from infants all the way up to elderly. We have switched over to providing telehealth, so we are finding that that's actually knocking down many barriers, historically, that the children and families had coming into clinics. So we're really kind of thrilled that actually, through telehealth we're providing these services remotely so I could go on I. Don't want to bore you, but there's a whole lot of programs and I would encourage you to visit our website sayfrison.org, which would give you know a thorough understanding of what we're doing, but I'll, just close by saying I've been here a long time. I really I think I'm a little not objective anymore, but I really feel we have some of the most compassionate staff that we ever could have I feel really humbled by the type of expertise, the passion that they're just driven, whether it's coming in every day during these rough conditions, to be there for children and families or from their bedrooms or living rooms wherever they can provide remote service, and I'm also humbled by the thousands of victims that have shared their journeys, their struggles and us really partnering with them to try to stay on top of their very complex and evolving needs. So after all these years, I'm still humbled to be part of this organization and I really welcome the opportunity of learning from other organizations. I feel like we're always in a state of learning and sharing. So if you've ever when things get better, if you ever want to visit any of our programs, we love to give tours I'd love to hug people again, hopefully someday soon so with yeah virtual hugs. So with that said, I'm gonna pass it over to John Pickett, who is really remarkable, he's our senior director of our Manhattan child advocacy center, and it's just phenomenal, so I'm going to pass it over to John Pickett. Thank you. Nancy thanks Nancy. I'm lucky enough to have her as a supervisor, so I feel really grateful about that, and just again I want to thank everybody for just having us here. I know this time period has is, can be overwhelming, even just the day-to-day of functioning. So in addition to that, having someone come talk to you about, like a child abuse can be a lot or other types of abuse is a lot to even think about so I. Just thank you for even taking that on and considering that. So, as Nathan mentioned, I'm the senior director of the Manhattan child effort center and if you will without getting too much into it before I, even say anything I just want to point out whenever I talk about child abuse, I like to point out, because we know that statistically one in two children will be sexually abused before they turn 18 and the numbers are high also for physical abuse, so that this excuse me, oh yes, could you just repeat that got kind of garbled I want to get it right? Absolutely, I'm sorry! It's interrupt yeah! No, please, of course, that we know that one in ten children will be sexually abused before they turn 18, statistically speaking and I bring that up in part just to kind of point out that this is obviously something that happens way too often and that it's also probably impacted people that are listening tonight, that this is not an issue that happens to others, because other people issue or the people that live you know outside New, York City. This is a very much irrelevant to even many of us here. That's you know. People here could certainly know somebody or even be impacted themselves by child abuse and as even when I'm talking tonight, I'm not gonna get into lots of details about it, but just to be aware of how we're ourselves are reacting to this, you know I, think it's just being self-aware. Knowing that this is the goal is not to try to you, know scare people or anything like that, but also our own reactions. I've been doing this a long time. The number of years and I still you know at times like I still can get. I can be reactive even for me hearing stories of children who have been abused or hearing their stories so I just want to be aware of that, for all of us and being taking care of ourselves. So along those lines, I know, we know that, like I said, the rate is high for children and the back in the 80s. We there was a prosecutor actually by the name of Robert Bud Cramer, who looked at this issue and said you know he was prosecuted actually in of all places in Alabama. I know just randomly, but some of you might need from Alabama, which is great, but the he looked at is like your children, who disclose some type of abuse, often end up in hospital emergency rooms where they get interviewed repeatedly by nurses, doctors and not because they're intending to do that. But it's just part of the process they get interviewed. They get examined. They end up in precincts which, if you hopefully haven't, had to be a precinct recently but precincts are not even adult friendly. You know for a good intention, I don't know, but it can be as a child seeing what happens in a precinct people getting arrested in handcuffs and I know. Even before we open the child advocacy center. Here detectives would talk about. You know that they would interview children and have children sit at their desk while they talk to their mother or interview, children in the line-up room or just kind of wherever that could happen, and the Robert V Kramer at the 80s said well. Why can't we do this differently? Why does children and families have to go to all these different offices of people who are investigating these? The child abuse allegations? Why can't we change the system to work better for children and families, and so he came up with this idea of a child advocacy center of a place where everybody who's involved in child abuse investigations would come to one place would be in one place and those children and families would come to that place and have a one-stop shop. If you will or once a place where they can receive the services, the investigation can happen in one place. The child can be interviewed the least amount of times, but hopefully one time where we have interview rooms here, observation rooms, where people who are investigating can watch that interview. We have specially trained social workers, and indeed and other members who how to interview children I, mean there's a whole lot of research, a lot of training, and that goes into how do you interview children and then say horizon here at the Manhattan challenge center and just to give you some idea if this includes we'll pre-covet and hopefully after cover Post Covid-19, includes about 55 people on site here, including members of the child abuse squad, I'm from the NYPD, I'm a prosecutor of 16 people from safe horizon people from ACS and medical doctors who specialize in child abuse pediatricians. So all of these are here and in order to support families who are going through some type of child abuse, investigation and I want to point out too it's not just families who, unfortunately, a lot of our the families come here are not here because of something that happened because they made some kind of mistake. Communication. Unfortunately, maybe there's something somebody made an allegation that wasn't. Maybe that wasn't true. We're also here to support those families that unfortunately have to go through this process, which is I. Think for all of us, it's pretty daunting to talk to you know, maybe the detective think of detectives involved or ACS or all these people. We want to minimize the impact it has on a family as much as we can so Saferizer provides those services and assistance in perm and conducting forensic interviews with children for the team. We also provide crisis counseling and support services as soon as they walk in the door. We're working with that family to do what we can to support them right after the interview that, whether that's the caregivers, the children and we continue as long as they need to or connect them to services or other resources in their community. If they're not in near the Cac, our child, Etsy Center, excuse me and what so, that's and here at the child legacy center has names nothing mentioned we tend to. We are see the more serious cases of child abuse, so we see sex abuse, severe physical abuse and fatalities. Typically, those are the areas or categories I guess you might say that we see on a regular basis. We continue to stay open during the pandemic. We're at about 75 percent of volume we normally see over a thousand cases or a year we conduct over a thousand forensic interviews of children a year related to those types of allegations and the. So that's a big part of what we do throughout. Obviously, what we're doing on a regular basis, I think about that as even I think it was Catherine and we're talking about like what and what can you do like? What are people who are? Maybe aren't doing this specific work, but obviously you're care about your community and care about. You know as individuals and I often talk to people whenever I do a presentation. I talk about the difficulty children have to disclose abuse. We know that 55 to 70 of children who are sexually abused, do not disclose being abused until they're adults. If ever and there's an incredible amount and I could talk for another hour about you, know stories or real life situations, why children didn't disclose and there's so much shame involved to that societal pressure, community pressure and even family pressure for that child not to disclose so I encourage for all of us. I. Think it's all our duties to try to figure out. How do we make it easier for children to disclose I? Think often we've we're because of this thing, but even around sex but a stigma around child abuse. It's not something people want to think about, and certainly it's not something you want. It's not something you want to talk about. Normally so I think children often- and we often pick up on that our children are very perceptive. When we see children myself, it was a forensic interview and interviewed hundreds of children. It's numerous children who have said you know I, don't want to talk about this, because when I talk about it to my mom, she started crying or when I was talked about said something to my teacher. She got really upset or felt really you know so. Children pick up on this and I think oftentimes that either delays their disclosure of abuse or keeps them from talking about it at all, so I think as community members and leaders in the community and family members that we one of our primary goals is to think about. How do we make this easier for children? How do we become more comfortable talking about abuse where it's part of our vernacular, not that we need to talk about every day? But how do we make ourselves more comfortable talking about these issues and making it out there so resources for individuals, and so that there's less shame connected to it, there's less taboo and that we're able to address it and support our children even more than we do now so I think those are some of the things that and we can talk more and I'm sure there'll be questions but and ways we could try to connect, but just generally that's a little bit over your program and some of the pointers I just want to make. Thank you John. Thank you. If I could jump in just for a quick second I wanted to acknowledge that council member Helen Rosenthal has joined us and we are grateful for your presence. I understand the council. Member is not under time pressure and so can wait until the end of the presentations. Is that correct council member or do you have other commitments? No, I'm here. This is my last zoom of the day and I think I look like it, but I'm really happy to be here. It's like being at a wedding when you see two of your worlds collide. My day, job is working with savvy and safe, rising the New York alliance. These are the best of the best that you're hearing from today. So it's an honor to be among you thanks for joining us Shelly back to you. Thank you. Okay, the emphasis at the end was sexual abuse and we're gonna transition to Sarah Zaidi from New York alliance against sexual assault. Welcome, thank you and thank you all for having us and putting this together. It's you know when we first started talking about it, I was starting Catherine and it you know. The conversation arose from the needs that we were seeing particularly heightened through the Covid-19 pandemic and I just want to thank Nancy and John for keeping the Cacs open, because that is, you know. We work very closely with John, who does many of our trainings, but the child advocacy centers are really what we need: they're, the kind of the wraparound services that they have for children, which is a welcoming space and it's a one-stop shop. What the family justice centers are for adults going. You know facing gender-based violence, so that is what we need, basically in the community, so before I go into needs. I'll tell you my I'll, give you my background. I am by training a physician, but I've been practicing child therapy for many years, which is why child abuse and trauma with children is my passion and I see you know, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. We saw an increase in anxiety. I saw a lot more cases of abuse and I saw a lot more cases of suicidal tendencies in children as young as six, and so that's where this conversation stemmed from the New York City alliance against sexual assault was founded in 2000 20 years ago by rape, crisis programs in the city for them, and the idea was that, because rape crisis programs at that time were had limited resources, the idea was for an organization to help them with systems advocacy and with the larger policy pieces and legislature, you know and government since then. Obviously, things have changed, because now sexual violence work is not as taboo. It's the conversations are, you know, and also there's more of a cross-section between domestic violence and sexual violence and ipv, and all of that, whereas it was very separated before I, think savvy was one of the few places that was providing those services. But now there's a lot like say horizon is doing it. A lot of other organizations are doing it all together. Our role therefore has changed as well. I mean we basically in terms of specific to survivors. We provide direct services for legal representation as well as for counseling, but it's short-term counseling, because what we do is we provide crisis intervention and then we actually provide warm referrals to places like savvy and dove and safe horizons so that the longer-term work can continue, and our focus therefore then stays on policy and ensuring that the voices of the rape crisis programs across the city are being heard across the board. We also do you know. A large part of our work is training and we are the largest organization in New York state. Actually, that does in-person trainings for forensic examiners to medical providers, that is nurse practitioners, primarily Mds are invited. Physician assistants are invited, but they don't require certification to do a forensic exam, and that's actually one of the reasons why I'd asked Dr Jimenez to join us, and hopefully she will be able to talk to that point a little bit more. But we provide a five-day course. It's a 40-hour training that is certified by the Department of Health and by the International Association of forensic nurses, to train nurses and medical professionals to provide a trauma informed forensic exam when a survivor first goes to the ed. Obviously, that can be a very triggering event, and you know the idea is to make it a survivor-centered forensic exam when they go in. Essentially, this is the rape kit that will that it that you know in layman's terms. Well, we recently that you know the training had been happening for adults and adolescents for a long time, but when I came on, I joined the alliance a couple of years ago and I realized that there was no training for pediatric patients, that there was no forensic evidence, collection for pediatric patients and so I. You know we made a real push for it, and we've actually had three trainings now and we've trained approximately 60 individuals to provide safe exams on children younger than 12. This was a huge accomplishment, because no one else in the city is doing this or even in New York state. It's Ifn provided the International Association for forensic nurses. Does that you know it's virtual. It's an online. It's spread over many months. Ours is five hours, sorry five days, and then you know we do like clinical exams and we actually have live. Gynecological teaching associates come in so that nurses can practice a pelvic exam, as well as the interviewing process and a medical exam, a head-to-toe exam so that obviously in children, it's not invasive, and so it's a very different looking exam and we work with certified exam trainers. Certified nurses who've been doing it for over 30 years. So that is something that we've been doing. One of the challenges we've faced is in providing preceptorship. Receptorship is something that is a requirement to be certified to become a safe p, which is the designation for the pediatric nurses preceptorship, so, basically a nurse before she starts or before they start doing the exam on their own. They need to be I guess under supervision for at least three to four exams. Now there are very because there are few people trained in that. Therefore, there are very few people to supervise them. So what we've done is we've partnered with telesafe, which is a telehealth program in upstate, New, York and we've been working with hospitals because they are funded by Obs, so there's no cost to hospitals and it's just like paperwork, but even with that, we are finding resistance from Ed directors it just because you know what happens is then there's a cost to them for providing on-call nurses, because you do need to have somebody on call, and so obviously it's a cost thing. So one thing that you all can do is push for more funding for something like that to provide a roster for nurses that can be available that have been trained in the pediatric course. The other thing that we've been trying to work on is, with these child abuse pediatricians to provide perception, as well as with Dr Brown who's at the Cac, to allow one or two nurses that have graduated from a program to be under their supervision for as long as possible, but because, like they're literally four to six individuals who are able to provide the supervision we're really struggling with, we have 60 nurses, who've graduated. The program so by the time they rotate it's going to be a while. So that's something that we really need to push for as well, and then the other thing we do is we provide training in terms of trauma, informed and best practices to community-based organizations to rape, crisis programs, lawyers, anyone that comes in into contact with survivors, and you know what we. What we've noticed is that everyone believes that they're survivor, centered and shaman formed, but when you actually put them in the hot seat- and you do some rule plays you're, this could use some work, so we we've really been trying to push for that and I'm a doctor, so I can say this and I can disass, but we are the last people that are trained in a bedside manner. To be honest, it's like we were not provide. We were told to take a history and leave the rest to social workers. That is what our training is. That should not be the case. Anyone that interacts with a patient should be able to have a conversation that makes them feel safe and in pow and in a position of power, because you know when somebody has been abused, that power and control is taken, especially children, because they have never they've, never been able to make decisions on their own. Even if they've been brought into the ed, it is not their decision, it's their parents decision. So all of these situations are problematic right. So we do provide a lot of best practice. Support to physicians, I mean one of the things that we're doing now is to provide shorter trainings for residents. Because, again, during my residency and as far as I know, residents are not trained in forensic exams. There's not even like it's an elective. If you want to become a child abuse pediatrician, it's an elective, it should not be an elective. This should be a requirement, so we are we're offering free trainings for whoever is interested and again it's been hard to get into hospitals because hospitals are, you know we don't have the time, it's not a priority for them, and this is a problem because when a child, you know, unfortunately, some we encourage everyone to go to the Csc for forensic exam, because that is the place to go. But there are some that go to the er right and then what happens is because a nur, because a regular physician is not allowed to do a pediatric exam, they call the pediatrician, and if the pediatrician is not trained in that exam, then it's it could go awry. I mean it. You know it's not the most dramatic form and with children you have to be able to engage them in a certain way. You have to make them comfortable. Consent is a huge thing. They think that the consent comes from the parent. No, it does not. It comes from the child, they're human beings. You have to make sure that everybody knows what the legal rights are of the you know. What minus rights are so there's a lot of work to be done in providing this information to medical professionals and then, finally, the need that we felt was. You know the area that we felt was most lacking was psychiatric care in the city, free services for children and adults, but since we're talking about children, you know it's very hard to find. I know that every non-profit that we have tried has a wait list of months, just two to three months long. You know if a child has been abused, you want to get them in right away if they are ready to speak and even if they're, not you can provide them with that support. Now it's you know. The Csc again is a great place, but you have to be in the system to utilize those services, and ideally it would be great to replicate what the Cac has, so that it is available to everybody to all children that are either part of this they're, not part of the system right like there's some families who do not want to make a police report. Of course, ACS. You know mandated reporting and there is a requirement for that, but there are times when you don't know right and a child may just there's play therapy. Has such a large part in all of this I mean I've done play therapy for years. I mean stuff comes out through play therapy that doesn't come out otherwise, but and then, of course, you know if you need psychiatric help for other issues, the very few people that are willing to do sliding scale or do it for free it's either. You have to pay with insurance or mitigate it's there. It's just such a dirt of good child psychiatrist in the city, and so I would love to see more of that and a center that perhaps has all of these services in it. You know, in collaboration with our child abuse mutations and the Cac, so that we all like it's a wrap around right, like I mean savvy, is one of the few organizations that actually provides child sexual abuse services. They're very few organizations that focus on children and 70 of the abuse occurs in children in people under 18. So imagine that, like we are so focused on adults, but the children are the ones that need the help. I mean we are always I. Personally, you know in my practice, I'm always at a lawsuit who to refer to. If someone doesn't have insurance can't afford like 150 fee and isn't willing to wait for the three months that a non-profit is, you know, requires them to wait for. So that's where we are in terms of the needs and kind of what we are involved with the children's work. We do provide child services like a child therapy in our offices as well, but again it's crisis counseling, it's short-term. We have a wait list as well. We see adults and children. We have creative arts based therapists, drama therapists and play therapists, but it's limited. So that's my spiel I'll wait for questions later. Thank you all Shelly. You need to unmute again. Sarah mentioned savvy a few times savvy as Mount Sinai's, sexual assault and violence, intervention program, extraordinary program and I'll, we'll start with Lynn Reverend Cawley. Thank you and thank you all for being here, as was mentioned early on. This is not the brightest topic to be discussing on a December evening, so I appreciate all of you being here and being interested in talking about child abuse and not just about it, but what we can then do about it, and certainly hats off to my colleagues, one of my favorite things about working in the anti-violence efforts in New York City, is how we all work together. I've been doing this work for about 27 years now, and I've done it across three states: everything from super rural to hyper urban in New, York City, and there is nothing like the collaboration of organizations and agencies within the city that I've ever experienced. I started with savvy in 2005 and right away from the beginning. You could tell this was a whole different animal because, partly on the negative, it's because there's so much work to go around we're not competing, but it's also, this genuine sense that people want to do what's right for survivors, and so, however, we can all work together as the is what needs to be done and we do it. So it's really good to see you all from safe horizon and Sarah and Helen, as we are part of your day job, as you said all here, plus all of you. So to give you just a little bit of back background about savvy and then because so much has been said. That I would just repeat: I won't do that I'll! Tell you a little bit about what we specifically are focused on in terms of children's services but savvy started in 1984. We started out as a rape crisis program that only responded to the Mount Sinai hospital in east Harlem to that emergency department. How it began was in the 80s New York was actually pretty far ahead of the curve in terms of providing treatment for sexual assault survivors, but we still had a lot to learn and it still wasn't great. So one night a survivor came into the emergency department who had been sexually assaulted and after she had been treated and discharged medical students that had been working in the emergency department. That night said we have got to be able to do better than that and they actually pulled together. A proposal for starting a rape crisis program: they found a wealthy donor within the development section of Mount Sinai Hospital and sat down at her kitchen table and created savvy one of the reasons: I love. That story is just because it's fun and cool and grassroots-y, and I'm all about that, but I think because we started that way. We've carried that thread through our evolution as much as possible. So what we've really tried to do is be responsive to community needs and that's how we've expanded so from just being rape crisis. As Sarah said, we started to incorporate pretty early on domestic violence and specifically intimate partner violence into our services, because those were folks coming into the emergency departments as well. Then there were several other hospitals in both Queens and in Manhattan that reached out. They realized that we had a program where we were sending volunteer advocates certified through a 40-hour training that we provide. That is sanctioned through the Department of Health, and they said hey. Can you do that for us as well? So we expanded to the point where we are now in 11, different emergency department and urgent care settings, so Mount Sinai, Manhattan, Mount, Sinai, Queens, Harlem metropolitan Lenox Hill in the Upper East Side Mount Sinai Queens did I say that Elmhurst Queens hospital center and Mount Sinai Brooklyn press, the east, Harlem health, outreach program and Upper West side, urgent care I always feel like I'm being like an iq test or something when I'm rattling that off, like am I, going to remember the mom counting on my fingers. So we have about 193 certified volunteer advocates at this point, who go on call on a volunteer basis and at any time on their shift can be dispatched to any of those locations to serve survivors of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, sex trafficking and child sexual abuse. They're extraordinary people, I have to say, then what happened after people are seen in the emergency department. What, then, unfortunately, many people who experience acute trauma? They don't want to engage in services right away. They really need a break. They think that it's probably something if they don't talk about, they can forget about. They realize a little bit further down the road that is not happening and that they're having a lot of aftermath of the violence that they experienced. So where do they go? What we decided to do was create therapy options for a range. We don't go as young as safe horizon. Does it's not our specialty? It's usually children, say school age, then adolescent all the way up. Through older adults, we have a couple of people who specialize in elder care and elder abuse survivors of intimate partner, violence who are elderly. So we have six different locations now throughout Manhattan and Queens, with 11 different masters level licensed therapists who provide free therapy, a typically short term, but we will see people longer because, as Sarah had pointed out, there's such a dearth of longer term options that again, you have to be responsive to what the community needs, and particularly free services are very important. The therapists collectively speak 10 languages, so this is going to be another one of those Iq things see if I can remember all of them: english, spanish, portuguese, french, italian, polish Gujarati, Urdu, Punjabi Hindi, and we're about to have someone who is fluent in Hebrew and sign language. Someone who's working on that. So since the I don't count them as 12, because we're not quite there yet, but pretty soon, but again it's about being as accessible to as many people as possible. There are already so many barriers to treatment family, not being supportive, not knowing where to go worrying about the cost, not having insurance. Where are you going to be seen? How far do I have to go into Manhattan all the time if I'm living out in Astoria, whatever that we're trying to reduce as many barriers as possible by spreading out where our locations are and being as culturally and linguistically diverse as possible? Specialized programs started to become an issue, so we developed a sex trafficking survivors program through the queen's district attorney's office, which turned into queen's human trafficking intervention court, which then expanded now, there's trafficking intervention court in every city in the state, but we do ongoing therapy for those survivors and that tends to be longer term. Their abuse typically starts very young and, by the time they're tracked into a sex trafficking. Program referred to us they've experienced such complex trauma through a lifetime and that there is no such thing as short-term therapy or trauma or services or support for that. We do have a peers from that program who have graduated to a certain degree and we're trying to help them develop more skills, so they actually mentor other trafficking survivors who are still trying to get out of the life and that's been incredibly effective. I think trying to incorporate peer support as much as possible and with any of our survivors is really key, because you, actually, you can visualize by seeing someone else who has overcome or at least moved forward, but there is hope that you can do that as well. I think it's that role modeling that becomes incredibly important. We have a program specific for orthodox survivors. Again, it was brought to us because of our location at Mount Sinai, the Orthodox community, when we started this 20 years ago and very insular weren't talking about the problem in that community as much the extensive child abuse sexual abuse that was occurring. So we were approached and said there were a lot of people from the orthodox community that could come to mount Sinai for health care or to do volunteer work or visit relatives that they could say. They're coming to Mount Sinai go down into the tunnels literally, that are underneath the main campus come up into the savvy office and be seen for trauma and victim therapy go back down pop up into the main building and no one would ever know it was a way to allow them a safety of coming for support without the community. Knowing it's much more open now there there's no tunnel walking, but it's one of that's a program of ours that is consistently wait listed that there's just a great need and very few resources for that community. We have a full-time education and prevention department with three different full-time educators and the piece delivers the stones and why we are here to talk tonight and we have a couple of safe programs, so the sexual assault, forensic examiner programs, both at Mount Sinai of Queens and at Mount Sinai in East Harlem, and we also send our safes down to Mount Sinai Beth Israel. We have a roster of about 25 safes. They run the range from Rns to aprns, to Mds, to residents, to pas we're very fortunate with the dedicated committed amazing people that we have, who are really doing it, because their heart is in it and they're very concerned about survivors who come in. So we have a schedule where again they're on call and they do 12-hour shifts at a time only three of those with the help of the alliance, because it had never been an option before three of those are actually now trained to do pediatric exams, but three of them across three hospitals. You know whether they're on call or not what they have agreed to do is be available if they're available, assuming they're not working to take calls from the emergency department. If a child comes in and there is no safe, examiner, that's pediatric trained to at least do consultation to at least talk to the attending to at least run through or calm that person down. I believe that the anxiety that comes from a physician, a resident and attending whoever it is in the emergency department, when they're confronted with a sexual assault survivor particularly a child, is that they know how important it is. They know how fragile the situation is. They know how vital the evidence may be from a criminal justice standpoint. They know the trauma that this child may have experienced and they don't want to add to. It. Comes from such a good place, but it's very deep-rooted anxiety, so a lot of times it's a matter of kind of talking them through it. Ironically, I'm doing a training for the peds attendings and the adult ed attendings at Mount, Sinai Morningside on Monday morning, specifically about doing pediatric exams. We definitely prefer them to go to the cacs. That is the stellar place. That is the best survivor, informed kind of care, particularly for children, but for some families that isn't an option for any number of reasons: they're more comfortable coming to their community hospital. They were brought there and that's where they are. So we don't want to have to transfer them necessarily or timing is an issue. There are a number of things that might factor in so we want to be able to provide the best care we can for kids when they're in that situation with us. What we need is more people to have the time to be able to go through the pediatric training so that we have a deeper roster and also like Sarah was saying the psychiatry piece of it is super important. Many psychiatrists for adults as well as children are actually opting out of insurance all together. So you're talking a lot of psychiatrists who may charge if you're lucky 350 an hour, your average family. It can not do that. It's just completely out of reach for most people, and particularly when insurance is not any kind of option at all for reimbursement. So, and that is a particular concern for our adult patients, as well as our adolescent and child patients. Also I did want to say, because adolescents- and we say, like 10 years old and up there, really is no bottom line for being able to consent to medical and sexual assault care and related care in the emergency department. You have to assess the ability of that child that young person to understand the pros and cons of what they're being offered and one of the things that we run into and we work really hard is training medical staff in the emergency departments to know what those minors rights are. As Sarah was saying: it's not immediately they're under 18, so the parent gets to decide oftentimes, that's actually counter to what the young person wants and would be contraindicated for them. So it's a matter of getting everyone to understand that there's so many things about children and adolescents and young people that are different that need to be taken into consideration. So it's a lot of training that needs to go on and I will shut up now, because that's all I needed to impart I think your questions are probably much more important. So there you have it. Thank you so much Lynn sure, I assume Angela is not with you this year, yeah, I'm sorry. She got ill at the last minute, so she wasn't able to come. So I'm trying to channel her as Helen and Sara I think no Angie she's a dynamo I wish she were here, but I'm trying my best to sling her, I'm sure you really filled in for the things she would have said, and we appreciate it. Thank you. Do we have all the imminent with us? I, don't see her on our list. I've been well. I've been watching. The attendees list actually should I look at the I'll look at both lists. Nope I don't see her yet I, don't think so. Okay, thank you. Where is Helen Rosenthal hi? How long would you like to speak? Might remember my mouth full? Oh no. You want me to learn that well, not much more. I'm really interested, I'm really. I'm sorry, I didn't realize and you're entitled to no worries. This is lunch. Okay, so I mean every time I hear these professionals I learn something new. Their work is incredibly nuanced and hard, and so it was a pleasure hearing everyone tonight we work together for the community boards benefit I work with these advocates in my role as chair of the committee on women and gender equity, and we work together on policy issues like making sure that the NYPD is well trained, in particular their special victims division, the division that is responsible for investigating sexual assaults, to make sure that they're trained in the trauma-informed ways that you just heard about tonight for how medical professionals are trained and many of the people you see here are doing the trainings and we work together on a variety of domestic violence issues as well, and we've accomplished a lot together, I think I really do and then, in terms of the budget. These are the groups that I'm responsible for in the council to make sure that their funding doesn't get cut, to make sure that to find ways for us to get more money to them because of the God's work that you just heard them describe and yeah it's just a privilege. I'm sorry, I'm going to turn it over to the community board to ask questions because I get to talk to you all the time, but you should all know it's just such a privilege to work with you dedicated smart people who really care about those who, whose voices are not heard so I really appreciate. Being here. Thank you, Helen for all your wonderful work and the council on these type of issues and other work too. Thank you and we appreciate you being here this evening. Okay, I have one question to start us off and then we'll go around in non-cove. At times, I'm curious from the various agencies. Do you get referrals from our public schools and other schools and follow up and what happens when schools close from March to June over the summer and then a good part of question before so? Whoever would like to take it go ahead so when, in the child, it's a great question in the child, efficacy, centers. Historically, the overwhelming reporters of child abuse are school officials, they're teachers, you know, and we did see a big drop. You know in March and April in just reporting our numbers dipped way down for two months and, quite frankly, they're they've they're back up again what we have seen I think we're maybe about 20 percent less than we were, but the cases that we are seeing are all serious I think just proportionately we're seeing a higher number of sex abuse than severe physical abuse, but we're also finding the reporters are a little different that it's family members calling in on other family members. It's hospitals calling cases in community service organizations, so it is not which has historically always been kind of the school officials. I do think they're getting some training. I think you know the board of vet of DOE of Hada how to kind of see kids you know remotely and try to have eyes on them, but we are finding it's more concerned. Neighbors. You know family members that are calling in reports. Okay, Lynn, do you want to answer that I can effectively unmute myself without my glasses on we. What was concerning to us is the dip, because I agreed with Nancy completely a lot of the referrals on child abuse would come through the school system, and so, when that closed down it, just it puts an ice dagger in your heart, wondering what's happening what we were seeing with our adults. We did go fully remote and, interestingly enough, the clients that we continued to have, we maintained our caseloads and then some and people were coming to all of their appointments and they really needed that connection and they really needed an opportunity to not be so isolated and but we had to get super creative with how to create space for them to be able to speak with their clinician, their therapist without the abusive partner, the abusive parent, that's in the home, knowing what they were doing. We noticed that the violence, the level of violence became much more serious during that time, and there were many more of the survivors experience more physical trauma from their abusive partner and we weren't hearing that much about the kids. So that's scary and at the same time, because adolescents and minors and young people have certain rights about receiving sexual assault care and mental health care without their parents, knowing because that way, they'll at least access it might be safer for them to not let their parent know or their guardian know. We work with the school system to be able to connect with that young person and that isn't possible when they're quarantined at home. They can't really get an appointment with a therapist on zoom, because the parent is right there. So it's been very challenging in that way and the therapists have been extraordinarily stressed about it, but trying to be as creative as possible. Okay, thank you can I quickly, chime in so yeah. So what was interesting was that during the summer, especially though the cases of sexual abuse that were coming into the hospitals were higher than the ones that were coming into, if they were adults, and the reason was because that were being reported, the reason was because parents were bringing children in for a physical exam for a sickness or something else, and then the pediatrician would notice that there was more going on. So that was probably the only Ju you know just like Nancy and Lynn said. Obviously, the schools are the main source of referrals, but this was an interesting shift that we saw in the hospitals- okay, very interesting, okay, Catherine, thanks to all of you, it's so great to see you I want to just raise a raise. I have two questions and one has to do with how we can be useful or helpful for you in your work. We've talked about Sarah, you and I talked about a lot of different issues: kind of implant in planning this meeting and tonight we've talked about the need for more forensics and trauma-informed practice, training, free psychiatric care for children and there's, probably I'm assuming there's a need for more child advocacy, centers or support for those that exist. So what I'd like to raise with the committee is the option of maybe choosing one of these areas to focus on maybe postponing our meeting our upcoming meetup meeting agenda so that maybe we could focus in on one of these areas again for January and then just push back or schedule for what by one month, if that's, okay with everyone, that's like an option but just to ask this the this everyone who's here like what's a priority right now in terms of where we might be able to bring people together or advocate for something that's very specific and that's urgently needed. That's my first question and also something for the committee to think about, and then also a really great point that was raised at the very beginning is the difficulty of children disclosing and what we need to do to kind of help and create a supportive environment and relationships for children to disclose, and so I wanted to hear. I actually teach writing, and so a lot of this comes up when students write, but how can we create opportunities and kind of empower children to have more voice and to give them communication tools in a way that's safe for them, and so those are the two questions that I have the first. What can we help you with in terms of advocacy or bringing people together? What's the priority and the second, what are some strategies or what can? What are you working on, and what can we do to kind of create, more supportive environments and relationships for children to disclose or ask questions or just communicate about sexual abuse? Well, for the second question, I, can you know I remember when I was doing specifically education with kids? You know back in the day when we used to do good, touch, bad touch and just say no and tell someone kind of stuff what became apparent early on and I think is still probably. To my mind, one of the priorities is what John was saying earlier, that you have to start with the adults ironically, because the adults have to be able to hear it and be receptive. We know from research that how a survivor is treated and responded to upon that. First disclosure is the best indicator of how well and how quickly they will recover so having whoever that adult is going to be able to hear it and respond compassionately and to believe right away and figure it out later, but in that moment really be there for that. Child is key, and it's not just. How do you react when a child says this to you? But what is your behavior in general I? Remember a parent telling me once that their child hadn't reported sexual abuse that had been going on from a neighbor for a long time, because one night they were watching like the TV news and there was a pedophile who had been caught and it was on television and the father had said. If that ever happened to my kid I'd find the guy and kill him didn't say it to the child. Wasn't trying to make any grand statement, but the child absorbed that and said. If I tell my dad is going to hurt the person and he is going to go to jail, and that is not worth it. I can't disclose it. It's like a protective factor for other people, so it's reaching adults I think with how to live in such a way around children. That invites or allows an avenue for a disclosure to happen and then respond to it appropriately. Just to piggyback off that I think Lynn really said that well, I think we talk after talking a lot of presentations. I do is just talking about being comfortable even with private parts names. Just to give an example: I had a friend of mine who knows what I do obviously and when his children were young around two and one years old. He asked me he goes John like what you know. What names do we call should I use with our kids or private part names and I was like well how about penis and vagina. You know like how does that when he goes? Oh, my gosh, because I don't know if I can say that to my kids, you know like, and I'm sure you know, I'm sure if we went around the room or in around the room or the zoom room here, that each of us would have different private part names or names that we've used when our children with our children are when we were children and really that's about us as adults, as even Lin was talking about being uncomfortable ourselves. It's not the children that aren't comfortable, but it's the children ourselves being uncomfortable with just even talking about private parts. So I think it's small steps like that, because these are important and I always like to bring this up because, as I said, I've done a lot of over a thousand interviews. A large majority of those were sex, abuse, interviews and I get concerned, because when there's a four-year-old who says during that interview that their you know Uncle my uncle put his you know finger in my pocketbook. What does that mean? You know and from a criminal standpoint from an I guess, investigative standpoint that makes it very difficult for to move forward because pocketbook like well? What does that mean? But that's what's one name we heard many times for children use for a child to use for their vagina, and so it's concerning for that investigation then, but I feel like it's even more concerning for how many times how many parents have heard their child say that their four-year-old three-year-old four-year-old five-year-old say something like that: use a term like pocketbook and assume that they're really talking about the little pocketbook they carry around. They don't realize their child is even being sexually abused because they're not using the right. The term vagina it's so or penis for that matter, and because we as adults- and this is where our responsibility comes in- to be more give them the words to use how to communicate even when they are in trouble or communicate when they're. You know, when their friends are in trouble, they're talking about things or can how do we help? We, as adults, have to take their responsibility to know better how to talk about sex for one be more comfortable with it to talk to our children, so we can do that, but also a sex abuse. You know how that is such a taboo topic and we feel uncomfortable and children pick up on that and then realize like. If my parents aren't comfortable talking about it, then I'm not sure I'm supposed to talk about it either, and we see that even after child and just to add to that I think along those lines for parents to realize. We know, statistically over 90 of the sex abusers. Are people that the family knows they're, not this the myth of a it's, a man, who's wears a trench, coat and lives in his mother's basement. That's not a reality over 90 of the time, so I can't tell you how many parents, after we've, been through an interview with a child who's given explicit details of being sexually abused. They have no doubt in your mind, you walk into that room and tell their parent. You know like what has happened and their first response is. It couldn't be. You know, he's such a nice guy he's so great with kids. You know he volunteers. His time he's. You know and I hesitate to say that, because I, don't think all minute, I'm a man you know like I, don't want to think that men who yeah that's a great thing too, but sometimes we're in such denial or even the thought that something could like that could happen and that awareness, because it's such a taboo topic so uncomfortable that many times things are missed as a result. So, just being aware and feeling more comfortable to talk about those things is a huge step and kind of the work and to just and for even as Lynn was talking about, there's a stigma there they're, like oh I, can't even talk about this, like somebody might get killed. You know like as a child children pick up on those things very quickly and then and incorporate that into the way they think about I think so just some thoughts so having a concrete language to talk about sex and sexuality and bodies. That's like specific and concrete, that's the kind of a shared language and then also demonstrating comfort and instead of like shame around talking about those things and going to what Sarah was saying earlier, also kind of putting children in a position of power where they can or take where it's okay for them to articulate what they feel and what they're experiencing and that they have kind of rights over their body and that they can kind of express that and ask for that and be heard. So is it all those things memory right, yeah I, just want to jump in I, think just specific for your community on the Upper West side, I think what would be you know what we're all seeing is to make these kinds of services accessible right for your residents. I think that's the main thing, because again, as Lynn was saying earlier, you know it's hard to venture further than your neighborhood for a weekly appointment, and that is what this would be and so a clinic that is similar to what a Cac does where, which is warm and welcoming it, you know, has child size. Furniture has people that know how to address sexual abuse, and the language has a psychiatrist on. You know who can treat children who is familiar with abuse and then has co. You know within the Mount Sinai system has direct contact with folks that can refer. You know that they can refer to for a forensic exam. That I think is what your community can. You know just if we're focusing on upper West side I, think that would be helpful if I could jump in on this. Just a little bit, you know there is there's specific funding that each council member is allotted to give in their community to address these issues and there's no doubt other communities have it. You know so much times worse than we do and in fact the money is allotted based on the number of 911 calls that are made, and not surprisingly, you know, on the Upper West side, we get a smaller amount of money than you know, Richie Torres in the south Bronx, but we get funding as well and we distribute that funds to pretty much everyone on this group on this zoom who do an amazing job. But one thing that I learned is that the upper West side is not it's not like. There's anything special about us so that sexual abuse, child abuse isn't happening. I mean there's very little correlation to wealth and one of the arguments I try to make in the council is, you know, yeah, okay, it's worse in the Bronx, but you have to give my community money, because the one in 10 number applies to the Upper West Side and I've now gotten to know the places in our community that are pretty hidden unless you know about it that take care of kids who have been sexually abused or are there for adults, different therapy and the wait lists. Similarly very long you can't get in and at some level it's even harder for upper West Siders because they don't qualify for the free services but they're. It's not. You know, they're all different levels of economic. You know income on the Upper West side and there are people who fall in the middle and really need the free services, but can't access them because they're just a little bit. You know they're above the poverty line. You know. If I can I'm going to brainstorm an idea, I'm going to take Catherine at her word and just brainstorm, an idea that we've talked about with the agency called ngbv, which is the city's agency to address gender based violence, and that is the child care. Centers are often in the family, justice centers, not often not all the time but like in Staten Island and there's only one per borough, and it's always struck me that the one in Manhattan you know is down by city hall. It's there for a reason, great transportation. You know it's central for that reason, but I've really been wanting to see a pop-up family Justice Center in Washington Heights, for example. You know again close to transportation, but I think advocating for some more family justice centers would be welcome. It's kind of like our own West side campaign against hunger. You would be surprised how many people in our neighborhood they are feeding today. The numbers are increasing every day, but they also take their van for example, and take it to Washington Heights in order to help there. So one idea is a pop-up family justice center. These are city-run centers I, don't know, maybe a pop-up child advocacy center can Sarah. Can you talk about the difference between the family, justice, centers and the child advocacy center? So people can understand the difference. Would that be possible? Yeah sure and John pleased Nancy to chime in as needed. So the family justice center is was an initiative by the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, and it that is a one-stop shop for anyone who has experienced you know domestic violence or sexual violence, and you can access NYPD there you can access counseling, you can get any kind of case management help. You need legal services. Prosecutors offices are located there as well housing services, so anything that you need to get out of that abusive relationship or support. While you are in that abusive relationship, they also have a children's. It's called the Margaret's place, which is a children's, a daycare facility which isn't daycare, but it's basically when the parent is coming in for services and they can't leave the child anywhere. So they have a space there for children to wait. While the you know the mother or the whoever is the guardian, is there seeking help? So that is the family justice center? They are there's one in every borough and then the child advocacy center is run by state horizon it's a different entity, but they are basically also a one-stop shop but also have NYPD also have prosecutors and a phys like a child abuse, pediatrician counselors everybody and they're entirely focused on children alone. So anyone that has a referral like has a case that has gone through the child protective services, which is ACS in New York or through. If a police case was filed, they can then be seen at the child advocacy center for services, whereas for the family Justice center, you don't need to have an active case, I wish- and that was true, but just so you know, like our I wish. That was true tomorrow morning at nine we're having a meeting with the top leadership of all the these s, because there are about 60,000 child abuse reports. You know coming into the state central registry every year and our child advocacy centers at our peak can manage about 10,000 of them and that's you know just our physical size and location. So we have been forced to kind of only deal with the most serious we're having a discussion tomorrow about rethinking. Are we getting? You know, I want all these kids I would love to see all sixty thousand, but so, but you know we're daily kind of having to make these horrific decisions about. You know which families really could benefit from this and, quite frankly, which ones is it intrusive and shouldn't be coming to our doors. All together, you know, there's a disproportionate amount of reporting of kids of color. You know that's. We could have another whole conversation about that, but you know my immediate worry is I. Do think we're going to get hit financially and then I just am very worried that just our core services of each of the five ccs really remain open and can provide vital services for these kids and families for the next couple years, just because I do think the amount of suffering the loss. You know Helen, you were referring. You know it's just people are hungry, you know so is as horrible as sex abuse is. You know some of them, quite frankly, are most concerned about being evicted tomorrow or you know, literally being homeless. So you know, I just feel. I also think we need to kind of deal with the reality of these are going to be really rough times. So I'm just thinking of if they're, tough financial times you know what are the essential services that we absolutely need to continue, even if they're reduced a little bit, which I hope not and then I just think we have to get super creative about. How do we share or better coordinate the extremely limited mental health treatment services, psychiatric services which I think you were referring? Kind of increase of suicidal ideation? We're seeing that as well, these kids are suffering. You know, I'm really worried about them. So I don't know. There's a letter and there's five child advocacy centers one per borough. Where is the one in Manhattan? That's where John is he's up in Harlem he's there right now, 122nd street okay, yeah 122nd at Park, Avenue Robert I, saw your hand before yeah hi. This is a very impressive panel and I'm very happy to see that the work that we're doing on the board and Hnhc our meetings are becoming more concrete, that our meetings are having outcomes where proposals are being established and work plans are being listened to and agreed to correct. Some of the issues and I have a I have quite a long experience as a supporter member of the movement and vendor and employee of in DV with the violence intervention program, which I'm sure you know vip from 1984 to 2008. So I have three questions and I think that I'm not sure what the importance of the order is, but the under to bank off the theme on children, and it would be the therapeutic theme that does the child have an inborn sense of loyalty. That is, can he feel or she feel that they're betraying the family either of the parents or good neighbor that they see frequently enough the word betrayal? Is there such a thing in the child and is that something that is that a barrier? Is that a challenge that the therapist to get the child to open up, because speaking up equals betrayal in many cases, and so that is that one of the issues I see that Misano is nodding and I don't know I'll hold my should I just list my questions: shall we or should I just wait until one at a time, I bet John's nodding more than me or Sarah, but John you want to chime in betrayal. Is a big, no yeah, I think you're, absolutely right, Robert! Thank you. So much for bringing that up, I mean there's so many things, but I think what we often think about, especially when it comes to sex abuse. Is that there's a relationship there mind a very warped and manipulative one, but I've had many kids who, even during a forensic interview where the abuse has happened, they don't want to talk about it because their fear that they're going to upset the person who is their abuser who's sexually abusing them. The fear that they may go to jail, the fear that they may get in trouble. I, remember interviewing an 11 year old boy who was sexually abused by his babysitter, and that was you know as we're talking about. He finally told what happened and is at the end of the interview. I asked him: do you have any questions for me and his only question was: you know, he's not going to get in trouble? Is he and that was his concern, he's going to someone wasn't before himself for his family? He was concerned that this person, who he who had developed a relationship with, was going to be in trouble, and so that's very much a barrier and there's so much that which, like I, was talking about before, if over 90 of the time, it's somebody who they know and trust and so they're worried about portraying that individual and portraying their family, who also probably knows and trusts that person too. So it's just you you're exactly right and that's it can make it very complicated. It's also more complicated with the culturally specific population. You know, there's the concept of filial, piety and asian culture, there's also joint family systems, and so imagine- and you know, of course what we call the shroud of secrecy around it. So anytime, a child speaks up, there's ramifications so that and that sense of loyalty is invoked upon quite a bit. Okay, Robert number two well since Sarah just touched on the cultural. My next, not it's not really a question. It's an issue because it's there they hold this whole. I've always been very doubtful. It's too strong a word, but the whole idea of cultural diversity when you're dealing with as many cultures as we're dealing with now increasingly and with the cultures that we're hosting, bringing with them their culture and their beliefs and their privileges and the whole thing on the child, raising the child. What is child abuse and we don't want to go into honor killings, and we don't want to go into this and that and the other thing, but- and this is a difficult one for this panel in a public discussion. But the way Sarah was saying that there are cultural issues with respect to I'm thinking of adults and I'm not thinking entirely of the women, because in the in my experience with the clients, of course, at Vip were all women and children and they're protecting the women and children. But even with respect to the boys and the husbands and the brothers that were looking for the women. There's. The question of I have a right to get my woman back, and the boy feels that it is his role to report where the mother's living and I've dealt with some of these situations personally and as a property manager for the agency and so the whole question of cultural diversity in addressing this, and that there's a it's like a separate context and the challenge is it's quite an important one, because we have cultures where you know if you're talking about sexual assault is genital mutilations, considered sexual assault, you see what are the definitions and what are the rights that cultures have with respect to their own children and with within the context of their culture? So it's not one thing that you have two or three neighbors but we're having we're developing communities of culturally specific identities. I see a lot of head nodding. Anybody want to share anything in particular, or just do you get my point, though strong strongly go ahead. Okay, go ahead! Sorry, oh I mean I, think you bring up an incredible, incredibly important point Robert and something we deal with on a regular basis. One of the great strengths of New York City, is its cultural diversity, but it also makes it much more complicated and even people who have grown up, maybe in a different culture and different understanding of even discipline when you get to discipline, how do you discipline your child, and so you know these are things we think about a lot and try to decipher as best we can. Obviously in New York City, we have to follow. You know, follow the law above how what that dictates? What is acceptable and not acceptable and I know we're. I'm really grateful that we have detectives who specialize in child abuse investigations, because they're also trying to decipher like. Is this an intentional or is this a concerning situation? Is this a cultural misunderstanding not that they don't hold people to that law, but at the same time there's some leeway in there? They can make trying to make decisions based on that so and then you know also education and this gets into you know, I think somebody mentioned even in the chat about prevention when, especially it comes to physical discipline like how what are alternatives to that you know even myself. I grew up in a family where that was just part of the culture. But what are alternatives? You can't just say don't do that. But how do you say? There's other ways of disciplining children, other possibilities and not even to get into I mean certainly could get into more of like what could that was the potential impact based on research. We have about how that can impact children, even physical discipline, not to mention sex abuse and those types of things, but I'm unless some of the other panelists I think have spoken enough unless some other people, chime in also yeah I, mean I completely agree, I Robert. All of your points are so valid and they're, just so many nuances that we have to read between the lines, but you know none of that makes the abuse, okay, right and I. Think that's where the education that John was talking about comes into play like we, you know there are so many cultural norms that are accepted. You know what you were saying about the this. The son wanting to you know, share the address and stuff I mean. That is something we see very often, and you know especially in patriarchal societies right, but it's our job to break those norms a little bit to help them see that look. Yes, we understand where you're coming from, but also that doesn't make it okay, so just questioning that a little bit and helping them see a different point of view. Perhaps okay, you know: Robert we've had two hearings on Fgm. It was interesting to hear you refer to it and at both hearings everyone tries to be very culturally sensitive, but at the end of the day it's illegal in the United States it's illegal in New, York and people will be prosecuted for doing it. I think it is important that our educators understand about it, because children will, you know, say they're going home for their Christmas break and be all chipper, and then they come back and it's a changed person, so the city impressively is doing some education around that they've done a great job at ACS, educating the outreach workers so that Fgm doesn't become a reason to take a child out of a home. Can I'm sorry to interrupt you Helen, but can you or someone define Fgm? What is female genital mutilation in case people? Don't know so F go ahead. Ftm is female genital mutilation. It can be as much or as little one way or another. It's mutilation, it's maybe one of the doctors could do a better job explaining the physicality of it. But it's a procedure that cuts the genitalia of a little girl I, think so that they can't feel an orgasm, and it is something that is done in some cultures and has amazing ramifications for that child's life, even to the point of when they get pregnant and giving birth. And what do you do if the medical professionals that now young woman is seeing doesn't recognize or understand what has happened to the vagina? And so we have to make sure that our medical professionals are trained as well and I. Think there's only one I think it's only CUNY, that's teaching about this. So we have to. We are actually working on legislation to require department of Health make sure that the hospitals in the city and medical students understand it when they see it did I, do a fair job, Sarah yeah, so I just want to add that it's also it's the so there's two different things: one is removing the clitoris and the other is actually sewing up the vagina and it's done usually without anesthesia and it's an extremely painful process. But it's also, you know just imagine when a girl goes through puberty and is you know, childbirth and all that it just rips the pelvic area apart and it can be very damaging Robert. You want to do number three and we'll move on and number three well. First of all, thank you Helen and Sarah for even explaining it more deeply, maybe as a defense mechanism, you feel that you have enough knowledge and you don't really want to know anymore and that's not denial, but you feel that you're being enough of an advocate just knowing so much, but when you have it explained by people that are more directly in medical communities more directly involved. It just reopens your mind again to the atrocities that we're capable of in an event the third one direct is related directly to the title of our workshop tonight and that's the training, because we're talking about the er staff and I've worked with er staffs in the 70s. But this was women. There was a group in the for the older people in the panel I, don't think anyone's there was born, yet only you and I Shelley up in the Norman up in the northern Bronx I was director of the community relations at north central Bronx hospital, and there was a group. Local group called women against rape and they were floating around trying to get entry into the hospital and there was no unit that would sponsor them as it were. People were sensitive, certainly, the Er Dr Gold Frank very strong, but they needed a host. So they came to my office. I. Think I was in the office two days and these ladies come to the office three of them, Debbie Green and a few others, and they said we need a. We need somebody to help us I said well. You know, anyway, this long story short. They did get involved. So there was that was talking about rape protocols in the emergency room and training, physicians and pas, and the doctors themselves when a woman come what to recognize and so on and so forth. It's a very same thing that we're talking about today with children but on training and I. Think I alluded to this in one of our last meeting, Shelley with the police and I think we had a command or two in the audience and I made the remark that and I used. One of the examples very dramatic examples of maybe 10 years ago, 12 years ago, where these two strapping detectors right out of central booking, responded to a call in crown heights, and they you know in those days they wore the suits. You know right out of Mulholland road. You know and the fellow had come out of the house. It was a brownstone and he come out of the house. He was standing on the stoop and someone said: that's him. There was a big wow and he supposedly beat up his grandmother or something like that. Really sick man and detective number one approached him. Are you Mr So-and-so? He says yes and he lifted up a shotgun and just blew this detective away. Of course, the second detectives runs to action and he gets shot too, so they were both murdered right there, but that's just a dramatic picture, but in my work as property manager and a first responder for Vic I would be present when the police were called either to move a woman from one shelter apartment to another, and on occasions my hair stood on end partially from shock, but also fear at what I heard uttered by some of the police that came to assist the counselors in resolving the issue where there was domestic and there's always a kids involved. So when we have these conversations, it's very difficult for me to separate child from mothers very difficult, because they're always together and but the police need as much training as the medical staff that is looking at the child, because it's the policeman's sensitivity that can make the difference in any encounter whether you're talking about a child, whether you're talking about an adult if the child is called to the home and if the NYPD is called to the home. If he's not sensitive to that mother and that family he's not necessarily gonna. Be sensitive to the child, he may not take it the extra mile that he has to as a as part of the solution, so the training to me of the police department is inadequate. Okay and now we know that the police are human beings like you and I, and that they have issues at home and that you know some of them are batterers and some of them abusers, and we get you know headlines all the time. Okay, but the training I think falls short of what is needed in NYPD. So in addition to training providers in medical settings and sensitizing them, and so they can recognize the whole thing. I think intensive training of the police is something that we know if I could just jump in on that as well. We had a full hearing about this a couple years ago and passed some laws around training and staffing for the special victims. Division and training for the police department as well and I, want to start by saying Robert your story about two police officers losing their lives because they've put themselves out there to try to help is heartbreaking and every that every time that happens, it's unacceptable. We had that happen here in New, York City. If you'll remember a couple of years ago, when two officers were killed while sitting in their vehicle, doing nothing but being present. That's outrageous, but I do think, though, that the police department has come a long way and of course it depends on the officer, but I was on the phone on a zoom yesterday with a city official who was telling me that at any given time now 65 of the police officers. So this is the third now 37,000 people who are out there are trained in implicit bias and in mental health crisis. What to do in a mental health crisis and which is the highest number I've heard so I think the police department is trying. You know sorry, I've been up since eight o'clock. The other thing is that the city has now set up these mobile crisis teams, so that will go to an emergency. What do they call an edp, an emotionally disturbed person so for those calls I think the city is trying hard to have a team of individuals to include not just social workers or mental health professionals, but also having the first responders be better trained at de-escalating at noticing. What's going on and trying to calm the situation, these are just horrible instances and things can go wrong like that and you're right, better training of all involved is the answer. The city's goal is to train all of the Emts within the next fiscal year in crisis response and trauma-informed crisis response, I mean even the language that the police department and City Hall is using is at the standard that the advocates have been calling for all these years. Incredibly important, great Helen. Before we go to our next committee member, can you share the idea that you shared with me about our next meeting from the Cva ps, yeah, so John I, think I forget who mentioned it John or Nancy that safe horizon staffs every precinct now with a crime victim advocate and so that that's what Cva I don't know? What p stands for quad victim assistance program there we go the city funds, this now thrive funds it now there are two in every precinct and I talk with them regularly. They're, just terrific- and please repeat that name, crime victim assistance program- and there are two embedded during the day hours at every precinct and I think it would be interesting to invite them in I. Don't know if they can work their hours, because this would be a night shift person to come. For you know a community board meeting, but I'm sure safe horizon can help bring someone in honestly. They are busy on the Upper West side. You know, abuse comes at every socio-economic level and the cbaps in our district are very knowledgeable know the families where things are happening during Covid-19 they're working harder to do outreach with the families that they've been working at working with, and I'm very close also to the PSA officers at Amsterdam houses, which are the police officers. They are trained very well trained for the NYCHA residents to have somebody to talk to and they're doing more outreach. Now during Covid-19, you know unrequested, but just outreach, it's an amazing thing and it's also safe horizon and kudos to them. Great. Thank you so much Helen for that great idea and to share that with us. I just want to remind everybody just about the timing, because I can't believe the time has just gone by so fast. We've all been learning so much so it's 8.50 and there's a few others on the committee that I think we still need to hear from and then also I know that there's a number of people from the community board here and then we also have three people that signed up to speak from the public. So I just wanted to remind people of time and who's next Shelly, okay, yes, you mentioned outreach, and this is for Helen, her friend who wants to answer during Covington schools close and people, I'm not saying something against the police, but a lot of people are too afraid to go into the police station. How does somebody get your help? How do they know you're out there? You know if I can jump in, because this was a really hot button issue for me: Maj and really pushed the city hall to make sure that groups like safe horizon and the violence intervention program which Robert is talking about, that they had funding to message out to all New Yorkers, that their doors were open for people and one of the things that we got the department of education to do was we helped them develop a flyer and ngbb. You know I think maybe safe horizon helped with it that was English on one side Spanish on the other, and we put them in all the grab-and-go meal bags right, oh great, so just getting the word out that services are available. That's primarily to parents, though, and you know which is different than child abuse, but this was primarily so people who were survivors would know because many of them have been locked in their homes now for months. Thank you, Rosa. Do you have a question? Yeah I do I know that the Mount Sinai person spoke about multilingual services, but I wonder if safe horizons and New York City alliance also have options like that for everyone thanks, okay I could jump in I mean John might tell you specifically, but we have multilingual I mean I, don't know, I, think we once kind of like over 50 I, don't know how many languages, but you know we really are trying to have our staffing kind of be more representative of our communities, of the clients, we're serving the languages, the cultures, the races so and we do have interpretation services sign language yeah. We pay a lot of attention to that good question. Yeah I mean same with Andy I mean I, know at the Manhattan childhood center. We have it's between eight and ten languages, I think represented from our staff, and we also really try to know and find places. Oftentimes people within their communities like that have specific language, so yeah, that's definitely something we do the best. We can to find that specific language and cultural understanding, I think, is also important along with that language. So yeah, absolutely it's a good question. Okay, any board members, but just in case anyone from city hall is listening. We don't spend enough on the many variety of languages that are out there. You know Jackson Heights, 157 different languages are spoken good point. Thank you any other board members who Clement has his hand up. Okay, please once again, Catherine and Shelly kudos to you for putting together such an incredible panel, all of the panelists are so impressive. This topic is very near and dear to my heart and Catherine knows that I was advocating to have a friend of mine on the panel, but perhaps we'll have him another time he's a former Fbi profiler and a specialist in child. You know crimes and sex crimes, specifically against children, and I've been privileged to be friends with him for about 30 years, and I've learned so much and attended many of his trainings. You may know him. His name is Jim Clementi, so he's taught me a lot and I'm not an expert, but he is- and you all are a couple of things that just takeaways that I'm hearing tonight. Obviously prevention is a huge word- that's been said quite a bit teaching and training and of course, that all starts at home. You know even the best intentions, as was described where people you know just using proper anatomical names for genitalia and are getting rid of the shame around it, and so that children can feel comfortable and not be shamed or fearful when they want to describe or point out where they were possibly touched, or obviously in you know, ideally to be prevent. You know preventing that also the proper boundaries and being able to say no as a child and not to obey any adult, just because they're an adult, because that is incredibly dangerous. And what was my friend taught me. The most benign example of that is when a parent innocently might say well give your aunt or give your grandma a kiss. They don't want to give them a kiss, and then they learn that they should do something that they're not comfortable with and that's the beginning of not having better boundaries so respecting the child when they say they don't want to be held, or they don't want to kiss someone or be kissed. One word I didn't hear tonight, which I'm sure all of you are very familiar with is the word grooming, which is incredibly important, and this is how perpetrators get access to children through a very protracted often very projected sometimes days weeks could be hours could be years and years a lifetime, and so access is another thing so where any child has access or anyone has access to the child. So that's obviously houses of worship in schools and anywhere else and doctors, sadly they're. The amount of crime that is committed by professionals is astounding and particularly heinous. So I, you know, I just wanted to say that this is an incredible you know panel, and it has to be repeated and because I think it's very important that everybody gets the message at home and just to learn how better to prevent it and then, obviously to report it. Hopefully we'll have my friend down here some time in the future to offer his true expertise. Two quick questions, one is all of the volunteer and training, because the predatory nature of this, these awful crimes is so it. It's so prevalent that even the volunteers and the professionals have to be screened. I mean you look at people like Sandusky who was put away. He had access right, Bill, Cosby had access and power. Those are great, a offender because there's trust in the society. So the question the two questions I have is: how are the professionals that are intervening with the children screen themselves so that they do not re-victimize a victim? And the other quick question is now that everybody's quarantining, it's so much harder to report? Are there certain safe phone numbers code words signals verbally non-verbally that can that children can use or adults can use in reporting when they may be confined in the home, with someone who is perpetrating and victimizing them? Thank you. I can speak to how we screened our folks. So I said we have about 193 certified advocates all as volunteers. They go to all of the emergency departments they're only first of all, they stay entirely in the emergency department, so they never go outside. If you know a patient might want to go out and have a cigarette, something like that, they don't ever go out with them, so they're always in the confines of the emergency department. But we do an extensive screening. They have to agree to a background check. They have to do a drug talk screening, they do a medical clearance. They do multiple interviews, both in a group setting in an individual setting the entire way through our 40-hour training, they're, continually evaluated and not everybody graduates, quite frankly, from our training. If we don't feel like they're the right fit for this specific kind of work, then- and we are very upfront with them in the beginning- that not everyone graduates that my priority is the survivor and supporting them as safely and as fully as possible. So if this isn't the right fit for you as a volunteer I'll help, you find something else, but I'm not just going to graduate you and put you on our roster and it's pretty much the same thing for our staff that they have to go through extensive background checks through the Mount Sinai Health system. In a lot of different ways before they get brought in, so we do everything that we can to ensure that the people that are working with our survivors are there, because they want to be helping survivors and for no other reason they don't have a history. We also have a policy for better or worse that we will not serve offenders, so we can. If someone has called us- and this has happened- that they're concerned about being an offender or being an abusive partner, we can not bring them into our office to see them where there are so many survivors who are coming. But we also want to acknowledge that if we don't address perpetrators and offenders and stop the people who are doing it from doing it, then this is never going to stop. So we have to be able to connect them to some resource to the best of our ability and I know that there are groups of us who are working on. How do you have a more effective abuser response? You know the anger management. Isn't it has never worked? It will never work. We have to do much more on the offender side, but it's another way that we try to make survivors as safe as possible, not bringing a vendors into that environment. I could just chip in real quick. You know the safe horizon also does extensive background check screening you know for all of our employees, including our volunteers and student interns. We have quite a number of interns as well. I'm also kind of proud that, through our anti-racism work, also, though, that if somebody gets a hit, you know with some kind of offense that doesn't relate, you know to their job they're, not automatically, also prohibiting them being hired. If we think that you know, that's not really going to impact their ability to do some work with us, so can anybody speak to the signaling of when people are in the homes and near their offender that they can report? Is there any method for that? So I don't know. If there's like a universal method, I know. That's been a big issue literally since March, and trying to identify when schools closed, that that's happening with the board of education. That's happening with ACS. That's happening in hospitals or different places that are have been doing. Everything from like focus groups trainings how to better identify that, and we actually are seeing that more I think we're seeing more reports from schools reporting that they've seen something on virtual. You know in the homes or where children are reporting back to them and maybe related to a variety of actors and children becoming more comfortable in kind of the virtual world. If you will but yeah those are definitely things looking so there's not I, don't think they're publicizing a specific like make this hand signal that kind of thing, but with teachers and school staff are getting that training and looking at different methods of doing that for their particular class and, of course, age group I mean different depending on that child's age and development. It might look different too, but that's definitely something that's. It's been a big issue, and also- and thank you so much Mr Clement for mentioning different things that you mentioned before. I definitely agree with that in prevention. I also think about just you mentioned just briefly like the different agencies and organizations. I think it's also important to consider the policies around everything from places of worship or other organizations where families and children are attending things that you're considering the policy around that, like children's going to the bathroom like who's in those bad, you know like how, like all those types of things, who's alone with children, how are the children separated from their families all those kind of policies which are important to consider in communities wherever you might be and underscore the boy scouts and Doug? If I could just mention a couple of things in response to your question, the last part in particular about code words, a couple of localities across the world actually have tried that out during Covid-19 and they're having a code word that you can use with a pharmacist and the jury is still out as to whether or not that's a meaningful thing to do. But there are people in the city who are watching that very closely, and you know seeing whether or not it's effective. You know the head of the W-H-O when Kovitt hit said the people we should care most about are the women who are vulnerable home now with their abusers, 24 7, and that's who we should be paying attention to. Obviously, in addition to the health concerns of everyone and I, don't think New York City has done a good enough job, making that a top priority, but I also think it's important not to sensationalize abuse of any kind. You know abuse you know talking about. You know making sure our laws are strong around not having sexual predators. You know around our schools, you know, of course, that's important, but oh by the way, if you're, wealthy and you're a predator you're, not on that registry and more often than not and again you know just trying to be clear about the Upper West side. We might not have registered sex offenders, but trust me there's a lot of bad stuff going on behind closed doors on the Upper West side and people aren't talking about it and they're getting away with it, and so for us, I mean I as chair of the committee I work on, you know the whole city, but for us on the Upper West side, it's really important to step back from sensationalizing things and know that there are amazing professionals out there when we were seeing the best of the best tonight. You know savvy safe Horizon, New, York alliance against sexual violence. These are trained professionals, serious people doing serious work on this, and it's we a lot of respect goes to them. They really know what they're talking about and our light years beyond the cheap shots that it's easy for people to make I just to respond to Helen, really quickly and also Doug, and just to build on what Helen just said. I think what was noted at the beginning of the conversation that most sexual abuse happens with most perpetrators are people that children and victims of violence. No so they're known offenders, there's a great I, think Sarah also mentioned the need to focus on offenders was that you Sarah and kind of reducing violence. There's a great book that just came out that's called in the last year. That's called no visible bruises, it's by Rachel Louise Snyder, and she talks about strategies that governments are using to reduce violence. That's more focused on perpetrators. It's a great book and Doug will have Jim, Clemente I know he couldn't come this time, but we'll definitely have him come another time. So Shelly are there other community board members that want to speak before we take a comment. Do you have a hand less opportunity? Well, we can always come back. Why don't we go to the public? We also have three: we have three people signed up. We have two focused on this topic, so we're gonna start there. The first one that signed up on this topic is Melinda. Thaler I just promoted her. She should be able to unmute her Melinda. You should be able to unmute yourself. Okay, can you hear me now? Yes, we can okay, I, don't I didn't mean to oh I can start my camera too. Okay, all right don't take that out of my one minute. Okay, sorry, my question is open to any of the panelists, but I did want to particularly call out the two safe horizon. Presenters I am actually myself a former safe horizon employee and my children and I are also beneficiary of your crime victim services. So I've been on both sides of your safe horizon fence and I can say, you're fabulous and in many ways I noted that Ms Arrow mentioned that safe horizon is present in many places, including all of the precincts in New York city, we're living in a time where there are loud calls for defunding the police and even abolishing the police, and given that safe horizon does have a presence in every police precinct in the city. I wanted to hear your thoughts about whether police can have a diminished role in child abuse and intimate partner violence services, and, if not, how should their role be? Right-Sized wow good question, so I could just tell you know in a minute that we are actively engaged. She has the leadership of our crime, victims, assistance program and the police department. You know that I think all communities want to be safe and I think there's a recognition, even within the police department that we can do it better. You know we can collectively and individually respond to victims in a way, that's trauma, informed, I. Think with all that's going on in the city in this country. Right now, you know, there's a real reckoning of people wanting to be treated with respect police officers victims, so we're taking the approach of doing a lot of self-reflection within safe, rising being accountable. What can we do better, looking deeply at our own practices, our own responses and we're really excited about working collaboratively with the police department. I'll just say tomorrow morning tomorrow afternoon. Actually, I'm in a racial equity work group meeting it's a tiny little work group meeting with some of the leadership of the special victims department and we're doing some self-reflection, NYPD leadership's doing it say: Verizon's doing it, ACS is doing it. The Da's office is doing it. A medical, professional, so I think it starts with us. You know individually, like what are we doing. Can we do it better? How is race playing into everything and then we're looking at? How do we support each other and doing it better? So I just want to let you know, I'm super committed to this I know say Verizon's super committed. We have a long way to go, but I feel like this country seems ready. I think our city's ready to dig deeper and let's do it better. May I just ask the name of the woman who asked the question. My name is Melinda Thaler T-H-t-H-a-l-e-r. Thank you. Welcome next speaker is Maria Danzalo and you should be able to unmute hi good evening. I'm glad to hear the community Board and Council member Rosenthal are very serious about protecting women, children and other vulnerable people. In the community against sexual predators and sexual abuse, I'm very curious as to Ms Rosenthal's statement, that of the use of the word sensationalizing things I, don't find it sensationalizing to talk about abuse of children in a way that we can prevent by looking at legislation and laws and tightening them up. There are a ton of loopholes in current law, and if anyone who thinks that there aren't loopholes in that law, just hasn't looked at the law. I've looked at it, I've thought about it. I've advised people on it and it is a very unclear law. As safe horizons, speaker pointed out, they are required and the police are required to interpret current law, but if the law is unclear and confusing, how can they possibly do their jobs? So, since August I've written several letters on this to miss Rosenthal's office and have yet to receive a response, I now understand that perhaps the issue has to do with the fact that there are people who aren't registered in our community and should be registered so under current law only level two and level three sex offenders are required to register. Many of these sexual predators may actually have committed crimes at the level two and three level, many of the level ones that is, but because of plea, bargain arrangements or other factors they might not be included as a level two or three also certain other behaviors, such as public impropriety, may not rise to the level of a registerable offense and may not be considered dangerous enough to require registration, but witnessing public displays of inappropriate sexual conduct can be extremely damaging to a person, a child, a woman or anyone who's vulnerable. So these are the kinds of things that it's insulting: to call it sensationalizing stuff like this, there's nothing sensational about it. I don't really want to be having this conversation, I don't want to sensationalize anything I want law that will address this issue in a way that's effective, and that is going to protect the community and I'm asking the community board tonight. This is an ask to take on the issue of legislation to look at level one two and three registrations and see what's going on with the law and try to provide adequate tools to the police and others who have to do their jobs in this space to protect the women and children and other vulnerable people, we seem to need to protect so much. We have to talk about this. It has to get resolved. Thank you very much. Okay, I want to respond to that. Tell you that I just checked, I'm seeing your emails, your these are issues that we should have responded to you just to let you know. These are state issues, not city issues, and there are so many I agree with you. So many loopholes that have to be closed, but really it's those are state laws, so you might want to direct those emails to your state representatives. Thank you. Okay. When we go on, is there a third speaker there? I'm sorry there is there isn't. There is not a third speaker on this issue, so I just want to finish with this and then we'll continue to the rest of our agenda. I do want to say that I think that, just to respond to the last speaker, thank you for presenting kind of another area that we need to draw attention to I think we're all here to work together and on these issues, and we thank everyone for coming to the meeting to share their insights and ideas. We thank all the speakers for coming. We thank Helen Rosenthal for her great work and we actually, we have two more speakers on two other issues just to let people know so just to kind of wrap up our this portion of our agenda. What do we think about? I'm asking this to the speakers that joined us today? Everyone that's here from the organizations and also the committee. What do we think? Would all of you be open to having part two of this next month and postponing the other issues by one month and focusing on one specific area since we talked about so many different topics and I? Think I want to listen to the recording again to kind of hear the specifics again and then follow up with the organizations to see where we could target one piece. What do folks think about that? Both people that joined us and also Shelley and people on the committee? Okay, I see a thumbs up from Madge from Doug from Robert Shelley. Okay, we, okay, Rosa I, think we have a consensus on this, but we don't want to over impose on our representatives from the agencies, so we'll try to have a conversation with you and try to make it convenient and so on. But we appreciate it and a great idea: Catherine focused on focusing on one area, I think it'd, be helpful. I think it would be sad to take all we've had tonight and just move on to something else. I think it's smart to focus more specifically and to continue this okay great. We can follow up on that and I want to thank this I want to thank everyone for coming. You don't have to stay for our entire. You know meeting it's really late, but thank you so much for spending the time and we will work very hard to think of ways that we can support your work in concrete ways, we'll process this and come up with the next step. So thank you so much for coming. Yes, thank you, everyone! So much. Thank you for having Us Council members Councilmember. One of the next speakers has asked that she wanted to address part of her remarks to you. So if you are able to stay, that is her request. Happy too I do just want to preface that I've been up since eight press conference at 9:00 a.m. Chaired a hearing had a briefing was at three zooms tonight, so if I say something a little off, please forgive me. Thank you so much for spending the time with us Helen. It's really glad to have. I'm really glad we're glad that you're with us and you're my priority Catherine Shelly. This is a great hearing topic. Thank you so much for being with us and your contributions, of course. So let's move to public comments on the other topics, so Erica Gerson, you were the first to sign up as for a topic that doesn't have to do with this with the child abuse topic, so you're up great I started my video, but I don't see myself there, I'm not sure. What's going on, we see you okay, perfect, oh here, I am sorry. Thank you for staying and hearing this. My question relates to our the last meeting toward the end of the meeting. There was a discussion about I, don't remember the title, but basically the working group that was to deal with issues arising from the temporary shelters in our neighborhood and it was. It became clear that group has in fact not met in a very long time. It may have met once and then not again or whatever happened for quite a long time. It hasn't met and Shelley had suggested that he would help make sure that we could figure out what happened to it and whether we could get it rolling again and in particular there was a question about the good neighbor policy was never shared with the community, despite many requests and so I think Shelley was going to see if this group could look into that, so that we could actually get the good neighbor policy and figure out how to hold people accountable and what is considered by violations and, what's not so I, wanted to hear an update on how that was going. Of course, it's also interesting to wonder why nothing was happening all these months when there were still many issues that could have been usefully addressed, but for the purpose of moving forward. I would like to hear what we're doing to move this forward on the good neighbor policy. We've done. Some research on the few good neighbor policies are required by DHS Department of Homeless services for each shelter, they're, not identical, but they basically define the program and then specifically, in relationship to the community, relate to things like people not hanging out on the street, not smoking in certain areas not and the type of interactions that go on, but good neighbor policies are guidelines that the community can call the provider on if there's normally there's a community advisory board when it's not a temporary emergency shelter, and so they can address those issues to that there and have them responded to or if it's something more serious on a call line or an email. So I've experienced this with other cabs community advisory boards. So there is a value to the good neighbor policy. What's clear is good? Neighbor policy isn't an enforceable policy. It's a guideline which is used as a kind of agreement between the community and the provider and DHS that certain things would be the right, behaviors expected of people in the community living in that area and they can be questioned and they can be brought up and repeated violations. I found with Lucerne also people were corrected and in some case removed if they've you know, violated those policies in a serious way. On the working group, we had two meetings, I believe and I thought they were effective, but they weren't. No additional meetings were convened. I think it was. The working group was an unusual creation. Okay, again normally there's a community advisory board, so there's ongoing meetings. It's I think it's a shame. It didn't continue because it was a vehicle to bring issues with stakeholders all in the same room and I think it was a very positive thing. I think what I missed, which would have been more helpful, was an ongoing weekly or bi-weekly report to the community of what progress was being made, but it didn't pan out over time. Unfortunately, so is there anything moving forward? That's planned on I think that's a great idea. A weekly update would be helpful. I mean there's a lot of people that are saying disinformation here, disinformation there, but in the absence of information people end up with this information. I think that's a very good point that when you don't have you what you hear on the street is what becomes the information? Okay and there's no other source. I. Think Mark tell me if I'm wrong, the borough president was the convener, that's correct. The president and the other elected officials were the conveners and we all tried to participate in that I. Imagine I don't want to speculate, but I. Imagine when things got into litigation it got a little harder to move things in that direction. The community advisory boards that Shelly is referring to are not available for temporary shelters, and so the working group was our collective effort to try to fill in that gap a little bit and that's all I'll say about that for right now, I think Shelley said it very well the. But the idea of getting better information out faster, even in the absence of a meeting, is a very good one and I'm happy to work with Shelly and Catherine and all of our lectures to try to see what we can do about that and can I just put a reminder to everyone about the chat that we please focus on kind of issues, questions, but not make any negative comments about groups, including people who are experiencing homelessness. So please don't make any derogatory comments or negative comments about people experiencing homelessness, and thank you to respond to Erica's to get as much information as we can in response to Erica's question is Helen still here can Helen respond to that as well to provide any contact. I am here, ooh. Is there anything that you want to say to provide additional context? I don't mean to put you on that. If I'm just wondering if you wanted to respond to that as well, I mean I, think Mark nailed it Gail has been convening these meetings and Shelly talked about good neighbor policy and the CUNY advisory boards. I think you know, let me think there is some new news. The population at the Lucerne has dropped significantly below 200. The only people now who are doubling up in rooms I think there are five rooms now with doubles and I. You know, I don't want to misspeak, but I know some of them are doubles for mental health reasons. They don't want people to be alone in a room which has been something that the nonprofits have been saying all along I. Think that's new information. I know there I think 50 guys are now working at Goddard they're getting six day a week on site services. Do we have any information? This is kind of in response to something that Gail shared at our full I. Think it's at our full board meeting keep track of all the meetings. Is there any news about where they're going to go and if there's going to be a continuation of the services that they're experiencing here like what's going gonna happen in terms of their having access to the services they have here or where they're gonna go yep. You know this. The litigation I think has been the status right now of the litigation there was I heard from the lawyer today is that there is a stay, that's been granted by the appellate court and they are preparing for a case that will happen. You know I just don't I'm so tired that I don't want to give out misinformation, but we could get the exact timing and the information from the lawyer I also I'm just looking at the chat a little bit if I'm wrong about the 50 men. That was what the lawyer announced today was that there are 50 men working at Godhard. I could be wrong about that. You know Councilman Rosenthal! Is there any progress? Has there any progress and made on securing those jobs as a program, regardless of whether the Lucerne residents are still there? I know there are other hotel residents and some people were hoping that program could continue, for whichever individuals that would qualify could have it. Even if the Lucerne is emptied. Yeah great question, I, don't know the answer. Okay, good questions to get answers to yeah. Let's follow up on that. So thank you. Helen for being here, thank you so much and we will follow up with you. Thank you Erica for your questions and we have our last public. Our last speaker from the community is penny Sherpa and I apologize. If I'm mispronouncing your name and the topic is food insecurity, hello, everyone. Thank you for staying up I. This is my first time attending a community board meeting and I really enjoyed it. Thank you. So much so I wanted to talk about food insecurity among focused mostly among college students. So we all know that more than 2 million New Yorker food insecure, even before Covid-19 Hit, and now that the Covid-19 has had like more than 1.2 million of residents about 15 percent were food insecure, including one in a five children. Now that the city has shut down and hundreds and thousands of New Yorkers have lost their jobs, the number of those relying on food pantries is only rising so about 60,000, CUNY, undergraduates and 25 percent experience. Food insecurity- and we all know what's being done- is like in 2017 the New York City Council passed a bill which required Department of Education to submit the speaker of Council and post on its website. A report including data related to meals, served by department of education to students and schools, including breakfast served before school and after school date. They began lunch after school snacks and after-school stoppers. The report would provide information about initiatives and programmed aimed at increasing student participants in the meal. So right now, I just wanted to introduce to a policy recommendation that is pretty new that was developed on 2020. That was the in intro to 2057 legislation. It's a pending legislation, so it was introduced in 2020 by the public advocate and council members to develop a plan to provide student with breakfast lunch and dinner in the event of city school. Our order closed either by the governor mayor or counselor or when any form of remote learning is being used. So just wanted to the bill is intended to reduce the administrative burden on school, as well as the paperwork and financial burdens to a family. So I would just I would I just wanted to introduce to this bill and wanted everyone to support, passing and enacting this legislation, because it will ultimately decrease the need for food for city schools. Could you please give us the bill number again, the Intro number sure until 2057 2020? Thank you know, Miss Sherpa, if I could just jump in. Thank you so much for raising these issues. The issue of food insecurity is a serious one has been and continues to be. So the city Council has added funds to the budget for CUNY students. We set up food pantries at several of the campuses. Not we weren't able to fund all of them, but I know those pantries are open and giving out food and for anyone in our community who's food, insecure. If you go to my website helenrosenthal.com and click on Covid-19 resources, we have a long list of food pantries that give out free food. Most of them don't require any information. I think the one that does is West side campaign against hunger, but they don't ask for personal information, it's more for their own tracking purposes and I actually have a one pager for anyone in the community who needs of how to get food on the Upper West side you, my office is closed, but I'm here all the time and several people a day come by and ask for it: I have it in spanish and english. Food is a serious issue everywhere, including the Upper West side. So I really appreciate you bringing that up. Thank you and we'll fall we'll follow up on that, we'll look into it. We did have a meeting a couple months ago on how to address challenges associated with food insecurity and improve equity and access, and we had people come to our meeting who produced the New York Food 2020 report. Food insecurity has almost doubled since the pandemic started. Yes, it's crazy. The number so we kind of outlined the recommendations produced by this report and then called on the mayor to strengthen and expand the mayor's office of food policy in particular, and we to kind of share this with the committee we've shared that resolution and also the anti-hate crimes resolution with the borough president's office, and they and mark I don't know if you want to clarify anything about this process. But those two resolutions are going to be shared with the chairs of the Manhattan community boards, the other Manhattan community board, so that it can be chaired with shared with their members, because we wanted to distribute that piece about food insecurity and also the hate crimes wider than just our district and board mark. Do you want to add anything about that or shall we you basically have it where this is the beginning of the process of trying to see if the Borough board will stand behind what community Board 7 stood behind, but it has to obviously be shared with the boards and they have to come to their own conclusion before we can put it on an agenda for that. We they can put it on the agenda for Burro Board, so you got it so it might end up at best in January. You know February of the early years trying to be an optimist. The goal was for people that don't know. Burro Board includes all of the Manhattan community board chairs, and so the goal was to kind of spread information and efforts and advocacy wider than just our district to those other 11 boards. So I think we can move now to new business. If there's any new business, anybody wants to raise Catherine, I'm looking in the chat and just can't find the exact bill you all were referencing I know you put the link in 2057, Helen yeah, that's the one that I see it now. That would no. This is a different one to your point about Catherine. Just now about having a better food policy. The there is a legislation, that's been introduced and I will try to find the bill number. That would require the city to have a more engaged food and meaningful food policy, and it would require it to have a not just established by executive order, but by local law, an office of food policy. It's not my bill. It's somebody else's and if you email me we'll try to find it and get it to you. Okay, great here, thank you so much for coming for meeting for having me any other comments from anyone. Great yeah. My comment is that it's 9:40. I want to wish everyone a good holiday season for any holiday they're observing or if they're, not a servant, just have a healthy good season. Thank you. Everyone have a good day, see you in 2021, that's right, someone's sounds like a gregorian chant a little boss. I'll continue over there. Okay have a good night everybody. Thank you.
