We envision this today's meeting as an opportunity to discuss ways to respond to child abuse and support the mental health and safety of children.
We're excited to have safe, Horizon, New, York, City alliance against sexual assaults and the Mount Sinai sexual assault and violence, intervention program and others with us.
The availability of forensic examiner and trauma-informed practice, training for doctors, physicians, assistants and nurses, child advocacy, centers, child-centered facilities and more free and affordable mental health care for children and youth, especially those who have been abused or in challenging situations.
This great work so from safe horizon, We have with us John Pickett and please let us know if we mispronounce our name your names, because it's important to us to get that right.
Little points of child focus programs that I think you might be interested in, My fabulous colleague, is going to give you an inside view of what's going on at our Manhattan child efficacy, center, which he is the senior director of.
So, for those of you that have been around safe horizon was really established back as victim services back in 1978, and over these decades we've really tried to stay true to the needs of what are the needs of child victims, adult victims, all kinds of victims of crime and abuse.
You know that there are more services available in our community, but I think the needs of victims of crime and abuse are more complex now than ever.
And I think we've done a pretty remarkable job, even throughout the pandemic of primarily providing remote services trying to knock down every barriers.
All of our programs are really there to provide assistance, advocacy and support to victims, whether you're, really infants and toddlers all the way up to elderly, and we deal with every kind of crime, domestic violence, child abuse, rape and sexual assault, Human trafficking, youth homelessness and our staff are now in every precinct, they're doing it remotely right now, but every police precinct through our crime victims, assistance program, where we have advocates to really try to help crime victims of all kinds.
And I would encourage you to visit our website sayfrison.org, which would give you know a thorough understanding of what we're doing, but I'll, Just close by saying I've been here a long time, I really I think I'm a little, not objective anymore, but I really feel we have some of the most compassionate staff that we ever could have I feel really humbled by the type of expertise, the passion that they're just driven, whether it's coming in every day during these rough conditions, to be there for children and families or from their bedrooms or living rooms, wherever they can provide remote, service.
In addition to that, having someone come talk to you, about, like a child abuse can be a lot or other types of abuse is a lot to even think about so I.
I just want to point out whenever I talk about child abuse, I like to point out, because we know that statistically one in two children will be sexually abused before they turn 18 and the numbers are high, also for physical abuse, so that this excuse me.
People here could certainly know somebody or even be impacted themselves by child abuse and as even when I'm talking tonight.
I know just randomly, but some of you might need from Alabama, which is great, but the he looked at is like your children, who disclose some type of abuse, often end up in hospital emergency rooms where they get interviewed repeatedly by nurses, doctors and not because they're intending to do that.
Why, can't we change the system to work better for children and families, and so he came up with this idea of a child advocacy center of a place where everybody who's involved in child abuse.
Abuse, investigation and I want to point out too it's not just families, who, unfortunately, a lot of our the families come here are not here because of something that happened because they made some kind of mistake.
It's pretty daunting to talk, to, You know, maybe the detective think of detectives involved or ACS, or all these people.
We're working with that family to do what we can to support them right after the interview that, whether that's the caregivers, the children, and we continue as long as they need to or connect them to services or other resources in their community.
And I could talk for another hour about you, know stories or real life situations, why children didn't disclose and there's so much shame involved to that societal, pressure, community pressure and even family pressure for that child not to disclose so.
We work very closely with John, who does many of our trainings, but the child advocacy centers are really what we need: they're, the kind of the wraparound services that they have for children, which is a welcoming space.
That's where this conversation stemmed from the New York City alliance against sexual assault was founded in 2000 20 years ago by rape, crisis programs in the city for them, and the idea was that, because rape crisis programs at that time were had limited resources, The idea was for an organization to help them with systems advocacy and with the larger policy pieces and legislature, You know and government, since then.
And, then we actually provide warm referrals to places like savvy and dove and safe horizons so that the longer-term work can continue, and our focus therefore then stays on policy and ensuring that the voices of the rape crisis programs across the city are being heard across the board.
Well, We recently that you know the training had been happening for adults and adolescents for a long time, but when I came on, I joined the alliance a couple of years, ago.
Other thing that we've been trying to work on is, with these child abuse pediatricians to provide perception, as well as with Dr Brown who's at the Cac, to allow one or two nurses that have graduated from a program to be under their supervision for as long as possible, but because, like they're, literally four to six individuals who are able to provide the supervision we're really struggling with, We have 60 nurses, who've, graduated.
So, that's something that we really need to push for as well, and then the other thing we do is we provide training in terms of trauma, informed and best practices to community-based organizations to rape, crisis, programs, lawyers, Anyone that comes in into contact with survivors, and you know what we.
Anyone, that interacts with a patient should be able to have a conversation that makes them feel safe and in pow and in a position of power, because you know when somebody has been abused, that power and control is taken, especially children, because they have never they've, never been able to make decisions on their own.
If a child has been abused, you want to get them in right away if they are ready to speak and even if they're, not you can provide them with that support.
Right, like there's some families who do not want to make a police report.
You know, in collaboration with our child abuse, mutations and the Cac, so that we all like it's a wrap around right, like I mean savvy, is one of the few organizations that actually provides child sexual abuse.
This is not the brightest topic to be discussing on a December evening, So I appreciate all of you being here and being interested in talking about child abuse and not just about it, but what we can then do about it, and certainly hats off to my colleagues, One of my favorite things about working in the anti-violence efforts in New. York City, is how we all work.
We're, not competing, but it's also, This genuine sense that people want to do what's right for survivors, and so, however, We can all work together as the is what needs to be done.
And, that's how we've expanded so from just being rape, crisis, As, Sarah said, We started to incorporate pretty early on domestic violence and specifically intimate partner violence into our services, because those were folks coming into the emergency departments.
We have about 193 certified volunteer advocates at this point, who go on call on a volunteer basis and at any time on their shift can be dispatched to any of those locations to serve survivors of sexual assault, intimate partner, violence, sex trafficking and child sexual abuse.
We have six different locations now throughout Manhattan and Queens, with 11 different masters level licensed therapists who provide free, therapy, a typically short term, but we will see people longer because, as Sarah had pointed out, There's such a dearth of longer term options that again, you have to be responsive to what the community needs, and particularly free services, are very important.
We were approached and said there were a lot of people from the orthodox community that could come to mount Sinai for health care or to do volunteer work or visit relatives that they could say.
I believe that the anxiety that comes from a physician, a resident and attending whoever it is in the emergency department, when they're confronted with a sexual assault survivor particularly a child, is that they know how important it is.
They know the trauma that this child may have experienced and they don't want to add to.
That is the best survivor, informed kind of care, particularly for children, but for some families that isn't an option for any number of reasons: they're, more comfortable coming to their community hospital.
We need is more people to have the time to be able to go through the pediatric training so that we have a deeper roster and also like Sarah was saying the psychiatry piece of it is super important.
Is training, medical staff in the emergency departments to know what those minors rights are.
I work with these advocates in my role as chair of the committee on women and gender equity, and we work together on policy issues like making sure that the NYPD is well trained, in particular their special victims, division, the division that is responsible for investigating sexual assaults, to make sure that they're trained in the trauma-informed ways that you just heard about tonight for how medical professionals are trained and many of the people you see here are doing the trainings and we work together on a variety of domestic violence issues as well, and we've accomplished a lot.
I'm, going to turn it over to the community board to ask questions because I get to talk to you all the time, but you should all know it's just such a privilege to work with you dedicated smart people who really care about those who, whose voices are not heard.
I think just proportionately we're seeing a higher number of sex abuse than severe physical abuse, but we're also finding the reporters are a little different that it's family members calling in on other family members, It's, hospitals, calling cases in community service organizations, so it is not which has historically always been kind of the school officials.
What was interesting was that during the summer, especially though the cases of sexual abuse that were coming into the hospitals were higher than the ones that were coming into, if they were adults, and the reason was because that were being reported, the reason was because parents were bringing children in for a physical exam for a sickness or something else, and then the pediatrician would notice that there was more going on.
You and I talked about a lot of different issues: kind of implant in planning this meeting, and tonight we've talked about the need for more forensics and trauma-informed practice, training, free psychiatric care for children, and.
My first question and also something for the committee to think about, and then also a really great point that was raised at the very beginning, is the difficulty of children disclosing and what we need to do to kind of help and create a supportive environment and relationships for children to disclose, and so I wanted to hear.
Are you working on, and what can we do to kind of create, more supportive environments and relationships for children to disclose or ask questions or just communicate about sexual abuse.
Remember, a parent telling me once that their child hadn't reported sexual abuse that had been going on from a neighbor for a long time, because one night they were watching like the TV news, and there was a pedophile who had been caught.
And we see that even after child and just to add to that I think along those lines for parents to realize, We know, statistically over 90 of the sex abusers.
That's like specific and concrete, That's the kind of a shared language and then also demonstrating comfort and instead of like shame around talking about those things and going to what Sarah was saying, earlier, also kind of putting children in a position of power where they can or take where it's okay for them to articulate what they feel and what they're experiencing and that they have kind of rights over their body and that they can kind of express that and ask for that and be heard.
I, Just want to jump in I, Think just specific for your community on the Upper, West, side, I.
Furniture has people that know how to address sexual abuse, and the language has a psychiatrist.
You, know: income on the Upper West side, and there are people who fall in the middle and really need the free services, but can't access them because they're just a little bit.
You know it's central for that reason, but I've really been wanting to see a pop-up family Justice Center in Washington Heights, for example.
You, know again close to transportation, but I think advocating for some more family justice centers would be welcome.
I, don't know, maybe a pop-up child advocacy center can Sarah.
The family justice center is was an initiative by the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, and it that is a one-stop shop for anyone who has experienced you know domestic violence or sexual violence, and you can access NYPD there.
Should I just list my questions: Shall we or should I just wait until one at a time, I bet John's nodding more than me or Sarah, but John you want to chime in betrayal, I, think you're, absolutely right, Robert.
I, Remember interviewing an 11 year old boy who was sexually abused by his babysitter, and that was you know as we're talking about.
So much that which, like I, was talking about before, if over 90 of the time, it's somebody who they know and trust.
We have about how that can impact children, even physical discipline, not to mention sex abuse and those types of things, but I'm, unless some of the other panelists I think have spoken enough unless some other people, chime in also.
I think it is important that our educators understand about it, because children will, you know, say they're going home for their Christmas break and be all chipper, and.
You know right out of Mulholland, road, Really, sick man and detective number one approached him, Of course, The second detectives runs to action and he gets shot too, So they were both murdered right there, but that's just a dramatic picture, but in my work as property manager and a first responder for Vic. I would be present when the police were called either to move a woman from one shelter apartment to another, and on occasions my hair stood on end partially from shock, but also fear at what I heard uttered by some of the police that came to assist the counselors in resolving the issue where there was domestic and there's always a kids, involved.
And, but the police need as much training as the medical staff that is looking at the child.
I. Think intensive training of the police is something that we know if I could just jump in on that, as well.
And I, want to start by saying Robert your story about two police officers losing their lives because they've put themselves out there to try to help is heartbreaking and every that every time that happens, it's unacceptable.
Think the police department is trying, You know.
I think the city is trying hard to have a team of individuals to include not just social workers or mental health professionals, but also having the first responders be better trained at de-escalating at noticing.
We go to our next committee member, Can you share the idea that you shared with me about our next meeting from the Cva. So, John I, think I forget who mentioned it John or Nancy that safe horizon staffs every precinct now with a crime victim, advocate.
You know a community board meeting, but I'm sure safe horizon can help bring someone in honestly.
Maj and really pushed the city hall to make sure that groups like safe horizon and the violence intervention program, which Robert is talking about, that they had funding to message out to all New Yorkers, that their doors were open for people and one of the things that we got the department of education to do was we helped them develop.
You know I think maybe safe horizon helped with it.
That's, primarily to parents, though, and you know, which is different than child abuse.
I know that the Mount Sinai person spoke about multilingual services, but I wonder if safe horizons and New York City alliance also have options like that for everyone.
In a lot of different ways before they get brought in, So we do everything that we can to ensure that the people that are working with our survivors are there, because they want to be helping survivors and for no other reason they don't have a history.
We think that you know, that's not really going to impact their ability to do some work with us, So can anybody speak to the signaling of.
So, there's not I, don't think they're publicizing a specific like make this hand signal that kind of thing, but with teachers and school staff are getting that training and looking at different methods of doing that for their particular class.
I. Think it's also important to consider the policies around everything from places of worship or other organizations where families and children are attending things, that you're considering the policy around that, like children's going to the bathroom.
You know: savvy safe Horizon, New, York alliance against sexual violence.
I think what was noted at the beginning of the conversation that most sexual abuse happens with most perpetrators are people that children and victims of violence.
I wanted to hear your thoughts about whether police can have a diminished role in child abuse and intimate partner violence, services, and, if not, how should their role be.
You know that I think all communities want to be safe.
Right now, you know, there's a real reckoning of people wanting to be treated with respect.
This is an ask to take on the issue of legislation to look at level one two and three registrations and see what's going on with the law and try to provide adequate tools to the police and others who have to do their jobs in this space to protect the women and children and other vulnerable people, we seem to need to protect so much.
I do want to say that I think that, just to respond to the last speaker, Thank you for presenting kind of another area that we need to draw attention.
I think we're all here to work together and on these issues, and we thank everyone for coming to the meeting to share their insights and ideas.
We actually, We have two more speakers on two other issues just to let people know so, just to kind of wrap up our this portion of our agenda.
And, so I think Shelley was going to see if this group could look into that, so that we could actually get the good neighbor policy and figure out how to hold people accountable and what is considered by violations and, What's not so.
And I actually have a one pager for anyone in the community who needs of how to get food on the Upper West side you, My office is closed, but I'm here all the time and several people a day come by and ask for it.
