It was about petitions or getting signatures or permission from neighbors to use the street space for parkside Are. We talking street space or park space, but you had said that if they wanted to do that, whatever that street program is that it would be helpful to get the sort of the okay in advance.
I, most likely on the bike lanes, because they seem to be the ones that are in the most stressed situation, but just know that that's out there and that if people are interested, they can contact us through our email info at columbus Only other thing that I'll mention is that our annual meeting is coming up on thursday, the 30th in the evening at five o'clock, and if people would like to join that, send us an email, So, just a reminder to committee members and non-committee board members, just please put in the chat, your name, which will help us to keep a record of who is on the who's here of the attendance.
Last two resolutions we talked about at our two prior committee meetings were sponsored by one of our members, but I'm kind of the one behind primarily behind this one.
Maybe you could put this on right now for a moment mark what the current law is concerning smoking and non-smoking the smoking prohibition in our parks and what The new york city parks and what the exceptions are.
It accepts from the prohibition sidewalks immediately adjoining parks, squares and public spaces places you'll see that at the bottom, basically pedestrian areas on our broad on strips, such as the broadway malls, but it's probably also ocean parkway and things like that and parking lots in parks and then theatrical productions which I think is probably not something we much care.
One of the things that our community member mentioned to me is that with the corona virus, situation, now, where you need to distance and wear masks, smokers are sitting on benches on the peripheries of the perimeters of parks, they're, obviously not wearing masks.
The ones that are listed in your resolution are definitely the ones that were exceptions that I couldn't get rid of the sidewalks near parks and public spaces, and this one was a big issue of pedestrians, Through any median or mall, which of course.
Think one of the things you might want to hear and have some discussion about is who's going to do the enforcement, it's very clear in the park.
You know smoking near the parks, partly because people can't smoke in the parks, and I think they know that, So they do pick areas right next, door, And I, think that's where you know, between the conservancy, the parks department and at least having a conversation with d.o.t. Don't it's not going to be in life?
You know it's one thing to smoke on fifth avenue or riverside drive on the opposite sidewalk, but it's another to be on a park bench in what's clearly a park on a parked sidewalk and our and our medians, and for that matter our parking lots, which are the three exceptions there And then there's the marijuana, issue.
Anybody, who wants to hang out on their park, has to deal with people who aren't wearing masks because they're smoking so kind of.
What happens is if you go out on this park, land, the edges of the park and sit on the benches you're, getting a double whammy, so the first part of that is that you're being exposed to secondhand smoke, which actually increases your risk of Covid-19 and the second part That's why I don't know who else managed to get on, but a lot of people were interested and that's why we're hoping that these exceptions can kind of go away, so people can enjoy the parkland janice.
Issues in our conversation, supports eliminating the exception of for smoking on the perimeters of riverside park, so that the entirety of the parkland we don't know judgment's parking lots would be, would not be exempt.
We wanted to make sure you had a chance to ask a question if you have one or make a comment right, including the people janice mentioned, but you know elizabeth and mark At least we have one, so we think we're getting the mechanics working, here.
It's enforced, and my sense is that it's enforced in riverside park for sure thanks, I mean, as I was saying a little while ago after gail spoke, although there are always going to be some people, whether it's this law or another one who are going to violate it in general.
That people for the most part know that smoking is not allowed throughout the park where in those except at the perimeters And they obey that, and if the law then is extended to no longer exclude the perimeters and as we've drafted here, the parking lots and the malls as well you're going to get a one, would predict a pretty high degree of compliance, voluntary compliance with always some outliers and Then.
I go to inwood hill park, And I go to riverside park, but central park with the vast numbers of people, and It's the locals, who just feel that it's their park And they have a right to smoke in it, and that's really unfortunate and selfish, and I've done the same thing with some of the tourists We want to get the public I live at 170, westin avenue and heard about this meeting.
You know you can't have a zillion signs all at once, because we've got a lot of parks and a lot of perimeters, but I think it's a friendly amendment to ask for signage, inform informing the public that it smoking is prohibited anywhere within the parks.
I'd like to join the course thanking Manhattan borough president and also second ken's comment about supporting this for tobacco smoke and use in those adjacent areas, but I'm concerned about the addition of marijuana.
So, I, don't know if that impacts people's decisions on this resolution per se, but I do think it's something we need to figure out.
I just wanted to raise this that there is a council, member, and I want to confuse matters in Queens named peter coo k-o-o, who has some has proposed some legislation to ban smoking everywhere outside It's, very extreme, but I just thought kind of people should know about that.
I mean partly spurred by the coronavirus, but partly this was going on before how our public space is used, , it's sidewalks and street beds, and parking lanes and parking, lots and plazas and all of those areas of public space- You know we're not tonight going to be addressing the much broader issue of smoking in all of our public space.
Marijuana in our parks and marijuana smoke is as offensive to many, certainly to me, but I know to many other people.
To think that this resolution is in any way it's intended to suggest that it not be fully available if it otherwise is for medical use for having in brownies for having on fifth avenue, but not on this one side of the street, but not on not in central park, not in riverside park, not in our other parks.
Okay, I'm, going to suggest that we first vote on the resolution minus that sixth, whereas equivalent and minus the second paragraph that talks about extending prohibitions to marijuana with the changing landscape of cannabis.
So if this is all right with elizabeth and with mark, what we would be doing is voting on the resolution committee members and then non-committee board members.
I do not want to see people smoking at the perimeter of parks, because it's the smoke issue.
The smoke itself is what we're really voting on tonight and where that comes from whether it's a tobacco cigarette or marijuana, is really what we want to keep out of parks for the quality of life of the majority of residents.
The way we're going to do this one is please so for first for parks and environment committee members, please voting.
I am a non-committee member of parks, Are. You voting mark?
So committee members in favor, of adding those two paragraphs in I'm going to put my hand up, I, don't know if this is friendly or too late, but perhaps removing the first of the two paragraphs might make it easier for people to accept it.
I. Think imposing sort of a judgment on the marijuana used to be is a little a little I'll still vote for it, but I think that it sounds a little So if I mean, if passed, I mean our resolution, would still be asking for the same thing, but I put in the first of those two yellow paragraphs, because it kind of gave the background, but I.
We're, not here, to judge on marijuana use, we're here to judge on the fact that people don't like smoke in the parks and whether it's coming from marijuana or a vape or a cigarette, and you know, is to me irrelevant All things that are things that obstruct the quality of life in our neighborhood.
Let's mark, if you don't mind putting it back on the resolution, so everybody knows what we're voting on What we're going to vote on is the resolution minus the first paragraph that talks about marijuana, but with the second one I, don't know, are people raising their hands to vote or are they are they wanting to?
Think janice in particular has made a very good case for why the crowding of our sidewalks during Covid-19 times, which are certainly going to unfortunately likely continue through the fall, are a good reason to add the perimeters, and perhaps the you know the parking lots and the malls as well, because they're in there is it.
They know that we strongly supported and in fact, unanimously the basic resolution with the majority, also on the marijuana, add-on, and so I'm hoping personally, because I don't speak for community board seven, but I'm, hoping personally, that they will take it back to their bosses and see whether, in light of all of these considerations, including the importance of making the most breathable space around our everywhere in our parks during the Covid-19 time that they'll initiate something without waiting for our full board in september, because this is not something we can put into effect.
And I know we have a couple community members who wanted to speak You want to talk about your work with streetopia, I, think that's great, unless Yeah okay , so I just wanted to make sure that your committee saw our central park, advocates report and street films for those who haven't.
Well organized, and you know the timing works for people, My this is just kind of an advice to the representatives from the parks who are on the meeting today that maybe we could come up with some sort of a public outreach plan because the parks are just being used like never before, and that has consequences and vs community members can step up to help.
You know if there's anything in the works on the riverside side and certainly on the central park.
And, you know volunteer some time to do some basic cleanup, we'll contact both riverside conservancy and central park about this.
Many of and many of the committee members have considered those to be pretty urgent enforcement requests for our local community because of the increased use of use of these parks.
Yeah, I'm aware of the the issue it's signed, I've been communicating with my our borough office right, That came in about actually two one was about the opening date for riverside park, south the phase five and then about construction.
We want in because it's very much a parks issue as well, Then our committee meeting is the 21st Have a great summer.
