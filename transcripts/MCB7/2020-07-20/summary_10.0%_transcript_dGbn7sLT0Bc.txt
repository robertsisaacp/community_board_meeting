It was about petitions or getting signatures or permission from neighbors to use the street space for Parkside Are. We talking street space or park space, but you had said that if they wanted to do that, whatever that street program is that it would be helpful to get the sort of the okay in advance.
The only other thing that I'll mention is that our annual meeting is coming up on Thursday the 30th in the evening at five o'clock, and if people would like to join that, send us an email It's info at Columbus , Amsterdam bid, So, just a reminder to committee members and non- committee board members, just please put in the chat, your name, which will help us to keep a record of who is on the who's here of the attendance.
Maybe you could put this on right now for a moment mark what the current law is concerning smoking and non- smoking, The, smoking, prohibition in our parks and what the New York City parks and what the exceptions are.
I'll, be very impressed mark if you're able to do this so that I just took from the statute the definitions which define smoking is doing just about anything, and it does now include E- cigarettes too, but it but with tobacco Then there's this prohibition in our parks, which is what we talk about here in this committee.
It accepts from the prohibition sidewalks immediately adjoining parks, squares and public spaces places you'll see that at the bottom, basically pedestrian areas on our broad on strips, such as the Broadway malls, but it's probably also ocean parkway and things like that and parking lots in parks and then theatrical productions which I think is probably not something we much care.
One of the things that our community member mentioned to me is that with the Corona virus, situation, now, where you need to distance and wear masks, smokers are sitting on benches on the peripheries of the perimeters of parks, they're, obviously not wearing masks.
This is not just about the coronavirus situation, although it has certainly exacerbated the crowding in our parks and the crowding on the sidewalks at the edges of our parks, but also about just increasing consciousness of the dangers of second, hand, smoke, increasing public use of our parks in general, now concern- This is in the resolution as well, that the rip that the statute is written does not address.
What I'd like to do actually is if this is all right with you, Elizabeth I'd like to turn to Janice horowitz who's, the member of the public, who had actually kind of precipitated Yeah look forward to hearing from her that'd be great, okay, so mark, if you can put on the draft resolution, but also what we want to do is to find janice in our attendees and janice.
The ones that are listed in your resolution are definitely the ones that were exceptions, that I could not get rid of the sidewalks near parks and public spaces, and this one was a big issue of pedestrians, Through any median or mall, which of course, you mentioned in terms of the benches on Broadway, perfect, and then we're not going to talk about the parking lot.
Think one of the things you might want to hear and have some discussion about is who's going to do the enforcement, it's very clear in the park.
You know it's one thing to smoke: on: fifth, Avenue or Riverside drive on the opposite sidewalk, but it's another to be on a park bench in what's clearly a park on a parked sidewalk and our and our medians, and for that matter our parking lots, which are the three exceptions there And then there's the Marijuana issue.
And I can come back to that because I have personal experience with the NCOS who were anxious to enforce And, then the some of the park people also were very helpful, but then they told me it was actually legal to smoke, but I'm just going to go back and forgive me for missing not hearing the beginning.
Anybody, who wants to hang out on their park has to deal with people who are not wearing masks because they're smoking so kind of.
What happens is if you go out on this park, land, the edges of the park and sit on the benches you're, getting a double whammy, so the first part of that is that you're being exposed to secondhand smoke, which actually increases your risk of Covid-19 and the second part That's why I do not know who else managed to get on, but a lot of people were interested and that's why we're hoping that these exceptions can kind of go away, so people can enjoy the Parkland Janice.
Issues in our conversation, supports eliminating the exception of for smoking on the perimeters of Riverside park, so that the entirety of the parkland we do not know judgment's parking lots would be.
We wanted to make sure you had a chance to ask a question if you have one or make a comment right, including the people janice mentioned, but you know Elizabeth and Mark- We think we're getting the mechanics working, here.
You know accommodating to this, and I also spoke to the Park ranger, who said she would enforce it, but she thought that it was legal to smoke on the perimeters.
It's enforced, and my sense is that it's enforced in Riverside park for sure thanks, I mean, as I was saying a little while ago after Gail spoke, although there are always going to be some people, whether it's this law or another one who are going to violate it in general.
That people for the most part know that smoking is not allowed throughout the park where in those except at the perimeters And they obey that, and if the law then is extended to no longer exclude the perimeters and as we've drafted here, the parking lots and the malls as well you're going to get a one, would predict a pretty high degree of compliance, voluntary compliance with always some outliers and Then.
My problem is that I'm still seeing so many people in the park, smoking and and that interferes that really interferes with my rights that interferes with my health.
President and also second Ken's comment about supporting this for tobacco smoke and use in those adjacent areas, In addition to the comment that Ken mentioned, Marijuana is increasingly prescribed as a solution to a number of ailments to include here in New, York state.
So I would not support the resolution as written with the addition of the language for Marijuana, But let's hear from other people, first I think it was janice who mentioned the NCOS, who were very supportive.
So I, do not know if that impacts people's decisions on this resolution per se, but I do think it's something we need to figure out.
And I want to confuse matters in Queens named Peter Coo K- O, who has some, has proposed some legislation to ban smoking everywhere outside It's, very extreme, but I just thought kind of people should know about that.
, it's sidewalks and street beds, and parking lanes and parking, lots and plazas and all of those areas of public space- And you know we're not tonight going to be addressing the much broader issue of smoking in all of our public space.
Marijuana in our parks and Marijuana smoke is as offensive to many, certainly to me, but I know to many other people.
And then that I think, will you know, because we've heard some people that do not want it.
So if this is all right with Elizabeth and with Mark, what we would be doing is voting on the resolution committee members and then non- committee board members.
If or if we find that out, I suppose we could later just take them out, but that gives people who have the opposing opinions on the Marijuana issue, but otherwise support the resolution, the chance to support the resolution without it and then to see whether we add those two back end does that work for Elizabeth and Mark Suddenly I see Doug Clyman, so I just wanted to say that I supported the resolution.
I do not want to see people smoking at the perimeter of parks, because it's the smoke issue.
If I could just add, I think whoever made the comment that this was about the smoke itself is what we're really voting on tonight and where that comes from whether it's a tobacco cigarette or Marijuana, is really what we want to keep out of parks for the quality of life of the majority of residents.
The way we're going to do this one is please so for first for parks and Environment committee members, please voting.
I, am a non- committee, member of parks, You voting mark?
So, the next vote- and our last vote will be whether to put in this resolution in addition to what we've now all passed, putting back in the two paragraphs that are in yellow on your screen, so committee members in favor, of adding those two paragraphs in I'm going to put my hand up I do not know if this is friendly or too late, but perhaps removing the first of the two paragraphs might make it easier for people to accept it.
I, just I'm just wondering if there's a way to say that sort of all of the legally or sort of illegal forms of smoke in our city, right now, which include Marijuana.
We're, not here to judge on Marijuana use, we're here to judge on the fact that people do not like smoke in the parks and whether it's coming from Marijuana or a vape or a cigarette, and you know, is to me irrelevant It's all things that are things that obstruct the quality of life in our neighborhood, and you know again.
, how we're going to say, that, and maybe the committee would trust us to just come up with some something simple that would say that All types of smoking should not be in the park should not be done in the parks , and is everybody okay, with our just refining that language later we'll go on the assumption that this vote will take out this paragraph We'll plan on adding a few words about all forms of smoking should be banned.
So, everybody knows what we're voting on What we're going to vote on is the resolution minus the first paragraph that talks about Marijuana but with the second one And we'll add a little language about wanting all forms of smoking to be prohibited in our parks?
Think Janice in particular, has made a very good case for why the crowding of our sidewalks during Covid-19 times, which are certainly going to unfortunately likely continue through the fall, are a good reason to add the perimeters, and perhaps the you know the parking lots and the malls as well, because they're in there is it.
Think that's great unless Yeah okay, so I just wanted to make sure that your committee saw our central Park advocates report and street films for those who have not.
Well organized, and you know the timing works for people, My this is just kind of an advice to the representatives from the parks who are on the meeting today that maybe we could come up with some sort of a public outreach plan because the parks are just being used like never before, and that has consequences and vs community members can step up to help.
You know volunteer some time to do some basic cleanup , we'll contact both Riverside conservancy and central park about this.
It's a proposed resolution, sure No. It's not going to go anywhere on CB7 letterhead until we have the full board meeting in September, And I certainly hope it will be adopted because I voted for it but, as I said, the most important people to listen to our discussion tonight rather than us hearing each other, were the council members reps?
Yeah, I'm, aware of the the issue it's signed, I've been communicating with my our borough office right, And I think we had one other question that came in about actually two one was about the opening date for Riverside park, south the phase five and then about construction.
, I think maybe the only last thing to mention is that we will be meeting jointly with the transportation committee at their September meeting on the issue of Revel as it pertains to safety in general, but the parks in particular.
We want in because it's very much a parks issue as well, That's, September, 8th Then our committee meeting is the 21st Have a great summer.
