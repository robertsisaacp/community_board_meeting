I, know: I, don't know what the rules are yet on how people can use the online piece as they do the minutes, but I've always found that to be a helpful thing to do so, and my point is it'll, make it easier for whoever on the board may want to do it this month , We have one item on the agenda Do we have a volunteer tonight?
You may choose to review the zoom session Second I got a request from peter ernst, who is in the attendees to make a quick announcement with with respect to an upcoming event and we're working with tree stewards that we've been trying to develop cadre of, to distribute it on trees , I most likely on the bike lanes, because they seem to be the ones that are in the most stressed situation, but just know that that's out there and that if people are interested, they can contact us through our email info at columbus, amsterdam bid The only other thing that I'll mention is that our annual meeting is coming up on thursday, the 30th in the evening at five o'clock, and if people would like to join that, send us an email, So, just a reminder to committee members and non-committee board members.
and then there's this prohibition in our parks, which is what we talk about here in this committee It accepts from the prohibition sidewalks immediately adjoining parks, squares and public spaces places you'll see that at the bottom, basically pedestrian areas on our broad on strips, such as the broadway malls, but it's probably also ocean parkway and things like that and parking lots in parks and then theatrical productions which I think is probably not something we much care about.
If our resolution is adopted to change the law, but there is no enforcement and the parks department website specifically says we expect citizen enforcement, and so it's up to us to enforce There are areas of the parks where some of them are ambiguous, such as areas in riverside park, where there's no clear perimeter sidewalk others are not ambiguous, but have smokers frequently, who make the park space much less, really impossible for other park users to use the adjacent space One of the things that our community member mentioned to me is that with the corona virus situation, now, where you need to distance and wear masks, smokers are sitting on benches on the peripheries of the perimeters of parks, they're, obviously not wearing, masks This is not just about the coronavirus situation, although it has certainly exacerbated the crowding in our parks and the crowding on the sidewalks at the edges of our parks, but also about just increasing consciousness of the dangers of second-hand smoke.
In the same way, and in the same in the same manner as in our parks, It's not about other public space, the member of the public, who had actually kind of precipitated this is that all right Yeah look forward to hearing from her that'd be great, okay, so mark, if you can put on the draft resolution, but also what we want to do is to find janice in our attendees and janice I gave a really brief sort of introduction, but, as I said, I was really spurred on by your thoughts and her contact with What are what we typically do and elizabeth.
You might call it early evening to all committee members, but not to others so like to be able to show the draft resolution, but also committee members may find it more convenient to look at the email that version that they had for the last hour or so and I guess we should first plan and call on committee members who want to speak Even though mayor bloomberg was supportive was almost an example until I stopped it of having an area in the beach where you could smoke, which to me was just beyond disgusting, so that went away, but The ones that are listed in your resolution are definitely the ones that were exceptions that I couldn't get rid of the sidewalks near parks and public spaces, and this one was a big issue of pedestrians through any median or mall, which of course, you mentioned in terms of the benches on broadway, perfect, and then we're not going to talk about the parking lot.
You know it's one thing to smoke on fifth avenue or riverside drive on the opposite sidewalk, but it's another to be on a park bench in what's clearly a park on a parked sidewalk and our and our medians, and for that matter our parking lots, which are the three exceptions there and then there's the marijuana issue and I know you were talking about enforcement and I can come back to that, because I have personal experience with the ncos who were anxious to enforce and then the some of the park people also were very helpful.
That second hand smoke renders the lungs of the non-smoker more vulnerable to viral infections so years ago, that virus could have been anything, but today that virus means Covid-19 What happens is if you go out on this park, land the edges of the park and sit on the benches you're, getting a double whammy, so the first part of that is that you're being exposed to secondhand smoke, which actually increases your risk of Covid-19 and the second part That's why I don't know who else managed to get on, but a lot of people were interested and that's why we're hoping that these exceptions can kind of go away, so people can enjoy the parkland janice Thank you and we have 29 people listed as attendees.
I think there are a few people there might not be, but we do have a lot of attendees at this meeting So we wanted to make sure you had a chance to ask a question if you have one or make a comment right, including the people janice mentioned, but you know elizabeth and mark Should.
Doug we've sort of decided to wait with committee members until we've heard the public we've been around and we worked with gail when and with wefts, when we were trying to landmark the neighborhood and we totally support this and I think it's very clear what the dangers of second-hand smoke are and if we have any remedies at all, even with a lack of enforcement, I think we should go for it Thank.
You alan and thank you for your association having you here tonight who else from the public janice mentioned a number of people mark elizabeth Otherwise, we'll turn it over to the committee or make your comments When I talk about the enforcement thing.
and I also spoke to the park ranger, who said she would enforce it, but she thought that it was legal to smoke on the perimeters So. My feeling is, you know you can almost say that about everything you know who's going to enforce it, that you know you need the law there and then you can maybe work through the mechanics of being sure it's enforced, and my sense is that it's enforced in riverside park for sure thanks I mean, as I was saying a little while ago after gail spoke, although there are always going to be some people, whether it's this law or another one who are going to violate it in general, That I think has been my observation in both riverside and central park.
I go to inwood hill park and I go to riverside park, but central park with the vast numbers of people and it's the locals, who just feel that it's their park and they could and they have a right to smoke in it, and that's really unfortunate and selfish and I've done the same thing with some of the tourists We want to get the public I live at 170, westin avenue and heard about this meeting.
Nobody much ever pays and the main concern is for the signage, and elizabeth I want to get back to ken's marijuana point, but let's hear everybody else, I'd like to join the course thanking Manhattan borough president and also second ken's comment about supporting this for tobacco smoke and use in those adjacent areas, but I'm concerned about the addition of marijuana In addition to the comment that ken mentioned, marijuana is increasingly prescribed as a solution to a number of ailments to include here in new york.
I'm gonna want to say something more about that, but let's hear from other people first Coming back to the enforcement question, I'm wondering if ncos actually exist anymore or not in our district Since the pandemic began, as everybody would agree, there's been a lot more usage of all the parks all over the city and a lot more people who've never used the park have no idea what the rules are, whether they're, locals or I'm sure there aren't too many tourists around these days, but in terms of the trash they leave behind, which you can see as even just a casual observer Can, you can smell the smoke, whether it's marijuana or just tobacco, and you can even see that in the trash which is overflowing so I think additional signage all over would be very helpful whether it's about tobacco usage or marijuana whatever it is.
Recreational use legal So, I, don't know if that impacts people's decisions on this resolution per se, but I do think it's something we need to figure out tonight.
Both bold I, think okay, so if this is all right with elizabeth and with mark, what we would be doing is voting on the resolution committee members and then non-committee board members Without these two paragraphs.
Nobody opposed nobody abstaining, nobody ineligible, so the resolution carries, looks like seven zero and five zero We're going to do is take the second vote However just before we do that, I see in the comments and the chat, rather that a couple of people have put in a link of various links to I Not sure what to various legislation, Has anybody put in a link that answers the question to whether marijuana is now treated like tobacco, currently or I believe that marijuana is not on the list, because marijuana is not legal yet so I'm, pretty sure that that's why it's not there hookahs actually were added, and so my hunch is that if marijuana became legal, it would be added as something that was being smoked.
I think imposing sort of a judgment on the marijuana used to be is a little a little I'll still vote for it, but I think that it sounds a little So. If I mean if passed, I mean our resolution would still be asking for the same thing but I put in the first of those two yellow paragraphs, because it kind of gave the background, but I, don't I , just I'm just wondering if there's a way to say that sort of all of the legally or sort of illegal forms of smoke in our city right now, which include marijuana.
To judge on marijuana use, we're here to judge on the fact that people don't like smoke in the parks and whether it's coming from marijuana or a vape or a cigarette, and you know, is to me irrelevant it's all things that are things that obstruct the quality of life in our neighborhood I mean marijuana is the outlier at this point Do we say it earlier in the resolution?
So everybody knows what we're voting on What we're going to vote on is the resolution minus the first paragraph that talks about marijuana, but with the second one I don't know, are people raising their hands to vote or are they are they wanting to?
Think janice in particular, has made a very good case for why the crowding of our sidewalks during Covid-19 times, which are certainly going to unfortunately likely continue through the fall, are a good reason to add the perimeters, and perhaps the you know the parking lots and the malls as well, because they're in it Is it a possible procedure to have this resolution come before the steering committee, which happens to meet tomorrow night, or does that not work within our procedures?
They know that we strongly supported and in fact unanimously the basic resolution with the majority, also on the marijuana, add-on and so I'm hoping personally, because I don't speak for community board seven but I'm, hoping personally, that they will take it back to their bosses and see whether, in light of all of these considerations, including the importance of making the most breathable space around our everywhere in our parks during the Covid-19 time that they'll initiate something without waiting for our full board in september, because this is not something we can put into effect.
and you know the timing works for people, so my this is just kind of an advice to the representatives from the parks who are on the meeting today that maybe we could come up with some sort of a public outreach plan because the parks are just being used like never before, and that has consequences and vs community members can step up to help.
You know, I, see people in there all the time I've been communicating with my our borough office right and I think we had one other question that came in about actually two one was about the opening date for riverside park, south the phase five and then about construction Let's, see on pools which paul fisher was asking if a pool isn't opening, but maybe the riverside park.
