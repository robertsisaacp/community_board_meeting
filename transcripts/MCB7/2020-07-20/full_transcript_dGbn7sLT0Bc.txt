Hello: hey there. How are you good to see you or not see you yeah? I'm just gonna eat my dinner, then I'll join audio. I mean video perfectly fine, so I didn't I was my daughter was on this thing on the atlantic council. She was being interviewed about her book, so I wasn't able to talk to you know. While you were on the train or whatever about that whole using park space. Actually it was about petitions or getting signatures or permission from neighbors to use the street space for parkside yeah. I sort of lost the thread there. Are we talking street space or park space, but you had said that if they wanted to do that, whatever that street program is that it would be helpful to get the sort of the okay in advance from the neighbors like to close off the street, I was I was liking, it yeah program may be too sophisticated a word. There are play streets right and we've and generally speaking, play street permissions are granted by the DOT, but they want to see a recommendation from the community board first, and there are only a few on the upper west side. There was one that was a huge knockdown drag out for years on 100 on 107th street, hey ken on 107th street, and at one time the solution was contemplated to make the play street 108th. Instead, that was a non-starter because there was a parking garage at one end of 108th street and the and the d.o.t would essentially not consider any solution that would block off a street that would prohibit a parking garage from having people come and go. I know that there's not a parking garage on the street, they said there is a school and I forget the name of it now and some kind of a home. I mean this whole thing is just you know, I'm sure you can appreciate how many meetings we're having to talk about potentially reopening what the reopening plan is, etc. So they're kind of just looking to see what all the options might be yep. So, but I'll talk to you more, maybe tomorrow when we're on the other call at the or at the end of the other call. Okay, great. Okay, sorry cause! I know we're starting apart. Thank you, pleasure, hey everyone hi, so it looks as if we have all of our members plus doug clyman shelly had said he was going to join us tonight. Oh suddenly, we have 11 14 attendees yeah. When you broadcast the attendees are admitted and I'm promoting our colleagues. I see yeah and you're promoting helen. I am I thought helen wasn't gonna be able to join us. That's great! That may well be marisa or julian. It's julian good evening. Everyone, hey julian good, to see you welcome. Are you ready to get started? If you are, I guess we should elizabeth. I think we should let's open it up. Okay, so do you want to start? You want me to start? Oh, we need somebody to take the minute. Oh there's barbara adler, she's joined us too. That's great, we need some is susan. Schwartz is not with us yet. I think all our other committee members are on which is great who's going to do the minutes. Elizabeth you want to find a volunteer for us, I'm happy to ask for a volunteer. I don't know how mark in this era of digital, if we are, this meeting is being recorded right. Yes, it is so I think just I would. I know I don't know what the rules are yet on how people can use the online piece as they do the minutes, but I've always found that to be a helpful thing to do so. The easiest way to do it is to go onto our youtube channel. At the end of the meeting, I saved the youtube and that seems to work better than the zoom recording. So I recommend that, but my point is that I think pen and paper in this in this zoom era is trumped by either going to the youtube or doing it on zoom, so if it makes it easy- and my point is it'll- make it easier for whoever on the board may want to do it this month. So I don't know if we draw straws, I mean I'm happy to do the recording and do it. We have one item on the agenda, I'm happy to do it. If nobody else wants to do it. Given. Okay, I completely disagree. I think that written minutes accurate written minutes that one can look at on our website as they document as a written document. No, that's not what I was saying clara. What I was saying was that I know we've got the zoom backup, but I think we need we need. We need minutes. We need normal written minutes right. The minutes will be written, but my point is they write them after seeing they can take notes and then they can write them after reviewing if they need to see somebody in their name which the name of everyone is listed on here they can get the spellings correct. Of course it's a very useful tool and I think it should be used more frequently. I thought you meant sort of in lieu of or semi, but you didn't no yeah. It is a use. It is a useful tool to help create accurate written minutes, but we need somebody to do it. Who do we have a volunteer tonight? We don't have a volunteer, yet do we maybe susan looks like natasha. Is volunteering okay and natasha we've also not maybe not, for the first time learned something which is perhaps before actually sending them to us. You may choose to review the zoom session. That'll help you with names and things like that. So if I could just interject for one second, I got a request from peter ernst, who is in the attendees to make a quick announcement with with respect to an upcoming event. Is that okay and sure that's great, and I see that gail's also joined right, which is great, terrific peter? Can you hear us and if so, can you unmute and give us the lowdown right now? Peter okay, can you hear me now there you go okay, great sorry about that. It took me a moment quickly. This saturday, the trees are really stressed. We've been watering, occasionally, we've been weeding some but they're just in trouble and we're hoping to get a load of mulch from parks department saturday morning and we're working with tree stewards that we've been trying to develop cadre of to distribute it on trees. I most likely on the bike lanes because they seem to be the ones that are in the most stressed situation, but just know that that's out there and that if people are interested, they can contact us through our email info at columbus, amsterdam bid and we'll be trying to do that this saturday. The only other thing that I'll mention is that our annual meeting is coming up on thursday, the 30th in the evening at five o'clock, and if people would like to join that, send us an email and we'll make sure we get the invitation and information to you. Thank you for allowing me to say this early sure peter. Thank you. Excuse me peter. What is the address? The email address? Ah, it's info at columbus, amsterdam bid I'll put it into the chat. Okay, natasha! Thank you, okay, okay! So just a reminder to committee members and non-committee board members, just please put in the chat, your name, which will help us to keep a record of who is on the who's here of the attendance. So let's move right into our first item because it we are delighted to have gail brewer with us tonight. She was the author of the legislation or part of the legislation that we're talking about tonight, and I had a call just before the meeting from steve simon from the parks department they're not able to join us tonight, but matt genrich, who is a parks. Person typically joins us and we're expecting him, and we have jason julian de la porta from helen rosenthal's office as well, and we're expecting eric from council member levine's office. I'm not sure if he's with us yet eric and julian should be turned made. Participants right mark sure- and I just wanted to know, while we're on that theme, that erica overton from linda rosenthal's office is also with us. Thank you for joining all of these folks and I'll promote eric as soon as he gets here. Okay. So let me start with this one, because I'll tell you I actually have sort of sponsoring this one tonight. The last two resolutions we talked about at our two prior committee meetings were sponsored by one of our members, but I'm kind of the one behind primarily behind this one. These are issues about smoking in our parks that I've been thinking about for a while. But additionally, this was really spurred by a community member named janice horowitz, who was one of our attendees tonight. She had contacted the board. She and I had spoken a couple of times and it really was a good spur for us to actually come up with this as a as an agenda item for night to the night, that's very timely, so I had distributed to committee members. A draft resolution that I read this afternoon but also and mark, has that he can put it on the screen when we I want to, but also had created a document. That shows- and maybe you could put this on right now for a moment mark what the current law is concerning smoking and non-smoking the smoking prohibition in our parks and what the new york city parks and what the exceptions are I'll, be very impressed mark if you're able to do this so that I just took from the statute the definitions which define smoking is doing just about anything, and it does now include e-cigarettes too, but it but with tobacco and then there's this prohibition in our parks, which is what we talk about here in this committee. But it accepts from the prohibition sidewalks immediately adjoining parks, squares and public spaces places you'll see that at the bottom, basically pedestrian areas on our broad on strips, such as the broadway malls, but it's probably also ocean parkway and things like that and parking lots in parks and then theatrical productions which I think is probably not something we much care about. So the issues are, and the reason we are talking about this tonight is that, first of all, there's no. If I can just sort of do an intro here and then we'll turn it over for discussion, there's there's really no enforcement by- and this is not. This is not a resolution asking for enforcement. This resolution asking the council to if it's, if our resolution is adopted, to change the law, but there is no enforcement and the parks department website specifically says we expect citizen enforcement, and so it's up to us to enforce. But there are areas of the parks where some of them are ambiguous, such as areas in riverside park, where there's no clear perimeter, sidewalk others are not ambiguous, but have smokers frequently, who make the park space much less, really impossible for other park users to use the adjacent space. One of the things that our community member mentioned to me is that with the corona virus situation, now, where you need to distance and wear masks, smokers are sitting on benches on the peripheries of the perimeters of parks, they're, obviously not wearing masks. They make it very hard for anybody to distance around them. But this is not just about the coronavirus situation, although it has certainly exacerbated the crowding in our parks and the crowding on the sidewalks at the edges of our parks, but also about just increasing consciousness of the dangers of second-hand smoke. Increasing public use of our parks in general now concern- and this is in the resolution as well, that the rip that the statute is written doesn't address marijuana. It talks about tobacco products and now, as the legal landscape on the all aspects of marijuana, is changing. One thing this does is asks to have marijuana explicitly prohibited in the same way and in the same, in the same manner as in our parks. This is just about parks. It's not about other public space. At this point as tobacco products mark, I think that's my intro, and I guess what we should. What I'd like to do actually is if this is all right with you, elizabeth I'd like to turn to janice horowitz who's, the member of the public, who had actually kind of precipitated this is that all right, and then we can turn to the discussion. Yeah look forward to hearing from her that'd be great, okay, so mark, if you can put on the draft resolution, but also what we want to do is to find janice in our attendees and janice. If you're there we're going to unmute you, how are we going to find janna? She was there, oh. If, while we're waiting for her, if gail wants to join, I don't know if gayle should maybe yeah. Maybe we should he'll hear anything. Gail has to say let dennis go ahead. I can wait, I'm fine all right janice! I saw janice on the list here and we need to understand. I mean we need to make me mad. Muted, you got her oops. Can you guess I'm here? You know I gave a really brief sort of introduction, but, as I said, I was really spurred on by your thoughts and her contact with. I need you here we'd, be delighted to hear you a little bit. Okay, I'm not sure you can just reassure me that you can hear me because you can obviously okay, because I can neither hear or see you so I'm glad I keep screaming for my husband, the techno whiz. So yes- and thank you so much for calling this meeting go ahead. Janice have we lost her. She can't hear you not. According to my my screen, we're not muted. Are we mark? We are not. What do we do? I think you turn to gail and I will try to find janice through email. Okay, although gail we hope you'll be with us for as many comments as you can, but we'd love to hear from you, I'm fine, but I think mark she indicated that she couldn't hear you so janice. Maybe you want to keep trying. I don't want yeah. I think we just need to text her or like message her, which I can try to do right now. I think she's up tell you what I've got her phone number here. So why don't? I do that, while you run the meeting how's that okay, so I guess before we hear from jonas, which we hope will do shortly. What are what we typically do and elizabeth if this is the way you want to do it tonight, is we first ask? Well we want to get the proposed. I mean I drafted it quickly this afternoon, but I think it covered the bases like to get that on the screen. I did distribute it this afternoon late this afternoon. You might call it early evening to all committee members, but not to others so like to be able to show the draft resolution, but also committee members may find it more convenient to look at the email that version that they had for the last hour or so, and I guess we should first plan and call on committee members who want to speak and I'm looking at participants, that's in the wrong place on my screen panel. I guess panelists is what we're called yeah and I think again I don't know if gail, if you're you'd like to say a word or two now or if we want to move it to other panelists for their comments. But I can do it quickly if you want so let me go, I can go very quickly. It's up to you, gail yeah I'll, go very quickly, because I can give a little context. The smoke-free air act was my bill and we spent a great deal of time negotiating it. Even though mayor bloomberg was supportive. There were a lot of you know. Smokers who objected, as you can imagine- and I remember one instance was it- was almost an example until I stopped it of having an area in the beach where you could smoke, which to me was just beyond disgusting, so that went away, but it was that kind of looking for ways to satisfy the smokers that I had to keep fighting. So the ones that are listed in your resolution are definitely the ones that were exceptions that I couldn't get rid of the sidewalks near parks and public spaces, and this one was a big issue of pedestrians, yeah through any median or mall, which of course, you mentioned in terms of the benches on broadway, perfect and then we're not going to talk about the parking lot. Let me just talk about the areas near the parks and the issues of the medians. The problem is, who is the enforcer, and I couldn't find an enforcer for the medians? I was absolutely not able to do it. I mean d.o.t said this: not them parks. That says it's not them, and that was one reason it got left out, the sidewalks along parks and so on. It would seem to me that would might be parked. Don't forget. Parks goes, as I understand it, you could correct me. Clary goes to the actual end of the sidewalk in adjoining to a park. It's not dlt, that's correct, but then it wasn't clear that parks would actually do the enforcement there. So I think one of the things you might want to hear and have some discussion about is who's going to do the enforcement, it's very clear in the park. It is the park whether there's enforcement or not is another story, but it is the parks department. There was this big thing in the median and the adjoining: is it d.o.t or is it parks? And then at the end, I just you know you're trying to pass a bill and I gave up so that's the that's the honest history of where we ended up now. I hate smoking, the less the better. I would be happy if we could get rid of it. There is, you know smoking near the parks, partly because people can't smoke in the parks, and I think they know that, and so they do pick areas right next door, and so I think it would be. You know excellent, but I do think we need to think about who's going to be the regulator. I suppose it's supposed to be parts, but you have to see if they would even pretend to be the enforcers, let alone be the enforcer. So that's what I remember and I think that's where you know- between the conservancy, the parks department and at least having a conversation with d.o.t. I don't think it's in today's world. I don't think it's going to be NYPD or maybe it could. You know I don't it's not going to be in life eating yeah. That's what I would consider. I spend all my time trying to figure out between the sheriff the mayor's office of special enforcement fire department, buildings, department and you know nightlife and so on, who's in charge of the restaurants. So I think in this case we need to figure out who's actually going to do the enforcement. If anybody yeah doesn't matter, then that's a different issue, but that's where I got stuck thanks very much. That background is extremely helpful and you did very well for us and for our parks users at the time to get it past. It all- and you know, in terms of enforcement. As I said, it's pretty clear and even the parks department website says it's. They expect citizens for the most part to do enforcement, but most park users even presumably most smokers. If they know it's, if there's no smoking they're not going to do it, they're always going to be some violators, as we know from other types of illegal activities we've talked about recently, but for the most part, if the law is clear, presumably people will comply, including smokers when they call 3-1-1, who is supposed to answer. Presumably pap is, but that's my educated gas scale, but you know in the real world. Are they going to probably not, but I guess the reason that I and I know as spurred by janice and if we can get her back. Oh there's, I see her picking his back. The reason that I was pushing for this tonight is, and janice will talk about. Some of these reasons, too, is those exceptions which were necessary to get the law passed in 2011. I think it was you know times have changed, there's more and more concern about second-hand smoking. We've now got coronavirus social, distancing and masks and smokers who are on what is clearly our park sidewalks. You know it's one thing to smoke on fifth avenue or riverside drive on the opposite sidewalk, but it's another to be on a park bench in what's clearly a park on a parked sidewalk and our and our medians, and for that matter our parking lots, which are the three exceptions there and then there's the marijuana issue. That is also addressed here because it's not a tobacco product, but it ought to be treated in the same way so talking to janice and then looking at this and researching it, at least it's my view, but this is for our us all to discuss tonight that it's time for those exceptions to go but janice, do we have you on audio now I have just. Can you hear me? Yes now we do. Can you hear us so here's the thing? I missed what gail what you said: gail brewer, so I hope I'm not redundant, and I know you were talking about enforcement and I can come back to that because I have personal experience with the ncos who were anxious to enforce and then the some of the park people also were very helpful. But then they told me it was actually legal to smoke, but I'm just going to go back and forgive me for missing not hearing the beginning. While I was working through all this technical stuff, so the upshot is, as I did here, everybody agrees. Secondhand smoke is bad for you, that's why it was banned on park land in restaurants, outdoor buildings and on your way into an office building. So, as you know, I believe we understand that there were certain exceptions made ten years ago and that included the edges of the park that we call the park perimeters. But those perimeters or edges happen right now, more than ever are being used a lot, an increased use during the time of Covid-19. So here is why it's critical right now to rectify or get rid of those exceptions during the time of Covid-19 and honestly, it's very simple, and that is in order to smoke, people remove their masks period and they sit on the benches for a long time without masks. When other people want to use the park land. Our seniors want to sit on the benches under trees. Mothers with strollers want to sit on those benches kids who want to bounce a ball. Anybody who wants to hang out on their park has to deal with people who aren't wearing masks because they're smoking so kind of. As a result, these edges this park land that you really go to presuming and hoping that it's a less risky area for Covid-19, it's less congested, ends up actually being a greater risk, because again, smokers are sitting for a long time for hours without their masks on and essentially the result is the rest of us who want to sit. There are disenfranchised from our park from the park, so there are other reasons, and that is secondhand. Smoke poses health problems that today have a direct impact on kovid, and this has actually been known for decades. I wrote about this at time magazine when I covered health. That second hand smoke renders the lungs of the non-smoker more vulnerable to viral infections so years ago, that virus could have been anything, but today that virus means Covid-19. So as so, what happens is if you go out on this park, land the edges of the park and sit on the benches you're, getting a double whammy, so the first part of that is that you're being exposed to secondhand smoke, which actually increases your risk of Covid-19 and the second part is those hazards are compounded because smokers aren't wearing masks for hours. So that's why I don't know who else managed to get on, but a lot of people were interested and that's why we're hoping that these exceptions can kind of go away, so people can enjoy the parkland janice. Thank you and we have 29 people listed as attendees. Some of them are names I recognize because they join us frequently. Many of them may be people who you have done outreach with, because many of them are not familiar names mark. Did we promote matt genrich to a participant to panelist rather, but he's a parks guy, so we have lots of a number of members of the public. It looks like maybe 20 or so some of them janus. Maybe people that you have helped us publicize this too. So is that what you wanted to say janice, if so, we'll move on to other discussion yeah? Well, this has the backing and maybe ellen kessler and kessler and bacha luton. You can acknowledge them because they represent groups that are behind this one being the west 80s, neighborhood association and then bach's group and for livable new york, who, I guess you know, and then we have somebody from the church on 86th and amsterdam. I forgive me susan. I don't know your last name but susan. So we've got some. You know groups behind this too. Okay, thanks janice and we will be calling on give a chance to speak to anybody in the community who is signed on as an attendee, so the people you mentioned or anybody else in the community will have a chance to speak just one other thing I forgot to say, as I was doing an intro here, and that is, I did speak this week with the ceo and president of the riverside park, conservancy dan gorodnik, what I was just repeating his name. That's all! Oh damn! Yes, who authorized me to say that he couldn't join us tonight, but we had a good discussion. He authorized me to say that the riverside park, conservancy in a general way supports. We really were focusing on the perimeter. Issues in our conversation supports eliminating the exception of for smoking on the perimeters of riverside park so that the entirety of the parkland we don't know judgment's parking lots would be would not be exempt the whole. The whole footprint of the park would be included and they support their. He authorized me to say they support that. Let's look, I suppose, as we normally do to people from the committee who want to speak. Actually, if there are people from, I maybe a question or two from the committee, but I think because we have many people from the okay, the other way around fine. I think I mean ken. If your question is quick, I think I think you're the only one with your hand raised right now, yeah. I had a comment on the resolution, not a question. Okay, so maybe we go to the committee then, or the community then and then come back. Fine, let's look at the community and see how how the same thing happened to me at the last meeting, elizabeth and mark. I am not sure I am seeing hands up or ability to see the hands up. How do people do that? So go ahead? Elizabeth I was just going to say I think they can raise. They can go into the q a function and raise their hands, not the q and a sorry the chat they got participants, that's the one. The participants function raise your hand. I think there are a few people there might not be, but we do have a lot of attendees at this meeting. So we wanted to make sure you had a chance to ask a question if you have one or make a comment right, including the people janice mentioned, but you know elizabeth and mark I'm not saying that on my list, but I think that's because of how I'm doing something wrong. So are you seeing okay? So I'm seeing in the chat someone's saying, where's, the oh and paul fisher joined us great, a participant's function. So if you bring your cursor down to the bottom of the screen on most computers anyway, then there'll be a pop-up series of buttons, one of which is participants. If you click on that, then you'll get a list of panelists and a list of attendees. You can toggle back and forth and in that list of participants is the ability to raise your little blue hand. So I see ellen kessler with her hand raised okay at least we have one, so we think we're getting the mechanics working here. Should we call let's call on ellen kessler and hope, then that other members of the public will raise their hands doug we've sort of decided to wait with committee members until we've heard the public. If that's okay, doug mcgowan is a member okay, ellen kessler, I'm going to click, allow to talk that should unmute ellen. Is that right, mark and elizabeth? I think I unmuted myself good okay, you're good, I for anyone who's using an ipad. The little raised hand icon is on the top on the top right when I'm holding it in landscape, so hi everyone, I'm ellen kessler, I'm on the board of the west 80's neighborhood association we've been around and we worked with gail when and with wefts, when we were trying to landmark the neighborhood, and we totally support this. We think it's long overdue for all the reasons that you guys and janice have mentioned. I have been working with janice to help her do outreach and I think it's very clear what the dangers of second-hand smoke are and if we have any remedies at all, even with a lack of enforcement, I think we should go for it. So thank you. Thank you, alan and thank you for your association having you here tonight who else from the public janice mentioned a number of people mark elizabeth. Do we see hands up? I don't actually, but just this is the time to ask your questions. Otherwise, we'll turn it over to the committee or make your comments yeah comments too. When I talk about the enforcement thing, I really miss the whole beginning, but my vague understanding is that there's concern about enforcement and in the park I go to riverside park all the time. You don't see people smoking. So even if there isn't, you know somebody out there specifically enforcing it's understood. I really don't see people smoking and I'm there all the time I had initially asked the nco from the 20th precinct about enforcing, not a smoking ban on the perimeters, and that's when I learned it actually was legal. They were quite- and I know it's a different era now, but they were. He and his colleagues were quite eager to help they spent a week trying to figure out whether it was legal or not. So they were. You know accommodating to this, and I also spoke to the park ranger, who said she would enforce it, but she thought that it was legal to smoke on the perimeters. So my feeling is, you know you can almost say that about everything you know who's going to enforce it, that you know you need the law there and then you can maybe work through the mechanics of being sure it's enforced, and my sense is that it's enforced in riverside park for sure thanks, janice yeah, I mean, as I was saying a little while ago after gail spoke, although there are always going to be some people, whether it's this law or another one who are going to violate it in general. That I think has been my observation in both riverside and central park. That people for the most part know that smoking is not allowed throughout the park where in those except at the perimeters and they obey that, and if the law then is extended to no longer exclude the perimeters and as we've drafted here, the parking lots and the malls as well you're going to get a one, would predict a pretty high degree of compliance, voluntary compliance with always some outliers and then that's an issue on any statute. Really, I'm disappointed that we don't have more members of the public who'd like to speak, but let's see are we finding any more? Why don't you speak? No! Okay. Do we mark elizabeth? Do we see any others yeah? I don't see anyone so unless you know we'd really love to have anyone? Oh can I think ken has a comment so we're going. I guess we'll turn to committee members. No! Can ken shaya ken, oh sure, right ken shaya? Have we unmuted him we're going to give you a slow count of three and then we're going to move on? So are you trying to find him yeah? No, I mean he, I think he's been unmuted he's unmuted I've unmuted himself. Okay, I'm on music. Now hi everybody! Thank you hi ken hi. I hope everyone is well in staying healthy, I'm trying to stay healthy too, and smoking interferes with that process. I wasn't aware that people were legally allowed to smoke on the park perimeter so just attending. This meeting has taught me something that I didn't know before. My problem is that I'm still seeing so many people in the park, smoking and and that interferes that really interferes with my rights that interferes with my health. That's an imposition on me. I don't care if people want to smoke, that's their business, but smoking should be their problem, not mine or yours or anyone else that wants to use an entrance to the park or enjoy the fresh air in the park. So I would just love to see a resolution come out of this that in some way affects greater enforcement on the benefits of public health and safety. Thank you very much ken. When you mentioned the park you were talking about central park. Is that right? I was talking primarily yes about central park. Thank you for your gratification, but I do I do I go to inwood hill park and I go to riverside park but central park with the vast numbers of people, and sometimes it's you know it's simply an out-of-towner. It's a someone from europe, a tourist and I've spoken to them and many times, they're very understanding and accommodating it's the locals, who just feel that it's their park and they could and they have a right to smoke in it, and that's really unfortunate and selfish, and I've done the same thing with some of the tourists but you're right. There are some outliers who don't obey shelley. I see your hand, but I also saw aaron damas is also waiting yeah. We want to get the public and I think a couple more have come up. Karen damas is unmuted right, karen demons. Yes, I am, can you hear me yep wonderful? I live at 170, westin avenue and heard about this meeting heard about the proposal and I'm just here to say rah-rah. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, please! Let's do it. We like to have an appreciative part. Thank you. Get on our website. Follow us on twitter, we'd love to have you stay involved with community board 7.. Absolutely I thought I saw sam vasalo as a public as a community member, but now I can't find him hand is not up, though I see him in chat. Jan alexander, I think, has raised her hand or his hand. Let's find jan alexander, you thought you have you found her in on me. Is it she and unmuted? I have allowed to talk so, whoever, if jan, if you're there? Okay. Yes, can you hear me? I just unmuted my mind great excellent, welcome john thank you. I just wanted. I just wanted to say that I'm an upper west side resident all right, I'm on a conference, I'm an upper west side resident and I just want to say I support the resolution. That's really we! You know we depend on being able to go outside for health reasons now, especially so, with new york being a model of public court health corp operation for the rest of the country. This is really the time to ban smoking in all public areas. Are you kidding with this smoking? Don't know who that was, but all of you please who are not speaking, please mute there. You go yeah, I think maybe we'll take what she wanted and move on unless she back. So thank you all right, any other members of the public who listen. Sorry, I just want to let you know those, that's the kind of comment I got when I passed my bill. Well, gail again, thank you for doing it, yes, and thanks for staying and listening, because this is starting to coalesce in a way I'm happy about, but we don't we're not there yet. So, let's even dividing households yeah right clearly, so I told my husband to just leave the room, but he would have agreed. I can tell you my husband would support this. So any other again, I'm going up and down the list. I don't see any hands up among community members. Elizabeth mark. Do you? No, I think, we're good, so we can all right so in the order in which we saw them we're going to have ken coughlin doug mcgowan, I think shelley was second and doug was third, it doesn't matter we'll get there again. Okay, first of all, I'm gonna join the chorus to thank gail for championing this very important legislation. I remember when it was passed and I was absolutely delighted and I would wholeheartedly support, closing loopholes for tobacco smoke. I think it's very important that we take it right to the edge of the park and not have these exceptions, but I do question why we're lumping in marijuana? The science is very clear that tobacco secondhand smoke and direct tobacco smoke causes lung cancer. As far as I know, there is no science to support the same for marijuana and marijuana is already illegal, as far as I know so, we're just sort of adding it to legality onto illegality, which I hope will change, but I don't think it's a huge problem. I don't know the original law was about tobacco and I don't think we should be tinkering with the original law. I think we should just try to expand it. The original law is purview and you were correct and that's also mark put on the screen earlier. The original the existing law speaks to the use of various uses of tobacco. That is correct. That's what it governs, let's go to doug and shelly, and either order shelley. You want to go next. Okay, thank you, I'm all for extending the ban of gayle's original law to the perimeter, particularly because of the dangers of secondary smoke, and I'd like to add that maybe we should have some type of since we can't guarantee enforcement at least some type of penalty. In a sign that says no smoking is the law at the at these sites and also to have some type of fine to at least give it some weight and not just be assigned. So I would certainly encourage adding something about letting people know by signage shelly. Let me address that quickly. I would regard as a friendly amendment, and I would ask elizabeth because she's the co-chair, but I would regard as a friendly amendment, putting in a phrase asking for signage around the perimeters of parks. You know you can't have a zillion signs all at once, because we've got a lot of parks and a lot of perimeters, but I think it's a friendly amendment to ask for signage, inform informing the public that it smoking is prohibited anywhere within the parks. If that's where we go with regard to penalties, there is a penalty in the law. I don't recall what it is. Perhaps gail recalls what it is. You don't need for the council to create a penalty. You may not think it's high enough, but it's not as if there are no penalties in the law. It's just that in the real world. Nobody much ever pays and the main concern is for the signage, yeah and elizabeth. Is that a friendly amendment? That's great! It's fine, yeah! Okay, it's a very good suggestion! Thank you. I want to get back to ken's marijuana point, but let's hear everybody else. First, we had a doug mcgowan thanks clary. Can you hear me perfect? I'd like to join the course thanking Manhattan borough president and also second ken's comment about supporting this for tobacco smoke and use in those adjacent areas, but I'm concerned about the addition of marijuana. So, in addition to the comment that ken mentioned, marijuana is increasingly prescribed as a solution to a number of ailments to include here in new york state. It's different than tobacco smoke as marijuana is prescribed as a solution. So in fact, as per a number of recent set of bills signed into law by the governor, marijuana is now prescribed for ailments to include post-traumatic stress disorder. It is prescribed for post-traumatic stress disorder, because a number of veterans organizations sought to include this as a treatment for post-traumatic stress. So in the discussion, there's been a dis discussion about how Covid-19, in this particular environment with kobe, there is an increased need to pass a piece of this resolution related to tobacco. But I would interject and argue that we will likely see increased post-traumatic stress from this cobit crisis here in new york and to limit the ability of individuals to consider as an option for post-traumatic stress. The use of marijuana may or may not be a good thing in many individuals in new york are unable to smoke as it as it is in their buildings, whether it be in their co-ops or their rent, their rented homes and look to smoke, whether it be tobacco or whatever else outside. So we would be limiting not only the location but also we would, as ptsd increases we would be getting in between an individual and their right to seek treatment for the ailment caused by, in this case the Covid-19. So I wouldn't support the resolution as written with the addition of the language for marijuana. Okay, I I'm gonna want to say something more about that, but let's hear from other people first we had shelley. We had doug, we had ken do we have other types of I think natasha and then barbara adler, hi yeah. I was wondering somebody I think it was janice who mentioned the ncos, who were very supportive. Do we have any more ncos in our district? My understanding was that they no longer exist. So, coming back to the enforcement question, I'm wondering if ncos actually exist anymore or not in our district, and I also want to piggyback on what shelley was saying about signage, but I would say not just on the perimeters of the parks, but actually even within the parks. Just since the pandemic began, as everybody would agree, there's been a lot more usage of all the parks all over the city and a lot more people who've never used the park have no idea what the rules are, whether they're locals or I'm sure there aren't too many tourists around these days, but in terms of the trash they leave behind, which you can see as even just a casual observer. You know there is a lot of you. Can you can smell the smoke, whether it's marijuana or just tobacco, and you can even see that in the trash which is overflowing, so I think additional signage all over would be very helpful whether it's about tobacco usage or marijuana whatever it is. I think that would be very helpful and also I thought recreational use of marijuana was about to become legal in new york. State imminently, so it's not just about ptsd and medical use, but I'm expecting even recreational views to increase soon. So I, as a result, I think it is important to put that in the resolution and I would support including marijuana in there as well. Thank you thanks natasha in terms of your signage point, while it's really hard to get signage, it's hard enough to get signage on the periphery of parks, much less inside parks, but I think that your observation and your request is probably consistent with the friendly amendment that we've already accepted about signage. Barbara adler is barbara mute I yeah. So can you hear me yeah? Okay, I completely agree with this resolution and I think it's a no-brainer. I can't imagine that anybody would be opposed, but certainly nobody who has spoken here tonight has been opposed to it. The only question is enforcement and how to get this enforced, but this affects our health, which makes it extremely important to us, and it seems to me that this is this is a time when gail. Forgive me, you do use the NYPD to to do some enforcement here. I think it's very important and also doug people who are smoking. Marijuana are also doing it without a mask, and so that also affects our health. I did want to say that I'm not home now, I'm somewhere else and it's a small town and there's a main street. That's lined with benches and on every single bench. It says this bench is reserved for people who are wearing masks. You must wear a mask to sit on this bench, so I thought that was something that we might consider doing as well. That's all! Okay. Do we have other members of the committee of the committee or board members? Other panelists, I guess is the expression, elizabeth yourself or mark or we haven't. I think the issue about the marijuana is an important one and I'll admit these comments tonight were have been very thought, provoking about how we address it. I think it's a bigger issue, given I think, as of June, the governor had not yet made it recreational use legal. So I don't know if that impacts people's decisions on this resolution per se, but I do think it's something we need to figure out tonight. If we want to include or not include, okay are there other I want to get again. I want to say another couple words on that, but first janice do you want to say something more janice? Do we need to unmute janice again yeah, I'm so primarily focused on tobacco, but I do want to just interject this tobacco is also legal and the question in my opinion, about whether marijuana is harmful to your health and forgive me, but it's really, there aren't studies. Yet it's going to take a long time to know, but I just thought I would say that you know tobacco's legal, so once marijuana becomes legal, it's just on the same plane and again. For me the issue is masks. I just wanted to raise this that there is a council member, and I want to confuse matters in Queens named peter coo k-o-o, who has some has proposed some legislation to ban smoking everywhere outside it's very extreme, but I just thought kind of people should know about that. That's been out there, I think for about a year. Janice, that's a good point, and you know one thing I just included as a sort of a preamble to the resolution is that new york is really rethinking a lot. I mean partly spurred by the coronavirus, but partly this was going on before how our public space is used and it's side, it's sidewalks and street beds and parking lanes and parking, lots and plazas and all of those areas of public space- and you know we're not tonight going to be addressing the much broader issue of smoking in all of our public space. We're focused here on our parks, because that's what this committee does yeah and clario. We just not part of that, but I will for just one second, is that it also would be part something that we would need to bring before the hhs committee as well. We were going to do that who, by the way we invited to join us tonight, we're not joined, but shelley has we sent shelly and catherine an invitation to share with their members and we've got shelley tonight, which is a great thing. If does anybody else want us, because I want to get back shortly to the marijuana and then we'll figure out how to how to vote? Because we've had a very focused discussion, which is great on the marijuana thing. I think that I think it belongs in a resolution and I'll tell you briefly why this isn't about whether marijuana may have beneficial medical effects. It's not about whether you can eat for that matter, eat marijuana, brownies in the in parks or otherwise it's not about whether you can use marijuana in any form anywhere in homes or on other public areas that are not part of our parks. It's only about smoking. Marijuana in our parks and marijuana smoke is as offensive to many certainly to me, but I know to many other people. It makes it's as immediately offensive to get that smell and be close to it, as is tobacco smoke. So I think it's a misunderstanding to think that this resolution is in any way it's intended to suggest that it not be fully available if it otherwise is for medical use for having in brownies for having on fifth avenue, but not on this one side of the street, but not on not in central park, not in riverside park, not in our other parks. That's all it's about with the marijuana. It's not in any way addressed to any other. Finding any other suggestion. Any other limit with regard to marijuana. It's just as written, makes marijuana equal or asks the council to make it equal to tobacco products in terms of protecting our park users, who don't want it in our parks. How we're going to go about this now? Let's have one other chance for either attendees or participate, because we have a very concise meeting tonight, either panelists or attendees, who want to say anything and here's what I elizabeth here's, what I'm going to suggest it looks like doug has a comment and anyone else. If you can get your phone sure, of course, if you could meet yourself if you're, not speaking, that would be great yeah clary. This is doug. So I take it from the comment that you wouldn't accept a friendly amendment to the resolution to remove to strike the language the addition of marijuana and to focus on tobacco is that the case or that is that is not, in my view, a friendly amendment, but I'm gonna. When we finish the discussion, I think matt may have had his hand up I'm going to suggest a way that we can vote that separates that out. So we can do a separate vote on that and then that, I think, will you know, because we've heard some people that don't want it in we've heard some people that do want it. Okay, so matt gambridge did you have your hand up, or did I yeah? I'm just you know, I'm just here to listen. My name is matt ginnard, I'm the district park manager for community board seven. You know I'm just here to listen tonight and report back to our agency. I just wanted to clarify so my understanding of no smoking in parks is any currently as it stands as any substance, whether that's hookah, marijuana or tobacco, or even vaping, there's. No, when it says no smoking, it's no smoking of any substance in a park. So that's. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. I know that the law was amended and maybe gail can help us on this, and the law was certainly amended to include vaping a few years ago. When I picked out you know I'm a lawyer, but that defining this stuff and researching it is not my specialty and when I looked at it today it talked about tobacco. What I picked out and quoted might not be up to date. I thought I had seen something that included any substance a few days ago, but I couldn't find it again. Does anybody have a better handle on that and that may be right, in which case we don't need to talk about marijuana, but gail do you know I think she's music just called smoke free, that's the name of the act yeah, but the definition that I picked out today, but I'm not sure it's up to date and refers to tobacco use, but I'm not sure that's up to date. Matt may be right. I hope he's right. Sorry, claria, I'm gonna, see if erica overton is with us, because there was a state bill that addressed vaping. I don't recall, and maybe there's erica, I hope, you're unmuted erica. I know that assembly member, linda rosenthal led a led on an effort to include vaping in various non-smoking restrictions. Do you know if that applies to new york city parks as well? Or is it only a state thing? I don't know I'd have to find out for you. I could text them right now. Yeah, I'm talking right now. It looks like okay and cindy has her hand up. Maybe she's got an answer: yeah, I'm on the new york city, gov parks.org and it says: do you want to know about electronic cigarettes yeah that is as of April, 29 2014? The city council approved legislation to include electronic cigarettes in the smoke-free air act right. No one is allowed to use an e-cigarette where smoking is prohibited. I had seen that and sort of incorporated that in my thinking that all types of tobacco, including vaping, but it doesn't say, tobacco on this side- it just says smoke, but how is smoking defined, I'm just on the site? It's not the legislation, so I'll. Keep that one, because in the in the legislative statutes in the administrative code that I saw today, if it is up to date defined it is smoking, but is somebody else doing any fast research here yeah? Let me suggest, then, that we do this, that we first vote on the resolution without the paragraph that talks about it's the one of the introductory paragraphs, one two, three, four, five: six, that starts out with the changing landscapes and talks about cannabis. Okay, I'm going to suggest that we first vote on the resolution minus that sixth, whereas equivalent and minus the second paragraph that talks about extending prohibitions to marijuana with the changing landscape of cannabis. That's the one! Well yeah, I mean provisionally don't cross it out yet or whatever mark, or I mean yeah. You can highlight it and also then the second highlight the second. As we say in the legal base, the creedal paragraph looks like we've lost or actually one you've got one of them as I'm seeing it now. One of them you've made bold and the other you've got highlighted at the moment. They're. Both bold, I think, okay, so if this is all right with elizabeth and with mark, what we would be doing is voting on the resolution committee members and then non-committee board members. Without these two paragraphs, if the resolution passes, we would then, if again, if this procedure makes sense to our folks other than me. We would then have a separate vote on adding those two back in if it turns out that we've missed something- and I would take the blame for that and matt is correct- that marijuana is already within the ban. Then we won't have done any harm or, if or if we find that out, I suppose we could later just take them out, but that gives people who have the opposing opinions on the marijuana issue, but otherwise support the resolution, the chance to support the resolution without it and then to see whether we add those two back end. Does that work for elizabeth and mark sure, elizabeth, okay, elizabeth? I just got some kind of message from you: did ken want to say something again or no. Anybody here phrase raise your hand. Last week, yeah, okay, cool last chance for attendees or participate or panelists, I think doug, simon. Suddenly I see doug clyman, so I just wanted to say that I supported the resolution and it's an initial incarnation and I I'm very sensitive to and to the benefits of marijuana and legalization of marijuana, but as a practical matter. I do not want to see people smoking at the perimeter of parks, because it's the smoke issue. It's not, and it is offensive to some- and I just you know, I'm very concerned about that. I've seen it. People are taking advantage and there's always the outliers anyway, and if it's particularly allowed, then we have. We have that problem. So you know in terms of cannabis. I don't think that we're restricting people's rights to take their medicine if and they don't need to they can. There are different forms to ingest cannabis and they could actually do ingest cannabis in the park legally if it just not for smoking. So I anyway, it's just at the very least it's a nuisance, but at you know the you know at its extreme, it's more problematic and remember: there's children coming in and out of parks and I'm not saying it's going to harm anyone detrimentally. But if you have a toddler and they're breathing in marijuana, it's that's not what you want so anyway. I've said my piece, but thank you doug. So then you will presumably vote yes on both votes, but we'll see what happens. Sorry, yeah. Sorry, since doug spoke on it, I thought I would I'm just not sure we should be making law based on what some people consider offensive. I happen to find the the smell of marijuana smoke very appealing and that's not because I smoke, I don't, but I just like it, and so I just don't think you know what you know. We should be making law and changing law based on what people's idiosyncrasies are. That doesn't seem like a good basis at all. Well can the mirror smell makes me sick, but that's one-on-one on that one. So if I could just add, I think whoever made the comment that this was about the smoke itself is what we're really voting on tonight and where that comes from whether it's a tobacco cigarette or marijuana, is really what we want to keep out of parks for the quality of life of the majority of residents. I think that's what we're thinking about here. Yep, I agree well said elizabeth: let's are we ready to do our vote mark elizabeth? Do we see any other hand? I think so, yeah, okay? So what we're going to do and mark? How do you? I guess we'll do this as it mark you're going to take a voice, a roll call vote right, sorry, just to clarify. So this is without those two paragraphs. The first vote we're going to take first committee members, then non-committee board members we're going to take it for yes or no on the resolute or I'm saying on the resolution minus those two paragraphs if it passes, then we'll take a second vote on whether to put those two paragraphs back in everybody with us on that. So the way we're going to do this one is please so for first for parks and environment committee members, please voting. Yes, please use the raise hand function if you're able, if you're, not raise your physical hand. So please do that now. Okay, this is parks. This is committee. Members in favor of the resolution currently have to raise their hand physically. So I see two plus four and that's all we see I'm a raised hand. I can't raise it on the got it okay, so I have three plus four is seven in favor, okay, all the committee members in favor. Then we are seven in number yep, okay! Well, let me just go through hands down anybody opposed. I don't see anybody abstaining. I don't see and there's nobody who's ineligible for cause. Now we'll go non-committee board members in favor. That would include me so I'm raising my hand doug. Are you not a board member of a committee member? What's up doug clement yeah? I am a non-committee member of parks, okay and you're. Voting! Yes, okay, so I have one two shelly is three: barbara is four anybody else. Are you voting mark? I already included myself. So it's barbara mark, doug and shelly is four great anybody. Thank you there so hands down anybody opposed. I don't, I think, that's everybody, but anybody opposed I'll go through oh paul fisher. Paul. Can you put your vote in the chat? I know. Sometimes you can't be heard all right. I propose that we give paul fisher a chance to vote paul votes. Yes there it is, and with your permission I will record that vote. So that's what was it one? Two, three, four! That's five right! That's five of five in favor. Nobody opposed nobody abstaining, nobody ineligible, so the resolution carries looks like seven, zero and five zero. Is that correct? That's great now? What we're going to do is take the second vote. However, just before we do that, I see in the comments and the chat, rather that a couple of people have put in a link of various links to I'm not sure what to various legislation. Something does anybody. Has anybody put in a link that answers the question to whether marijuana is now treated like tobacco currently or whatever they've put in the links is not going to answer that karen dimas has put in a link? Can we can we listen to karen again for a moment, just in case she can tell us what she found karen you're unmuted. Okay. I believe that marijuana is not on the list, because marijuana is not legal yet, so I'm pretty sure that that's why it's not there hookahs actually were added, and so my hunch is that if marijuana became legal, it would be added as something that was being smoked. Of course I'm not in people's minds, but but I think it would still take. We have to think conservatively. It would take the city council to do that. So all right, let's stick with the plan. The plan is. We will now take a second vote mark if you'll put up the language again, if you would be so kind. I clearly the comments were split on this among committee members. So the next vote- and our last vote will be whether to put in this resolution in addition to what we've now all passed, putting back in the two paragraphs that are in yellow on your screen, so committee members in favor, of adding those two paragraphs in I'm going to put my hand up so I see clary. Let's see I have clary and natasha and cindy is elizabeth she's up yeah. I don't know if this is friendly or too late, but perhaps removing the first of the two paragraphs might make it easier for people to accept it. I think imposing sort of a judgment on the marijuana used to be is a little a little I'll still vote for it, but I think that it sounds a little and like we're not scientists. Elizabeth, I mean I, let's just talk about for just a minute. I don't think it's too late, we're not pressed for time tonight and we're moving along. The reason I put that in is otherwise the clause asking for having it added to the legislation would sort of come from nowhere. I guess it would have the same force and effect. So if I mean, if passed, I mean our resolution would still be asking for the same thing, but I put in the first of those two yellow paragraphs because it kind of gave the background, but I don't I just I'm just wondering if there's a way to say that sort of all of the legally or sort of illegal forms of smoke in our city right now, which include marijuana, we can include that smoke. Anything else be listed rather than do sort of a separate paragraph. I mean it just seems like it's overly focused on cannabis marijuana, which is not. I think something we want this to reflect. We're not here to judge on marijuana use, we're here to judge on the fact that people don't like smoke in the parks and whether it's coming from marijuana or a vape or a cigarette, and you know, is to me irrelevant it's all things that are things that obstruct the quality of life in our neighborhood. And you know again. I think, if there's a way we can not indict one form of smoking over another or one form of sort of ingestion of smoke over another. It just seems we're going elizabeth. I understand your point. All other forms, I think, are already included with this tobacco and the vaping I mean marijuana is the outlier at this point, I'm not sure, there's anything else. I mean, I guess you could smoke twigs or something or well. We don't really say. Do we say it earlier in the resolution? I should look, but like say what do we specifically reference? All the you know the smoke-free air act. I think implicitly includes everything, that's smokable right now. No to the contrary, the definition is tobacco right, but I just I again, I think, there's a maybe a simpler way to well. You know two things one. We already have four votes out of seven for putting the two paragraphs back in so I'm not sure we want to fuss, but I'm willing, that's fine. I just I just think again. I think the optics make it look a little bit like we're and singling out people like this came to us, because we were thinking about people using marijuana. That's not the reason this came to us. It's certainly the reason it came to me, but anyway, mark has a comment and I'm willing to fuss if we think it's worthwhile fussing, although I do think I would have more vote on this at least maybe more mark clary. I would just as I just wanted to say that I agree with elizabeth's suggestion of taking out that first paragraph, the first highlighted paragraph and keeping the second highlighted paragraph in okay, I mean I could consider that a friendly amendment or elizabeth did you want to yeah that friendly? If people, if it doesn't impact you know? Well, I don't think it impacts. What we're asking for. I, like, though, elizabeth your idea of having something that talks about wanting all smoke all smoking in the parks for the for the you know, quality of life, of a park of our park users all smoking. He doesn't have to use the that. I'm not just not sure how we were, how we're going to say that, and maybe the committee would trust us to just come up with some something simple that would say that or we could try to do it right now, but but I'm admittable to taking that out and if we do, I would prefer to adopt some something such as elizabeth has suggested about all types of smoking should not be in the park, should not be done in the parks right, I think that's. I hope everyone would agree with it. Okay, and is everybody okay, with our just refining that language later we'll go on the assumption that this vote will take out this paragraph we'll plan on adding a few words about all forms of smoking should be banned and then we'll keep in the last one so clearly so clary. This is doug, although I appreciate the goal of creating a family, a friendly amendment, to remove that paragraph and then perhaps get a everyone to agree that they agree that there should be no smoking in the park. The comment was made that you can just use an edible. I understand that that's what's communicated and discussed as someone in the community, not as someone who uses but somebody who's in the community of individuals who are dealing with post-traumatic stress the that type of solution is not applicable to all, and there are individuals who, in order to seek their treatment, do prefer a certain method, and for that reason, even with the friendly amendment you'll see on this part, for me I'll be unable to vote and support. We understand that and we're not. You know we're not always unanimous and that's why we have debate, but do understand that if we do adopt this second piece of this, it doesn't address smoking. Any other form of marijuana, use smoking or anything else in your home on the street opposite the park in the middle of the street anywhere other than within our parks, so yeah and the issue with that is most in most homes. You are unable to smoke uh-huh. So I understand, certainly you can't in mine, but that's you know everybody does their own thing. So, let's mark, if you don't mind putting it back on the resolution, so everybody knows what we're voting on and we you've got some hands raised, though what oh yeah we got to do the hands okay. So what we're going to vote on is the resolution minus the first paragraph that talks about marijuana but with the second one and we'll add a little language about wanting all forms of smoking to be prohibited in our parks? We just don't have that phrase yet, but trust us if you will so now. I think you still have hands raised. I don't know, are people raising their hands to vote or are they are they wanting to? I don't know I don't know. If people want to talk, they can't otherwise will vote. What are why are people raising their hands? I don't see any. They all went away. Okay, so janice we're done with public comment and well say one more thing. Just one little thing is: I see on rivers on the park perimeters a lot of montessori school there's a yeshiva on 89th, I'm just throwing that in that in the time of Covid-19. I suspect those perimeters will be used much more as there's a push to use outdoor space as much as you can if kids go back to school, so the marijuana thing may be part of that. Thanks. That's a helpful comment, all right. The vote now on the marijuana part of this that has taken out the first paragraph about marijuana keeping in the final one and putting a little new language about no smoking anything in the parks. Let's now look for I see doug is sort of smiling. I think you managed the meeting very well. You and elizabeth. Both our dogs are smiling. So all those in favor of the marijuana enhanced resolution. Please raise your hand. Now. I see members this is committee. Is that correct committee only first. Thank you very much. So I see clary elizabeth natasha, cindy and susan is. That seems to be five to me. Okay, did I miss anybody? I don't think so. Okay, hands down. Please, let's see those committee members against adding the marijuana provision correct. I've got one two who's, the two: oh I'm sorry right and not yet barbara. That's what I've got as well and then so. Non-Committee board members now's your chance. So I'm sorry lower your hands. Let's see lower okay, so now non-committee board members in favor of the marijuana provisions and amendments that you just heard in favor. I see shelley I see doug is two. Barbara is three. I think. That's all that's all I see there were five before weren't there. You were one of them. I think I am abstaining so that I see three in favor. Oh paul fisher is paul fisher here with paul fisher. That's right! Paul! Can you so the non-committee will be four zero one, zero, okay, great, and I will now put that into the the document. Yep, okay, so elizabeth and I will- or I mean elizabeth- I volunteer to do this tomorrow- to just do the little editing that we need and then get it to penny mark. I have another question for you now I it didn't occur to me until about half an hour ago. The the next full board meeting is in september. It is september 1st yeah, and I think I mean I think janice in particular has made a very good case for why the crowding of our sidewalks during Covid-19 times, which are certainly going to unfortunately likely continue through the fall, are a good reason to add the perimeters, and perhaps the you know the parking lots and the malls as well, because they're in there is it. Is it a possible procedure to have this resolution come before the steering committee which happens to meet tomorrow night, or does that not work within our procedures? If, by your question you mean, can we circulate it as a position of community board seven based on a steering committee vote? The answer is no okay, our bylaws make that abundantly clear and the chair of our biologist task force is with us tonight and if I'm misspeaking, I invite her to correct me, but I'm pretty confident of this one. Well, I thought that was the case that it was a policy in a previous era that if we weren't meeting then steering would be able to vote but no longer and there are boards there are boards on borough board who take that position. The reason, as I understand it and shelley probably knows this better than me- is that as that, once upon a time, the borough president's general counsel said that that's not kosher that that you can't do that, and so our board corrected itself, and I wonder at those other boards who have this other policy, but we're not going to be one of them on my watch. Okay, so I would then just say one more thing on this topic and I think we've done a good and efficient job on it tonight, and that is fortunately, we have julian de la porta who's representing council member rosenthal with us. I don't think that mark levine's, a colleague eric cuello, is that his name ever made it on with us tonight. He was planning to. I never saw his name on the attendees. We've had gail with us, so it's been a discussion that seems to have raised an issue that has not been in the consciousness of our city council until we raised it and I oh there's eric eric, I don't know when you joined us so glad to see you can we unmute eric for a minute. I thought I did, but eric appears to be a yankee stadium. So can we go wait? Let me know now hey how much of our discussion have you heard I've been on since about 6 30.. So well, that's when we started. I think we did everybody. We look for you, sorry, we would have unmuted you and asked and invited you to participate throughout. It's no problem anyway. What I was saying is that I think the most important thing now is that eric and julian who represent, and our staff members of our local council members have heard this discussion. They know that we strongly supported and in fact, unanimously the basic resolution with the majority, also on the marijuana add-on, and so I'm hoping personally, because I don't speak for community board seven, but I'm hoping personally that they will take it back to their bosses and see whether, in light of all of these considerations, including the importance of making the most breathable space around our everywhere in our parks during the Covid-19 time that they'll initiate something without waiting for our full board in september, because this is not something we can put into effect. It is asking the city council to do a law, and I hope that both of our reps, our council, reps, have heard us loud and clear tonight. Anybody want to say anything more on this topic. Okay, elizabeth, do you have anything else to turn to, or I think we're good mark thanks with matt with still with us. I just received something a constituent concern today, I'm wondering if matt has heard about it and what the right way to try to address it would be. The playground on 89th street apparently has folks using it well into the evening. Well past the usual times, and apparently some of it can get rather noisy and raucous. Is that something we bring to your attention or is that an NYPD thing? How do we? How do we try to engender better behavior without overdoing it yeah? I can I'll re-report back to NYPD and pep and our lock-up crew as well, and see what's going on. Thank you. That would be great, and let me be your point of contact on that. If you need any follow-up. Okay mark I'd like to ask a question about that particular complaint. It was I mark forwarded to me and elizabeth late sometime late today in the afternoon. I think it was what was not clear matt. I think that the email said that pep had come twice. I believe to that location question is: did they just warn the people or did they issue any kind of summons, because it sounds like the same people get warned the pep officers leave and then the behavior starts all over again the pep officers come back. They do another warning. If that was the case and then the same behavior starts, is there any actual enforcement going on at this location? I'm not aware of those particular instances when pep was there, so it's something I'll have to have to look into okay. Thanks do we have anything else where we want to just oh, I haven't. I have an update and it's a good one. Yeah corey and I know we have a couple community members who wanted to speak yeah too lisa being one of them. You know I think lisa as long as it's remained a parks and environment for a minute or two. If you want to talk about your work with streetopia, I think that's great unless yeah okay, so I just wanted to make sure that your committee saw our central park advocates report and street films for those who haven't. We are a group that kind of came together actually people that attended cb7 meetings and were interested in the park, we're all heavy park users and some are longtime advocates, like your very own ken and some are brand new activists which has been really fun to hear their enthusiasm. We wrote this report and created a bunch of street films to highlight issues for park users and some solutions and we'd love to hear your feedback. As you read the report, I know clara, you said that you received it from us and I read it: okay, great so at some point, we'd love to hear feedback from you and perhaps get on your agenda to discuss it further sure, thanks lisa, we I think that a lot of us are active in supporting the park in various ways and various modes of transportation. So we really appreciate you presenting this to us tonight. Thanks yeah, it looks like natasha has her hand up. Is that still from the vote or something else? Hi? Yes, chloe? I do have my hand up. You know this goes back to something that you know. We discussed in the last the main agenda item and also something that peter arnstein also talked about the fact that you know the park, it departs all the parks nowadays since the pandemic started, you know they're, obviously being very heavily used. We keep coming back to that the same issue and you know whether it's smoking or you know dog, leash issues or anything else. You know, but one other issue that has that is very obvious, is the issue of trash and cleanup because I guess usage has increased, but the resources available to these parks has either declined, have either declined or maybe they're the same, and I was wondering you know for our friends from the parks department who are here if they know whether any public outreach has been attempted where the parks department or the conservancy or riverside park, they solicit volunteers, specifically from the community, to help clean up the parks, and I know that you know it's the summer. People are looking to spend time outside. Maybe this could be a productive use of the time of people in the community. I know that I would be interested in doing something as long as it's you know well organized, and you know the timing works for people, so my this is just kind of an advice to the representatives from the parks who are on the meeting today that maybe we could come up with some sort of a public outreach plan because the parks are just being used like never before, and that has consequences and vs community members can step up to help natasha. I see all the time I'm in riverside park in the mornings, and I see overflown not just overflowing but overflown. If that's the right word trash baskets with lots of trash on the ground and you hope it's not going to end up all over the place in the river. The only parks department representative we have with us tonight is matt gingrich. So we're going to put him back on to speak to the united states, one quick thing doug. I just wanted to add one quick thing. Chloe. I think a lot of you saw on the news today. There was at least with the mta and in the subways today. There's now what's called a mask force, so people wearing yellow t-shirts and they're volunteers who are going out to give out masks in the same vein as what I think natasha, which I think is like a brilliant idea for volunteers to try to get involved with. You know whether it's volunteers trying to do trash pickup or whether to give out masks in the park. I think that could be something where community boards and our board could play a leadership role in trying to trying to implement with park so matt. Maybe you know if there's anything in the works on the riverside side and certainly on the central park side. We would love it, but before we hear before we put matt mahatsi doug mcgowan, were you wanting to address the same issue and then we'll turn to matt, not the same as you know, okay, then, let's turn to matt to see if he has any wisdom on this for us matt so yeah. I would definitely encourage you guys to reach out to central park, conservancy riverside park and partnerships for parks. They are especially partner. Social parks is kind of our they organize. You know, volunteer efforts in our parks and I think that they would be. You know if you had some resources available, where you could provide some volunteers to do some cleanups riverside park. The concert central park, conservancy and partnerships or parks would definitely be interested in that you know as a whole. The city is down employees because we didn't receive our. We normally get an influx of seasonal employees to help us with the with the high season which we didn't receive this year. So we are, you know we're doing. You know the best that we can with the resources that we have. So if groups want to come out- and you know volunteer some time to do some basic cleanup- you know I think that's that would be something we're pursuing matt, we'll contact both riverside conservancy and central park about this. But you yourself are the manager for the rest of the parks in our district and that's a tall order in many parks. Do you feel that with the resources you have now, but with all these folks now in your parks? But you feel you're able to keep up with the trash. The big bellies helped. I know the big trash cans, but they're only limited in number for the rest of the smaller parks. You know we're able to manage it. We've shifted some resources around you know. Theodore roosevelt park can be a challenge at times, especially when the green you know with the green market, but we're able to manage our resources. Some of our my larger parks and other districts outside of community board. Seven, I'm actually in communication with my friends of groups to try and see what we can do a volunteer so not in seven but in community board. Nine, I'm looking in some of my larger parks. So, okay, that's helpful, so we'll communicate with both the riverside park, conservancy about natasha's thought and also with the central park conservancy. Is that it for the this topic trash, etc? Then, let's turn to doug mcgowan, who has a different point, and I do want to make sure I tell you some good news too doug thanks sorry, this is. Can you hear? Okay thanks clary? This is part based on natasha's comment, but it's not direct more generally, though, the committee during this meeting has talked about the increased use of parks in the current climate during the current crisis. So just it's a general question: it's the wrong place. Then we can discuss it somewhere else because there might be a process already in place, but we've recently passed two resolutions through full board related to parks and enforcement. Many of and many of the committee members have considered those to be pretty urgent enforcement requests for our local community because of the increased use of use of these parks during this time so have do we have we have we or do we have a process to ensure communication of those resolutions to the appropriate parties? Okay, we do and mark. I want to say just what we have done, what you have done really, but for the board so very to cut right to the chase. There are some resolutions from some committees that are handled by the district office as a matter of course, when bci approves a sidewalk cafe, they don't need me to get it to DCA, but with resolutions like this one they were, they are sort of suey, generous sort of suey generous anyway. They are they're, unique right. Exactly. Thank you. So in each of the cases of the two resolutions that you are referring to the bike enforcement and the I wrote, I wrote a direct letter to the appropriate folks. So in these cases the appropriate folks were the commanding officer of the central park precinct and the borough commissioner for Manhattan for the parks department copying a few of their copying, the conservancy and some of the the other leaders in those divisions and then copying also our elected affair, our city elected officials and our state elected officials. I chose not to include the federal on this one. The only person who has responded is to the first one was the commanding officer of the central park precinct and I am an ongoing who wants to come to a meeting, but he wants to come to a live meeting which I so we're working through. The issues of whether police, infrastructure and equipment can be used on zoom or, if not, how else to do it and there seems to be a lot of different seem to be as many people with different points of view on that, as there are anything else you'd find in the upper west side. So the shortest answer is they have been communicated. There has been a little bit of response and I look forward to having some kind of better dialogue about that when that is when we're able to do that and then doug just to follow that for a moment. With regard to tonight's, it's a proposed resolution sure no, it's not going to go anywhere on cb7 letterhead until we have the full board meeting in september, and I certainly hope it will be adopted because I voted for it but, as I said, the most important people to listen to our discussion tonight rather than us hearing each other, were the council members reps? So they know about these issues. They know what the rationale is and maybe they'll be able to if they choose to move ahead even waiting without waiting for september. I have anybody, oh barbara, and then I've got I've watched. I don't want to say my good news but barbara. What do you got? You called on me, yeah, sorry, okay, I wondered if it would be possible to see the letter that got sent out. Could we get a copy of it? Okay, that'd be great. Thank you, okay, which one on the on the dogs are on the traffic enforcement. Oh I'd love to see both of them yeah. Okay, thank you. Okay, good news, guys are pretty good news. I had a call from steve, simon who's, the chief of staff from Manhattan parks department, just this evening to say that he couldn't get to our meeting tonight, because we had invited them and he said that matt ganrich is going to be here for the parks department, and I said we know that and matt's always welcome, but with regard to and all of our committee members and our board members know about the skate park at 100, a street. I think it is it's been under construction. It's a huge project. It was nearly done when the coronavirus hit anyway. Part of it is nearly done. The rest of it is not quite so nearly done. What steve said to me tonight is what they're likely to do is very soon. After doing the finishing touches on not the big bowl, which is not ready, but the kind of rest of it or most of the rest of it they're likely to have sort of a soft opening to the public. For that part of the skate park, they're not going to have a formal ceremony. We may remember talking at our meetings about a ceremony, but you know nobody can have a formal ceremony these days. The second part of it would be the bowl and some other surrounding features. That's not ready yet so that would be done in the second phase. But what steve and I talked about is- and I'm doug, I'm sure you've observed this cindy and the rest of us who spend time nearly every day in riverside park since the dog runs reopened since the basketball, shooting courts reopened and other facilities in riverside park, we see tons of people in them. I mean, unfortunately, in the basketball. Of course, these kids, I see playing they're, not wearing masks mostly, but all of these facilities that are reopened are very popular. We have a tremendous demand for further available real estate and amenities open in our in our parks. What steve said to me and I've seen this too you've got kids down there at 100, a street that are crawling over and through the fences and getting onto the site of the skatepark already. So it's really, I think, very good news that they're going to open the part that can be opened quite soon they're going to let us know, but you know better that I think than and they think most importantly, the parts department things than waiting for the whole thing to be done. Do we have anything else? Mark anybody anything else, because we're not going to meet in august hope. Everyone has a great summer. If we don't see you before september. Well, we'll see you all in riverside park, we'll see you again central park right, we'll see you all in matt's parks. Thank you, clark, clary! I did have one last question. Maybe matt can answer. This are the teddy roosevelt park, green areas, open or not, they're currently actually not open at this time, but I do actually I have. The construction on the dog run should be getting completed fairly soon as well. Okay, so so we'll be we'll be looking forward to that being done. Matt was that construction halted for some period of months. It was. It was yeah they. So I think about three months four months, however long they halted. Construction for Covid-19 it got halted as well, so that is even though dog runs in general are reopened. That one is not open now, because it's still under construction is that the deal correct. Well, then, it'll be great when that gets right and the riverside dog runs are all open at this point right, yep, always foreign yeah. I just want to say that, even though the the green area in like across from the dog run in river in teddy roosevelt park is not open, it's very heavily used. You know, I see people in there all the time. Yeah, I'm aware of the the issue it's signed and it's something. I've been communicating with my our borough office right and I think we had one other question that came in about actually two one was about the opening date for riverside park, south the phase five and then about construction. Let's see on pools which paul fisher was asking if a pool isn't opening, but maybe the riverside park south question first, I know something about that. One I've spoken to margaret bracken relatively recently, so with riverside park. South we've really got three areas of construction that we're talking about. One is not yet started, but we'll start soon, which is adding some changes and entities that the original first part of the part to be built. That is between about 68th and 72nd that hasn't started yet, but it's going to be done in a way it is now contracted out, it'll be starting fairly soon and we hope and believe it'll be done in ways that won't close that whole part of the park. The two phases that are brand new are phase 5, which runs from what is it about 64th or 5th to 68th, or so that was nearly that's. It's a very long, complicated story. It's been years, it's being done by the parks department and never mind the whole story. In any event, it was nearly done. Finally, after many years of delays- and it was very close to finishing when the Covid-19 hit and all construction stopped- we've been told by margaret bracken that they are have resumed construction and without putting a date on it, they do expect to open up that phase 5 quite soon whatever that may mean well. The really good thing about that is that it includes a ramp, a separate ramp devoted for to bicycles that can access the park off of a riverside boulevard at 66th street. I think it is and then take a dedicated ramp down to the greenway. That's just a hugely important feature there. It's got another playground, a small. I think it's a teeny kid playground, or maybe a medium-sized kid playground. It's got lawns, it's got some other features. What is not was never bid and may never happen and is really bad about. That is the plans always called for a comfort station up at the boulevard at 66th street and a concession: that's what they call the architecture. It's designed by different people. It's separately bid out. They never bid it out. They thought the cost is too high. It's not clear whether it will ever happen. So that's the bad part, but the good part is the landscape features, including the big bike. Rampy thing are very close to opening the other part of riverside south is nowhere near close to opening and that's phase six, which is southward from about 65th street 64th street. Maybe it is down to 59th street. That is the last piece of unbuilt a park it is being built or will be built by the developer. It's part of a very long story that dates back to the early 90s, very sad, difficult, frustrating story for us and others as well. Last. I knew that even involving our the person who's. Currently, president, that's right! That's right! That's right! The last I knew phase six had not yet been contracted by the developer. They are projecting a couple of years of construction, very frustrating, but phase five will be a tremendous amenity when that opens any mark. Do you have anything to add on that? Okay, so I was just gonna. I was just gonna address, paul's question really briefly and it I think it's about the last rapool. I think that's what he's referring to so yes, so I don't again, I think the question is about whether construction is going to start early at the pool it doesn't. I don't think the pool is opening this summer right. So the answer is that the the I'm sorry go ahead. Elizabeth, no, you know the. I don't know the answer. So the answer is that is that an organization that is affiliated with a former developer on that previous site- you were talking about nameless here- still has a concession for that facility and that concession doesn't run out until sometime next year and so trying to closing the pool, because the governor won't allow us to assemble is one thing, but it would take. It would be a breach of contract to pull the plug on the on the concession prematurely. So I'm so there are two different things, so, unfortunately that means that can't be moved up. Matt is there. Is there I'm pretty sure I'm right about that, but is there anything that you've heard that, whether there's even an effort to try that yeah- I don't have? I don't have any information on on it, so, okay, one other piece, then on construction nobody's mentioned this, but I'm glad we were talking about these things. You, your folks on the committee and other board members, will remember. We spent a great deal of our lives talking about the project, to reconstruct the rotunda at 79th street and the bike paths and the landmark aspects and the whole thing and a huge project. We spent a great deal of time on it. We made our opinions known to the department of transportation's bridges division as who is dealing with that they had always said they were going to start construction in 2020. We then never heard from them again about anything and then and then Covid-19 hit the best scuttlebutt we've got from that and mark. I spoke to penny about that just a couple days ago, very vague, but it was that they are not likely to start till sometime in 2021.. I asked penny if she knew whether they ever had gotten to the point of having a contract, because this is like a you know: 150 million dollar contract or something like that. She didn't know she was gonna, try to find out the the fallout from that, though- and this is another matter- that's close to our hearts, although one on which we do not always agree is that the rose, what we call the rosenthal bypass had been put into effect in, let's call it memorial day of 2019.. So when we approved the plans, we didn't have any choice about it's being constructed in general, because it came out of a participatory budgeting item for helen rosenthal that passed, so that is the mandatory inland bypass or detour that cyclists have to take from 72nd street to 83rd street people have had many opinions about it of pro and con, but in any event, what we did when we approved the design for it, which did not involve a lot of construction. It was more signage and limited, paving and things like that. We put in a two-year look back or a two-year, and this is largely you know. Ken was very active on this issue, and that was a good thing. So we were going to give it a look at after two years, and what margaret said to me recently is: it looks as if, because the bypass would be closed for the rotunda construction, so we were never going to have that two years, but now it looks as if we will have the two years to have a look back, because, although margaret's bracket is not doing the rotunda work, she's, certainly coordinating with that. The best sense I got of putting all of this together is the rotunda work is not likely to start and therefore close off the bypass until the two-year point. We don't know that for sure they may be able to start the rotunda sooner, but all these things sort of are, you know, part of the same octopus and we'll find out more when we find out more anything else sounds like that's a wrap, I think we're great, very great everyone and gail if she's still with us all of you and yeah. Sorry, just to be sure. For I mean this is a quick last question: administrative wise for our september meeting. Are there any holiday observances mark for that monday for our september, I need to check and make sure what a good question no. I was thinking about that this weekend, myself is shelley still with us. Yum kipper is on a monday, give us a date. It's the 21st, I believe so it will be the third monday. What's the third monday in september, that's our parks meeting right. The third monday would be our parks committee. What date is that? No I'm sorry yom kippur starts on the evening of the 27th, oh okay, so okay, but what about rosh hashanah grocery shot is on friday, night saturday, sunday, so we're okay yeah. So it looks as if all right, I think, that's a very good issue. I think it looks as if we'll be on our regular date in september 6, 30 third month september. 21St right and thank you everybody, oh I should say while we don't meet, we also we're not asleep we're our committee's, never really on vacation. So you know we do stuff. If we need to talk about anything, if anybody wants to talk about anything yeah, I think maybe the only last thing to mention is that we will be meeting jointly with the transportation committee at their september meeting on the issue of revel as it pertains to safety in general, but the parks in particular. So that will be a joint item that is on the transportation committee agenda, which I guess will be september november september, 8th right and so for folks who have interest in that you've probably read a lot of the news. It's we'll have the month of august to have a very structured meeting prepared for you all in september, right yeah, as you probably know, guys, riding rebels. These mopeds in the in our parks is forbidden, but people see them there all the time when we got wind at the transportation committee. Was we going to be having an agenda item about this? We said hey we want in because it's very much a parks issue as well, so yeah, that's september, 8th and then our committee meeting is the 21st have a great summer. Everyone natasha, let's be in touch about the minutes, hi. Thank you. Bye,.
