Okay, there we go yeah mark, hey there hi it's Madge, I'm going to have to tune in and out. I can't I have something going on, so I'm going to be present as much as I can be. Okay, that's that's great and I'll. Let Michelle and Kay know okay, but if you're here at least a little on screen, then perhaps you can counter the quorum. That would be great. Okay. Can I go to get rid of the picture yeah by all means leave the picture off. If that would work better for you? Yes, it does. Okay, you you, okay, hey Mark! I was slightly confused. How many do we have tonight? Well, the only ones I've heard that are that had an issue where Jay, who may be able to just zoom in for a minute and madge, just told me that she's going to be toggling between two things, but she's technically here for foreign purposes, so a night. Now, that's all I've heard about it. Maybe the others have issues. I do not know okay and we're seeing 40 west 84th. The agenda is yeah. I did not see once one west 67th, that's the building, yeah 320, Amsterdam storefront and then 40 West 84th. Sorry, I'm here now, thanks, sorry, guys no worries. I was on the phone with at t all day, I'm sorry lucky! I never did this before and I'm trying to install a TV 800 miles away and service. Okay. After last night's debate, I would not mind a TV that was 800 miles away easier to take yeah. So if you do not mind, I'm going to take a back seat to this, you take over okay, I saw all three of the sites. Of course you can't see anything on the roof at Cafe, Des ortiz. You can't see anything on the roof on 84Th Street and I will speak up a little bit about the the what it is an enclosed cafe that they want to redo 320 at 320 Columbus, and I spend a lot of time there and I was, I saw all three sites and I've been the site at 320 Columbus. If I may mark I'm sorry did I interrupt you guys, I'm sorry! No- and we were just talking about that down there they're going to continue with an enclosed sidewalk, cafe yeah it's an enclosed cafe. It has not been opened for. I saw adler yesterday, she's been about two and a half years and yeah the place is a wreck inside mark talked to me about maybe incorporating the request for the outdoor, the enclosed cafe and the LPC request. But the fact is, the place is nowhere near what place is this? I got that it used to be saffron, it used to be Saffron, 75th street and, as Josh probably remembers, they came to us a couple of maybe even six months ago and said: could we would you agree to the outdoor cafe, renewal or in this case, would be a new one, but then nothing happened with the space it's been empty and just now just recently, they've been working on it and they have a certificate of no objection which I sent to you mark. That said, they could do the. I guess the inside work, but it's a mess inside I mean it's nowhere near ready, maybe yeah. You said you said that to me, but unfortunately I was not able to actually read it because it was a photograph yeah. No, that's fine, but but the cne did not have anything to do with the outdoor cafe, as I understand it, no, it does not, but typically, if you want to re, if you, if you want an outdoor, cafe, you've already rented it to a party- and there was no way to coordinate that- that's all I meant to say: why are they coming the webinar, I'm going to start letting people in okay? Why are they coming to us yeah? Well, I guess we'll find out. They want to completely read this in a landmark district, okay and they want to change the I'm going to go, get a cup of coffee, good idea. Why not right yeah, maybe a gin and tonic. I can't drink gin: okay, hey Susan, hi, Susan, hey Josh, hey, so the attendees are filing in. We are recording and we are live streaming and I have the slides ready whenever you want them. We, let's see one two, three, four five: you have a quorum, okay, great and we'll need somebody to take some notes or, and is that the order, the order you gave them just a second ago? Is that the order on the agenda, which I did not see, one I'm reading from the website? But, okay, generally speaking, the order is from south to north yeah. So if you want to change that talk to Jesse and penny, no, I love order yeah sort of how would we want to change that? We would not all right. Oh and here's Peter great, oh wonderful, hi Peter! So is anybody feeling able to do some some minutes I'll? Do it if nobody wants to do it and because I really need the help and help writing resolutions also so and then, when we can all meet one day in person we'll go over this, even though Sue Schwartz does the best minutes ever she says: I'm not here, I'm not here. Hi, Doug, hello, all right, good, okay, hi welcome everybody we're going to get started. We have three buildings to look at okay, so who, let's see among our attendees, who is on one West 67th street? Could you raise your hand either digitally or well? Actually has to be digitally. Looks like Martin Finio is. Is that the only person now that he's joining us? Oh there's, Doug, Mcgowan, Excellent, Hey, Doug, good timing, you just missed the. Can you do the minutes? Please are you looking at Martin Finio is nate rubin part of your team. He is yes all right, so I'm going to promote him to panelists right now, too I'll keep the other attendees where they are for now, we'll call on them when their number is up, as it were great all right I'll just say: welcome to everybody, we're the Preservation committee of Community Board. Seven, our role is to determine the appropriateness of whatever changes are anticipated, either to the historic district or to the individual landmark. Our role is advisory to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. As you know, we we do our darndest to represent the interests of our community in this whole process, and I think it's an important part of the process, and so thank you for being here and we're eager to hear what you've, what you've got to tell us about. Likewise, sorry, okay and we're you can see who we are we're the members but we'll do a quick introduction, I'm Kay Carpen and I'm the co- chair of preservation along with Michelle, who is muted, Michelle Parker. Thank you, Susan Schwartz, Joshua Cohen, oh Peter, Doug, Sampson, Right and Mark, I'm Mark dealer, I'm the chair of the board, who is not a member of any committee. It's up, steering and with me is our Vice Chair Doug Clyman. So once again we have the Brady Bunch with the two dogs two next to each other. I wonder if I wonder if zoom knows that you know the old joke is that if both of us leave all of you become Douglas? Oh thank you so much for that. So someone tried that with ruthless the other day and it was not funny yeah now under the circumstances. Okay, so Martin and nate please talk to us. Shall I pull up your slides yeah? I have them here if you want to give me sharing capabilities, or is it better for you to do it in a small group like this, I will allow it. It is so, let's see who can share when somebody else is sharing only the hosts. It seems like I have the capability. I could not show you I should now have. I just gave you a capability when it's a larger group. This is how you avoid getting zoom bombed, so it's yours to do hold on. Let me see it's asking me for my own preferences, so I do not know why that's happening hold on one Sec. Both the reuben and finio are, from the first step for the first application right from one West 67 yeah, I'm just the I'm. The owner's Rep, I'm just here for moral support, so Martin Martin's going to be doing the presenting I'm just here to eavesdrop and show face and say hello, great, okay, thank you! Okay! So can you see my screen now good? Okay? So thank you again. Everyone for your introduction and for giving us the time to present this. As you said, this is this is work that we're proposing that will be heard at the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and it is work that we are doing on a penthouse apartment. It's a it's! A combined two units 901 and 905 at the hotel, Des Artis at 1, West, 67Th street I'll, say right off the bat. None of the work that we're doing is on the contributing facade of the building, it's all on the rear, facade and and the East Facade. So there's four basic things that I want to talk about with the project and so there's a lot of information, but I'll try to go through it. I think I can go through it pretty quickly. First is a modification to the rear. Parapet second is a modification to an existing skylight. Third is the replacement more or less in kind of a solarium? You know a sunroom and there is a window replacement involved. Okay, so yeah just say that again, a modification to the rear parapet, modification to the existing skylight highlight replace solarium replacement right, okay and window replacement correct. So just to give you some general information about the building and if I'm giving you stuff that you know you know inside and out just tell me to move on, and I will but Martin, I'm just going to interject for one quick, second sure for chairs privilege, which is that I believe our board heard applications with respect to the western penthouse apartment some time ago, maybe two or three years ago, and I remembered in part because we joked and said that it would be great if the improvements that you were planning for the West side could be put on to the east side as well, and at that time, that the units were not joined. As I recall is. Does your presentation include that history, and just so we know where we are well. I do not know that. I was involved with that several years ago with you, unless it came somehow through landmarks to you. But what I can tell you is that the parapet, modifications that we are proposing for the West are going to are also. We are also proposing for the east. Okay, all right, I'm sorry I'll shut up. Please go ahead! No, please! But so anyway, hotel des artists built in 1915 to 1918 a kind of neo- gothic building with some tudor flourishes to it. It's a nine- story building and the window types that we are dealing with are multi- pane casements that are steel and multi-, pane pivoting windows that are steel. Here you can see its location relative to the island of Manhattan and central park. West, and here you see it in context of the upper West Side Central Park West Historic district, which was designated in 1990.. If we zoom in a little bit further here, you see the configuration of the building on the block within this district, and then here it is within the context of the block. So our penthouse 905, you can see- is the sort of North West Corner of this sort of clover shaped building and the unit does not occupy the roof of the adjacent, proper adjacent apartment to the to the east, but space below that one. So it's very much a kind of puzzle. The apartments in this building so here is a drawing of the kind of rear of our building in context, and here it is zoomed in a little bit more. So this is the unit that we're talking about. So it's kind of hard to tell here, but we are, we do not have this rooftop right here, however, we are modifying the parapet of that rooftop unit. So we have it's a triplex here and it's a duplex on this side and what's the what's the top floor, then on the it's another unit, separate unit, another owner? Yes, so just to give you some photo documentation of the building. Here it is on the left, more or less right after it was constructed and then on. The right is from the 1940 tax map imagery. Here it is in 1989, and here you see, a photograph of the interior. This is actually the apartment of the one- time apartment of the architecture, critic, Paul Goldberger that he sublet in 1978.. It's good to be part of those, the original windows they are and what you'll see is we are. We are replacing our windows with origin with historically accurate windows, here's a typical floor plan of the building- and here you see it in context from the street in 1929. So again we are. All of our work is on the back of the building on the east side. So we're always looking through a series of buildings at our building. It's a kind of incidental view of the building. Here's a couple other views from 1929 and the East facade. What you'll see that photograph on the right of the East facade? There has been a building built since then much even taller than the Des artists building. So much of what you see right here is occluded. Now here you see it a view of it from the 1940 tax map of 68th, Street, and so here we'll just give we'll give you a couple of photographic views along Central, Park, West and 68Th street. Just to show you again how you know how sort of incidental the back of the building is to the experience of the city relative to these views. So here it is from Central, Park west. The photos on the right will show you the location of the photograph and then the view from that location. Are those water towers part of their part of the building, but they are not we're not touching them. They exist so we'll just sort of highlight and yellow what is the building every time we go through here. So here's a view from further south up down central park. West and again, you see just a kind of sliver of the building from there. Here you see deeper into 68th street, oh yeah, the view there and then, as you move further into 68th street. This is what you see of the building and then further still, you just catch a very small portion of it and drawing documentation. This is the main facade of the building on 67th street, which is just a lovely, very rigorously composed facade as it was as it's meant to be experienced, and this is the kind of identity of the building, whereas the back of the building is slightly different and less composed less strategy behind it. But everything that's in Blue is what we are talking about tonight and in fact, the three large picture windows that you see here are not actually part of the landmarks hearing, because we're able to deal with those at staff level. I just wanted to bring make them part of the conversation here, because they are very special windows in the building and we wanted you to know that we are replacing them with historically accurate windows, so I'll just toggle between these two images. This is the proposed work. I go back then to the existing, so this is basically the nature of what we're talking about tonight. Existing proposed existing proposed quickly where's the solarium. Just it's. Can you see my cursor it's yes, this structure right here got it and you'll see that you see you catch only the very top most bit of its fascia from the street. This elevation gives it a false impression that it's much more visible than it would be, and that solarium sits on top of the owner's apartment. That's correct, so the floor below it is the owner's apartment, that's correct, as is space directly behind it got it and there's an existing solarium there. That is essentially the same footprint just slightly different materials right only just slightly. Actually, it's also going to be glass with a with a you know: a membrane roof on top of it. This is the profile of the building of the east side of the building, and here are the four windows in question. So again, this is where it gets interesting, so this solarium belongs to somebody else. So this whole sort of zone right here is a different unit, but we sneak in underneath it and sort of above here honestly, the interior of the building is amazing. The way it's a kind of a jenga puzzle and how about two floors is that it ours is a triplex on the West side. So it's a floor, a mezzanine and a floor and then on the east side. Here it is a duplex, it's a floor and a mezzanine. So that's what you're, seeing here you're seeing the what is the ninth floor in the building here and the ninth floor, mezzanine and just to point out this dashed line is the building that now stands in front of our building to the east, to the East correct. So if you were standing here, you would you would not see any of this. So here is the proposed change on this side, which is basically what I'll talk about in at length. A little later is taking what are the existing windows right now and bringing them back to closer to historical, but not what we understand would be exactly historical and then there's also the change to the modification to the parapet, but I'll go into all of this in more detail. So here's maybe a clearer view of the whole thing from the air. Everything in Blue again is what we're talking about. This is all the existing conditions and here's the proposed change, so you can see the skylight. That's here, we're basically just extending it acrosss this element here, this existing solarium we're just replacing in kind, and then we are modifying this parapet and this parapet did you do the after again, could you do before or after this is after? This is before yeah and I'm not sure how much lag there is so apologies if I'm sort of talking before it's switching you're good. This is after this is before, and I'm happy to do this all night. If I could try a little forever really, I think, as we go through more of it will go earlier. Do you have plans of the apartment? I do not have plans, no question redoing the parapet on the east, so that, what's the purpose of that just to match the two sides: yes we're doing it to create the to maintain symmetry for the building and our owner was good enough to offer to the adjacent apartment to do the work for them happening together. Now that makes sense, and let me let me let me preface all of this by saying that the reason that we're making this modification in the first place is because our client is actually wheelchair bound and that's not a temporary thing, that's a very permanent thing and the parapet that exists and maybe yeah. Let me just go right into it from here sure, and also let me say that in fact about nine years ago, this same request was made to landmarks and was approved, and it's just that the work never happened in the building. I do not know why it did not happen, but it never did and if we had gotten in a little bit earlier under the wire. I think these approvals have a seven year life to them, so we just missed the window as which is why we're coming back. To I mean we were not part of the original proposal, but just to say that basically the very same thing was proposed and approved okay, so I'm much older than I think I am because that's what I'm remembering and it was nine years ago- and I wrote that resolution so again. Well, I love the fact that you think that nine years is three years that I think there's something there's something healthy about that who knows what time is anymore. It runs so here you can see the view from 68th street. Let me sort of orient you here so you're, looking from 68th street up to the parapet, this is the existing condition and this little red DOT. Then we're showing you in detail. How much of that solarium you see in the existing condition and I'll show you again with the modified condition, how you know you're, seeing a bit more of that the face of that solarium. So again I'll toggle back between these two oops? No, I'm not there! You go and there you go. Actually these are not quite in the same. I'm really they're, not quite in the same orientation. To one another, so it's not quite toggling, so one of the things we did we realized in our research too, is that in fact, this parapet originally with the building, was lower than it is right. Now, if you look right here, it's hard to tell in the photograph it's much clearer in person, but this is the kind of remnant of a terracotta cap piece which indicates that the parapet actually was about this level and was carried acrosss sometime in the last. What we can within the last 30 years, there was waterproofing work done to the back of the building, where they then, for whatever reason, built up the parapet to higher than it was originally, and you can see the state of it now. It's that whatever work they did is not holding up so well, because there's spalling happening and the flashing is deteriorating. So in doing this modification, our plan is to also just rectify lots of kind of ill will work here. So this will show up more clearly. Here is the existing parapet, which is at 50 and a half inches is about what is that about 10 inches higher than code requires for this parapet. So what we're proposing to do is lower the masonry portion and build back up to the required height of 42 inches above the terrace with glass, and we want to set that glass on the inside face of that wall so that it has the least the visible effect from the street. So again, I can toggle between these two you've got an over oversized masonry pair, but to begin with we're bringing it down to two feet above the terrace and then building up the rest with glass. So again that goes all the way on the entire setback. I'll show you, it does not quite go all the way to the to the full back of the building. It stops at two chimney, flues, which you can see here on the right here. It stops here. This chimney flew then from that point on the original parapet remains, and so again this is about. You know our owner, which has this terrace, which has a wonderful view of the park. If you can see it, he can not see it if it with the parapet in its existing configuration. So this is the way in which we feel is appropriate both to the building and to the owner of the apartment, but you're, basically looking north right you're looking north, but as you can see here over to the to the right is a is a beast. I'm sorry to the east is a view to the park. Okay, let me just review this you're going to lower the masonry to 24 inches and then have glass from that point up to 42 inches. That's exactly right! Thank you. So here's two images that show the you know the differences on the left is existing and on the right is proposed. Even you know, we tinted the glass here, a little more white than it would be just so you can see it and you can see how you're seeing a little bit more of that solarium than you're, seeing in the left image, and you can just barely see a bit of the solarium. The existing solarium on this side and you'll see a bit more of it on this side right because you're lowering the parapet which would have which would have hidden it. That's exactly right, so here it is closer up just to give you a better sense. This is not a way that you would ever experience it. This is with a zoom lens, but it just gives you a slightly better sense. Here's that existing Para, Existing, Solarium and they're proposed- and you can see that the you know the because the glass is set back from the par from the thickness of the wall. It has also much less of a presence than it would if it sat at the other end good. So now we'll look at the skylight. I think you saw pretty clearly in those other images, but this is the current state of that skylight, and this is the sort of stretch of roof in a sort of compiled Panorama view. Here you can see that when the skylight ends there's a bunch of mechanical equipment on the roof and then a security fence around the edge here, here's a plan that shows, hopefully you can understand what you're looking at here. This is the back half of the building as it exists, and this is the back half of the building as we're proposing again just showing the extension of that skylight, the just the roof of the new solarium and again everything that's shaded here is not in our scope of work, but here, in answer to the question about the extent of the parapet. It's up to these two chimneys here and then here and here are the associated mechanicals, the mechanicals of the apartment, not no, in fact, they're not, and we have arrangements to relocate them with the apartments that they're associated with. Actually, I think I think they you correct me from wrong. Two of them are associated with the building and there's a there's a single s. Well, it's a it's a split there's, a split system. There that's belongs to an apartment which will be relocated along with, but the rest of the mechanics, I believe, is to the existing apartments right and what you can see here is now behind. The skylight will be all the mechanicals that we will need for this apartment and they will not be visible from the street, and I should say the building is very happy with this scope of work, because we again are going to be repairing a number of hills with the roof and leaking issues. So they are. They are certainly on board with the work. Here's a view, I'm sorry, could you explain to me how the mechanicals will look or not look to the to your client? They walk in the apartment. They will not see them either because the skylight faces north and then the back wall of the skylight is solid and everything will be hidden by the that back Wall. Okay, great. Thank you, yep. Here's, the West view that shows again the modifications where on the left is existing on the right is proposed. Here you can see the parapet, modification, the stellarium modification and then the skylight modification, and what you will see is how very little you can see of this from the street. Here's a view left is existing and right is proposed. You can just catch a slight little glimmer of something happening up there and I would be hard- pressed to say that anybody walking down the street has ever looked at that building from this view, but here is a little closer up, but how about the view from the West looking east? This is this is this is the only moment where you can see that- and this is basically from the North West. Looking southeast yeah, that's from 668Th Street right, that's correct- and this is this is the only moment where you can see this from anywhere. So you do not have an actual mock- up of anything on the roof. Presently, right, nope, okay, and what we're looking at, just like I'm clear, is straight up the can you can you show us where we can now see in the proposed the versus what you see here? Okay, I live two doors down two doors to the west on 67th street. In the back on the 11th floor, I can look down and I can't really even see any of that right. It's not visible yeah and it's and none of this again, what we're talking about is visible, certainly from the contributing facade on 67th street. So sorry go ahead. Yeah no go ahead, the mad you're saying at the conditions as they exist. Now you can't see no you! I sometimes lean out my back window to try to see the park and I even have a little you know, can crawl out there and look out a little space and you can't see any of this. Okay. Thank you. Do not lean out too far. Man yeah, exactly here's the existing solarium. Just to give you a sense of what we're replacing and again here's the plan of again we're just replacing it in kind thanks. What does that mean? Replacing kind same just same footprint, same volume, just not we're not affecting the shape or size of the thing. So here's a view from the from the pigeon and then we'll from here. We can talk about window replacement so again these windows- we do not really need to talk about, but I just think because they're such they're such unique windows to this building that we'll just tell you that we are taking the three large special windows that constitute this department, and here you can kind of see the plan now of the build of this apartment, at least diagrammatically how it sort of wraps around a unit here. So this unit then has the space above this unit, but these three windows- these are the existing conditions of those windows, here's what they look like and what you can see of them from the street. Here's what they look like archivally. You can't tell very well from this photograph, but from this one you can see how they are. The bays that we have in our existing windows are actually subdivided again in the original, and so that's what our proposal is here on the left is existing and on. The right is our proposal and on the left here is a drawing of the existing window and on the right is a drawing of the proposed replacement and the third window that you're not changing. That belongs to the other. Another apartment well yeah, and this is the thing we had hoped that the building itself had a kind of master plan for window replacement, and it does not so there's. No, you know the building has no rules by which to follow. How one goes about this. I can say that the windows that we're using here to replace with, have been used to replace other historical, accurate windows in the building, so this is optimum windows, is the manufacturer, so they have a great track record of dealing with historically accurate replacements, but that perform you know at a level that the 21st century demands of them. So now these are the other windows that we want to talk about, which are very small windows that are in a kind of light court, which is, which is a bit of a light. Chord is a is a bit of a misnomer, because this never sees the light of day or never sees direct sunlight. Anyway, it's a north facing light court. There are two windows at one level and a couple more at different levels. I'll show you in a photograph more clearly here are the four windows that we're talking about and we're simply asking to replace them again in kind. This is a view that you can't get from the street. This is a view we got to this terrace from the building itself. It's sort of the rear yard of the building. Just to give you a sense of the nature of this court. These are the four windows on the left as they exist, and we simply want to replace them with new. You know windows that perform better but in the same format and then, similarly on the east side of the building, these windows are visible from certain points on central Park West. There are four windows here that we would like to replace there. They are. This is basically the moment that you can see the four of them together and here this is just showing you from those windows how what the range on Central Park West is that you can actually see them from which is pretty limited, and here they are in archival photos, and so what we're saying is this is our best guess at what the original windows looked like. This is what they look like now and so we're proposing a compromise that sort of brings them back closer to the original, but does not have all the divided light. That just seems unnecessary at this point and same for these larger windows. The on the left is what we imagine is the historically original window. This is, what's there now and we're proposing a sort of hybrid and that's what that would look like on the East elevation. I think that is it yeah. The rest is just appendix information. So, thank you. Thank you. Will this work? Any of this work require scaffolding. Yes, actually, yes, it will because because, in fact, we'll have to lift a lot of materials up from 68th street to get it into the building has very small service elevators. So we are we're looking at the logistics of you know, just how much material we can get in via the building and how much we'll have to lift from the street. Thank you any other questions from the committee. We asked a lot as we were going along. Yeah about this work is not there a the restaurant set up outside now on the street. It is but that's on 67th street, so everything that we're going to be doing will basically have to take place on 68Th street. Okay, everything has to come through 68th street. Well, everything that has to get craned up has to come from 68th street, all the other, we're working through a bunch of logistic challenges. With this building there's a very limited access in getting materials in. We have a size limitation because of the service elevator that takes from the sidewalk down to the seller and then from there you have to push to their freight. So there's a there's, a limited sort of sizing that we have with that and then, as far as bringing heavier equipment, larger equipment up we're working through the list, logistics of that and that will have to strategically be brought up likely using a specialized crane that would that would not be through the front. It would come through the 68 side. When are you calendared at LPC? Yet yes for early November? No, what's that November 6th, 10th, okay, anything else, questions mark! Is there anybody from the community let's find out? There are four names that I see as attendees. Joshua looks like Weisselberg or Weaselberg. Are you here for this matter? You have to unmute yourself, I'm going to keep nope we're here for the next presentation, very good, Matthew lamont. Are you here for this matter and do you want to be heard? I know I work with Josh and we'll be honest: okay, we'll see you next and I'm going to get I'm going to guess that Michael Gasper is the application after this he's actually he's one of us we're hiding him for some reason. I'm sorry just listen again, all right. Okay, so cheers to you cheers. Why do not you have your discussion and I'll? I assume we should leave the drawings up for now. So yeah. I have another question you know for this goes to the committee. We, how is every I understand the reason for the almost two feet of glass at the parapet. Is everybody okay with this that portion? Yes, I would prefer, like I did last time a metal railing as opposed to glass, but I- but I do not think it's inappropriate, so you guys and our previous resolution which they which they showed us, was for glass and was approved. So I think in this case the glass makes some sense. Is there any part of this proposal that was not approved in the previous resolution of nine years ago? Yes, it was the replacement of the solarium, the replacement of the windows and the extension of the skylight are new. Okay, I have a question about the glass. I do not know if a bird could actually get to that part of it, but is it bird friendly or is that going to be a problem because it's right next to Central Park, pretty much it it's very low? I can't imagine that would really be an issue at this point. You know the solarium has been up there this whole time and it is also glass and there has been no history of any bird strikes there. The glass extension of the parapet right, I'm just saying I mean it. I look at it as no different than the windows that are on the that are in that facade as well, and I a bird would not be flying towards the building where there's clearly physical material behind it. So I can't imagine that would be an issue. Can I make this a friendly suggestion that you check with New York, City Autobahn sure absolutely, and I also believe that yeah there is a coding that's being developed. That is, you know that you do not, which I would be happy to apply to this. If that's the case, and if you need, if you need help with context or anything, I'm happy to do it great. Thank you. Peter you had yeah. I have a question about the the medal itself. You did not speak too much, or maybe I missed that is it steel. Is it is it? How does it relate to the existing metal frames of the existing windows? Our window replacements, yeah, our window replacements will be steel windows, which is the same material as the existing windows and they will be painted to match the existing windows. Is it a hulks window? It's a optimum which is a very similar manufacturer. Oh okay and the skylight the skylight will be. First of all, you can't see it from the street, the skylight at any point any part of the glass and it will be. It will probably be an aluminum skylight because, because of the kind of spans that we're talking about regarding the skylight in the existing condition, it appears there's a a metal, a metal fence of some type that moves around the the space there. Is that because there's an entry to it and does that same level of safety applied to the new condition, not sure I understand the question, so the existing skylight does not extend the full way the full length. Oh this, the roof, so that's meant for access from you travel. You traverse from the terrorists up onto the solarium roof. Currently, then, from the solarium roof onto the setback, and that is a then you have the safety rail that goes around the back. So what they're proposing now is the extension. The skylight behind the skylight is where the mechanics will be. There will be a guardrail back there as well same amount of safety. Okay, so there will be a guardrail, though, where the okay, that yeah and it will and it's actually going to be an improvement, because the access to the water towers and everything they'll we're going to we're going to it's going to be a vast improvement and a safer way to traverse that and what is currently in place, great, okay, anything else if I could just offer a thought- and that is to say that I appreciate very much the attention to the window design as presented both the large windows that are not ours to opine on and the secondary facade windows, including in the light. Well, I think that those are I mean that we do sacrifice some muntins that were not that were apparently there in the original, but not there in the replacement. And so I think this is an improvement and I would recommend approval of it on that basis as reasonably appropriate. All right, all right friends, I think we're moving towards something like a vote. Can we consider this as a whole, as and for purposes of voting? Or does anybody want to split out any of the items to consider separately? I guess those people who have who want to split it up can I would take the vote that way if they want, but no need for me, no, I'm, okay with it. Okay, let's bundle it all right, bundle away all right. So, let's let's go through and and get a tally and you'll record. This Michelle, may I say just say something as a non- committee member, yes, that this is just a just sort of more of a global, the I'm glad that Susan brought up the issue of birds, and I appreciate the mindfulness and willingness to do that. It, the issue of the bird birds that maybe I'm not saying that an expert to know how birds see, but the idea is that it's not that birds might be migratory or enroute, it's that they may look to land beyond the glass and then have a collision because they were going to land on the parapet. So I appreciate that you're doing that and that's just a general comment projects as well. Thank you. I think it's worth note, though, that the glass is set back so should a bird want to land on the parapet, they would still have the ability or, if it's going to go beyond it or land yeah all right in either case. All I want to say is that we I share that concern and whatever we can do to alleviate any kind of ill effect on a bird. I would do it that's great, that's great. Can we would be okay with you guys if we incorporate it into the resolution that that you will be checking with New York City Audran about this absolutely great. I have that in my notes. Great. I do not want to bore my colleagues with my recent birding craze. I I'm a cliche in March. I started birding non- stop, but on 71st street outside the Majestic I had the privilege and the terror of picking up a black and white warbler on the sidewalk and carrying it up, Columbus avenue to the wild bird fund in April, and it I mean I do not know what it hit, but this year the bird strikes have really been up dramatically Susan. If we wanted to get that contact from you for the New York City Audubon, I you have a email in through the Community Board website or otherwise I'll put it in chat. Thank you get in touch with me through Michelle or, however, you want to I'd be beyond delighted to do that. Thank you very much chat tonight. If you can yeah put it in chat right now. I appreciate it great okay. I think we're ready to vote on this one. Okay, Susan! Yes, are you in favor? Yes, okay, sorry! What do you? What yeah I'm typing here? I can't do two things at once. Oh sorry, I should have started with Peter yeah. Oh yes, okay, very good, Doug Mcgowan, yes, and I just like to note I'm very appreciative of the detail presented tonight. Thank you yeah. I agree Michelle. Yes, all right! Josh, yes, and I also appreciate the details. It's amazing. I think it really is great and I vote yes match. Yes, especially, yes, very good, all right. So the committee, it's one, two three, four: five: six: seven, zero, okay and then non- committee board, members, okay, so that we have a yes from Mark and Doug. Yes, and a beautiful presentation very nice and great I'd like to say that you have Michael Gasper to thank for that beautiful presentation. He deserves all that credit. All right, great awesome! One last question: I'm just curious: how long you think it will take to do this much yeah! Well we're planning on a yeah. I think it would take a year and a half and we're hoping to start in the new year. I can. I can appreciate the what you're describing as a rabbit warren. I think. Maybe that was the term used or we have. We have my husband. I have friends who live lower down in the building. They have, I think three apartments put together and it's just mind- boggling what goes on inside. Yes, so much has been cobbled together over the course of this building. It's amazing! It's a beautiful building! Good luck! Okay! I'm going to move us along here. Yes, please! Okay! Thank you! All very much! Okay hold on guys! Thank you. Thank you. We'll see you at LPC, all right. Moving on the next up looks like 3,320 yep who's, the who's, the presenter. For that one, please, is that Josh Wieselberg Weisselberg! Yes, I'm just going to promote everybody who's here into panelists, and then they can fight it out right here. Okay, West 84th street that we're looking for no we're looking forward to 320 Columbus avenue. Is that Matthew? No I'm with Josh so is I do not see any other attendees. Is there anybody here for 320 Columbus avenue, I'm sorry to jump in for the chairs? That's so I like it. Why do not you guys, if I may suggest to the chairs? Why do not you go forward with the guys who are here and I'll see if I can find a phone number for the people who are not? Okay? Oh no, fair dog, Doug, Mcgowan hi, it's every night at the same time! Mark! Oh, my goodness. I remember the kids go to bed. I remember those days with great fondness: hi sweeties! Let me start by saying all right: let's go you guys go ahead, I'll, try I'll see if I can find the other guys: okay, 40, West, 84th Doug! You know it's nice to see those daughters beautiful. Do you remember this person? Yes Josh, all right! So do we need a screen share or what do? How do we proceed with it yeah? So we can. We can show this. Well, I'm sorry you're right! I'm going to have to. Let's see, I'm sorry, let me go back so Josh and Matthew. Are you able to share your screens? Yes, okay, why do not you go ahead and do that and that'll? Allow me to look for the other guys: okay, probably another 15, minutes, okay, so the presenter is Mr Wieselberg. Why? You can call me Josh? Okay, thanks! Shall we shall we begin? Yes, please. This is a alteration to an existing penthouse at 40, West 84Th street. The general scope of work is to add a roof deck to the roof of the penthouse structure, and the visible portion of this is going to be the new railing. On top of that, let's take you through. This is the building on 84th street. You can not. The penthouse from 84th street is set back quite a bit from the front facade and that's not going to change that footprint. Won't. No. The footprint will not change. Okay. This is another view from any four street. Again, there's no visibility and again, there's no visibility from really anywhere on 84th between this is from 83Rd street zero visibility. This is our existing plan, very small penthouse. It's about excuse me, are we talking about the park block? Yes, thank you. It's about 500 square feet. The one bedroom apartment with about 1200 square feet of deck outside of the on the roof deck you can see. This is the 84th street, oh okay! So that's looking north yeah! This is 84th street. Here, okay, the proposed plan is the same photogram, but we're adding a stair which is not visible outdoors there up to the roof deck up to a new roof deck on top of the penthouse roof and that railing, let's see we'll take it through the existing penthouse existing railing and the it does with the roof deck and railing on top and replacing a portion of the metal railing at the lower roof. We do have a mock- up, which I will show you, let's get to the mock- up. So this is looking from the corner of Columbus and zoom, and can we zoom in here? Maybe you can see that black box is the existing penthouse and the Orange Fence is showing us right now that that's built at a little over four foot six, so that covers both the thickness of the roof deck plus a 42 inch rail. Ah, it's current. It's currently four foot. Six! The mock- up that orange fence market is built yeah, so it's a little it's a little higher than a railing because it also encompasses the thickness of the of the roof deck. That's being added you're, building a roof deck over the existing roof, then you're, putting a railing up exactly and the current railing that we see is the railing that will be replaced exactly. Let me zoom in there. So it's it's about 18, inches of metal, rail over the parapet and we'll be just replacing that length of railing with glass. It's about 18, inches high above the power panel alrighty. You know, additionally, in the scope, is general alterations to the penthouse, of course, and new windows, but none of that is actually visible. This is the existing penthouse. It's you know an old metal, clad box. When was that built? You know we do not know. I think it was late. 80S is my sense. There's an alteration to it in 2005. That shows it as existing. It kind of has the look that it used to be. Like a you know, some kind of mechanical or service space that was then converted into an apartment. I see so it was originally intended to be like a mechanical shed or a cover, not a shed, that's sort of our guess, because it's really so small and disconnected from every other apartment in the in the building. Yes, and but now it's going to be an apartment, it is currently an apartment, yeah, leaving a large department. Well, the apartment will be the same size, but the roof deck will get access to the roof, got it okay. I see the upper room yeah, but you can see the kitchen exhausted. It's a very significant kitchen exhausted, but it's a very kind of humble size, little penthouse and that's the middle railing that we're proposing to replace on the westerly side. The masonry all is to remain. That's it it's a very sort of small, but the deck is so low that again the deck is already so large. Yes, it is, I think you know looking at this apartment generally. I think that the interest the owner's interest was for the outdoor space, not so much for the department that the apartment's actually extremely small, like so the whole apartment, the whole apartment. Is that penthouse? Yes, oh okay, no wonder they want some outdoor space Josh. Can you say again, the masonry will stay and you'll just replace the metal rail. Is that right? That's exactly right with some similar attachment kind of arrangement, or are you going to get to that yeah? Well, there will be a like that standard, a boot attached to the masonry, and then the glass will stick up in the same location, really on the okay. What color will the metal railing be the new one? It's going to be a glass railing with a black metal cap on top okay, and can we ask about the birds? We noted your birds. I looked up. You know the audubon website during the last presentation and we will we'll find out if there's anything. I know I've seen those birds stickers on windows. I do not know if those really help or not, but just a little bit a little bit of clarification. What happens is the birds when they see their reflection in the glass? They do not realize what they're looking at. They think it's. They think it's another bird, that's the problem. I can tell you that these homeowners do have a cat. I do not know if that'll help you're not helping the case you're Josh. Do you have details of the railing? I do not. Let's see if we have one here. Basically, we were not going to do that scope until we decided that we were going to go to a hearing, so we just added at the last second, you know the landmarks position on the hearing versus staff level. Approval was if we set the railing back on the upper roof. The visibility would be so low that it could be approved at the staff level and we took that back to the homeowners, but they felt that the space was already so small. They would like to ask for the for the full width and they said if we're going to go through the truffle. Let's try to replace the other railing as well so you're here but yeah. So here we are so can I ask a question, since I missed a little bit of this, because I was phoning around? Is it the case that this is visible, but only from a secondary facade, that's right and over other facades right, so here's our entire okay? I got it. I remember now. I remember seeing it before thanks. Okay, all right other questions. Anybody could we see that. Could we see the addition to the structure again, so this is looking from 84th street. Obviously you can't see it from 84th, but this is looking straight. I looked. I could not see anything yeah me too, and this is you know, looking from Columbus, which you know it's an elevation, but basically we're sort of thickening the roof to to give it enough structure to carry a roof deck and then slightly set back on that roof will be 42 inch guardrail and then, where does the stairway go, which which side? That's on the on the east side of the front House? Oh there that has really whoops sorry that has really zero visibility from yeah from it. There's actually quite a high wall between the next building and like a barbed wire razor wire fence, so we're actually going to remove that, but it's also not visible from anywhere else. So is that the fire department Stairway? No, but no there's one. It's not required, because the setback is here, they can use a ladder, but it will function as possible. Okay, what's the purpose of the metal on top of a glass rail? Is that really needed? Yes, it's been our understanding in glass rails and our guard rails is you do need a cat piece that in case one pane of glass shatters, there's something that connects it to the on either side? So I know I've seen around the city examples where they do not include that top rail, but I do think it is a requirement unless yeah, I believe it's a requirement. I do not believe it's a requirement. I mean there are many railings that are just tempered glass or without a cap. I have seen the same railings I have when I read the code. I see the code is saying that if one panel fails something needs to stay there to support it, you know, I think that we would be certainly willing to not have the cap rail. I do think that maybe, if the railing is tempered and laminated so the lamination would keep the pane of glass in place if it shattered that you might be able to keep it, but I think the expense of that is, you know not just twice as expensive, so you're inclined to keep the metal cap on the glass for safety. I would suggest that, as you say, laminated and tempered yeah, I would, I would still personally feel more. Firstly, unprofessionally, I suppose, feel more comfortable with the top rail keeping those things together but visually. I agree it would be nice to not have that at any on any glass rail. It might be helpful for our bird friends too to have that evil on top and we find that black is sort of the most subtle thing to have up there. Rather it could be, you know it could be aluminum or stainless. Those are all reflective, so the black just looks like a matte grip that kind of vanishes, but there's a finish that you would prefer to see. I think we'd be open to that as well. Okay, so this is a roof, an addition to the rooftop and the addition will also be another rooftop yeah. There are two levels right, so you have this rooftop edition. That's currently there that has 1200 square feet of deck around it am I right the current and then you're going to build on top of this rooftop and people will be able to go on the top of the new rooftop right. The existing rooftop yeah levels got it: okay, yeah right so there's a deck outside of the apartment and then now there'll be a stairway up to a deck. On top of the apartment right great. That will add how many square feet to how much what would be the square footage of that second deck. I believe it's about 500 square feet. Is that how big it is? Do I have a dimension here? Oh yeah, that's you said this: the apartment's 500 square feet yeah it's 20 by yeah. I do not know if it's even quite 500, but all right, just less than 500 square feet. Yeah, it's just it's it's hard to engage it because it is such a tiny little apartment. You know the. If you look at it. You know this area down. Here is all common space in the building. So this is all just the elevator hallway you have do you have any details of the stair that goes to the upper deck. We do not have it here because it was not visible, so the landmark did not want to know about it, but I can explain it it's. Basically, you know steel, stringers and and stone treads on a steel support. It's I do not think we have any images of it here, because it's hidden between the addition and the non- visible area are there hint? Is there a hand? That's a handrail. There yeah there'll, be hand rails on both sides. Okay, all right. Okay, anything else. We need to know before we proceed. Yeah I'll mention that a block away, we approved a the installation of a very similar rail. It was not glass, it was metal surrounding a penthouse on 83rd street about a year or two ago. Of course, my memory of time now is suspect is not. It was probably the early 90s mark, and I remember the discussion at that time included whether it should be white or black, and the committee concluded that Black was actually more likely to fade into the fade into the background. Okay, all right, are we ready to do a vote? I think so. Would you guys be willing to do the same thing we did with the other project about the glass and being in contact with New, York, City, Audubon sure absolutely great, all right Peter, all right, I'm okay with it, but I think the presentation is lacking in details. The one thing I object to somewhat is the metal cap and not seeing any details of it. I mean you describe a metal top to the glass rail, but you do not show how you would do it, how wide is it and so forth, so I'm otherwise. Okay with the whole idea, but I do think that there should be some more details to explain how it would be put together being that we're in this unusual situation, where I'm on my own computer, would you like to see an image of what it might look like? That's not part of this presentation. Would that satisfy it. I think that would be helpful. Okay, let me let me pull up a similar project with a similar railing. If the railing on this product will be much higher because it was the full height of the guardrail well, this will only be 18, but the cap will be exactly the same. How big is the cap? It's about an inch and a quarter inch and a half high, and I think, 5:8 wide, it's very thermal, it's their most minimal cap today. So this is here: it's done in stainless, actually, instead of black, but if you can see that line on top of the glass well, I'm still seeing your original yeah you'll have to exit your share screen and then re- share the screen with the new thing Quirk of zoom. Okay, there you go so here's a similar glass railing. This glass will only be 18 inches high above the parapet, but that cap rail will be the same spec. But in this case it's going to be black in this product. It was stainless. Can you can you zoom it make it larger oops? Oh my god, look at that project without help yeah. So that's basically the look of the railing. This has a cap to stay there in case of panel breaks you're, not giving these new clients a jacuzzi part of this that's happy to. If they would like one, I think, okay, so we can see that. Does that make sense. Yeah! That's helpful! Peter, you! Okay! With that, I'm okay, I'm surprised, there's no railing for the stair! That's true! That's a good point on this project. Yeah. Can you ask these other people to talk to New, York, City, Autobahn? Okay, all right, I think we're ready to go back to the boat if that's all right with everybody, so Peter, you're, okay, now I'm okay, grudging! Okay was a little bit more in the way of detail, but in general, I'm. Okay with it, okay, thank you, Susan yep, yes, okay, Doug, yes, okay, Michelle, yes, Josh! Yes, madge, yes, and I agree with Peter on the detail. I'll vote. Yes, all right, so that is seven yes for committee folks, zero, Doug, climbing, yes and mark. I vote yes and given the the reservations of image and Peter, maybe we should characterize it as reasonably appropriate as opposed to a good old- fashioned appropriate if that would yeah. I also note that Paul Fisher joined us. Maybe is he still here? Yep Paul Fisher is still with us. You may want I'm not sure if Paul is able to put his vote in the chat or Paul. Or can you hear me? Maybe he could just raise hi raise his hand, yeah you're right. He votes by Chad, generally Paul votes by putting something in chat. Well, it's good to see you at a preservation meeting. Is there anything we can do you want to vote on this one? I think you joined in the middle, so you do not have to. Let's consider that a note, a non- vote, no vote either way. Okay, all right! So we have our vote. Are you guys calendared? I believe we're looking at the November 10th date. I think, is there next, the ten so yeah? This will go before the full board on November on Wednesday, the fourth, because some of us have something else to do on the on Tuesday. The third so but that'll be plenty of time great. Thank you very much. I hope nice to see you. Thank you. Thank you, Josh. Thank you all right, yeah! Thank you. Thank you all right. I guess that concludes our business. Unless you've got. If I could, I just got a call back from the reception guy at the architect firm for 320.. He tried to reach his boss, but could not get through. I recommend to the chairs that you take a disapproval protectively and if they come back to us and reschedule, we can always just table that in favor of whatever you do when they do show up, but I do not want you to lose the chance to be heard at LPC and LPC in general is not happy with people who do not show up. There are two new attendees. Just fyi, I do not know if that's okay, let me see who they are, are either of you guys here for 320 Columbus avenue, I'm looking at 917.483 and something called Mg guys. You got to unmute yourself if you're on the phone, it's Star six star, six, we're not hearing you. It sounds like somebody's talking, but I only hear the person just went off and back somebody went away. Just came back, I'm promoting him to panelists so that I was hoping that it's not working. I can write something in the chat. Does anybody hear any talking? Nope 48483 is Paul. Fisher 917. was that right, yeah because Paul, because Paul joined us by computer too, okay yeah, he just he just wrote: okay, thanks Paul, okay Paul, so I do not know who Mg is and they're not responding. Mg try to unmute yourself if you're on the computer, it's probably in the lower left hand corner or you can put your cursor over the letters Mg on the screen that you should be seeing. Let me give another minute just because I do not want anybody to be boxed out, but I do not understand what's going on well, I can fill in the time by letting everyone know that the White House's doctor has announced that trump has finished. His Covid-19 treatment he'll be able to hold public events by Saturday. Why am I glad that we're not allowed to talk about we're? Not voting on that today? Are we less sad, the better? Well if we apply the standard of appropriateness? No, I'm not going to go there. I I'd love to ask that doctor to stand face to face with president Trump without a mascot yeah wait. Are they real men? Do not wear masks right, yeah, okay, well, Mr, Mg or Miss Mg? I you appear to be unmuted, and yet we can not hear you if you, if you're able to put something in the chat and tell us why you're here, especially if you're here for 320 Columbus avenue, please let us know otherwise, the chairs are going to call a vote for a protective disapproval of that resolution of that application. I am sorry to move this along, but we got a half dozen people, cooling, your heels, for what I prefer for you know for what we can't hear. So I should I make. Should I propose the resolution. Please do I propose a disapproval without prejudice? Let the record reflect the time is now 7:48 p.m, and neither the applicant nor its representative has appeared for 320 Columbus avenue and that Mark Diller has attempted to reach out to the applicant, and nobody has responded, and I also want to add to your record that we also call this recall this application at 7:15 as well. So it's multiple attempts to reach. Okay, so does anybody disagree with the disapproval without Prejudice Kaye, myself, Susan, Josh, Peter, Doug, Mcgowan, Madge and then Doug, Kleinman and Mark? Okay, we're with you, okay, all right? Well, I would if you're taking a vote, are you taking? I would have to take a vote. Okay, wrong. I would be ineligible okay. So it's reason that is that my colleagues represent the retail space. I am not on the account, but I do not, and I have no but abundance of caution. I am for non- committee members. The vote is three zero. One: zero! No three for non- committee, it's 2- 0, it's 2-, 0-, 0- 1! Actually, oh because it's ineligible, not that he's abstaining, got it okay and for the committee, it's one two, three, four: five: six: seven: zero! That's what I have okay disapproval! Okay, make it away Kay! I think we've done it. I think you have. Oh, hang on. Oh no zoom curious live down the avenue; okay! Only learning! Oh great, all right! Well! Thank you very much for joining us. Please check the the the website for the November meeting of the Preservation committee, where I hope 320 Columbus avenue will come back to us and actually present glad that you were glad that you saw it on Linkedin or link NYC rather, and thank you for coming. That's the and, if you are so led when you visit our website, there's a button to click to get our e- blasts so that you can be notified of our agendas in advance thanks very much for coming. Thank you. Let me welcome. I was just going to say that we welcome input from members of the community on all projects. Last month we talked about the district needs statement and how we thought this was not the right year to ask for more staff, or anything like that. I just want to confirm that we did that we did right yep and we okay great. So then there's nothing else that I want to add to your agenda, and I thank you all for your good work right great with that we will release you to have a peaceful night. Okay, thanks, everybody, hey everybody well done, take care.
