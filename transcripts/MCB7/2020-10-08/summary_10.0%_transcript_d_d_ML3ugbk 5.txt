They came to us a couple of maybe even six months ago and said: Could we would you agree to the outdoor cafe, renewal or in this case, would be a new one, but then nothing happened with the space It's been empty and just now just recently, they've been working on it.
I guess the inside work, but it's a mess inside You said you said that to me, but unfortunately, I was not able to actually read it because it was a photograph But, but the cne did not have anything to do with the outdoor cafe, as I understand it, If you want to re, if you, if you want an outdoor, cafe, you've already rented it to a party- That's, all I meant to say: Why are they coming the webinar, I'm going to start letting people in They Want to completely read this in a landmark district, And we'll need somebody to take some notes or, and is that the order, the order you gave them just a second ago?
The order is from south to north And then, when we can all meet one day in person we'll go over this, even though Sue Schwartz does the best minutes ever she says: We have three buildings to look at okay, so who, let's see among our attendees, who is on one West, 67th street?
A combined two units 901 and 905 at the hotel, Des Artis at 1, West, 67Th street None of the work that we're doing is on the contributing facade of the building.
I'm, just going to interject for one quick, second sure for chairs privilege, which is that I believe our board heard applications with respect to the western penthouse apartment.
We'll give you a couple of photographic views along Central, Park, West and 68Th street.
Yes, we're doing it to create the to maintain symmetry for the building, and our owner was good enough to offer to the adjacent apartment to do the work for them happening, together.
That's a very permanent thing and the parapet that exists and Let me just go right into it from here sure, and also, let me say that in fact, about nine years ago, this same request was made to landmarks and was approved, And. It's just that the work never happened in the building.
If you look right, here, it's hard to tell in the photograph it's much clearer in person, but this is the kind of remnant of a terracotta cap piece which indicates that the parapet actually was about this level and was carried across sometime in the last.
What we're proposing to do is lower the masonry portion and build back up to the required height of 42 inches above the terrace with glass, and we want to set that glass on the inside face of that wall so that it has the least the visible effect from the street.
This- is the back half of the building as it exists, and this is the back half of the building as we're proposing again just showing the extension of that skylight, the just the roof of the new solarium and again everything that's shaded here is not in our scope of work, but here.
That's belongs to an apartment which will be relocated along with, but the rest of the mechanics, I believe, is to the existing apartments right and Skylight will be all the mechanicals that we will need for this apartment and they will not be visible from the street, and I should say.
The building is very happy with this scope of work, because we again are going to be repairing a number of hills with the roof and leaking issues.
And I would be hard- pressed to say that anybody walking down the street has ever looked at that building from this view.
Can crawl out there and look out a little space Here's a view from the from the pigeon They're such unique windows to this building that we'll just tell you that we are taking the three large special windows that constitute this department, and here you can kind of see the plan now of the build of this apartment, This unit, then has the space above this unit.
These are the existing conditions of those windows, here's what they look like and what you can see of them from the street.
Similarly, on the east side of the building, these windows are visible from certain points on central Park, West.
We are we're looking at the logistics of you, know, just how much material we can get in via the building and how much we'll have to lift from the street.
I started birding non- stop, but on 71st street outside the Majestic I had the privilege and the terror of picking up a black and white warbler on the sidewalk and carrying it up, Columbus avenue to the wild bird fund in April, and it We wanted to get that contact from you for the New York City Audubon, I.
The, general scope of work is to add a roof deck to the roof of the penthouse structure, and the visible portion of this is going to be the new railing.
Like, a you know, some kind of mechanical or service space that was then converted into an apartment.
Is it the case that this is visible, but only from a secondary facade, that's right and over other facades, We see the addition to the structure again, so this is looking from 84th street.
And, then you're going to build on top of this rooftop and people will be able to go on the top of the new rooftop right.
You appear to be unmuted, and yet we can not hear you if you, if you're able to put something in the chat and tell us why you're here, especially if you're here for 320 Columbus avenue, please let us know otherwise , the chairs are going to call a vote for a protective disapproval of that resolution.
