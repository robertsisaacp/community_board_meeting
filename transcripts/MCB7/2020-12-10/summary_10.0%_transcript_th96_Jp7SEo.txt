You know, I've worked with Neil, so on so many things.
Do, all these interviews on all these stations, so I always get to know like who watches what.
But the thing you know, I work with him and the thing is with business.
Okay, so I guess that's it, but we have everybody that counts for the street fair.
The street fair started when the applicant for 434 comes that way.
Thank you for running street fairs that people love to go.
It's been intense, eight, nine months and now, who knows if we'll shut indoor dining next week, it's just devastating on so many levels.
I think today was 2.5, less right, half of counties throughout the state where indoor dining is going to remain open.
And we've seen since June reference has been open at 50 percent indoor occupancy and New York city, since September 25 and infection rates continued to go, down.
The governor said: 70 of the new infections, are related to unregulated private social gatherings in people's homes.
You know what he said was that there was data that Robert restaurants, a lot.
Just said this week when it was asked, he said that he is not at any time now going to close indoor dining in New Jersey, because that's not where the infections are coming from right.
I mean I figured I'll, give you know the data that I have, which is the year before it was helpful.
It was a good great article, actually helping their tenants and working with them, and you know without Colombia, is doing that.
You know local law, 11, work and other stuff, which is extremely costly, and they can't make that stretch so right.
You're going to get a lawyer this time unless it's you know, are Aaron or Naomi here for a particular purpose or just observing.
Folks, let's take a look at the application, and so you know we're the hours were reasonable.
You, know so, and they don't have to tell us what kind of restaurant it is.
They opened up a new business, a nail salon, so I said: Is it asian or black.
And I was shocked that they got money to open up a new business, It's, Madeline, 115 or Columbus.
Sorry, Columbus well, I mean there's still some programs available for the small business administration, but I see what you're saying it's difficult in this period to open.
I, think you know we have such a reputation on the board that nobody ever expects us to once start on time and.
Okay, One thing you might want to know there were I, don't know if it's still the condition at that place, but there's a back door that opens onto the side street as opposed to the main door, which is on the avenue and the back door.
It's like street fair, I, love, Sadly, I think you guys are just hungry right.
