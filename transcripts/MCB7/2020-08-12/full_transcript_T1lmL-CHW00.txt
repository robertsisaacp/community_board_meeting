Hi, hello, hi, linda hi, okay, let me how am I unmuting madeline? But okay, it's unbeated! Okay, doug we've got our new doug, so we've got he kind of himself all right. Okay, so we've got barbara. We've got christian. Barbara josh you've got a quorum yeah. We have a quorum yes great and give me one second: okay: let's do a gallery view gallery there. We are guys good, got the gallery view everybody's unmuted. We have one two, three, four five: we gotta go: okay, we're ready to leave; okay, whatever what? Where did? Oh? Okay. Excuse me, one second hi, william hi natasha, hey susan, you made it holy molly. I let me know when we can get started whenever you're ready go right ahead. Hi robert with a cigar, okay, hi, shelly, okay, so the first order of business is our first order of business. We have no business left with them, except for them so we're starting at exactly 6. 31., hello, everybody, hello, hi, everybody, okay! So I'm going to ask everybody to kind of mute yourselves and then so here we are our first order of business. Is, I believe, 898 amsterdam avenue. Do we have the application christian? Yes I'll, give you a second put that up, so everybody take a look at it, yep, which is really the original reason. Why we're here not up? Yet this is a new application, but it's not a new application. It's a trend, I believe it's he has to renew it. It's an application of renewal for casa mexicano at 898, amsterdam avenue it's pretty pro forma, but we want to. We wanted to meet so we could really work with another restaurant to help them out so make sure that they didn't have to wait until september. So here it is okay there it is so there. It is, take a look at the method of operation, the hours of operation. So it's not open all that late! It's a restaurant, there's background music, only low pre-recorded background music, guys it's been around here for a long time. This is a renewal hi michelle! So that's where we're at and does anyone have any questions you mentioned 898 amsterdam. This is showing 483 columbus, it is 43 columbus and I crafted up sorry. We have the the owner. Mr kessler, mr kessler, can you unmute yourself? Yes, everyone max bookman, I'm josh kessler's attorney. I wasn't sure if we were doing the renewal or we're doing the new application for 40 columbus. First, I'm sorry, so I got this confused. So this is a new application for okay. You got it yep very good. Let me let me take it away then, and thank you very much good evening cb7. My name is matt hoffman. I am an attorney nice to see. Everyone with me is josh kessler. He is the applicant for your application tonight and thank you for hearing us in august. So the application is for 483 columbus avenue and that's a current existing restaurant with a an alcohol license. It's called bellini it's on columbus between 83rd and 84th. Very small space and josh is looking to take it over and do a new restaurant there. So a little bit about josh. He is an experienced restaurateur. He has a he's: the owner of a kosher restaurant over on the east side in the 40s on 46th street, that he's owned for a number of years now called barnea, bistro sort of standard kosher restaurant with with reasonable closing hours that garnered a great deal of of acclaim and he's looking to do something new he's, not sure yet whether this restaurant's gonna be kosher or not, he's leaning toward towards not kosher, but the food concept he's very clear on and that's gonna be small plate, tapa style food, the restaurant's going to be called bonito and, as was shown on the the application that he submitted very reasonable. You know restaurant method of operation, we're talking about 35 to 45 seats, reasonable closing hours for your neighborhood recorded background music. Only fellini does have a licensed sidewalk cafe, and so we are also going to have a licensed sidewalk cafe once sidewalk yeah once the city is doing sidewalk cafes again and the temporary covered stuff is over and so we're both here and we're happy to answer any questions that the committee may have great. What is the name of your restaurant again? On at on 46th street, it's called barnett. Oh sorry, it's well, you can answer, but it is barnea bistro. I think method of operation looks well. Anybody have any questions from the committee. Can you repeat hours of operation? It's on the application? Yeah. Let me show you that again hold on it's 12 a.m, sunday through thursday and then on weekends, friday and saturday 1am. That is obviously when we go back to being to real life, because now right yeah I mean I was watching. I was watching the sla full board meeting today where they were unsuspending, some licenses that were suspended and what they were doing for any license. That's been suspended if they're unsuspending them they're, requiring them to close for delivery, take out anything at 11. and obviously those are the city rules as well now as well. So anything that we're talking about tonight is the first subject to when all this craziness ends. Okay, shayla, you want to talk shelley, you had a question. I want to say that I'm familiar with bonaire personally, you've been there, it's well run and good neighbor and everything else. So that's just a thank you sheldon. I appreciate it. Well is there anyone from the public who would like to speak? I'm sorry well, they will have to raise their hands if they want to talk while you're waiting for the public. I could just say by the way mr bookman max. I am great respect for what you've been doing for the industry. You know and hospitality alliance. I've seen you testify and I just kudos to you for all of your work. Thank you. The hospitality alliance has really been instrumental andrew ridgie, who everybody knows has been. You know. I think I think this is the first time he's been able to take a few days off. Actually, and god knows that when and he really deserves it because he's been non-stop. Thank you. I just wanted to say and again this is not a requirement, but I see josh kessler's name and type, but is there any reason he doesn't want to show is punim unfit on camera? There's, no reason why not? I just got to figure out how to do this hold on a second not necessary. It's not I'm just there. I am I'm here. I don't know what happened there: okay! Well, okay, let's close the question. Oh hang on a second did the did the I tried to unmute the folks who were attendees just in case they wanted to say something. So I see donna is. Were you asking to comment? No, I don't have any comments right now. I was interested in learning a little more about some of the things that were going on with hotels being nice, we're going to continue a little bit later, so we're going to move this off. We have two items after this new business and I love your input and we- and I think everybody has a lot of opinions and there's a lot going on in our neighborhood. We have to think first, let's vote on this folks, so all in favor, if you can place your hands on the participants area, please the committee members first paul. If you're hearing me vote on the chat, please, okay, why am I not getting my opponent yeah alina you're, a co-host, so you cannot raise your hands at your birth charter? Yeah? Okay, so we have one two. Three linda's four and five josh is six yeah paul. If you vote was on the chat please so for now the vote will be six zero committee members. So if you lower your hand now so non-committed members, all those in favor raise your hand please. So I have a rubber as a one. Two three four five six seven with dog mark is eight susan is nine. Shell is ten anybody else. So that's ten. I raised my hand virtually oh yeah. I see it yes! Well! Let me let me start the count again hold on hold your hands up, say. Six. Seven boost mark ducks eight susan, nine, jelly, ten, okay, anybody against abstaining! Oh actually, I didn't condense, even was 11. okay, so the non-committee member boss was 11-0 jerry. You got my yes though. Yes, I did yes, oh okay, I didn't see it come up. Okay, mr bookman! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Everyone happy birthday take care everyone. Thank you. Thank you all very much and thank you and stay safe and well. Thank you as well. Thank you. Thank you. So you're welcome to stay on. The next discussion actually might be interesting for you we're going to talk about the sweat law, that's being resurrected by our state assembly, woman, linda rosenthal, and- and we find this from the perspective the restaurant's really egregious, especially it's always been egregious. It was passed in the state assembly at last January or was it december and and the state senate, and then it was vetoed by the governor and so now they're trying to push it through. I'm going to leave give this over to christian. Who will explain it to you in more detail than I, but if you don't know what it is it's well, the the law in part is they are requiring if any employee files a claim that his wages have not been paid, he sold wages with a lien law. They can put a lien on the business property and also on the owner's property for the amount of the of the of the claim now part of the reason why we don't believe this is, it ought to be done. This way is that, if once that's done, if the business needs to do any kind of transactions to to be able to say to survive, they may not be able to, they may not be able to because of the lien and now that's why we think we so, or at least some of us are against it now. Having said that, the part of the reason this came about was that of because of those restaurants that had disputes with the with their employees, and they will close the restaurant, they wouldn't pay the employees and they will reopen under a different name or different corporate entity, and the employees will lock out. So this is a partly an attempt to avoid that, but the way it's written right now it just goes too far, and I think it will have a negative impact on restaurants. You want to weigh in here and talk about it from the perspective of a restaurant, an owner I mean I've said before. I think it's ridiculous. I think she's crazy to suggest this unreasonable. It's I don't know what more there is to say about. I think christian that everything needs to be said. It's just nuts. That was the discussion, and we wanted to know if everybody was on board with that doug you you're dealing with this firsthand, I mean with your clients. Well, so what many restaurant owners have said to me- and I think rightly so- is that this law goes too far because it lacks it's. Basically, really. The lien is placed just for a claim being made, not after it's being completely adjudicated, and the problem is that there are a lot and donna. Can we get everybody to mute who's? Not talking? I think, okay, thank you so so the issue is that there are people that would take advantage of this and could use the employees and I'm not I'm. You know nobody wants to see any employees mistreated or underpaid or ripped off. That's not what this is about. The issue is: will people use this as undo leverage to almost for lack of a better term extort an owner into you know putting a lien on someone's personal assets and homes when otherwise they have some protection through a corporate veil and force? You know for someone's hand, and so I know many restaurant owners and bar owners. Who've said: if this law passes, they will they'll shut down and they're not going to come back. That's someone else's quote, that's not mine, but it also goes after the most importantly, it goes after the personal asset of the owner. Sometimes the managers, even the investors. So what it does is put a damper on anybody who wants to participate in this current environment and we're going to be dealing with this from 2022. Hopefully, no later, restaurants are already at risk and- and we've seen, I mean barbara and I about of someone a restaurant very well. Even before the law was passed, he had they fired a bartender and he went after him just before the law saying that they were going to go after he was going to try and go after their personal assets. Barb. Are you raising your hand? Yes, I just want some clarification on why this is coming up again if this failed the first time around, because the governor failed to sign the bill. Thankfully, even you know, we all worked very hard. I is the director of the bid at that time and certainly andrew ridgie, and we did a lot of work on this together, but it failed, and now I don't- I don't understand why we're talking about it now. Should you bring it up again? If I may linda, you could technically say that if that did actually pass, does the governor veto it? They submitted it and it has already passed the senate and it's awaiting a vote on the assembly, so it may pass again, and that means the governor's got to veto it again, but it's a really wrong-headed bill. It is horrible. This is a very dangerous bill. Has it been redrafted at all? Have there been any changes made if you want, I can put it up, but you know it looks that most of the original premises are still there. They didn't change any of the of the main points. I mean the intent behind protecting employees. You know from the legal, wranglings and someone you know, opening up just you know dissolving one corporation and then not having liability. That's we don't want to condone that, but we also don't want right and they should have addressed that directly, which they actually did not. It's sort of curious to me that the bill was vetoed, and rather than trying to override the veto, which is the correct procedure in the legislature that they instead just resubmitted the bill. If I'm understanding, you correctly is that what's going on yep wow, but you know eight days later [Laughter] that is unbelievable, softening of language, no clarification, nothing, no, not to the parts that are important. It still says that that they would put the lien on the on the pro on the you know, on the property and and the personal assets also. So what we could do is send everybody a link, so you have it. What we're talking about is I experience. What we're talking about is a letter coming from the business and consumer issues, committee of community board, seven saying that we are very much against it if we're very much against it, which is why we're having this discussion. If this committee agrees that we all collectively think it's a bad idea and punitive and at a time that's really bad, we will go ahead and draft a letter and we will send it to our committee to review. I wish max bookman was still online if he felt like a pining on it. But okay, I just put the link on the thank you. Okay, we have to be a little careful about a letter that looks like it's coming from cb7. If it's just a letter from the committee, we might, there might be a way to deal with that yeah. Let's work toward that and yeah absolutely and everybody will have a chance to review and as always what we do on this committee is everybody participates and we do it in tandem and everybody and we incorporate everyone's edits and we will send it to you, of course, as we always do, but the language will be coming from the business and consumer issues, maybe okay, rover and then michelle after yeah. This is it's an alarming letter kind of draconian, but I really think it's a it's a shot before the bow and it's a warning in these difficult times and it's a warning to unscrupulous restaurant owners and the abuse of employees, and if we consider the history of restaurant workers over the years, you have to take into account that these scenarios are very real possibilities. I don't think that we're going to see a case where a restaurant's owner is a southampton home is going to be attached. It's going to be lean, but this is you know it's interesting that during the banking crisis in 08 and 1907, goa did the same thing with the banks. This is you know. We know you're going to do this, and this is what we're going to do. Of course, you know the banks always prevail, but it's the same concept. I think, and it's a preventive measure that take us seriously and and we're very happy to hear that you have the community support and that you have no intentions of abusing your employees, but we know you know, I don't agree with you and I'm gonna speak up because I don't think it's a preventive measure. I think it's punitive and not only that most restaurants today have digital time clocks, it's very difficult to rip off an employee, as it was very much. You know not saying that there aren't bad actors there are, but it was it's much harder to do that, but what it does it says, you're guilty before proven innocent. Well, it's punitive. If you're not enacted, it's just a warning. It's just a warning in the meantime! No, it's not if they pass this law. It's not a warning! Well, yeah! So it's a deterrent! You know we can play with the word, but it's a deterrent. Don't you dare do this robert? It's a claim. It can be a claim against opinion. Who else wanted to speak? I think michelle wanted to speak. Then I see david honor and hi david and peter arnstein, okay, yeah. I see my time to josh. Thank you. I just wanted to say robert that this could be a claim against it's. When there's a claim. Not even the case doesn't reveal it's just a claim and it could be against a manager, not even an owner manager. It's egregious. It's awesome on personal property like if you own a condo or whatever you own, you can put a lead on anything yeah. I think josh. If what george is saying, I'm going to have a look at the law just for my interest, I'm supporting the committee, but I think if you're talking about the manager candy, no, that you know no, but I'm just I'm just making the point that I understand the deterrence factor and but I agree with the committee's outrage and that the committee should send a nice letter so I'll get it that's so nice, okay, who else wanted to speak peter and then david how's that peter? What's going on, I put my notes into chat, but basically I don't think this is well written. I'm very concerned about small businesses that don't have lots of lawyers or have a lawyer on staff. That's competent and they're, the ones that are going to get hurt. I I've yeah, that's my biggest concern is that the larger restaurants that have lawyers will figure out a way to deal with it to a degree but the smaller ones. There's they have no chance whatsoever and that's an issue for me. Thank you, peter david. How are you I'm good? How you doing good nice to see everybody and on a side note? Thank you all very much for your support. I'm not! I wasn't on this to. I didn't know about this part, but this obviously affects me as well. This is a it's a dangerous bill and what the gentleman just said is correct. Small restaurants suffer from this because we don't have human resources department. We don't have lawyers. You know I can't call lawyer on a regular basis. The problem is, there are some very bad restaurant owners out there and they probably have ruined it for everybody else. You know if we're talking about a bill. What I would like to see past is: if an employee see what's happened in the past, is employee can sue you and then you have to defend yourself. So, even if you win the case, you spend thousands and thousands of dollars defending yourself. So what happens? A lot of restaurant owners actually settle, even though they're doing nothing wrong only to make it because it will cost them less money. So I would actually like to see a bill that if an employee sues you and they lose the case, they pay your legal fees and I guarantee there won't be as many if you're going to be punitive to the owner. You've got to be punitive to the employee who's, taking advantage of something. So I I'm guessing. This would never happen, but to me it would level the field and it would save many restaurants, a lot of heartache to say like if you're, okay, if you're bringing a false case and you lose you're gonna end up paying the fees. So it's a very dangerous build, but unfortunately there are a bad. There are bad not like I say, restaurant, but bad business owners in general and then that- and that's that goes with any business and this bill. It's you know, owning a small business. You can't be you're supposed to be you're innocent until proven guilty not guilty until you've proven innocent. It's very dangerous, I see doug's hand is raised. Michelle was your hand raised too. Oh okay, no I'm good. Thank you. I mean I just to further david's point and see others here. I have no problem. Punishing bad actors with the way this is written. This is the concern I would again. This is an oversimplification and I'm not an attorney, but I would be delighted with a bill that eventually would put a lien on an owner who has egregiously offended and broken laws by not paying their employees and it was proven in court and then possibly there would be some liability, personal liability that makes pierce the corporate veil, but not until such time that it was proven and yeah and if you're going to walk away from your liabilities, especially with regard to wages, which is a major no-no. I'd be okay with that, but just because you know people have to be innocent until they're proven guilty, and the fact is that there are a lot of litigious employees and there are many more employees than there are owners and the and it's not as much the employees, but many of the attorneys and again not trying to attorneys. But there are a lot of attorneys that are go after restaurants. They go here's what you're going to do and they push a settlement. It happens all the time it happens with 88 cases and I've seen it with my own eyes and it's not fair and it has to be rewritten. I would be so I'd be in support of something that was rewritten, but I don't know why it hasn't been. Okay, maybe doug I'll. Tell you what we're going to do. If everybody on our committee is in agreement that we can draft a letter from business and consumer issues, we got a an ii here, then I will doug with you and christian, and I work on the letter in the language and then everybody can we'll do that I'll get this going! Next week, okay, yeah paul any longer- okay, I guess not, okay, so okay, so the next one, I think, is why everybody's here hold on barbara. You have a question you're on you're, muted, barbara, I'm new to yourself, you're still, muted. Sorry, I only have my ipad here. Just would not unmute. I apologize for that. I wanted to ask if andrew ridgie has factored in on this, because I really don't think that cd7 should move forward until we get his input. I was so actively involved before I spoke to andrew today we texted each other and he was apologetic. He doesn't have any bandwidth. I know it was so he said go for it and then we would all discuss it later. Yeah he's very interested in this. Actually, he said the brother to our attention for us to discuss so we're there, and I know he could have been really eloquent about this, but he's taking a much needed break so we're all here. I think most of the folks are here tonight about the issues with 688 folks residents moving into our neighborhood, all single men and women, no families and and they've wreaked havoc again. This is a bci committee, so we're they've wreaked havoc on our local stores. They're wreaking have a lot of a lot of people, not everyone, but there are several people who there was an od yesterday in front of dsw another one in front of the lucerne. That seems to be the most difficult one, but the belt player we've got those issues too, but primarily the lucerne is the one that's affecting our restaurants, the most because we've got we we're getting reports of aggressive panhandlers, which is which obviously is discouraging diners on the street, and so we've got some issues and it's not you know, and we want it's not that we are a native, a community. That's not that doesn't want to support those less fortunate, okay or people. It's truly, but we've got. We've got a whole bunch of drug addicts, primarily 283 at the lucerne and we've got a whole slew of drug dealers. I was, I watched. The drug deal go down on saturday, so on broadway in 79, so we've got some issues, so I think again we're going to write a letter. There's no point in a resolution at this stage because it wouldn't the whole full board would have to vote on it. But again we'll be writing a letter and everybody's input is critical. So I'm going to start the dialogue rolling here again, meddling raising your oh hold on a second linda. I wonder if it might, it might be useful to have mark, give us a summary of the of the meet of the meeting that we had the other day with the the border president's office and and dhs, and some of those other people sure I'm glad to do that. And while a letter that comes only from a committee with respect to a proposed legislation is something we can talk about. This is an issue where I think that, to the extent that the community board seven speaks at all, it needs to speak with one voice and we're not in a position to do that right now. There are obviously concerns and- and they should be addressed, let me answer christian's question. So as soon as we learned about this, which was after it was a done deal as I think everybody knows, we set to work trying to address the issues as they came up, we're losing you mark, I'm sorry say again: we lost you there for a moment. Oh okay, I didn't lose you, so I so thanks for letting me know. Okay, so several of us, including especially well, not especially but including me, have been spending an awful lot of time, trying to make headway with the service providers, with the elected officials with block associations a whole panoply of folks who are trying to respond to this, and with the service providers we've been engaging both with their security folks, as well as their programming folks trying to make sure. For example, there are things for the residents the shelter clients to do. One of the things that has been emerging is that, while there are absolutely incidents of aggressive behavior and there have been overdoses, there was one in a tree pit in front of my own apartment building. So this is not rumor. This is fact the. It is not always possible to trace the people who were involved in these actions actually back to the hotels or back to the shelter clients. We've been working with the NYPD to try to enlist their help, especially with respect to things like drug dealing, and some of the answers are not the answers that you'd want to hear the NYPD that there is private security, that is, that is contracted by the service providers. At the hotels, the private security are not peace, officers they're, certainly not police officers. They cannot make arrests discussion, I've had with reporter. Yes, the police, the police are severely limited in what they can do as well. Essentially, if, if they don't see a drug deal with evidence right in front of them, there's nothing they can do either, and I mean like seeing it across the street is not good enough. Certainly people, certainly people- I mean I I've witnessed what I believe to be drug deals too, so I'm not questioning whether that's actually happening. I'm simply saying that this is what is the challenge we face and the police are diminished in their ranks both because their budgets have been cut and because they have a number of other challenges that they they are prioritizing and so working with them to try to expand the perimeter of whatever it is that the private security will reach has been a challenge for sure the the elect. So there was a meeting last thursday, which was the first time that many of us got to speak, and the co-chairs of hhs and bci were on that. Thank you, as well as a couple of our other colleagues who were invited in their other capacities in the community, not necessarily because they were cp7 members with a wide number of constituents involved and several electeds showing up in person and their staffs as well as other staffs and d. A and dhs was there, as well as the service providers, dhs started to answer some questions and work with folks, some of the things I've just been telling you were things that emerged from that meeting. They agreed as long as we don't call it a community advisory board. They agreed to have an ongoing working group with members of the community. I am working with April from gail brewer's office and also helen's office and other offices to try to get that next meeting set up. We were hoping that it could come together this week, I'm not so sure that's going to happen now, but we're pushing as hard as we can for that. Meanwhile, I shared with you all many of the things that I'm saying now as cb7 members over the weekend and I'm contemplating two things. One is contemplating a communication by email using our email blast to the wider community to try to share some of these things as well, not because this is going to be the information that everybody wants to hear, but because we should be sharing it and then in part because well and then the question is whether I hold or we hold a a specific meeting about this with the community at large and while, on the one hand, I don't want anybody tagging cb7 to say that we are the authors of any of these discussions or decisions. It is important that as accurate information as possible, as is conveyed, there are aggressive incidents of aggressive behavior, for example that have been happening in our in our district, but that we don't have any reason to believe happened with respect to shelter clients. There was a horrible stabbing. I don't know if you saw the video at the 72nd street subway station, where a person emerged from the subway with a very long knife and it and without warning or provocation, took after a person buying a metrocard. It was bone chilling and I've been a new yorker for 40 plus 50, whatever it is years and that's as scary as it gets the that person had nothing to do with any of the shelters he wasn't coming here to visit a shelter, he wasn't a resident in a shelter. As far as I know, he wasn't a resident in a shelter anywhere else either there have been some incidents of aggressive behavior in our restaurants and you're right to be concerned about that aggressive panhandling, almost isn't the right word, because it sounds nice, and this is accosting people in a very challenging way. Again. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether any of them are shelter, clients or not directly in front of lucerne. We know it was the sheltered person well, and it is also the case that there are populations- and I've been criticized for using this word, but I'll, try it again, just in case that prey upon the shelter clients. So, for example, we've had documented overdoses. We know that the drugs are illegal and that they weren't provided by the shelter. So they got here somehow, and so there are people who are preying upon vulnerable populations in that way, and that is destabilizing not just for the shelter clients, but for the community around or I should you can say that sentence either way. You could also say it's destabilizing both for the community surrounding and for the shelter clients too. I you know to the extent that they are attempting recovery. That is something that we should be supportive of. There has been. There is a beginning of a discussion in that meeting that christian and linda were referring to about a good neighbor policy and the expectations of the shelter clients and their behavior. It was a surprise to me that continuing in active use of illegal drugs is not a violation of the good neighbor policy such that it would cause them to lose their rights to shelter or even their rights to use shelter in these hotels. I'm not defending that decision, I'm simply reporting it. One of the things that we were given to understand in the early going was that, because these hotels, let's face it, they're much nicer properties to live in than some of the places that these folks are used to in terms of shelter, it would be a lever to say that they needed to behave in a way that you know we would hope for our community, but it is emerging that active drug use, for example, is not a disqualifying event with respect to the shelters. I'm sorry, we expected these hotels as shelters, so I am. I think that we ought to hold a meeting, even though I am wary of doing so, and the reason is that we're not the author of these decisions, I am I'm not confident that dhs would show up to a general community meeting where an awful lot of the angriest voices will be heard. I think it's important that angry voices be heard the same way. I think it's important that compassionate voices be heard. The the and I have yet to hear a consensus emerge through all the communications I've received and believe you me when I tell you that I've received you know, probably a half dozen to a dozen emails every single day. I've been doing my best to respond to them because I think people want to be acknowledged. I think that their concerns should be addressed, even though I don't have a lot of hopeful information for them about that. It is absolutely the case that these hotels are near schools and they are near residential neighbors, and I got to tell you that the lawyer-like answer that was given that you know that only the registered sex offenders who were allowed to be near there are near there. That's not the answer that the community wants to hear that there was only one residentially restricted sex offender that there are different. This was aaron drinkwater deputy commissioner of dhs, and it was- and she said so- she didn't what she said was there was only one residentially restricted sex offender, the others were okay, a block from the school. Well now they know there's six registered leaders. Okay, I met with the police today, okay, I think we should let my finish before without interrupting. Please that's! Okay! That's okay! You know you can hear the conflict in my voice too, because I want to be compassionate and I want to be appropriate, but I also want to have the right answer for our community and it doesn't appear as though anyone is owning the predictable collateral consequences of these actions. At the same time, it is appropriate that it is appropriate that we be compassionate to the people who are being put in our community. These are, I don't, have a good answer for you. I am trying to do my best to make this better, but better is not the same thing as the problem going away and so yeah. I I'm making a meal of this. There are two more points I want to make. One is that I do think we need to hold a meeting even if it's a highly organized meeting, so that folks feel as though they have an opportunity to be heard on this. In some sense, even though I don't know that there's anything we can do with that information, I think it's still important for us to set to hear firsthand as much as we can. I mean this meeting could go on for 18 hours, so I'm not gonna, I'm not going to agree to that and we're going to hear things that are going to be hard to hear, but I still think that there's. I also think that if we don't hold such a meeting, then come september 1st, with our next full board meeting we're going to hear it anyway, and then we will be dealing both with the issue of whatever folks are saying and the fact that they feel aggrieved by the fact that we didn't give them enough an opportunity to speak before that. The last thing I want to say is that these are all very difficult issues. It has become known to me because I lived near one of the hotels, so I walked by there with some frequency. By no means is this a black and white issue, but there are a significant number of people of color who are the clients that are being housed in these hotels. Our board has been searching for answers with respect to the inequity of resources in our system system-wide, and it's found we're still work, we're still working on the best possible way to express that. I don't want to lose the reality that there are that same conversation could have some impact here that we need to be mindful. I think I need to be mindful of the population that is being discussed and how the nature of their situations warrants are, taking into account inequities in the system wide about the availability of resources, the availability of treatment, the availability of health care in general- and I guess I'll end with that. This is an enormously difficult situation. Those are my thoughts on it as well, as I hope, a fair summary of that meeting, which ranged all the way from this doesn't belong in a residential neighborhood all the way to we need to be better neighbors ourselves. So I hope that's an answer to your question and of course I'm here. Thank you, marcus, gotcha, okay, kendall, okay, I'm and forgive me, I'm very upset right now. I spoke about this weeks ago. More so I spoke about the restaurants opening up in the street that this will happen. I warned against this and now I'm emotionally upset now, when you bring up the fact that it's mostly minorities, we know that what we, what are we going to do about that? Not look at them. They're criminal drug dealers have no jobs. Where are they going homeless? People don't want to go on a shelter because of corona virus. There are all sorts of issues that these people are going through and now that they've gone through it. I warned you guys weeks ago. You should have thought about finding a solution. I'm angry, I'm so angry that black people are being perpetrated as these criminals. These crazy people, these drug addicts, don't you think they have problems? I am so upset and you mark, I am so upset, and I understand that you don't mean it in the way that I hear it, but I'm hearing it because I want you guys a few weeks to go. I am so upset black people in this country. That's why this election is so important that you hear us. You see us, you pay attention to us. You help us. We help each other, don't come back and say: oh now, they're out there dealing to us or this one died in front of this place or they whatever they do. I warned you guys weeks ago. We should have been speaking more and more about that. Then I thought it was been an outside restaurant. Now, it's all over. You guys didn't listen to me. Please listen to me for once or listen to a black person who knows what they're talking about. We know what we're talking about. We know what we need they're, not out here, doing it intentionally. They have no means to live a better life. I live in public housing and I hate it, but this is all I can afford and I do the best I can and help others out. So I don't want to hear about there's more crime. I warned you guys weeks ago and I'm done chilly, I'm new to yourself. Sorry, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, yeah. I want to provide you with some information first, because I had somewhat of an intimate gathering with the commander of Manhattan north, who many of us knew from the 24th cathedral. Riley of captain zuber from the 20th and detective yaguchi who's new at the 24th and the first bit of surprise information is that the lucerne contract ends in October, and the commander said that it will not be renewed definitively. Okay, it would have to be renewed then, and she said she knows that it will not be renewed. Okay, that's one thing. The second thing the police hands are tied for any quality of life issues in our community. Okay, a lot of things were negated as things that were considered crimes and other things are not honored by the Manhattan d.a. They will not prosecute any quality of life crimes so that the police have to walk tiptoed. You know to tiptoe around a lot of things, what the police feel that they're being victimized as maybe not doing enough. They said this. The homeless services are responsible for most of the reaction to things that are going on. What people are not aware of, or may not be aware of, is that the majority of residents, temporary residents now or the people who are born from the shelters go out in the morning and come back in the evening. Most are not hanging around during the day and then they're not required to the police are come around at key times of the day, specifically to the shelters when people leaving and when people coming back, where their concentration of people and where there could be arguments and could be issues between the people who were now residing in the hotels. The drug dealers didn't weren't confused when they left the shelters downtown, they knew where they were going and either they came to meet them, or some of the people who had are not fully recovered are going back to their suppliers. So that's the normal course of business, and the only answer to what's going on from what I can see is that people have to start distinguishing between crimes and discomfort. Crimes are when people are assaulted, verbally or physically crimes are when things are done that are illegal. So, although it's a very difficult situation for most people, I think people have to be aware that the neither none of the hotels are going to be emptied by, except for one possibly in October, and that this is a longer-term situation. The people who were there did not ask to go there. They did not request to go there. They were shipped and warehoused there. What we can do, both on behalf of the community, on behalf of the other, the people who living there is to report to the to the precinct 9-1-1 anything we see that we think is very inappropriate or criminal. The police then go to the service providers, project renewal, help USA and they discuss it and try to get it corrected. The pictures that go to elected officials are wonderful, but they're not going to act on it. The police are going to act on it. So if people concerned about issues they should bring it up with their elected officials, and you know question why there was no process with the community and that the services hardly can be provided properly to 283 people at the lucerne 288 people at the belclair, but that that's not the resident's fault. It's just very poor planning on health and human services, health and human services have never, I shouldn't say: never almost nev almost never will come to a community meeting. So that's a waste. But if we're going to have a community meeting, I think that we can have the two precincts and Manhattan north commander come and speak. We can have the providing service providers come and speak. We can have elected officials come and speak and respond to questions. I think it's important that the community board has some type of forum before september comes because people expect it. They don't they're not going to be invited to gail's limited meeting. They feel they must be heard, and the only venue that they've accustomed to is the community board. But I think we have to be mindful of the fact that although they're very uncomfortable things and offensive things and criminal things going on that, the situation was set up for failure and concentrated in a small area to make it even worse. The last thing I want to say is: there are two issues here: two major issues: there are street homeless, which we've had for a long time and the numbers have increased and then there's the shelter people and to distinguish who's doing what is very difficult for most people, there's also the third group and that's the ordinary person who's doing something wrong. So one person I know complained about. They were assaulted, verbally by someone on the street and very abusively and harmfully and hatefully, and I asked who was it they said. Well, it could have been a shelter person, it could have been one of the encampment people, I said, and it could be someone else, so we can't make assumptions about people because of what they do, but we can you. The only avenue we have is to report things that we find and expect that the police will work with the service providers and with and with the elected officials. The having a working group that mark mentioned, I think, is a wonderful idea. So it's not a community advisory board. I think it's necessary to get updated information, because the only updated information we seem to get is from the newspaper and from online things and I'm not saying they're not valid, but certainly they're going to be skewed in the negative. So well, I said a lot, but I think we have to be mindful of the broader situation who's responsible for it and it's not the homeless people who are brought up from other shelters who are responsible for the fact that they're there and the fact that they do not have they can't get their services properly in this highly concentrated, overloaded hotel situation. Thank you. I saw. I just wanted to point to shelley's point that the individuals didn't ask to go to these hotels. Rather it's pretty clear at this point that the hotels accepted for business reasons to accept the program into the community. I think there was an article newspaper article about it published today, where one of the individual owners noted that he had a part. He had an opinion and was part of the discussion with that in mind and that it's clear that there's data related to incidents all public publicly available on the boardstat tool. In my mind, it's clear that there's a community concern as well associated with this. I think we all agree with a letter as a way to begin the conversation outside of the public meeting with a letter from bci who has the responsibility to mediate in the charter. Would that be a beginning mechanism or a way to begin the conversation to put us on record on how we feel about the activity? Or is it not just? Let me jump in. Let me jump in there, because committees don't generally write letters. The board does and generally speaking, positions on in letters are an amplification or re restatement of positions taken by the full board. Right now, the full board has not taken any position at all and I'm not certain that there's a consensus in any particular direction. A letter that asks for information is something that anybody can do, but a letter that states a position is something that needs to be based on something that the full board has done. I will try to let me just interject, because steve brown has his hand, please with the discussion that he and I had earlier, and I had suggested that hhs and yell because they deal with families, and it was you know and pertinent to them that they write a letter, because bci's focus had to do with the local businesses that are so challenged right now. That's why I suggested other committees, but I think you know, and also because we don't have a meeting this month. This was the bci meeting that had been called as an emergency in order to address an application, and then we discuss this, but I'm going to call on steve brown now, because I know that you want to discuss this too yeah well I'll, be I'll, be kind of straightforward and simple in hopes of anticipation of a further meeting and to linda's point at yale. I was talking to a couple committee, members and other. You know other board members about possibly having a yl with concerns specifically about youth concern. You know the issues would simply would be to my the committee. You know around the pedophiles around walking in certain areas around youth, but I I'm not sure if mark had made a final decision, but we've had some dialogue and I would actually ask if we had a broader meeting. So I'm going to formally request and or support that meeting and if that does so, then I think it would be much more impactful on that level. And then my comments are, I think, shelley and doug and the other comments were I'm not going to be repetitive. So I will just make a different comment and I think the challenge that I see with government in particular dhs, is their methodology and way they do things, and it's become clear to me that vhs, I believe, looks at things in a capacity issue, but not a community appropriate issue and we've seen it ravage a very successful women's shelter on the upper west side, and it was probably because some algorithm came forward that sort of made sense to do this and as a as we listened to the government, we listened to the mayor's office. Talk about community involvement as we try and turn policing into community involvement. I don't understand why dhs can't be talking about community involvement. This was not set up for success at shelly said. I don't think it's fair to the men in there and I, and some of them are empathetic and some of them can't really I'm not as empathetic, but the bottom line is as someone that has some experience with addiction in my family and in my life you know it doesn't make sense. To put, I would not want to put a family member who went to a place near a in an area that had many liquor stores that it's just not the proper place. There are many places in the boroughs that I think would be more appropriate. So I'll just leave it at that, but I think that we should be communicating to dhs that the upper west side welcomes people that need help, but we want them appropriate. A family shelter in that area would be so much more appropriate kids and mothers and other ones would be more appropriate and we should be focusing on the dialogue of let's get the appropriate people here. That particular group and I'm very empathetic, would do better someplace else and our community would be better it's not in either or people aren't. You know, people aren't demonized and I'm super sympathetic to everyone. But let's get the right people. We are welcoming community, but let's coordinate those efforts together. That's the message I think has to go out to dhs. If you want to continue to do this, then you need to work with us and get the right area. That would be my a major theme of what I think should be going out to the community to the people into new york city. Thank you, steven we're going to recognize now doug climb and after that barbara adler. I've been giving this a lot of thought, as I think we all have and on a personal note, I've been doing my very best to make real observations with my eyes and ears. I've been walking by all of the hotels regularly at different times of night and day. I've been monitoring a lot of the chatter on social media, some of which is credible, some of which is bogus, and I think, there's an old expression that nothing changes until it becomes what it is. In other words, let's get the facts and I think to shelly's point, there's a lot of conflation here. I saw someone post a picture of carl on 79th and broadway, who we've all known for years, and you know they're putting that in the backdrop of the lucerne. Well, carl is not a lucerne resident he's been an issue, he's been a problem. God bless him. I wish him well, but they got that wrong and they've got a lot of other things wrong. They got some things right. Yes, quality of life super important crime, not gonna, be tolerant of it and when I say crime, I'm talking about drug addiction, fornication, masturbation, drug sales, harassment muggings all that stuff. We got to get a handle on that, because that is what everybody's afraid of, but I do believe that many of the reports have been grossly exaggerated. I think there is a lot of NIMBY going on here and there's a lot of white privilege going on here too, but I'm not saying that that's all what it is, because there's something really happening in our neighborhood and it is happening every day. I've seen it and so I'd like to know more about you know you look, you follow them. Oh mighty dollar, the, whether the lucerne's contract is going to be renewed or not, do the math roughly, these hotels are making about a million to a million and a half a month. In an environment where they were sucking wind because of Covid-19 they're empty, so I can't even fault the hotel owners for saying yeah I'll take that deal. They probably don't live in the neighborhood, but I understand why they did it. So I I'm kind of all over the place here, but I'm committed, as we all are to be to help these people compassionately. But you know drug addiction, encampment and substance. Abuse is an extremely volatile, tragic thing and it is probably the bubonic plague of our time. Besides Covid-19 and people that are active drug users, some of them are compl are violent, not all of them are and they can be very dangerous when they are in a numbed state, and we are seeing some of that and we got to get a handle on it. I you know I like to see what the you know. I spoke with mark earlier the rules. What are the rules in the hotel if they're violating their curfew- and I am I'm shocked- that sobriety at least for some period of time- is not a condition of staying in these properties, because they're shelters but no room to refine that a little bit? So in any case and to madeline's point, you know we. This is obviously we're getting a real vision here of a systemic problem and now it's in our backyard in our front yard. So, yes, there is a horrible, I'm gonna and I'll wrap this up, because I'm taking too much time I apologize, but I've just been giving it a lot of thought. We are now seeing it in our face. We haven't built enough, affordable housing. We have not helped people with mental illness. That is a fault. It's such a complicated issue with federal funding, medicaid medicare, you name it and now we're seeing it. So maybe this is a great opportunity for us to really figure out ways. We can systemically help people, it's not going to be overnight, but I continue to ruminate on this and meditate on this and pray on this, and I would love to be part of a solution without vilifying anyone in particular. Thank you. Thank you, though. Barbara yeah, I don't think there's anybody in our community who has not given this very serious thought people have questions concerns people are upset. People are feel one way. People feel completely the opposite way about this, and it seems to me that community board 7 has just really failed this community, in that it's our job, to provide a forum for people to come together and to hear each other to get some answers from some professional people who have something to say, and I don't understand why we haven't done that. There's been a few meetings that I've heard about. I was not invited to any of them. I don't understand why selected people were invited and I frankly I don't think it makes sense to have this meeting now for a very selected group of people on bci when everybody from cb7- and I can't tell you how many calls I have gotten from people who want. However, questions- and I can't answer them- I don't think any of us can really, but I think we absolutely have to have a meeting as soon as possible one. The meeting was called by the borough president's office, it doesn't matter linda, it doesn't matter who called the meeting. We should have already called meetings. The meeting was called by the borough president's office, specifically for the members of the 79th street block association and the people who are immediately in the immediate area who are impacted. We were asked the two co-chairs of bci and the co-chairs of hhs were invited period. It was it happened within three days of it because dhs wasn't available one. The biggest issue here is: not anybody dropping the ball, not helen, not this is not something that happens in a vacuum. This is dhs doing the same thing. That dh does- and I called the comptroller's office and they don't even have copies of the contracts. So they don't know there are no rfps in an emergency, so they don't even know who got who's getting paid, how much why they chose, which groups to come here. Nobody consulted with the neighborhood. This would have been an ideal neighborhood for families that are out on the boonies in laguardia to be here and with access to parks for their kids, and it's not happening so we were invited to one meeting. One meeting mark was surprised of mark and helen and were apprised of they were. Let's say who signed the check. Mark and helen were prized of the belclair and people coming to belcher. Three days three days before everybody was moved in nobody consulted hey, wouldn't this be a great place to have like especially the lucerne. They have two and three bedroom suites. So you know, and so it's a missed opportunity as shelly was talking about, but I don't think anybody dropped the ball. It's ghs doing dhs covert things. They make the decisions, they don't consult and if I could just add on to that, please because barbara, I don't think we dropped a ball at all. If we held a meeting without having had our first meeting with dhs, we would be holding a meeting in an in an environment with a great deal of venomous and no information to share. Only after we got to a point where we I my hope is that we have a second meeting with dhs before this meeting. I'm trying to put together occurs and I'm not I'm not certain. What who the right people are to bring to that meeting I mean I would love for it to be dhs, but I have no hope as shelly was saying, I have no hope that they'll engage on that level. It was all that the borough president could do to get dhs to come to the meeting that she was able to put together with the other electeds. There is, and then there's also a need for having a little bit of experience so that we can, I mean, obviously the experience has been troubling, but there was a need for a need for a basis of information, we're now getting to a point where I think we have that and if I was interpreted before as demonizing the shelter clients or demonizing the folks who are in need, I apologize for speaking badly because that wasn't the last thing that I intended to do while acknowledging that there are difficult circumstances to deal with and trying to make that better. That's what I've been trying to do, that's what the electives have been trying to do I've. I communicated that once I had information to share with the full board, I did it. I will continue to work on that with you and with all of us, but one of the one of the really realities is that dhs wouldn't come to a 50 board member meeting with all of us present, and so I expanded the list. As far as I could based on being invited myself- and I think I did the right thing- but I am happy to receive that criticism, but that's where that's where we are and now we're, hopefully in a position to do to take the next step and so working on this is a stepwise situation. I'll shut up now, okay, hi, I'm not going to repeat what has already been said about this being a very hyper local manifestation of a systemic problem. I totally agree with that. What I will also echo is the fact that crimes are being committed, but that they're not being dealt with shelley touched upon it. Others have touched upon it, but, for instance, I don't understand why NYPD needs to have an officer right there, while a drug deal is happening in order to make an arrest. You know these are like really ridiculous issues again: systemic that are just hamstringing us even more in a very difficult situation, and I just want to I you know- there's been a lot said about writing letters or having meetings. But what are we doing as a community board in terms of action? And I don't really see any of that. For instance, I'd like to know more about the outreach. That's been done with the business community and I'm not just talking about the restaurants or the shops, but also like the halal cart guys. The new stand guys, you know what do they want? Are they getting organized at all or not? There was a. There were a couple of slides that were shared the other night at the boardstat training and they were specific to community board 7 and the homelessness problem, and they showed that the hotspots of a lot of the complaints that have been made to 311 are around broadway, basically up and down broadway. So I believe there was a broadway task force. I was never part of it, but I would like to hear what they have to say about it. Is there? Is there like, maybe some redirecting of their focus? What is their insight into this? You know. It also seems that all these people congregate around scaffoldings, and I know that some scaffoldings are well lit, but I'm sure every scaffolding could be better lit. Why can't we mandate better lighting of the scaffolding, while obviously not being in violation of anything that the city mandates for these scaffoldings? These scaffolding areas are being used as bedrooms bathrooms. You know for all sorts of criminal activities and also another thing at the 79th street block association meeting gail brewer herself announced that dhs was supposed to provide us with at least four of its own police officers, who have the authority to make arrests. But I don't know what happened to that. You know that should be something to be followed up on because they seem to be the only ones with the power to actually do something, and you know, and also I think, all these stores that sell alcohol. I don't know why they can't the alcohol cannot be secured better, whether it's a dwayne reed, whether it's a liquor store. You know. That is something that we can do like. If this is a temporary situation, then maybe we can, as a community board mandate these things. You know just for a temporary period of time. We have to start from somewhere, but I feel like right now. All we're doing is talking about writing letters to people who may or may not listen to us. We may not get to the right people at all, and you know more and more time is passing as september comes more and more families are going to move back into the city. Schools are going to reopen we're losing a lot of time in basically in action. So that's and I also wanted to address the issue of NIMBY-ism. Somebody talked about it and this is my backyard, but you know what I've been having conversations with people who come into work in my backyard, like the woman who takes care of the 77th street playground on amsterdam, you should go talk to her about how she was harassed and literally chased out of the playground in tears by some man who came in to use the bathroom to just clean himself up from top to bottom. So this is not just about my backyard. It's also about, like other people who are here working to take care of our children, make this community a safer, better place for all of us, so it's not just affecting people who live here. That was all I had to say. Thank you, okay. I thank you natasha anyone else that wants to be heard on this subject before we move on susan yeah. Thank you very much. This is obviously a fraught time for everybody. I was often go back to the the exercise that we did at the Manhattan borough president's office when I was being interviewed for the community board, which is the alpine crash and the demonstration where you know. If you try to figure out what to do by yourself, you'll probably die, but if all of you work together, then you have a better chance of survival. I don't know if everyone did that when they applied I'm a relatively newish member in the group here, but but it seems to me that if we could all sound sort of pollyanna, but if we could all get together as many people as possible, even if a lot of them are angry and let everyone be heard, then we can perhaps all work together to make sure that we all have some input in this and that's what I would hope for is that we would have a meeting that that, ideally, the community board would take a leadership role on setting up. Even if mark, I appreciate that we don't yet have all the information and there is no consensus among the board members. There. Rarely is about what we should do. I mean the same way we did with the museum of natural history. It wasn't our decision to do an expansion. The board was divided on whether or not that was a good idea, but still we held the meetings and we let people be heard. It's the part that upsets me that hasn't been talked about is a lot tonight. Is the frustration in the community that they're not being heard by the community board, and I would like to see that rectified as soon as we possibly could. I think I agree mark. If we wait until the september meeting, it will be really bad, I'm really bad. So I would urge us to have a meeting. That's well advertised me tonight. If this had been on the agenda as something is being discussed, I assure you the attendance would have been different, I'm in philadelphia right now. I've got a lot of family stuff going on, but this issue is really important. I feel so much for the restaurant owners and the business owners that this is like the thing they didn't need. On top of all of it and madeline, you did raise this months ago not weeks ago, and I think it really is it's a time to really for the community board to step up and set up some sort of meeting. One final thought: it saddens me that we have a city agency that won't come to a meeting. I mean what would we do if d.o.t wouldn't come to a meeting? It's just. It's just confusing to me that that's okay, that's it! Thank you! Okay! Thank you, susan! I'm gonna call this issue close now so that we can move on to one last issue at least, but before we close it. I would like to give the last word to mark as to what the steps might be follow. Thank you. The steps going forward are that I'm going to work with the chairs of the right committees, including this one and hhs and yel, to try to set up a meeting that makes sense. It may just be us, it may just be the community board doing it, and that may not be the. I feel strongly that we should have an opportunity to hear from the public, although I don't think holding that meeting this week or the week before, would have been sensible or productive. I'm not certain that next week, it'll be productive. But at this point I think the consensus I'm hearing from this meeting is that we know about what we're gonna know so now's the time so and if that's something that well anyway. So that's where I've been working toward and I will continue to work toward that goal. It may and if I can get either the service providers or the or the or the dhs to attend or the elections to attend, then so much the better, because we'll have more sources of information, so I'll commit to working on that and try to have something available for as a final decision the next day or maybe two with enough information going forward the the other. So that I think, is our next step, and I don't think that there's any other next step that we can take at this point. That would be consistent with how we're going to approach these things yeah. I I'm still called to try to answer the well. No, I it! I guess I'll leave it there. I mean I'm still obviously conflicted about a number of things that we've that have been said and but I'll try to deal with that in a more productive way than this. Thanks mark, I think I think, susan's everybody's, you know we hear everyone's frustration. We have one more thing: we're going to talk to david honor because he's a restaurateur who's dealing with a different issue about his seating, and I took some photos that we'll put up now if we want to see fred's open. I remember when fred was just opening in the late 1990s, with larry, johnson and fred, so his incredible golden retriever so anyway, getting back to this whole thing. We've the reason why, susan to answer your question, this was a bci special meeting specifically for a one item agenda and we have the other issues that we thought would be pertinent to would be pertinent to the restaurant tours and we didn't we weren't going to have a meeting until september. So we wanted to answer your question natasha. So we thought a letter talking about how it was impacting the businesses the retailer and the restaurants would be as effective as we can be on a again, an advisory group. It's a community board, we're not elected officials. Now we're looking at press. If I could just real quick in the interest of open meetings, I think it would have been really useful to have it on the agenda with a better description of what it was going to be, so that more people could have been involved. I think people are really interested in how this affects the businesses. Okay, I don't agree with you. That's fine, okay! This was a committee meeting david iran all right. Well, my issue seems very silly after listening to the a very important issue- and I have a heavy heart after listening to it very heavy heart, I've worked in the upper west side since 1994, so it's most of my adult life. So it's I love the upper west side. I love the community. I love the people I'm affected by everything you guys talked about tonight, so it's a very heavy heart that you know it's. I hope I wish I was smart enough to solve it all it's just it really. It makes me very sad anyway, so the city has allowed the roadside seating. As we all know, I have a for the past 23 years. I've had a sidewalk cafe. I cannot do anything in front of amsterdam because I have the bike lane and then I also have a turning lane. What I do have because fred's actually starts in amsterdam and else down 83rd street, I'm actually in three separate buildings. So right where you see the the mail truck right there, I would like to do some seating actually a little past that there's a there's, a someone just changed the angle, but the perfect there's a red sign just to the top left of the mail truck. That's no standing, no standing anytime, so you can sell certify for a roadside cafe. I if I self-certify it's a lie, because self-certify means that I've met all the requirements. I can't do. I can't get roadside seating because it says no standing anytime. So if I do self-certify first of all, I'm lying and god forbid, someone gets hurt. My insurance will my chart company is not very happy with me right now anyway, but they certainly will not that's a great photo. They will not protect me, and I also will never put anyone at risk like that by putting seating outside illegally. It's just it's not it's not worth it. So I spoke to the children's museum and they said those signs are there because because of the because of them, because busloads of kids would get dropped off and you know when I first opened fred's in 97, you could park on both sides of the street, and that was that way for many years and it got changed and then they changed it back to parking and then they quickly changed it back to no standing. So what I would like to do is take a portion of the no standing. I don't know how far the photo goes down the block. If you can go west on that photo so right there there's a there. You go my right, I don't. I want to go to this tree. So that's my kitchen door right there, the basement kitchen door. They keep moving it. If you look south at that photo is that possible? These are not my photos. Yeah, I don't know someone someone's doing a great job, so that's my kitchen door right there. Next to the blue right to the right of the blue and gray garbage pills, that's my basement door and that's my kitchen. It would actually be makes sense for me to have roadside right there, because I can actually run the food right now. I would I would want to go there and I would want to go east to the tree. That's a little more east and that would give it's the other yep there you go, so I basically want to go from where the flower box ends on this. One. When I say ends I mean, and to that one. So the people going making a left off amsterdam or coming over the fire truck coming down 83rd street would still have more than enough space. I just need some. I need somebody I called d.o.t. They sent me to the borough planner. I called the borough planner they sent me back to d.o.t. I don't want them to change the signs, because what would happen then is someone would park there? What I would like is just basically a letter from an official from an official agency saying that I'm permitted to do this. It would help tremendously you know right now, it's august, it really won't help much in august, because it's hot it's rainy, but in september, if kids do come back to school. I know the schools are open, but I know from some parents they're not coming back, but if they do come back it would be very helpful if I had additional seating on the side, because if you do walk by my restaurant and I do adhere to the six feet- a part rule. So you know I don't have as many seats as I normally would with my side, one with my normal sidewalk cafe. So I need help. I need just someone with common sense to say this makes perfect sense for this restaurant owner to do this, but I keep getting bounced around and you know I have some people helping, but again I'm getting ping pong back and forth. So thank you. So I reached out to the only expert in this that I know and that's andrew ridgey, who was kind enough to respond from the wilds of the adirondacks about this. I also reached out to the department of transportation earlier today to say: is there an opportunity to change the street, the no standing to something that would allow you to use that space? I haven't heard back from them, yet they're, usually pretty good, so hopefully by midday tomorrow, I'll hear something but but to your larger point of rather than changing these the parking regulations and as I understand it, the parking regulations are there in order to facilitate people going to the children's museum of Manhattan, which of course, isn't even open right now and that there will be plenty of room down the block even after using the space that you propose. So my question to andrew ridgie was how do how do we get a waiver? How do we get some sort of permission, and he said the system is not really developed or devised for waivers well, yeah and in one sense all of us asked them to make this a turnkey streamlined operation, so that restaurateurs would not have to sit around waiting for city agencies to take action. Hence the self-certification thing all the respect in the world, for you not fudging the rules, but instead trying to live within them, but but, but apparently, and I'll continue to work on this with the DOT who are the arbiters of permission. Along with our chair, I involved the co-chairs of our of our transportation committee on this to see if there is in some way one way or another. We can do this because you deserve the opportunity that everybody else is taking advantage of, but unfortunately, the sensible solution that you're proposing is not within the capacity of the people. You want to act on your behalf. To do so. We'll try to find another way to to screw in this light bulb right. Well, I appreciate it. Obviously, you guys again have much bigger things to deal with and I tried not to. I tried to just handle this myself, but I've you know come up against the wall, so any help or advice or assistance would be greatly appreciated, and I commend you all for all that you're doing for the community again having worked here now for 26 years. This is very hard times indeed and trying to stay positive, and you know silly as possible whenever that permits, but thank you all for all that you're doing, and you know once in a while. I get a customer that yells at me. So I can imagine you know some of the some of the people who are contacting you and are angry. I'm sorry that you have to deal with that and again. Thank you all for your support. It's really sincerely and humbly appreciated. So thank you. Thank you, david and thank you barbara's, the one who brought it to our attention that you were going to be here tonight. So thank you, barbara adler. You didn't you, sir. I hate to ask you a question, but should we write a letter to you, I've already written to DOT in the nature of a question not in the in an advocacy position, but we could write a letter because we had our resolution in January on June 2nd. So that is if we had to write a letter we could thank you. I think steven brown wanted to. I think you've got one of the last words stephen. I know you wrote that you wanted to say something well, look I I'll just share that. I wanted to take a moment to support mark and, to a certain degree, defend him. You know in all my conversations with mark he's been very kind and supportive of when we've talked about and empathetic to these people and if it came across wrong, I wanted to be a second person to defend him and not have him defend himself and in all my conversations he has always been willing to listen and evolve his position. So that's what you need in the leader and if you thought this was the right thing to do now. I think the biggest thing to focus on is now that it looks like we're going to have a meeting, so you know it's to make these decisions is never easy and- and I just wanted to take a moment to say that I thank you steve, thank you for before we go. I want to say also I share sd sentiments. You know I support mark for the same reason that steve just said. I also want to. I want you all to keep in mind that we are understated of emergency. So a lot of things that the government will do the city will do they're going to be doing them without consultation, as we saw and as it already has happened, and I think the best opportunity we have to be able to have any anything positive come out is to have that work that working group going so that the working group, if the working group is established, it will be a means of communication between dhs, the the service providers and the community and and, as we know, mark is working on that. So we just have to wait now and see what happens? It's that's great, peter real, quick. I missed the last number of minutes. I guess 20 minutes whatever, because I got called downstairs because there was a woman acting out on the street and I know of her and have dealt with her and just want to say, as you develop a protocol for down. There need to keep us in mind north of 96th street we've been dealing with these issues for decades and for the most part, it's not a problem, except when it becomes a problem. I mean we've got a lot. We've got a lot of families up here and a lot of kids and a number of people with mental health issues and the whole system needs to be looked at and we need to support our local providers and maintain some contact with them so that they hear what we're seeing also so just feeling like that would be a real help right now. Thank you also before we go I'd like to congratulate peter on the open, amsterdam students on saturday for for restaurants to be on the street between 97th and 110th, and there were some issues, but I'm sure that going forward that things can be can improve will probably continue to be some issues, but thank you for coming out christian. It was it turned out towards the end of the day. It was really beautiful. There was still some loud music that wasn't intended, but other than that it was, it was really nice at the end of the day. So, oh well, okay, thanks come back out this. It's every saturday through October thanks. Can you do that below 96th street? They won't. Let me they won't. Let me they they're trying to I had to I mean we were christian. We were slow opening up because of problems between 97th and 96th street right. We hadn't given us that, and finally, we just took it with the police and now they've acknowledged that they should have done that from the beginning, but that it took the police and us working together on that. So, anyway have a good evening. Everyone. Thank you. Thank you for your work. I think that I think doug had asked a question doug. What was your question? I said that you recently survived a fire at your establishment too. So I just wanted to point that out. You've been through a lot of hardship. Lately, sorry and that's okay, nobody got hurt we're starting to and that's by far the main thing. If anybody got hurt, I wouldn't have gone back because I just the karma wouldn't have been good. We are starting to slowly rebuild. Obviously, Covid-19 has slowed that all down and you know they've had some contractors come in that don't wear masks, so I not very politely ask them to leave so you know we are starting slowly and you know I remain hopeful. I remain hopeful, so fingers crossed that I've had a good relationship with my landlord, so we're going to have the difficult conversation very soon and I'll know much more in the very near future. I believe so, but thank you all again. Okay, thank you! All everybody and I guess we'll wait to hear from mark. We are going to write. I am going to prepare a letter about the sweat over as they all have it. Bci will have it next week to review susan if you'd like me to send it to you, because you're in a fantastic editor I'll be happy to do so in an honorary bci person. But you know this is a neighborhood. This is a remarkable neighborhood. When I moved here in 77 I was the music therapist at kirby hospital at Manhattan state psychiatric center, and I all of my patients were at the endicott. We had the bridge we had. We had services psychiatric services that made it feasible. So when you put at-risk populations into a neighborhood without services, they're going to be issues and dhs should have consulted with us, and that's we that's really what the issue's all about and- and I think it's a travesty- that more families couldn't have been here who were also homeless and they're out by laguardia airport, with no access to transportation. It just should have been done better, and maybe it will be because who knows when Covid-19 how long kobe is going to be going on when we asked dhs how a temporary was they couldn't answer because none of us know anyway, the most important thing is everybody, be safe, wear, masks and we'll wait to hear from you mark and and we're all with you. Okay, thank you. Thank you all for coming tonight. Bye. Thank you good night. Thank you. Everybody.
