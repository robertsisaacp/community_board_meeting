It's, an application of renewal for casa mexicano at 898, amsterdam avenue We wanted to meet, so we could really work with another restaurant to help them out So. It's not open all that late!
You, know restaurant method of operation, we're talking about 35 to 45 seats, reasonable closing hours for your neighborhood recorded background music.
The next discussion actually might be interesting for you we're going to talk about the sweat law,, that's being resurrected by our state, assembly, woman, linda rosenthal, The restaurant's really egregious, especially it's always been.
Is: Will people use this as undo leverage to almost for lack of a better term extort An owner into you know putting a lien on someone's personal assets and homes when otherwise they have some protection through a corporate veil and force?
What we're talking about is a letter coming from the business and consumer issues, committee of community board, seven saying that we are very much against it if we're very much against it, which is why we're having this discussion.
And, we incorporate everyone's edits and we will send it to you, of course, as we always do, but the language will be coming from the business and consumer issues, maybe okay, rover and then michelle It's an alarming letter kind of draconian, but It's a warning to unscrupulous restaurant owners and the abuse of employees, and if we consider the history of restaurant workers over the years, you have to take into account that these scenarios are very real.
And and we're very happy to hear that you have the community support and that you have no intentions of abusing your employees, but I think it's punitive, and not only that most restaurants today have digital time clocks , it's very difficult to rip off an employee, as it was very much.
I'd be okay with that, but just because you know people have to be innocent until they're proven guilty, and the fact is that there are a lot of litigious employees and there are many more employees than there are owners and the So I'd be in support of something that was rewritten, but I.
We're getting reports of aggressive panhandlers, which is which obviously is discouraging diners on the street, and so we've got some issues And we want it's, not that we are a native, a community.
The drug deal go down on saturday, so on broadway in 79, so we've got some issues, so I think again we're going to write a letter.
As soon as we learned about this, which was after it was a done deal as I think everybody knows, we set to work trying to address the issues as they came.
We've been working with the NYPD to try to enlist their help, especially with respect to things like drug dealing, and some of the answers are not the answers that you'd want to hear the NYPD that there is private security, that is, that is contracted by the service providers.
One is contemplating a communication by email using our email blast to the wider community to try to share some of these things as well, not because this is going to be the information that everybody wants to hear, but because we should be sharing it and then in part Well and then the question is whether I hold, or we hold a a specific meeting about this with the community at large and while It is important that as accurate information as possible, as is conveyed, there are aggressive incidents of aggressive behavior, for example that have been happening in our in our district, but that we don't have any reason to believe happened with respect to shelter.
They got here somehow, and so there are people who are preying upon vulnerable populations in that way, and that is destabilizing not just for the shelter clients, but for the community around or I.
It would be a lever to say that they needed to behave in a way that you know we would hope for our community, but it is emerging that active drug use, for example, is not a disqualifying event with respect to the shelters.
Okay, I met with the police, today, okay, You know you can hear the conflict in my voice too, because I want to be compassionate And I want to be appropriate, but I also want to have the right answer for our community and it doesn't appear as though anyone is owning the predictable collateral consequences of these actions.
The second thing: the police hands are tied for any quality of life issues in our community.
If people concerned about issues, they should bring it up with their elected officials, and you know question why there was no process with the community and that the services hardly can be provided properly to 283 people at the lucerne 288 people at the belclair, but that that's not the resident's fault.
If we're going to have a community meeting, I think that we can have the two precincts and Manhattan north commander come and speak.
I think it's important that the community board has some type of forum before september comes because people expect it.
The last thing, I want to say is: There are two issues: here: two major issues: There are street homeless, which we've had for a long time and the numbers have increased and then there's the shelter people and to distinguish who's doing what is very difficult for most people, there's.
So well, I said a lot, but I think we have to be mindful of the broader situation, who's responsible for it It's not the homeless, people who are brought up from other shelters who are responsible for the fact that they're there and the fact that they do not have they can't get their services properly in this highly concentrated, overloaded, hotel, situation.
Let me just interject, because steve brown has his hand, please, with the discussion that he and I had earlier, and I had suggested that hhs and yell, because they deal with families, and it was you know and pertinent to them that they write a letter, because bci's focus had to do with the local businesses that are so challenged right.
This was the bci meeting that had been called as an emergency in order to address an application, and then we discuss this, but I'm, going to call on steve brown now, because I know that you want to discuss this too.
So I'll just leave it at that, but I think that we should be communicating to dhs that the upper west side welcomes people that need help, but we want them.
That would be my a major theme of what I think should be going out to the community to the people into new york.
The meeting was called by the borough president's office, specifically for the members of the 79th street block association and the people who are immediately in the immediate area, who are impacted.
You know for all sorts of criminal activities and also another thing at the 79th street block association meeting gail brewer herself announced that dhs was supposed to provide us with at least four of its own police officers, who have the authority to make arrests.
We may not get to the right people at all, and you know more and more time is passing as september comes.
Somebody talked about it, and this is my backyard, but you know what I've been having conversations with people who come into work.
Also about, like other people who are here working to take care of our children, make this community a safer, better place for all of us.
But it seems to me that if we could all sound sort of pollyanna, but if we could all get together as many people as possible, even if a lot of them are angry and let everyone be heard, Then, We can perhaps all work together to make sure that we all have some input in this The community board would take a leadership role on setting up.
Are that I'm going to work with the chairs of the right committees, including this one and hhs and yel, to try to set up a meeting that makes sense.
We have one more thing: we're going to talk to david honor because he's a restaurateur who's dealing with a different issue about his seating, and I took some photos that we'll put up now if we want to see fred's, open.
If I could just real quick in the interest of open, meetings, I think it would have been really useful to have it on the agenda with a better description of what it was going to be, so that more people could have been involved.
I need just someone with common sense to say this makes perfect sense for this restaurant owner to do this, but I keep getting bounced around You know, I have some people helping, I, also reached out to the department of transportation earlier today to say: Is there an opportunity to change the street, the no standing to something that would allow you to use that space?
You know in all my conversations with mark he's been very kind and supportive of when we've talked about and empathetic to these people and if it came across wrong, I wanted to be a second person to defend him and not have him defend himself and in all my conversations he has always been willing to listen and evolve.
I think the biggest thing to focus on is now that it looks like we're going to have a meeting.
We've got a lot of families up here and a lot of kids and a number of people with mental health issues and the whole system needs to be looked at and we need to support our local providers and maintain some contact with them so that they hear what we're seeing also so just feeling like that would be a real help.
