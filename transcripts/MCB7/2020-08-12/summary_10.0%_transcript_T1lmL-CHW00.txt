You want to weigh in here and talk about it from the perspective of a restaurant, an owner So what many restaurant owners have said to me- and I think rightly so- is that this law goes too far because it lacks it's so so the issue is that there are people that would take advantage of this and could use the employees The issue.
Also What we're talking about is a letter coming from the business and consumer issues, committee of community board, seven saying that we are very much against it if we're very much against it, which is why we're having this discussion This committee agrees that we all collectively think it's a bad idea and punitive and at a time that's really bad.
You know it's interesting that during the banking crisis in 08 and 1907, goa did the same thing with the banks and and we're very happy to hear that you have the community support and that you have no intentions of abusing your employees, but I think it's punitive, and not only that most restaurants today have digital time clocks , it's very difficult to rip off an employee, as it was very much It's not if they pass this law.
It's awesome on personal property like if you own, a condo or whatever you own, you can put a lead on anything If. What george is saying, I'm going to have a look at the law just for my interest, I'm supporting the committee but I- think if you're talking about the manager candy, no, that you know no but I, agree with the committee's outrage and that the committee should send a nice letter.
This is an issue where I think that, to the extent that the community board seven speaks at all, it needs to speak with one voice So several of us, including especially well, not especially but including me, have been spending an awful lot of time, trying to make headway with the service providers, with the elected officials with block associations a whole panoply of folks who are trying to respond to this, and with the service providers we've been engaging both with their security folks, as well as their programming folks trying to make sure For example.
We've been working with the NYPD to try to enlist their help, especially with respect to things like drug dealing, and some of the answers are not the answers that you'd want to hear the NYPD that there is private security, that is, that is contracted by the service providers.
Simply saying that this is what is the challenge we face and the police are diminished in their ranks both because their budgets have been cut and because they have a number of other challenges that they they are prioritizing and so working with them to try to expand the perimeter of whatever it is that the private security will reach has been a challenge for sure the the elect There was a meeting last thursday, which was the first time that many of us got to speak and the co-chairs of hhs and bci were on that Thank you as well as a couple of our other colleagues who were invited in their other capacities in the community, not necessarily because they were cp7 members with a wide number of constituents involved and several electeds showing up in person and their staffs as well as other staffs and d A and dhs was there as well as the service providers, dhs started to answer some questions and work with folks.
Try it again, just in case that prey upon the shelter clients, We, know that the drugs are illegal and that they weren't provided by the shelter so there are people who are preying upon vulnerable populations in that way, and that is destabilizing not just for the shelter clients, but for the community around or I.
Why this election is so important that you hear us Then I thought it was been an outside restaurant Listen to me for once or listen to a black person who knows what they're talking about They have no means to live a better life.
Project renewal, help USA, The police are going to act on it If people concerned about issues, they should bring it up with their elected officials, and you know question why there was no process with the community and that the services hardly can be provided properly to 283 people at the lucerne 288 people at the belclair, but that that's not the resident's fault It's, just very poor planning on health and human services.
So we can't make assumptions about people because of what they do, but we can you The. Only avenue we have is to report things that we find and expect that the police will work with the service providers and with and with the elected officials So. It's not a community advisory board.
So well I, said a lot, but I think we have to be mindful of the broader situation, who's responsible for it and it's not the homeless people who are brought up from other shelters who are responsible for the fact that they're there and the fact that they do not have they can't get their services properly in this highly concentrated, overloaded, hotel situation It's pretty clear at this point that the hotels accepted for business reasons to accept the program into the community He had an opinion and was part of the discussion with that in mind and that it's clear that there's data related to incidents all public publicly available on the boardstat tool.
and I had suggested that hhs and yell, because they deal with families, and it was you know and pertinent to them that they write a letter, because bci's focus had to do with the local businesses that are so challenged right now , This was the bci meeting that had been called as an emergency in order to address an application, and then we discuss this I was talking to a couple committee.
You know the issues would simply would be to my the committee So I'm, going to formally request and or support that meeting, and if that does so, then I think it would be much more impactful on that level The challenge that I see with government in particular dhs, is their methodology and way they do things.
So I'll just leave it at that, but I think that we should be communicating to dhs that the upper west side welcomes people that need help, but we want them appropriate A family shelter in that area would be so much more appropriate kids and mothers and other ones would be more appropriate and we should be focusing on the dialogue of let's get the appropriate people here.
It, also seems that all these people congregate around scaffoldings You know for all sorts of criminal activities and also another thing at the 79th street block association meeting gail brewer herself announced that dhs was supposed to provide us with at least four of its own police officers, who have the authority to make arrests.
Somebody talked about it, and this is my backyard, but you know what I've been having conversations with people who come into work in my backyard, like the woman who takes care of the 77th street playground on amsterdam It's also about like other people who are here working to take care of our children, make this community a safer, better place for all of us.
It may just be us, it may just be the community board doing it and that may not be the I feel strongly that we should have an opportunity to hear from the public, although I don't think holding that meeting this week or the week before would have been sensible or productive It may and if I can get either the service providers or the or the or the dhs to attend or the elections to attend, then so much the better, because we'll have more sources of information, so I'll commit to working on that and try to have something available for as a final decision the next day or maybe two with enough information going forward.
The the other We have one more thing: we're going to talk to david honor because he's a restaurateur who's dealing with a different issue about his seating If we want to see fred's open We've, the reason why susan to answer your question, this was a bci special meeting specifically for a one item agenda, and we have the other issues that we thought would be pertinent to would be pertinent to the restaurant tours We thought a letter talking about how it was impacting the businesses the retailer and the restaurants would be as effective as we can be on a again, an advisory group It's, a community board If I could just real quick in the interest of open meetings.
This was a committee meeting david iran After listening to the a very important issue- After listening to it, very heavy heart, I've worked in the upper west side since 1994, so it's most of my adult life It's I love the upper west side , I love the community, I love the people I'm affected by everything you guys talked about tonight.
I need just someone with common sense to say this makes perfect sense for this restaurant owner to do this, but I keep getting bounced around and you know I have some people helping I also reached out to the department of transportation earlier today to say: Is there an opportunity to change the street, the no standing to something that would allow you to use that space?
I think the biggest thing to focus on is now that it looks like we're going to have a meeting.
We've got a lot of families up here and a lot of kids and a number of people with mental health issues and the whole system needs to be looked at and we need to support our local providers and maintain some contact with them so that they hear what we're seeing also so just feeling like that would be a real help.
