Many of you know, I'm running for Manhattan borough, president I'll leave it at that, but I feel like it's really important, to have sort of non- partisan leadership on our committees and in our leadership on the board.
Looking forward to working with you all in hopefully a different capacity in a year's time, but I will remain on the board, but there will be a new co- chair of this committee within a month or two so leaving it at that very good.
And I know that they've done some leg work with the museum and with the Parks Department and with the dog run.
I. Think if we could wave a magic wand and have unlimited budget, there would be a bulldozer that would come in and scrape out all of these rice gravel pieces and put down something rounder like pea, gravel or something more proven like the brownstone screenings from Riverside park.
There were also just a couple of other complaints that there are fewer benches now than there were prior to the renovation, and this has become an issue also with Covid-19 social distancing, that you know, people are kind of one person to a bench or one family to a bench, and there are not enough of them.
The periodic upkeep on the dog runs in Riverside park and said he's great.
We in Bulmur's dog, run started planning how we're going to raise five thousand dollars every two years just to get a dump of the stuff, because it needs to be replenished over time.
Actually I wanted to bring up the issue that elaine herself brought up about people using the grassy area.
This brand new dog run is there, and maybe it's these issues that elaine is highlighting, but frankly, even when during the pandemic, when Park's usage was going up a lot and we did not have this brand new dog run, I did not see that grassy area being used as a dog run ever then.
It seems like there's a small dog's area right next to the garage within the bulmur's dog, run, and I see very few dogs, I'm wondering if elaine knows anything about that and also finally, I'd read this report, maybe last month that the dog run got flooded, Then I want to turn to Matt to see if he can tell us anything about the lawn and enforcement on the lawn, but elaine Second, prior to the renovation.
Steve Simon's, working with our capital team, as well as other people, to see what can be what can be done and the other concerns, as well, with the with the lack of benches in the run, and then you know we're still.
If parks wants to go and close that firmly that might help and then the second not the main lawn that's on 81st street, but that little lawn, that's just to the west of the dog run.
There's, an opening in the fence sort of on the dog run side on the south end all right, we'll take a look at it.
It's raised a little bit and the dog got off the gravel and it seemed from watching other people that this is this surface somehow needs to be remedied.
Whoever's got the kitchen action if they could mute unless it's Barbara The only the only other thing I wanted to mention was that we, somebody from 81st street, sent us a video of all the little dogs that are using the the grassy area right now outside of the dog run.
It's you know, parks enforcement, does a lot of education and before they start issuing summonses out to people That doing education when there's a very large sign in English, which is the prevalent language here, that says, law enclosed.
First hi This is Peter Arnson from the Columbus Amsterdam bid, and I just wanted to say that a couple of organizations up in our neck of the woods have taken things into their own hands or they used to the morningside dog run used to be run They would get material from parks and spread it It seemed to work fairly.
I do not know whether that's a possibility, but it would be a fast way of dealing with things if the rice gravel could be put into what are called gator bags, which are large, two yard bags and parks could take it.
Brownstone chips, which I was involved in a long time ago, are soft, but my understanding is they're porous, and so they absorb a dog pee and bacteria And they're, not as sanitary as Pea, gravel or whatever else, and the last point is our group went to other dog runs to see what was going on Riverside at 72nd, clary, near you, Carl, Scherz and tompkins square, and guess what most of them are as hard as a rock and sand.
That's, not a great place to put a dog run, people like to be in the sunshine, especially in New York City, where we all live in canyons.
It would be wiser to think about the ecology of the site and how people are going to interact with that, and it probably would have been better to put native plants that, like to shade and that, like moisture to grow in that site, rather than trying to re- engineer.
It was when CB7 actually had a resolution on the dog run, where we were supportive of the renovation, but we urged that public money going into it be limited.
Had not planned on it anyway, but I think we all want to really encourage, as Matt suggested that dpr is taking this real seriously and working with the dog Second comment on the three dog runs : I visited You know that Karl schers and tompkins square and Riverside We're all financed with private funds, Ten years ago.
Nobody quite knows what happened, but that the plants are not set in stone that we can still potentially do the plants that we want to do, which would have made a nice green year- round green evergreen hedge in the front of that area- These are the trees that we had in mind.
She expressed some concern that, if the trees get too bushy that it might bother people who are sitting on the benches there And, but we said it's not really an issue because, with a hedge trimmer, we can easily take care of that And I think we were all really happy that the bull moose people and the people from parks and from 81st street and from the friends of Roosevelt Park all seemed to be on the same page that we all wanted to do something that could help Bonnie had a few questions.
Are, you anticipating any kind of tree pits or how would because that's , know that some of the people who use the dog run want to have it maintain its largest possible square footage for dog use?
Like I said you know, This is looking looked, in, is being looked into by numerous people who have a lot more expertise in this area than we do , I mean Matt or Peter, or somebody else may have other things to add about this right now.
I think the only other thing that I would add is that if the proposal moves forward and working with parks, we would just want to make sure that our security group is involved in the next meeting, so that we can coordinate if the if the plantings are going in and ahead shape, to make sure that the line of sight is appropriate for for our security in the area.
So you know this is just something that we're exploring with friends of theodore Roosevelt on the dog run, and it's something that we'll continue to meet and talk.
I know only one thing from what you said about the noise you'd only want 81st, street.
All the time, and I deal with it, because that's part of living in this city I just want to say a few, a few specifics first and answer Elizabeth to you, because I I've been around the 20 years since the park, renovation of the planetarium went up, and I.
I, think that's the Planning Board 81St Street, the friends, the museum anyway, two other specific observations in terms of the size of the dog run and how it would net down this dog run is 13,000 square feet Second, observation is because we have too much history on this Jan Applebaum Said: Is there an alternative, such as putting up noise, reducing panels in front of or on the garage wall?
Talking about this dog run, I agree with Elizabeth It's a sort of a lot of time on this dog.
The approach for our committee for the DNS is going to be to identify and just try tonight to just come up with some items that occur to us areas within our purview of parks and environment that have been impacted by Covid-19 Our district needs statement.
From cindy I do not think it's fair to ask somebody to chair that committee So we're just really looking for ideas here of ways in which Covid-19 has impacted our, as I said, our parks and environmental issues, and I'm just going to run down a list of some.
You hear this list, you'll know that, like a month ago, three weeks, ago, the situation was one thing And now, there's sort of some programs are coming back and there's more money.
People are not taking public transportation and they're, using primarily Riverside park, but other routes as well to get where they're going, and we started seeing more and more electrified vehicles of various sorts in our parks competing with pedestrians on pedestrian paths before Covid-19 The next issue.
We need to have make sure that, especially when it comes to transportation, which you know, I, think you know we can differ on how we feel like mass transit is being served right, now.
I, think many of us feel like that is the most green way to get people around.
So, it's not just us, but it, but it's particularly dramatic in New York, where so many people are avoiding mass transit, and We have a very substandard route between 72nd, Street and 81st street, which we've collectively called the rosenthal bypass, and there have been problems with it It's very unfortunate that this is coinciding with a dramatic increase in bicycling and also south of that This terrible pinch point that if you do not ride a bike, here, I do not know about it, but it has narrowed the bike path to half of its width and pedestrians and cyclists are sharing what was once the bike path and cyclists are literally going almost handlebar to handlebar passing each other, and I understand that's supposed to go away in a week or two, but it's been.
Seen of the parks is that they're all heavily used and there's a desperate need, for you know getting people involved with spreading compo , not spreading, compost, spreading, mulch or potentially even weeding.
Talked about some volunteer efforts at in the parks like tree stewardship, and in my conversations with Riverside park, conservancy, I learned that they used to have these kinds of programs.
Church groups and school groups come in, but none of that they can do in the times of Covid-19 because they said that kind of work involves people getting very close to each other.
So sorry was nice enough to put me in touch with Kristen Mead, who is the volunteer coordinator at Riverside park conservancy, because this issue started specifically with Riverside park, and I had a conversation with her You know a lot of what she told me was very sort of instinctual things that we've been discussing in over the summer in various meetings.
One thing that she clarified for me was that Riverside parks, conservancy, is mainly responsible for landscaping, but it is the parks Department that is responsible for trash collection and over the summer, for all, for due to budget slashing bin flipping within Riverside park was cut down from three times a day to two or maybe even one time, a day, and that's why these trash cans were overflowing and as a result of that, they decided to reach out to the public kind of, in a way that you know they had not really done.
In, like people will walk their dogs, but then you know, have a trash, grabber and one hand and a plastic bag and a in another hand and then collect you know by the time they're done walking their dog.
If people are interested for a hundred bucks, you know get like your friends together and go spend a few hours in the park.
She also said it would be really helpful to educate people on taking their trash out with them like not to even use the trash cans within the park, because they just get filled up very quickly.
She said that the problem is most dire between 120Th and 150Th Street, where people come in to and so there's a lot more trash and probably different kind of trash that collects more over there.
It involves a lot more capital, projects, also, but everything I, believe, 120Th, Street and above You, know and be supported by a Riverside park in terms of gloves and garbage bags, but they're highly encouraging people and they've actually seen a significant uptick in people just arriving at the park with their own materials and collecting trash.
Who manages Riverside park, but my impression in the past was that Dpr did trash cleanup, but these these special events, the charitable ones and others were things like the.
All these things, plus, you know just more people in the parks.
Looking around the city, I'd like to think that Riverside park is actually a much cleaner park than many of the places you may see around the city.
The people on the upper West side are very good about trying to do the right thing about trying to use the trash cans about trying to take the litter with them about being responsible after picking up after their dogs, I'm, very fortunate to have the good neighbors around the upper West side as community partners and to help keep roadside park clean.
Think we wanted to bring you in to have this conversation tonight to make sure that if there's anything, we could do as a community board to support you.
The last thing we have always on our agenda is just updates on committee business and we've overlapped a lot of that already, but we do have some projects, particularly in Riverside park, to talk about briefly and Ken. Well, I had one other compost alternative on sundays, from 12 to 1, on West 90th street, between Columbus and Amsterdam, the the sidewalk outside of the community garden, the West side, community garden, they're, collecting, compost, starting yesterday; compost, not Organic, right, yes, just food scraps They asked me to spread the word.
That was an essential component, but that was never bid The. Maybe since our last meeting, maybe I do not know if there's been any update, there, but just at 72nd in the area again in Riverside, where there's been a change in how people are looking at the or how the parks has opened playing fields right that has happened.
Guys, Jake look out because next thing you know somebody's going to try to recruit you for the community.
