Since there are so few people on the call, I, don't know if we've opened it up to participants but for anyone I will be leaving this committee in the coming months.
Many of you know, I'm running for Manhattan borough, president I'll leave it at that, but I feel like it's really important, to have sort of non-partisan leadership on our committees and in our leadership on the board.
Looking forward to working with you all in hopefully, a different capacity in a year's time, but I will remain on the board, but there will be a new co-chair of this committee within a month or two so leaving it at that very good.
We will certainly miss cindy, but it means we've got all of our committee members on now and a couple of other board members and we have matt genrich, who is the park manager for a whole lot more than roosevelt park, but including roosevelt park?
It was my intention to come to a community board 7 meeting and thank you for all your support of the run and to have a big ribbon cutting, but Covid-19 19 seems to have postponed that so the issues with the run- You know this being a public amenity.
I, think if we could wave a magic wand and have unlimited budget, there would be a bulldozer that would come in and scrape out all of these rice gravel pieces and put down something rounder like pea, gravel or something more proven like the brownstone screenings from riverside park.
There were also just a couple of other complaints that there are fewer benches now than there were prior to the renovation, and this has become an issue also with Covid-19 19 social distancing, that you know, people are kind of one person to a bench or one family to a bench, and there aren't enough of them.
Actually I wanted to bring up the issue that elaine herself brought up about people using the grassy area.
That elaine is highlighting, but frankly, even when during the pandemic, when park's usage was going up a lot and we didn't have this brand new dog run, I didn't see that grassy area being used as a dog run ever then.
It seems like there's a small dog's area right next to the garage within the bulmur's dog, run, and I see very few dogs, I'm wondering if elaine knows anything about that and also finally, I'd read this report, maybe last month that the dog run got flooded, and I was wondering.
And, then I want to turn to matt to see if he can tell us anything about the lawn and enforcement on the lawn, but elaine Either people prefer the larger run.
If parks wants to go and close that firmly that might help, and then the second, not the main lawn, that's on 81st street, but that little lawn, that's just to the west of the dog run.
Don't we hadn't really planned to spend this long on this part of this issue, but we want to air it, and then susan after that, 96 before when peter was we started working with friends, the dog run surface was dirt and the dogs were getting sick Department, we didn't have a budget.
Only the only other thing I wanted to mention was that we, somebody from 81st street, sent us a video of all the little dogs that are using the the grassy area.
It's you know, parks enforcement, does a lot of education and before they start issuing summonses out to people And, that's the reason I wanted to say something was because it seems to me that doing education when there's a very large sign in english, which is the prevalent language here, that says, law, enclosed.
Is, I think, a lot of our problems stem from not taking the ecology of the site into account and in Manhattan square, which is what roosevelt park used to be called was put.
That's, not a great place to put a dog run, people like to be in the sunshine, especially in new york city, where we all live in canyons.
It would be wiser to think about the ecology of the site and how people are going to interact with that, and it probably would have been better to put native plants that, like to shade and that, like moisture to grow in that site, rather than trying to re-engineer nature, is to work with nature rather than against nature.
It was when cb7 actually had a resolution on the dog run where we were supportive of the renovation, but we urged that public money going into it be limited.
Nobody quite knows what happened, but that the plants aren't set in stone that we can still potentially do the plants that we want to do, which would have made a nice green, year-round, green evergreen hedge, in the front of that area- They're called emerald green arborvitae, trees.
She expressed some concern that if the trees get too bushy that it might bother people who are sitting on the benches there And, but we said it's not really an issue because, with a hedge trimmer, we can easily take care of that And I think we were all really happy that the bull moose people and the people from parks and from 81st street and from the friends of roosevelt park all seemed to be on the same page that we all wanted to do something that could help bonnie had a few questions.
Are, you anticipating any kind of tree pits or how would because that's , know that some of the people who use the dog run want to have it maintain its largest possible square footage for dog use?
Like I said you know, This is looking looked, in, is being looked into by numerous people who have a lot more expertise in this area than we do , I mean matt or peter, or somebody else may have other things to add about this right.
So you're talking about planting things in the dog run, yes, behind the benches right between the benches and the fence, so they look beautiful.
I think the only other thing that I would add is that if the proposal moves forward and working with parks, we would just want to make sure that our security group is involved in the next meeting, so that we can coordinate if the if the plantings are going in and ahead shape, to make sure that the line of sight is appropriate for for our security in the area.
I just wanted to congratulate you on the bioswale and the planting there in front of that school there at the thank Those big trees are swamp, white oak trees, those are native to the new york city, area, they're, fantastic trees.
First of all, elizabeth, I, know only one thing from what you said about the noise you'd only want 81st, street.
The approach for our committee for the DNS is going to be to identify and just try tonight to just come up with some items that occur to us areas within our purview of parks and environment that have been impacted by Covid-19 Our district needs statement.
I, don't think it's fair to ask somebody to chair that committee So we're just really looking for ideas here of ways in which Covid-19 has impacted our, as I said, our parks and environmental issues, and I'm just going to run down a list of some.
You hear this list, you'll know that, like a month ago, three weeks, ago, the situation was one thing And now, there's sort of some programs are coming back and there's more money.
People are not taking public transportation and they're, using primarily riverside park, but other routes as well to get where they're going, and we started.
We need to have make sure that, especially when it comes to transportation, which you know, I, think you know we can differ on how we feel like mass transit is being served right, now.
I think many of us feel like that is the most green way to get people around.
So, it's not just us, but it, but it's particularly dramatic in new york, where so many people are avoiding mass transit, and We have a very substandard route between 72nd street and 81st street, which we've collectively called the rosenthal bypass, and there have been problems with it It's very unfortunate that this is coinciding with a dramatic increase in bicycling and also south of that This terrible pinch point that if you don't ride a bike, here, I don't know about it, but it has narrowed the bike path to half of its width and pedestrians and cyclists are sharing what was once the bike path and cyclists are literally going almost handlebar to handlebar passing each other, and I understand that's supposed to go away in a week or two, but it's been.
Seen of the parks is that they're all heavily used and there's a desperate need, for you know getting people involved with spreading compo , not spreading, compost, spreading, mulch or potentially even weeding.
Anything on this any member of the committee or for that matter, the board, or for that matter, the public that The internet check everything that's going on, but that's It's really a priority of of a lot of us this week and just want to call attention to it as the parks and environment committee.
Church groups and school groups come in, but none of that they can do in the times of Covid-19 because they said that kind of work involves people getting very close to each other.
The genesis of this was that we received, I believe, at the community board, some complaints about riverside park, looking very neglected and trash ridden, and that kind of coincided with 3-1-1 complaints about trash in our green spaces.
So sorry was nice enough to put me in touch with kristen mead, who is the volunteer coordinator at riverside park conservancy, because this issue started specifically with riverside park, and I, had a conversation with her You know a lot of what she told me was very sort of instinctual things that we've been discussing in over the summer in various meetings.
Of, in a way that you know they hadn't really done before their plan was to their plan, was to actually do a public outreach where they could get ideally people to come in three times a week during the week, preferably in the late afternoon.
In, like people will walk their dogs, but then you know, have a trash, grabber and one hand and a plastic bag and a in another hand and then collect you know by the time they're done walking their dog.
If people are interested for a hundred bucks, you know get like your friends together and go spend a few hours in the park.
She also said it would be really helpful to educate people on taking their trash out with them like not to even use the trash cans within the park, because they just get filled up very quickly.
She said that the problem is most dire between 120th and 150th street, where people come in to and so there's a lot more trash and probably different kind of trash that collects more over there.
It involves a lot more capital, projects, also, but everything I, believe, 120th street and above You, know and be supported by a riverside park in terms of gloves and garbage bags, but they're highly encouraging people and they've actually seen a significant uptick in people just arriving at the park with their own materials and collecting trash.
So looking around the city, I'd like to think that riverside park is actually a much cleaner park than many of the places you may see around the city.
That the people on the upper west side are very good about trying to do the right thing about trying to use the trash cans about trying to take the litter with them about being responsible after picking up after their dogs, I'm, very fortunate to have the good neighbors around the upper west side as community partners and to help keep roadside park clean.
Think we wanted to bring you in to have this conversation tonight to make sure that if there's anything, we could do as a community board to support you.
The last thing we have always on our agenda is just updates on committee business and we've overlapped a lot of that already, but we do have some projects, particularly in riverside park, to talk about briefly and ken.
The work going on in the northern end of riverside south, which was the first section of the park to be built and over the years, developed a number of number of issues and with usage, it became clear that the area could be better deployed in some ways, so that work started and it started the 14th.
Maybe I don't know if there's been any update, there, but just at 72nd in the area again in riverside, where there's been a change in how people are looking at the or how the parks has opened playing fields right that has happened.
