Is we don't know what the service is going to look like come next May, which is when any service cuts would take effect.
Now, not now, given everything we know and most of importantly, what we don't know, which is what service is going to look like if the feds don't help us there are some good sounds from the incoming administration, but there we are facing a 12 billion dollar deficit and we absolutely must get help.
And since we don't know what the service is going to look like.
For instance, There is one for commuter rail that would do a flat suburban fare and a flat city fare, which means somebody commuting hypothetically from Mineola to Penn station would pay the same as somebody commuting from Montauk, and a lot of people are standing off on that proposal, and you know there are proposals to do away with the time based passes the 7 and 30 day, metro cards, largely because there has been some fraud, one of the board members, as has keeps harping on the fraud, and that means there are people who are vandalizing the Metro card, vending machines, so that you can't buy a metro, card.
I just think we shouldn't be talking fairs now, not when we don't know what the service is going to look.
We, don't know what the service is going to look, like, A, difficult situation, complicated.
We could adopt a resolution saying we don't want a fair increase, I, don't think.
When we know what the service is going to look like, we should have that discussion, but.
We don't think there should be a fair increase, I, I'm saying at this time when we there's so much unknown and people are hurting.
I personally think it's unlikely they're going to come in 100 cents on the dollar, for every dollar of need.
It is true that a new administration is likely to give us a favorable answer, so we can get moving on congestion pricing, which will help the MTA bond towards the 51 billion dollar capital program that has been in held hostage for the past year, because the Department of Transportation did not give the MTA an answer, whether you need an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment or a categorical exemption.
A committee referred to full board and then adopted then, By which time the vote would have already been taken and the letter that you know so then transmitting it would be after the fact.
Okay, when next week is the meeting December, 16th, they're hearings before that or leading up to it, We do have a full board meeting on Tuesday, there's, actually still fair hike hearings after this vote takes place.
And then I can draft the letter and pass it around to everybody for if we're gonna thought resolution that goes through full board, then do we even need a vote or are we, but you can always record it.
What I'm, proposing that we do is we say, that, on behalf of community board, seven in our upper West side community, We right to recommend that no vote be taken on increasing fares for the following reasons.
We're simply going to say this is our opinion, as representatives of our community, which I think we're on solid ground with based on all the things that you guys have proposed about mass transit in the last year and voted on and so forth.
Next item is an issue with regard to 1:10 the intersection of 1:10th in Amsterdam, to allow northbound cyclists to safely cross from the west side of the street to the east side at the traffic light.
We confirmed with our signals, division that they plan to make improvements on Amsterdam, Avenue and 110th street to facilitate the transition for bikes from West side to the east side of the street and we're hoping to have an update in early 2021 on this.
There's, the same condition there, where there's a protected bike lane on the West side, and then you need to cross over to the east side of 8th Avenue.
You know just words, preparing them, I, wonder if it makes sense to switch bikes at 109th street, just so that they're prepared, so that lacrosse isn't at a two-way busy street good idea.
There seems to be a problem in getting from central Park west to Columbus in that area, because there are can correct me at seven streets in a row.
It would be really helpful if there is the ability for cyclists to head west from central Park on 100th street.
Yes, riding a CitiBike from Central Park West to Broadway and was ticketed in front of the 24th precinct.
Yes, it's closer than the 7th street, it's closer to 97th, but there's one at Manhattan and 100 also, and you have a lot of people coming from the east side on CitiBikes coming out of the park at 100th Street and a lot of cyclists who aren't on CitiBikes and want to go west now, As you're saying, Christian.
That would require making a left on central, Park, West or left on Columbus Avenue going to 97th street is a very busy street.
What we can ask for in a number of different things or a couple of different things, I, think at the very least, we should be asking for DOT to legalize going west on 100th street, which is a very common practice in a lot of other cities and countries on one-way streets to allow cyclists to go.
Yeah, the street is very broad from central Park west to Amsterdam.
It doesn't look broad between Columbus and Amsterdam, because there's so much precinct parking there, but it actually is, and if we were able to reduce the amount of parking there, which I think would be I would say, That's a non-starter.
You know it's so much parking, because you have all the angle parking on the street, plus all the double parking that the police cars use.
You know, give up just because we think somebody's going to oppose it, and maybe there are good reasons why it would be good for the police department to have fewer cars.
I, don't know how many people are working at any one time in the precinct or in at the fire department, but there are typically that means there are 40 vehicles being double parked.
I think that could definitely be reduced and a good way to do it would be to put in I mean the other alternative to having, at the very least, We have a one-way contraflow lane and just a lot of cyclists, and there there's room enough for that.
It's, basically, even with the double parked cars effectively a two lane, a two-way one-way street, but we could also ask for a two-way protected bike lane and that you know the police department would have to find something else to do with their private vehicles and it might incentivize them to be less car dependent and rely on Mass transit, Andrew Rosenthal, just put a note in the chat.
Well, we're talking about making a illegal for cyclists from Central Park West to Broadway, but right now we're talking.
Wouldn't it no right, They said he could make its own rules on any passing city, just not give people tickets and do what they're probably doing now, and we have Colleen's opinion on this meeting was noticed.
I've said this so many times there clearly is a need for cyclists to go on 100th street west, but I am not a traffic engineer and to my knowledge, Neither is anyone on this.
I. Think we should ask for the DOT to use their expertise, that we pay high taxes more to figure out a way to make this work for everyone.
I think that going down 100th, street.
I. Just think we should I personally favor asking the DOT to come up with a way for cyclists to get to go west without going significantly out of their way.
I agree with Howard, if just state the goal, which is, if it's feasible, establish that as a as an east to West route, If it's feasible and if DOT thinks it's feasible, Let us have a specific proposal to consider I.
You thanks one of the things that I wanted to interject into this conversation, and it may be off topic so forget or not hitting the point, but I'm reminded of our previous vote in the creation of the Central Park West protected bike lane, which I did support.
And I think was a good thing to add, and the Central Park, West, Bike, Lane I, think is a partial answer to the problem: that's being presented here, which is that if you exit the park at 100th Street, you have an immediate right-hand turn onto that protected bike lane that can bring you to safe crossings.
So I, I'm a little bit curious as to what need we're trying to fill with a hundredth street that couldn't be filled by moving north or south on Center Park West a little bit in order to find safe, passage.
And I think we have to be realistic, that any cyclist who is around 100th street and wants to go to 100th street on the West side or anywhere you know, 102nd or 101st or whatever, is going to go on 100th street.
Think the last of a long list of people that we should be Hocking to use mass transit are the police and the fire.
We're, not talking about where police environment should live, we're just trying to find a simple way for someone on a bicycle to get from central Park, West, 100th Street to Columbus and 100 street.
I, just I would support a call to the D.O.T to look into some more efficient way to allow cyclists to go west on 100th Street have them come back.
We just move on and just agree that we want to ask them if there's a feasible way to improve the East to West Cycling and if there is to let us know what their opinion is.
I. Think we should I have one other suggestion, which is that in the meantime, we asked the 24th precinct to stop suspend writing tickets for a cyclist going the wrong way, because there is no other alternative.
I. Think, given that there are emergency vehicles coming out of the north side of the street, it would have to be along the south sidewalk and a question would be.
Let's ask: Let's have a resolution asking the D.O.T to come up with it with a way for cyclists to safely and safely for them and for everyone else, get from central Park, Western, 100th, Street, all the way west on 100 street.
I think it would make a lot of sense to bring in the NYPD and FDNY and NYCHA to see how they're going to get there, because a lot of officers and employees live outside the boroughs and they do need their vehicles to get to work and protect our neighborhood.
So Barbara, I'm, going to lower your hand, non-committee board members in favor of this resolution.
I, Don't see anybody non-committee board members opposed Paul, Zero Christian has his hand raised.
I think this was the double parking on 73rd street that we heard quite extensively.
This is the one about specifically about 90, I'm, sorry 73rd street, between Central Park, West.
You may remember that there was a some of placard or sign from the NYPD, essentially directing people to double park, on certain streets, 73rd being one of them and Riverside boulevard around the corner, at Riverside, South being another, and my understanding was that the council, member and others were going to try to convene a meeting with the stakeholders to try to and the mosque and a few others to try to figure out how to improve that.
I, Don't think it would be a huge stretch for our board to do piggybacking on what we said in our resolution of almost a year ago to have a resolution saying that our taxpayer dollars should not be being used to for this quality of life problem in our city and in our district in particular, Ken. You may recall a couple of meetings.
And I think we need to make sure that we're keeping you know the networks, Channel 4, Channel, 7 and Fox 5.
Is one and nobody's ineligible non-committee board members in favor, I'm going to say yes to me.
So I don't think we need to spend more time on it, but I'm proposing a resolution once you draft the proposal we'll do it in at the next meeting.
I just wanted to follow Colleen on 72nd Street and the cross park paths for cyclists on those two issues.
Think Mark wanted me to give an update on the West.
Great, So I wanted to let you know that we've had really positive dialogue with Christina and Jessica regarding having the open street on weekends, And. I believe the hours are from 10 a.m to 4 p.m, and we had a conference call today and just to let you know, we stress the need.
We also highlighted that there will be a need to be constant observations shared with DOT and we'll do the same as well provide feedback that we get, whether it's from the community board or other residents right, now, We're, proposing 87th street to 95th, Christina and Jessica reminded us that NYPD wanted us to include wanted us to look at 80 1687, because there was.
You know what in their group, what about everybody else who lives on West End Avenue in that district.
So I understand that Howard, but they didn't call for closing the street between on West End Avenue.
Yeah I did want to note that at a recent committee meeting on this subject, council member Rosenthal was noting that you know she was being asked.
Talking now about the middle of winter, with on a street, that's going to still be open for police cars, fire trucks, school buses, ambulances, delivery, vehicles, garbage trucks.
I mentioned the same thing last month that the cars come off, the West Side highway at 95th Street, and they turn right.
If somebody lives on 68th and west end they're going to walk all the way to 88th street as opposed to walking one block to Riverside, park.
That I do believe that Colleen was asked by multiple city members to by city council people to get involved in this, so I think she's doing what she's told my concern.
There was quite a few people on here who did not want this, and maybe we should have done a rich did because I think.
People I used that when the parks were closed and I think that a lot of the support for open streets are when parks and many things are closed.
And, then I would like to then take some type of vote because I, don't believe anybody's gonna, use, It. I, believe it's a small fringe group of people I think people also have passionate goals of open streets and open things, and.
But, that being said, My issue is that I, don't believe anybody's going to use this I, don't think it should be open.
I want to add to the questions that need answers on this, because we heard a lot about in the meeting a month or more ago.
We were talking about this, We heard a lot about drivers, not observing the barricades or crashing the barricades or being aggressive with and so forth, and so my question I guess goes to Colleen as to whose responsibility will it be to deal with safety on the street, because I'm very concerned about creating an opportunity that appears to be safe, That, isn't, and so as cars are accessing the supposedly open street, especially during the winter, when they might not be expecting to encounter people in that street.
It needs to be made more permanent and we need you know definite, signage, making, clear local traffic only and five miles per hour, and we need to make sure that people on the street are safe so that they're able to go on the street and actually use it and cars, respect that they don't have the right of way during the open street periods.
Cross streets is one thing, but if you're closing off West End Avenue, you need to look at Broadway and Riverside drive as well.
I seem to recall, on the other, when West end was a so-called open, street.
You might want to tell your community sponsors to seek some legal advice, the first time that a car speeds around the barrier that they were supposed to be maintaining and strikes some person who could have been walking on the sidewalk, But it's in the middle of the roadway and relies on it and see if in fact, they're letting themselves in for a liability problem, Because I can tell you if it happened to me they would be the first ones.
And I know that there's been a lot of like opposition and pro for this open, street.
We met on the open street and we did a survey of people who live like we only handed out surveys on West End Avenue, and you know we only wanted to move forward with this.
You- know, trying to find people in the neighborhood who could do this and who are interested in this, and that is why we did a survey and really, Why and honestly like I.
You know I, understand that, like part of this I think, is that in the past you know it was just a street that was closed.
I just hope that people keep an open mind because, as we speak to them, There is like so many opportunities that you know they have Santa Bike rides or they have Christmas caroling with Coco.
This is a big undertaking or you know, I hope people are inspired by what this can be, because it's an opportunity like when I went to Riverside park.
And I hope that people can see the opportunities here and maybe go into it with an open mind and understand that this is, you know.
So, please be very careful about encouraging programming on a street where it is not permitted, and you know where you need a permit.
I, don't know so just think about it.
You know a real need for it in certain situations doesn't apply to park, adjacent areas and the particular area being discussed here really is quite close to both areas and people.
And I can give you that information, but from what I've known personally and you know the community boards email, me- elected officials, email me whenever there's an issue, I have not heard of any problems about 103rd street I.
And I think that information would be most beneficial and relevant to understanding how one would be used on West, Dens Avenue I would be more than happy to have a conversation with you at the side about that, and then we can connect with the maintenance partner for that because, again, A successful open street it.
I, can't understand why it would be better for people who happen to live on wet on west end to congregate in the middle of the street.
I know mark if you can facilitate that or if you want me to send something, I'm just trying to find data, particularly that goes back to the last three years, which I think have been.
Think that you know we have Tri. We, have parking rules for a reason, and it just feels like there are more and more people who are evading the parking rules and store managers at a store that we're not giving it to their competitors.
We should talk to the 24th precinct about that, Yes, I, Don't think you know a manager, but you said employees is it the manager or is it all the employees that get to do this.
, don't know what we want to do about it, but it's not just the electric bikes.
Somebody, basically hit me from behind and left me and just like I, don't feel safe, even going for a run in the park.
Let's see what kind of enforcement they're doing on these electric vehicles we're going to be inviting the central park precinct to come to the Parks Committee in the new year.
We may want to contact the transportation Committee of Community Board and see if they've had reports like this Mr Faisal.
If, you want to come to the Parks Committee meeting, That mark was talking about.
There needs to be a new way to consider how the e-bikes or the scooters exist on our streets, because this current bike lane situation is dangerous for everyone like if it were on the.
