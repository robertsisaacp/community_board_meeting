But we don't have quorum yet. So, let's hope that comes our way. Hi Andrew did you read about Margaret for Germany. Today it was over the weekend. Wasn't it huh? Oh I only saw it today. It was announced a few days ago that that's amazing, that's fantastic I mean when Andrew and I were chairs of transportation. We worked pretty closely with Margaret a long time yeah. Oh, she was terrific yeah and she had that. Wonderful combination of you know looking like a school girl but swearing like a sailor. Sometimes that could really be disarming. You know. I probably shouldn't say that on live stream should I all right, I'm going to start the webinar. So let's start letting attendees in, although Hey Meg, let's see I, don't think you have quorum yet, but so we got seven. Oh, let's see one two three! Yes, you do. You got seven four five, six seven yeah is that a quorum I didn't realize. I was muted yeah. You think I noticed your lips moving yeah my lips were moving yeah, the best of both worlds, hi everybody. Now we got eight and nine. Okay, all right- and it's just exactly so fantastic. This is the December meeting of Community Board Sevens Transportation Committee, I'm Howard Yaris and my co-chair is Andrew Alport and he has the I think the most interesting thing on the agenda so we'll get right into it. You have to unmute yourself Andrew, I'm sorry just to interrupt before you get rolling here. I see that Mr Faisal, I'm probably mispronouncing. That so forgive me, has his hand up. Mr Faisal corresponded with me earlier in the day, and he would like to bring up something that would probably be a new business. It'll have to do with an encounter in central park, so I'm going to lower Mr Faiso's hand right now. No disrespect to Mr Faisal want to let the chairs know that he'll want to speak in new business and but you're welcome. To raise your hand when the chairs call for public comment. Okay, great- and we also have a relatively loud agenda tonight, so you'll probably be coming up pretty quickly, very good thanks Howard, and we need to do an item of business, which is we need to ask if somebody would do the minutes. I can do last month. Oh, thank you. So much thanks. So much Meg, that's fine thanks! So much all right. So the first item on the agenda is something that I think we should comment on. I've commented a lot in the press and one of the other hats I wear. Our members are commenting at the MTA fair hike hearings which are there was one last night there's another one. Tomorrow night they go through December 21st. This is not I. In my opinion, this is not the time to be talking about a fair increase for a host of reasons, not the least of which these are very difficult times. A lot of people have lost their jobs. A lot of people are commuting differently. Some people will continue to commute from the office and work virtually. What we should be doing now is. We should be encouraging people to return to mass transit, maybe with fair incentives. Some inventive pricing I can think of a host of things, but even more important is we don't know what the service is going to look like come next May, which is when any service cuts would take effect. So can you imagine asking somebody to pay four percent more for 40 percent, less, that's just a non-starter in my opinion, and so I would be in favor of us, and I can certainly draft it. I can think of at least 10 reasons why this should not happen now, not now, given everything we know and most of importantly, what we don't know, which is what service is going to look like if the feds don't help us there are some good sounds from the incoming administration, but there we are facing a 12 billion dollar deficit and we absolutely must get help or you know the New York way of life is threatened in my opinion, so I'm willing to hear from anybody but I just think we should sound off on this Andrew yeah. You know I'm all in favor of doing whatever we can to encourage people to come back to mass transit. But do you think that a resolution from CB7 will go anywhere will do anything? A lot of organizations are making their voices heard on. You know just to get it out there, okay, to get it out there and make let everybody know that these are difficult times and since we don't know what the service is going to look like, how can you price it right? Andrew, I, assume there are alternatives to a fair hike, such as, in addition to the 12 billion dollars that we need to get yeah. The fair hike does not is nothing to do with the 12 billion. The fare hike is the regularly every other year scheduled. Four percent yield fare hikes. Oh okay, yes, and there are some fairly inventive and argumentative fair proposals. For instance, there is one for commuter rail that would do a flat suburban fare and a flat city fare, which means somebody commuting hypothetically from Mineola to Penn station would pay the same as somebody commuting from Montauk, and a lot of people are standing off on that proposal, and you know there are proposals to do away with the time based passes the 7 and 30 day metro cards, largely because there has been some fraud, one of the board members, as has keeps harping on the fraud, and that means there are people who are vandalizing the Metro card, vending machines so that you can't buy a metro card and then they are selling swipes and due to the anti-pass back feature, that's on the time-based card, so you can't hand it to a member of your family and let them in after you, there is a 12-minute anti-pass-back feature: they buy a variety of cards and then they just stay there and they buzz swipe. People in I asked about this and I said why penalize everybody when it's just a few bad apples that are doing this? Obviously that you know the time-based cards encourage people to take just trips when they might not have thought of taking a trip it's paid for might as well use the system. I was told by the inventor of Omni that, when somebody with who is passing people through on these metro cards that they've bought with bad intentions, the MTA doesn't find out that there's a host of cards using one particular fair entry area until three days after it's happened with Omni. They will know instantaneously and can lock out a card when they see this kind of activity. So you know to say that we're going to do away with the time-based passes. I know there'll, be an intent to bring them back, but I just think we shouldn't be talking fairs now, not when we don't know what the service is going to look like. Have you done anything? Oh sorry, Jay! No, just so I understand the timing. You say that a 4 bi-annual fair increase four percent yield. Yes well, does that translate to a fair increase? Yes, four percent yield is slightly less than actually four percent. Fair increase. Yes, but is that automatic it's by vote every other year of the board? There are some interesting possibilities, but the vote is happening. December, 16th, that the vote is December 16th. It is not on the service cuts, but they will be discussed of course, and the after the December 16th vote. When would any if there were an increase, when would yes, the new fares would take effect in January, I'm sorry in likely in March, the new tolls would take place in April. Okay, have you drafted anything for this? Do you have a draft letter? I? Don't I can certainly circulate it, but I've. Given you pretty much the points, these are very difficult times. We don't know what the service is going to look like. We should be encouraging people to use the system now and words to that effect. A difficult situation complicated. We could adopt a resolution saying we don't want a fair increase, I, don't think. There's anyone in New, York, City or out of New York City, that is in favor of ferry increase. The question is: how do we give guidance to the powers that be so that they don't have to have a fair increase? No one wants a fair increase. Howard I wasn't going to word it that we don't want a fair increase. I was wording it that due to this- and this is not the time to even talk about a fair increase when we know what the service is going to look like, we should have that discussion, but now we surely yeah. Otherwise you look a little irresponsible. You know obviously right, but then my question is: how do you cure the deficit? How do you fill the? How do you fill the gap so when we know how much service we're going to have, we can talk about the various interest, some of some very interesting options for fare increases. There are some that would take away this feature but add on another feature. There are some that would actually end up reducing the fare, slightly there's just a host of things floating out there, but I wasn't going to say we don't think there should be a fair increase. I, I'm saying at this time when we there's so much unknown and people are hurting. So much is a terrible time to even talk about it, but I'm really, you know more than any of us. If you don't have a fair increase, how do you fill the gap? What are the thought? I'm just curious. What is the Mda thinking? Are you talking about the normal gap or the big gap that has been brought on by Covid-19, because that only the feds can cure, assuming the feds are not going to be there, and even if you know I know, a new administration is coming, the Senate may change, and even if it does, it's I personally think it's unlikely they're going to come in 100 cents on the dollar for every dollar of need. Well, I'm told and I don't know how accurate this is, but I'm told in the new 900 billion dollar House Senate package that is being talked about. Now there is 45 billion on the table for transit, whether the MTA gets the 12 that they need out of that 45 I think 45 also includes Amtrak, and it might even include some airline as well. So it's not clear but I think there is some messaging that we can look forward to something. So we need to know more before we can do all of this. It seems to me, but I just wanted to follow up and say that, assuming what the feds give is not a hundred cents on the dollar of need, yeah and assuming we don't have, we don't want a fair increase. What is the thinking for how to fill that gap? The thinking is, besides an eventual fare increase of some sort. Some new funding sources, such as an increase in the gasoline tax I, know that some of our elected officials are talking about a package tax believe it or not. On every package that gets delivered, I've heard that being thrown around it was an op-ed in the daily news about a year or so ago about how you can raise some money from parking fees to be the subway I recommend yeah. There could be there's even talk of us of a piece of the stock transfer tax, there's all kinds of possible funding being discussed. We can't lurch from crisis to crisis anymore. We just can't I just want a question. Go ahead with regard to the four percent yield. How does that correspond to the collective bargaining with the Twu? And where are we with that? Because clearly, if we are obligated when I say we the state's obligated on the collective bargaining, the expenses are going to go up and yeah, the MTA is talking a freeze and the union's largely local 100 of the transport workers union is saying no way if we do not get the federal funding, they are talking about, laying off 9400 employees, horrendous, just unbelievable and Amtrak is now and some of the commuter rails, because so many people were lost through Covid-19 and they've laid off some temporarily. There's now people that don't know how to drive some trains and so service has been cut because there's no staff now so we're looking at some really horrendous options. Obviously, if we don't get this federal aid Andrew, how does the MTA I mean? They've obviously got continuous operating expenses which now are running at a deficit? Oh yeah, extra cleaning? How do they fund the deficit as or are they doing additional bonding borrowing? What are they doing? Yes, what they? What they've done, and what they're about to do again is utilize, something that's actually reserved for cities and municipalities called the municipal liquidity. What's the last word facility mlf and it allows cities and in this case the MTA to borrow at a very attractive rate, the MTA will be borrowing 3.9 billion dollars from the out from the mlf, which is expected to come in December that'll get us through. You know a couple of months into the next year: okay, yes, the we are almost we are pretty much at the 20 ratio of you know how much all everything we have to do is debt related we're very fast approaching 20, not good, and if that money is borrowed, that means it has to be paid back. You bet now. It is true that a new administration is likely to give us a favorable answer, so we can get moving on congestion pricing which will help the MTA bond towards the 51 billion dollar capital program that has been in held hostage for the past year, because the Department of Transportation did not give the MTA an answer, whether you need an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment or a categorical exemption. They just didn't tell us anything. There is pretty much an inkling that one of the first things the new administration will do, will get us an answer and get that moving, but you won't see the money for about a year right, Andrew. The only thing that I'm first of all I think is a great idea for a number of reasons. Most of which you've already outlined so I won't repeat, but it's also good for this board to be seen as championing this kind of an issue, so I think it's good for us in that respect too, it's appropriate and good for us. Thank you. The thought. The only thought that I have is that if the vote is next week next Wednesday, the resolution wouldn't be voted on by full board until three weeks later. Would it make sense for us to find a way to write this as a letter, rather than leveraging the resolutions we've already passed, rather than as a new resolution? I'm thinking, for example, that we had a resolution and I think it was in June that recommended that it was our recommendation to the mayor and the governor to get off their tuckes and start encouraging people to use mass transit. Again, it's safe, it's clean! It's all those things I think that we have talked a lot about the vitality and the essential nature of mass transit to the vitality of our city. I'm wondering if we can cobble together enough of those prior resolutions that we can have a solid basis to write a letter without waiting for a full board resolution to be adopted. A committee referred to full board and then adopted then, by which time the vote would have already been taken and the letter that you know so then transmitting it would be after the fact. What do you think a letter is fine? We could do it as a market as a committee resolution and have a ratification voted full board yeah. We have to say in the letter that we transmitted that this was only a committee action and that kind of diminishes the impact of it. And if we're going to do that, then I would just assume, write the letter then and say you know, yeah, I'm fine with you would send a letter to the chairman and I assume. Sorry I would propose that you draft whatever you were going to put into a resolution into a letter and then I could do that. I'll work with you to try to do that. I could get the letter out to everybody by tomorrow easily and everybody can just sound off on it and yeah, because I, don't think, there's controversy here in terms of the substance of the letter, it's not like we're taking a contentious position on whether or not to build. You know a high rise in the middle of central park so and I would be interested in streamlining this so that you we get heard prior to the decision rather than after, so that we have a you know, hopefully a unanimous vote on this. What was the first line, you said Barbara I said: could we vote on this tonight? Voter vote on it in concept? Oh sure, yeah I think it's a good idea for us to be heard on this, the more voices they hear about. How can you even consider this now? When you don't know what the level of service is going to be? Okay, when next week is the meeting December, 16th, they're hearings before that or leading up to it, we do have a full board meeting on Tuesday, there's, actually still fair hike hearings after this vote takes place. Believe it or not, the fair height wouldn't take place till March, so there's still hearings up to the December 21st, believe it or not wait. So the vote comes prior to the last hearing. Yes, we do have a full board meeting next Tuesday I know we want to keep it short and we don't want to add things to it, but it is a potential option and this is non-controversial at all. It would take under a minute yeah, but it's not a football meeting. It is a nominated nominating meeting only which is a special portion of it, and the rest will be just a steering committee. Now you're saying we can do the student committee I will agree to that, but technically, according to the bylaws, it is a full board view. Yeah I'll leave this to mark. Whatever mark would like to do with this as long as we're going to sound off on this is, however, marxist fit is fine, yeah I mean even next Tuesday. We adopt this yeah, I'm reluctant for the reasons Christian mentioned to add anything to that agenda, but even if we were to add somebody that agenda, that would mean that we pass a resolution on Tuesday night and have to transmit it so that it would be received Wednesday morning that doesn't give any realistic opportunity for it to be read, I think if we get a letter out by Thursday, we would be much more impactful and we'd be saying exactly the same thing. It wouldn't be that we couldn't say anything in this letter that we could say it's not like. There's something we'd be omitting from the letter that would could be in a resolution. I think we can do both one or the other, rather Andrew yeah get clarity on something so December 16th is the MTA vote. This is the bi-annual or annual vote on the four percent yield. This would happen normally biannual yes by annually, whether the year right every other year, whether or not to Covid-19 or not. This is a regularly scheduled vote happens on the 16th. But hearings continue after that, when the vote has already taken place. Yes, there are hearings through the 21st of December, so is that vote that happens not ratified, because what's the point of having hearings, if it's a fate to complete already I, don't understand that not the government yeah they're also going to be voting in January on other items, and if there was anything that was, you know unforeseen or something. Since the new fares will not take place until March, they could change their way of thinking in January. So perhaps that's why they let they need to schedule these through the month and obviously we're facing holidays. And all of that so thank you. I'm used to having to go to all of the boroughs for these fair hike hearings and I'm used to seeing the wonderful Christmas decorations in Staten Island, which I'm not seeing this year. So should we take a vote on the concept and then I can draft the letter and pass it around to everybody for if we're gonna thought resolution that goes through full board, then do we even need a vote or are we, but you can always record it. We want to get the letter in right away. Rich, we want to get it in this week before, should we say it's a sense of the committee vote. No. This is a full board statement. What I'm proposing that we do is we say that, on behalf of community board, seven in our upper West side community, we right to recommend that no vote be taken on increasing fares for the following reasons, and then you know we're not going to say there's a resolution specific to this, we're simply going to say this is our opinion, as representatives of our community, which I think we're on solid ground with based on all the things that you guys have proposed about mass transit in the last year and voted on and so forth. You put it all together and it makes us in a position of authority with respect to speaking for the community about that issue. I think that that's a perfectly fair thing for you to do. I agree it's also in our district. It's also part of our district needs statement. Thank you, Roberta. That's, perfect, you're! Absolutely right! So there's no need. Are we proposing that there is a this that we that it's vote no for an increase or that there shall be no vote and it should be deferred in police? This is not the time for talk of an inquiry. That's going to be the just because there's too much that we don't know- and this is a terrible time for a lot of folks, so the meeting shouldn't even convene it should be deferred well. The meeting will convene, but it should not be for this purpose and it isn't only for this purpose, there's a host of other things, procurements and all sorts of things that happen every month, updates on capital projects, things of that nature. Yes, good, all right! Well, thank you. Everybody I will draft something Andrew. If you want to send me a include me on the draft. I'd be glad to make sure, of course, I would so we're not voting. Now just so. We have a vote from this committee. There's nothing to vote on who's writing a letter. We don't need a vote. Letters don't get that voting in concept and then we don't need to circulate it tomorrow. We don't need a minute should the minutes, I'm sure Meg will write that pretty much. Everybody is in agreement on the need for this letter and the content of the letter was a signatory me as chair of the Board and Andrew and Howard as chairs of the committee. Well, thanks to everybody, I think it's an important statement. Yep I agree. The next item is an issue with regard to 1:10 the intersection of 1:10th in Amsterdam, to allow northbound cyclists to safely cross from the west side of the street to the east side at the traffic light. I understand there are a couple of people here who have are attending to speak about that mark. Do you see? Can you raise your hands and mark well and mute? You too, so you can explain the situation to the committee. The situation is the avenue becomes two-way, so it's a whole different ball of wax. Oh, it's yeah and there's a cross there's a thing where the bike lane crosses from one side to the other. With these rather cryptic dashed arrows, I see Christina, Weil or Wheel. Forgive my pronunciation and is anybody? Let's see I'm going to promote Christina the panelist for now, so she can speak and be seen. Is there anybody? Well, if you are looking for how to raise your hand when you click on the panelist button on the bottom of your screen, you'll see your name under attendees and then, if you click on attendees, you should be able to see Ray's hand as one of the options. I hope that that's clear, because I can't ask you if you can see it or not, because I need to let you speak in order to let you speak so I'll double my own conundrum. Here, that's actually participants button, correct! Thank you particip. What did I say, yeah two as I say not as I do right. Okay, so we've got Christine A while and then I don't see any other hands just yet, but maybe we will hi Christina Weil I raised this issue to the committee a couple weeks ago, I bike every day with my children up to the Cathedral, School and Columbia greenhouse, and so we make that shift from the left side. The West side to the east side to get across the intersection, and it's quite treacherous- and we know several families who are also biking some with small children who are five and six years old. Speaking of five-year-olds two-year-olds. Here we go anyway. There's no indicator for bikes like there is for bicyclists at 96th street and at I'm sorry, can you please take him, I'm so sorry, there's no way, there's no light. There's no indicator like there is at 96th street and at 106th Street and no signage, correct and no signage. The best solution we've come up with is to cross the street over to the West, the east side of the street, with the crosswalk and then continue north I think that it could be improved if there were a leading pedestrian interval or if we even could get a sign. I realize this is the difference between one community board and another and a protected bike lane in a non-protected bike lane. But I think that this is a simple, hopefully, a simple fix that would really improve safety for families and young children who are biking on their own to school. This year, because of Covid-19 and I seem to recall D.O.T putting up signs in other communities where there was a reason that you had that bicyclist had to change the side of the street. They were on because of a host of other things. So I'm surprised to hear there hasn't been a sign all of this time. So do we have a specific proposal that we can transmit sign signal? Can somebody hi it's Colleen from DOT, so good night, everyone so we've been in touch with Christina and we've been speaking with her about this issue and we confirmed with our signals, division that they plan to make improvements on Amsterdam, Avenue and 110th street to facilitate the transition for bikes from West side to the east side of the street and we're hoping to have an update in early 2021 on this. That's what we're hoping to do at the moment. Just so you know. Thank you. Yeah! Please go ahead. I was just gonna say thank you Colleen. This is Christina and I'm gonna sign off, but thank you very much for the update there and I just wanted to explain the situation to those on the committee who were not familiar. So thank you. You're welcome, Colleen. When you say there's going to be an update, do you mean an update in signage or an update on information? It'll, be an update on the signal, improvement and signage and growth? Yes, both combinations. Yes, are you looking at a dedicated signal for cyclists? There is a one option: I, don't know exactly what we're looking at yet at the moment, our signals division is evaluating it as soon as I have more information. I will share that with the committee and with Christina. Is there any other place in the city where you have something similar and what's been done there or any other city? Can we benefit from their experience? I'm sure this is not the only location where we have something like this, I'm pretty sure there might be other locations, I'm not familiar with this. You know design setup at this particular location, but I'm sure we do have something and it's working out pretty well Elian could I suggest this is mark. Could I suggest that you take a look at the requests from community board 4 on 8th Avenue heading north into Columbus circle, there's the same condition there, where there's a protected bike lane on the West side, and then you need to cross over to the east side of 8th Avenue before entering the traffic circle. Now there was a proposal to put a protected bike lane in the center of that traffic circle. I'm not sure if that's ever been done, but that's the same condition where you've got a where the bike lane itself traverses across a crosswalk and so I would recommend that you take a look at that and see if there's any learning to be had from there and Ken's idea of a cyclist interval or the idea of a leading pedestrian interval at one tenth would be I know it's a split phase, light already, because the downtown portion of Amsterdam Avenue ends at 110th street, and so there's a left turn lane for them that interferes with the usual north, south green but I. But those two things together, I think would be the kinds of things you might want to be. Looking at and they're pretty local to this community I'll shut up now, no mark don't shut up. You know, that's a great idea and I want to say that we did look at the 8th Avenue and we made some improvements, but I will confirm that if you could just send me an email on that, I will I'll confirm that with my colleagues. Okay, glad to do it. Thank you. So much so this seems non-controversial, it seems D.O.T is already looking into it. Is it worth us doing a quick resolution just to have it, as a record of you know something that's up to the board? If you want to do that or you can just send an admin letter to D.O.T I feel like it's worthwhile having I think it's worthwhile having a record of it always is I mean I, don't know. If you need to do a resolution, you can just send an administrative letter to us. Usually we just send a letter of something like this and they DOT is really very responsive. Well, plus, we don't have a specific fix that we're advocating, for we just want it fixed right, yeah. Well, our practice, I think in general is not to propose a fix just recognizing the ot and I think a letter in a letter. We can also add that we think that cyclists should probably much as when something else is going to change. Motorists are notified blocks in advance, cyclists. You know at 110th street you will need to go on the east side of the avenue. You know just words preparing them, I, wonder if it makes sense to switch bikes at 109th street, just so that they're prepared, so that lacrosse isn't at a two-way busy street good idea. The problem is, we already have the infrastructure between 109th and 110th. Oh that's, true, yeah I mean it's funky infrastructure there, but it's just a bad place to be switching from one side of the street to another. That sounds like the name of a music group: rich funky infrastructure yeah. It's something that D.O.T definitely should consider that should be in our letter, perhaps yeah, there's also, and what mark brings up about the split timing of the traffic signal. Yes, is a makes it that much worse. At 110th street we had gotten complaints from residents of the area on trying to cross there as I recall. So what's the next step, I think we're writing another letter. Aren't we I think okay, we'll circle who's going to be the taking the laboring or in this draft you know, I'll do I'll! Take that one if you, if you're comfortable with that okay. Thank you Christina! Thank you. Yes thank you. Colleen and Colleen yes, okay, the next item in business is a hundredth street. There seems to be a problem in getting from central Park west to Columbus in that area, because there are can correct me at seven streets in a row. You'd have to go seven streets out of the way to go. West 100th Street is a particularly wide street and it's it would be really helpful if there is the ability for cyclists to head west from central Park on 100th street. Is there someone here? Who is someone from the community brought this to us actually well? I did in pursuant to I think it was last month that we heard from a woman cyclist who had gotten a ticket. That was our committee right. Yes, riding a CitiBike from Central Park West to Broadway and was ticketed in front of the 24th precinct. I, don't know whether she's here but she's, already spoken to us, but I. Remember I could explain if nobody else has raised their hand from the community. I can explain a little more about. Are we saying that this is a hardship to go to 97th street to go up to go away yeah? This is the issue there's a an exit, an entrance to the park at 100th Street in Central, Park West, there's a CitiBike station at 100th and Manhattan Avenue, there's also a CitiBike station at Broadway in 100th. So already you've got a lot of CitiBike riders who are very incentivized to stay on 100th street and continue west. There is no other westbound street between 93rd and 105th for a cyclist. Actually, the Hodges station was moved close to 97th street, say that again the 100th street. Yes, it's closer than the 7th street, it's closer to 97th, but there's one at Manhattan and 100 also, and you have a lot of people coming from the east side on CitiBikes coming out of the park at 100th Street and a lot of cyclists who aren't on CitiBikes and want to go west now, as you're saying Christian, you could go over to 97th street. That would require making a left on central, Park, West or left on Columbus Avenue going to 97th street is a very busy street and then you'd have to go all the way to Broadway and then you'd make a right on Broadway and which does not have a bike lane and it's our district's most dangerous street, statistically and you'd have to go three blocks on Broadway to get to the industry just to qualify. We asking just so that they don't get ticketed. You know like they just are we asking like for a bike lane or any other change like that? Well, what we can ask for in a number of different things or a couple of different things, I think at the very least, we should be asking for DOT to legalize going west on 100th street, which is a very common practice in a lot of other cities and countries on one-way streets to allow cyclists to go Contra-flow. It actually has a word. Contraflow I understand that France and Belgium allow cyclists to go Contra flow on any one-way street, but not on 100th street. But now I, don't know what about history. Everybody does it I? Guess you don't want to be ticketed. Can you describe what the setup would be in terms of how many lanes there are on 100th and what each lane then would be trying to picture it? Yeah the street is very broad from central Park west to Amsterdam there. It doesn't look broad between Columbus and Amsterdam, because there's so much precinct parking there, but it actually is, and if we were able to reduce the amount of parking there, which I think would be I would say, that's a non-starter. The police department is not going to give up. You know it's so much parking, because you have all the angle parking on the street, plus all the double parking that the police cars use. All the time, I think it's safe to assume that you're not going to get the police to the police and the firemen they don't I, don't think we should. You know, give up just because we think somebody's going to oppose it, and maybe there are good reasons why it would be good for the police department to have fewer cars. Let me just say that they're I've they've been counted, I counted them they're, 171, on a typical day, 170 parked on that block vehicles, cars, not counting the NYCHA parking lot. That's there are there's space actually for only 130 vehicles, almost all the vehicles. There are look to be private vehicles now I, don't know how many people are working at any one time in the precinct or in at the fire department, but there are typically that means there are 40 vehicles being double parked. I think that could definitely be reduced and a good way to do it would be to put in I mean the other alternative to having, at the very least, we have a one-way contraflow lane and just a lot of cyclists, and there there's room enough for that. It's basically even with the double parked cars effectively a two lane, a two-way one-way street, but we could also ask for a two-way protected bike lane and that you know the police department would have to find something else to do with their private vehicles and it might incentivize them to be less car dependent and rely on Mass transit, Andrew Rosenthal, just put a note in the chat and I agree, because I just was on Google Street view. We can do that. That's a better view to look at it literally from the street angle. If that's possible I, you know I really disagree, you're going to be Lucy Parking, and this is going to be a big fight and the residents on that area are really going to be quiet against it. Christian I would ask this question due to the fact that you have the 24th precinct Manhattan north and the fire department on that on 100 street. Is this even a safe place to cycle with cars and or fire trucks, and whatever rushing in and out of the place? Are we putting bikers in harm's way? I, don't know if any? If anybody can have any knowledge, I don't know of any bicycle accidents there. You know and plenty of people do bike. Do that. You know plenty of people do that. Yeah I lost the thread here. Ken are we talking about Amsterdam to Columbus or Columbus to Central Park West? Well, we're talking about making a illegal for cyclists from Central Park West to Broadway, but right now we're talking. The sticking point seems to be the block between Columbus and Amsterdam well, and the block between Amsterdam and Broadway is no longer Park, West, Village and Douglas houses. So it becomes a normally a normal width street as opposed to an extra wide street right. So on that block, I think it would probably necessitate taking out the parking on one side of the other, probably on the North Side war parking disappearing, more parking disappearing, but how about just making? How about a resolution asking the state legislature to make it legal to go the opposite direction on that street and just leave it? You pays your money and take your chances. It's not the state legislature. I think the city can be the vehicle traffic law. Wouldn't it no right, they said he could make its own rules on any passing city, just not give people tickets and do what they're probably doing now, and we have Colleen's opinion on this meeting was noticed and they didn't. If they're, not here, they chose not to be here. I guess mark. Is there a way that you can do this mark I put it into the Google Street video, okay or if you want to make me a host I, can I'm sorry what I just did was make all panelists able to share. So if you want to share something, I'll stop sharing and you can go ahead, I'll just throw in my two cents here. I've said this so many times there clearly is a need for cyclists to go on 100th street west, but I am not a traffic engineer and to my knowledge, neither is anyone on this. Maybe Colleen is neither is anyone else on this call I think we should ask for the DOT to use their expertise, that we pay high taxes more to figure out a way to make this work for everyone. That's my take on it. Yeah I mean I'm not an engineer by profession, but you know you're, absolutely right, Howard. If the board wants us to look at this, we'll be more than happy yeah. That's my take on it. There is an acres and have the experts figure it out exactly, but the this picture is very dramatic and shows the level of parking. As you can see most of the cars they look like private vehicles. This is probably this is another matter, but this street is basically commandeered by the police driver and the fire department for their use and I'm not sure that's appropriate or needed Richard navigate through this yeah I. Can I'm gonna click to get closer to the police department. I would assume that most of these cars are the cars that belong to the officers or FDNY to drive into our neighborhood to go to work I, don't necessarily. If you look carefully on the dashboard, you can see a white placard on almost every single one of those cars, so you wouldn't I'm sure they're police owned vehicles, yeah and most likely it's hard to tell from the Google photos, but they're, probably designed for them to get to work. But we don't know how many live near mass transit and simply drive because they have easy and free parking. Well, a 40-minute ride is better than an hour and a half so I think they do what's best to come to our neighborhood and start our neighborhood, yeah and I have to it's. Colleen I have to tell you I'm going to be difficult to. You know: try to eliminate these parking spaces for these guys, NYPD or FDNY I. I'm not sure that we want to be a vociferous voice to try and make life even more difficult for the police and the fire department that serve our community. It's not just my view on this again. I, don't think we should be promoting making life difficult for anyone. We need we're trying to make life easier. We need the ability for cyclists to head west on 100th, Street and I would call the experts to figure out how to get that done. Make life better. Well, that's your opinion. I'm gonna pronounce that you don't need to do that, but they can go to 97th street. Maybe 100 street is not the best street for them to go west on. Maybe they need to detour one block and then go west I mean you know: Howard I, wouldn't love going through buildings. Oh I'll, just be clear. I do think that's my opinion. I think that going down 100th street I was on that street a while ago it was really cold out and I watched a woman get a ticket and it was a freezing cold night and she wouldn't have to go close to a half mile out of the way on unprotected lanes. So again, that's my view. I do view that as being very helpful to cyclists and making their lives easier. On the other hand, I don't think we should be prescribing any kind of reduction in parking or anything else for anyone. I just think we should I personally favor asking the DOT to come up with a way for cyclists to get to go west without going significantly out of their way. I would say: I would start with. Perhaps maybe we should have a resolution to request having a hundred street via two-way lane, a two-way street for cars, an east and westbound lane for cars. Once you establish the road that you can head West and east, then I think afterwards we can implement something for bikes, because we're just doing something for bikes exclusively. That's I think where the problem is I, think if we can make it it's an inconvenience for cyclists, as it is an inconvenience convenience for motorists, whether you're on a car or a motorcycle. You still have to go around 96 or go up 104th, so the inconvenience exists for anyone who's on the road, so we should make a convenience for both motorists and cyclists at the same time and maybe do a request that he goes east and westbound for under street. That's another solution, however, that would require a massive reduction in parking for the police. Fireman I agree with Howard, if just state the goal, which is, if it's feasible, establish that as a as an east to West route, if it's feasible and if DOT thinks it's feasible, let us have a specific proposal to consider I think it's I think that's a reasonable approach and you know let let's have something specific to consider. If D-O-T could come back and say it's not feasible, I think it's so big yeah, it's Colleen I think it's worth exploring. It's not like it's the board's intent to eliminate the parking spaces for FDNY and PD I mean, if there's a compromise, and if we can look at creating a compromise for both NYPD at the NY and cyclist I. Think it's worth exploring again absolutely I agree mark. Thank you thanks one of the things that I wanted to interject into this conversation, and it may be off topic so forget or not hitting the point, but I'm reminded of our previous vote in the creation of the Central Park West protected bike lane, which I did support and I think was a good thing to add, and the Central Park, West, Bike, Lane I, think is a partial answer to the problem that's being presented here, which is that if you exit the park at 100th Street, you have an immediate right-hand turn onto that protected bike lane that can bring you to safe crossings elsewhere. So I, I'm a little bit curious as to what need we're trying to fill with a hundredth street that couldn't be filled by moving north or south on Center Park West a little bit in order to find safe passage. East. I'm sorry West from there well there's kind of a false equivalence between drivers and cyclists when it comes to taking detours like this. For one thing: there's the extra energy expenditure which, but beyond that any detour that a cyclist takes, particularly if it requires going on a crossing, a dangerous intersection or going on a street that does not have protection, adds to the risk. And so that's the reason why cyclists are really incentivized to take the most direct route and I think we have to be realistic, that any cyclist who is around 100th street and wants to go to 100th street on the West side or anywhere you know, 102nd or 101st or whatever is going to go on 100th street and that's going to continue and no matter what we say we can say: well, they should go on 97th street, but for the most part, they're not going to well, while I was out there. Counting cars on that block, two or three cyclists went by me going the wrong way and you know yeah. Okay, the only other point that I would want to interject here is that the reality is Ken is speaking of the reality that cyclists will find the most direct path and I'm not in a position to argue with that. So I'll accept that I think the reality also is that a huge percentage of our firefighters and probably a healthy percentage of our police officers as well, don't live in the five boroughs, and so their commute is different than the commute. Now, if you, if we were to propose that we would require them to so that mass transit becomes more of a viable option, assuming that there's affordable housing to meet that need, I might find a more receptive year to that. But I am concerned about a statement from our board that essentially makes that practice of driving, and you know that I'm I think that everyone should use mass transit but I think the last of a long list of people that we should be Hocking to use mass transit are the police and the fire can I just say something. This conversation goes way off on attention. We're not talking about where police environment should live, we're just trying to find a simple way for someone on a bicycle to get from central Park, West, 100th Street to Columbus and 100 street. That's it we're not trying to relocate our whole police force. I, just I would support a call to the D.O.T to look into some more efficient way to allow cyclists to go west on 100th Street have them come back and then we can have a debate where firemen should live. I may I say something sure you know 24 of people in New, York City ride bikes of that 24, and this is from a recent article, I just read, which I can forward to you: 14 ride a bike at least one time a month, 33 ride a bike a few times a year and 53 ride a bike several times a month. So, okay, I've lost my article, but the great majority of people never get on a bike. So we I don't think that we have to accommodate the entire city for bike lanes, nor do I. But all I'm saying is that police, especially on a block where there's a police department and a fire department, it's it would be treacherous. It seems to me to even have a bike lane there again what I said and I think what Jay said as well is we're asking Drt to see if they could do this in a reasonable manner that doesn't inconvenience anyone? That's it I think we're all in agreement. Doug yeah, so I see that there is a dearth of passage passageways to go westbound and obviously we pinpointed 101St, because it is a wide, I'm sorry 100th street, because it's a wide street. What there's two quick things: what are the conditions of 99th street 101? Can we explore westbound travel on either of those- and second part is very specifically with regard to the fire department. I think that that's a hook and ladder and pumper station, so you need you have with considerations, do does when the fire department regularly responds to fires from that battalion. Do they always go east? They also may turn west I, don't know what they in an emergency sure understood. So I'm also just concerned about the birth of the width of their turn. But what what's the condition on 101St Street or any other westbound streets nearby? There is no between on central Parkway between one hundred street. If you want to go westbound, you have to go to 97th. You have to go up to 104th right here, 150, all right, okay, any well. Can we turn the lane of the direction of traffic in one of those and make it a westbound car and bike lane? We can't turn the direction anywhere. Doug I think we should present to the DOT and let them get back to us with a plan but Howard we're talking about an earth of westbound bike lanes. So what I'm saying is, does it have to be 100th? Can it be anything if they come up with a greek plan for 99th I? Think that's acceptable. It's just that I just am not expert enough and with all due respect, I don't think anyone is on this board tonight to solve this I think we should allow their experts to figure out how to get this done present them with the problem. Can we just move on and just agree that we want to ask them if there's a feasible way to improve the East to West Cycling and if there is to let us know what their opinion is and at some point in the near future, we'll if they think it's feasible, we'll have a specific proposal to consider in the meantime, I. Don't think we need to spend another hour speculating on. Can you turn here? Can you turn there? Is the fire department, happy, etc? I think we should I have one other suggestion, which is that in the meantime, we asked the 24th precinct to stop suspend writing tickets for a cyclist going the wrong way, because there is no other alternative. I, don't think we are in the business of asking the police department to disregard the law. I agree with you: they have lots of discretion on a lot of different laws, including jaywalking. You know what they could if somebody shoot somebody on Amsterdam Avenue and they have the discretion to turn the other way, but I don't think we're in the business of telling the police only at Donald Trump only on football haven't had to influence. Can I make two really quick comments. I haven't spoken yet in this all right number one is given the fiscal crisis, especially we should not ask for 99th Street or 101St Street, because that would involve moving buildings, which would be expensive and number two I think. The only way to do it and again I completely agree with Howard that we should rely on Dot's expertise, but I. Think, given that there are emergency vehicles coming out of the north side of the street, it would have to be along the south sidewalk and a question would be: is there some way to fit a bike lane in between the parked cars and the sidewalk that might not remove parking? It might not impact traffic flow at all. It would just narrow the street a little bit and the question is that possible, and is that that's totally possible to say: let's just so, isn't it the fact that both Howard and Jay have said, let's ask D.O.T to come up with a solution? Isn't that how we're what the direction we're moving do? We need a resolution, let's go with it yeah. Let's ask: let's have a resolution asking the D.O.T to come up with it with a way for cyclists to safely and safely for them and for everyone else get from central Park, Western, 100th, Street, all the way west on 100 street? That's the resolution I would with a reduction of parking. Oh no. We should not prescribe anything yeah I, don't think we should prescribe I think we should have already proceeded to put a bike lane in transit. That's the only thing. I just would like to say that the work that they should that face should first analyze it and see. If it's feasible then give us a plan, that's essentially what I'm saying it sounds: fine good! Okay, all those can. You circulate the language of a resolution. Howard! Yes, but the substance of the substance is just what we say right. Exactly Julian from Helen Rosenthal's office has his hand up I, don't know if it's about this should I call on okay. Are we taking public comment? We should hi good evening. Everyone I must have kept my hand raised since the beginning of the conversation, but I did want to put in I put it in the chat as well from district service cabinet meetings. It's my understanding that there is a parking shortage for the NYPD FDNY and NYCHA employees there. So if you guys are going to consider removal of that, I mean I know that the conversation has gone in a different direction. I think it would make a lot of sense to bring in the NYPD and FDNY and NYCHA to see how they're going to get there, because a lot of officers and employees live outside the boroughs and they do need their vehicles to get to work and protect our neighborhood. Well, hopefully, that would be a part of the Dot's analysis. I agree completely call the question all those in favor of a mere request for D.O.T. To look into safe passage for cyclists on 100 mark. Do you want to do the counting? Okay? Are we doing the blue hands or the I did a blue hand, but if you don't want to do it Howard and Ken, and that's it so that's a seven plus two is nine hands down all those opposed. Let's get the hands down. First Paul Fisher said opposed on. The top is Paul Fisher Committee member is opposed, looks like I have three raised hands and no physical hands. Anybody abstaining, Barbara I am Barbara is one okay, Jay I thought you were opposed: okay, guys, no, okay, sorry so, and then no one's ineligible, so I have nine to three to one to zero non-committee board members in favor. I'm sorry so Barbara, I'm going to lower your hand, non-committee board members in favor of this resolution. I, don't see anybody non-committee board members opposed Paul. Fisher is one that's right. Zero Christian has his hand raised. Okay, so and I don't see any other hands. Abstaining, I am I, don't know about anybody else. I, don't see anybody. Could you please change my voice to an abstention? What was it originally? It was a yes vote, okay, so that would make the committee vote eight three two zero, that's what I bet so I have and then for non-committee board members I have zero to two to one to zero. Okay mark I'm having terrible connection I, don't know! If you can hear me it's Steve, but I'm just abstaining. If you can hear me so you're not you're a non-committee board member right, no he's the committee member, I'm not a committee member, okay, I, dream of being a committee member, because we all know it's the best committee but till then oh okay, you're here so often I thought you were well. You know! Once a year you get a committee vote as a door prize, so Meg. The vote on the non-committee vote is zero to zero. Okay, that's what I've got! Thank you. Okay, we're moving along, oh business. Anyone have any old business they'd like to bring up Howard. It's mark I, see in the Q&A a question from Eleanor's telling about the 73rd street safety issues. So I'm is that new business or old business or I don't know what that is, I'm not sure what it is either. I think this was the double parking on 73rd street that we heard quite extensively last night, oh on Riverside, right where Riverside near the mosque. If I made a taxi parking. Okay, do you recall the status of that mark, I'm near the mosque? Yes, thank you. Somebody just said near the mosque. Okay, we're waiting mark for Council member Rosenthal does Julian still with us. Oh I, see a raised hand over here. Now too, is Julian with us, yeah you're here with us Julian. Can you unmute and tell us if that meeting is has been scheduled, which meeting with our office regarding traffic issues in the Upper West side? But this is the one about specifically about 90, I'm sorry 73rd street, between Central Park West, I'm no, I'm sorry, Riverside and Riverside, it's right next door to the Schwab and around the corner from the mosque and once upon a time it was Friday afternoons. And now, apparently we had that presentation. Last month, where there were several days of the week in which there was a fairly significant double parking and making it difficult to get down 73rd street, which is not a wide street and we saw images of ambulances unable to get through and there was going to be a meeting with stakeholders about that issue. You may remember that there was a some of placard or sign from the NYPD, essentially directing people to double park, on certain streets, 73rd being one of them and Riverside boulevard around the corner at Riverside South being another, and my understanding was that the council, member and others were going to try to convene a meeting with the stakeholders to try to and the mosque and a few others to try to figure out how to improve that situation. I, I'm probably missing some details, but that was the that's a lot, that's the base of it and we were waiting for that meeting to be scheduled and it has not been yet I. Apologize. We've had three committees this month, so I've been scrambling around trying to get legislation moved around, but I'm happy to connect offline and get that moving again and we can do it as early as next week. I'm happy to make sure that happens as soon as possible, though so we can get that done before the end of the new year and we have to have the 200 obviously involved in this yep, so Julian, if you could coordinate with me and I'll, make sure that penny and Howard and Andrew and anybody else who needs to be involved from our end, is there and then we'll and Andrew's absolutely right. We need the precinct and of course we need our constituents who brought this to our attention in the first place. Ellen ourselves is with us tonight. Thank you for being with us, Ms selling and I think there were some other folks as well. I'll dig through the notes to make sure that the right people are there. Howard, yes, I had something I, think it sold business because it relates to a resolution we passed almost a year ago. It's on the helicopter thing. Yeah, why don't you go ahead and okay people, I'm sure, remember that we passed a resolution endorsing a federal legislation that would reduce or eliminate non-essential helicopters over New York City and over Manhattan in particular. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed the dramatic increase in helicopters. What they do is they go over central park and they hover for minutes on end, sometimes two or three at a time they're coming in from New, Jersey and Westchester, to avoid a recently passed, New York, City law that prevents them from originating in New York city. It's every time, Gail talks to us at full board. She it's on the top of her list of complaints that she's getting and she's working hard on and is getting a meeting, apparently that the Faa is at least going to be listening in on and a meeting with long elected officials in New Jersey to see what we can do to get control of our airspace back. And but there was an article in the Gotham gazette a couple of weeks ago by somebody named Julia, Vetula Martin, who some old timers on the board will read. Her husband was our long-standing CB7 member, a great, very factual article. I thought it was fantastic. Yes, it was a wonderful article, and but there was one particular paragraph that jumped out at me, which was that our taxpayer dollars are being used to promote these helicopters and get people to take these trips and the way that works is that NYC and company, which is the taxpayer supported marketing arm for the city, trying to get tourists to come and do things in our city like go to the empire state building. They list dozens of helicopter companies on the website and they even offer discounts, 15 or 40 dollars off things like that for people to take these trips originating in New, Jersey, well, I yeah in New, Jersey and Westchester, so I, don't think it would be a huge stretch for our board to do piggybacking on what we said in our resolution of almost a year ago to have a resolution saying that our taxpayer dollars should not be being used to for this quality of life problem in our city and in our district in particular Ken. You may recall a couple of meetings ago. I gave a report on this problem, which is a huge problem. Now it's everybody's complaining about it. It's unbelievable, but I was in contact with Rob Gottheim from Congressman Nagler's office, and he said there was no legislation currently under this administration that will get passed. He can't get the Faa to do anything about this problem at the present time, which was two months ago. If you think another resolution will do something, I'm happy to support it, but well, this is really even congressman. We have a new Andrew. You might have heard we had. We have a new administration coming in yeah and they're. Really it isn't going to change their leadership for a while, just I know: I work with the Faa in my day, job and I think it's you know, I think Gail is really doing a good job. Trying to convene the right group of people for this and I. Think we need to keep this in her hands would be my suggestion and anything we can do to support her efforts as a board. I would be in support of well this resolution. You know we've already supported it. I know it was before the pandemic, though, and I think the one thing that's changed, I mean I'll, just be really clear. I mean a lot of the you know. There are traffic choppers from TV stations that are also hovering 24 7 when there's a crime or a even on the West side. A few weeks ago, when there was you know so it's you know, it's a wide range of people who are breaking the rules and I think we need to make sure that we're keeping you know the networks, Channel 4, Channel, 7 and Fox 5. Everyone also held into account. Just as we are these tourist helicopters, which we know are largely the problem but I believe Elizabeth- that we have learned from various folks, including the stop the chop, folks, that these flights are originating at Linden Airport in Linden, New Jersey and even some from Jersey City and Jersey City. The America's office has said that they're not getting involved, I mean I've spoken, I mean I've talked to the I, think and Andy Rosenberg's on the call tonight. You know they they're trying to stay out of it and they say call your congressman in New, York and so I think we need to keep putting the pressure on Congressman Adler's office to address this as well as, let me just be clear. My proposed resolution would be simply to say: we don't want our taxpayer money being used to promote these flights and actually the stop the chop. People very much welcome by presenting this resolution, because it would help I think it would help draw attention to this and may get this off the NYC and companies website, which would be really a good thing so and it would draw too I think we all probably support that I. Think everyone on the committee probably supports that. So, let's do it can I say something about this. I had something in old business, but since this topic has come up, I think I've mentioned before I'm a bit of an airplane aficionado. I'm a student pilot and I, actually just I haven't flown for a long time, but I like to observe and I have a window that I can see they traffic and I, monitor it. Occasionally and I can tell you that we've said before so much of this, our news, copters, there are NYPD, there's coast guard, there's also actually the army and air Force and so I think some of the most annoying helicopters, at least that I've observed, tend to be traffic, copters and news, because they're, the ones that are going to fix and hover most of the tourist helicopters while they're annoying. They are following a pattern: they're hovering well most of the ones that are hovering are typically the news and traffic in NYPD, absolutely no okay. So you can take a look at the brochures that the that they offer. You know you can see the statue of liberty and make the turn around here. They actually will show you the pattern that they go. They have a limited amount of time that they're up in the air they'll go over central park. They'll go around the statue of Liberty Ellis Island. It's a pattern. They I mean there are photographers that those are for hire where they're doing that. That's but hovering is usually done by the NYPD and by news copters, and it's very annoying. I'm not, but one of the things that I've seen where I've traveled around the country and also just when I, was flying more regularly, there's what's called a no tam, which is a notice to airmen and basically noise abatement procedures. So I have a feeling that we can try to out. You know ban all of these all together, which I understand is the main goal, but I think ultimately we're going to have to get to a compromise and I think the compromise is going to. Ultimately, this is my prediction: it's going to be noise abatement procedures at certain days and times of the day and days of the week, because if you fly an airplane, let's say of Santa Monica California, there are noise abatement procedures where you're not allowed to fly over the residential area when you're taking off and landing jets are not allowed to go up to full throttle, there's very specific things that they can and can not do certain day of the week and certain time and I think maybe getting to some. You know a solution where we actually figure out when or maybe during the week they can and the weekends and early mornings they can not. You know anyway and I'll with respect. Ken's proposed resolution is very specific. It's just against using taxpayer dollars to fund advertising for these helicopters and there's a whole broad spectrum of problems with them. Can we just focus on Ken's proposal, which I think has brought support? Yeah I agree with you, guys, I think we should support this problem. All the questions wait. A second just be careful, because this can also be viewed as being anti-business and anti-city recovery in these economic times, because you're just telling the city do not attract tourists. Well, Chris. It's not tourists we're in a helicopter that, but one says it can be viewed that way, we'll be very specific. It's we shouldn't be subsidizing teletourism. Any tourist who passes up a helicopter Ken will give them a free bicycle if they're reporting helicopter in New Jersey- oh my god and then going back to Jersey they're, not spending money in the city, yeah, there's a real, strong argument that if they didn't have access to these, they might actually walk in central park and spend some money right. But it's not our business to know what they're doing other than whether they're flying or not I think we keep it as narrow, as can you've related the question. I guess the mayor. Should you really think it's going to have any effect at all if there is Jeffries as well? If we're talking about our taxpayer dollars it's sitting. These are the things yeah, but you know that De Blasio is not going to do anything about it right well to our council members, as they say, this is more immediate. Focused thing: do we know what the total number of helicopter rides are? How many of them are the tourist helicopters? It doesn't matter whether it's if it's 10 and of the problem and 90 of the helicopters are not the travel. Then it it's a drop in the bucket right. No well, it's it! It's not a drop in the bucket I can assure you, okay focus on whatever it is. Somebody who lives under the flight path once taxpayer money should be used to promote this. That's the resolution. I also think we both made a very good point. We should be focused on tourism here. Yes, so let's call the question all those in favor of stopping taxpayer funding for advertising. These helicopter rides vote in favor Hi committee first, so I've got eight plus one. Two I've got eight plus two think. That's ten, so far, I think it's nine. Oh it's in it depends on whether you're in base ten or not. Let's convert to base pi I, see nine blue hands. I had eight. Do you have nine now one two one I'll put mine back now: it's eight, oh okay! So eight, no Andrew is one three nine they're at the time now, there's ten blues: it totals it to the left of where it says. Panelists, you don't have to count. We don't have the eleven that's what I was doing, but now I got eleven plus two is thirteen. I switched mine from a physical hand to a blue hand, so make it as did I. Okay, so I have 11, okay 11, it is hands down, please lower all hands. Okay, anybody opposed I, don't think there are any more committee members I, don't think there are either so zero anybody abstaining I am, is one and nobody's ineligible non-committee board members in favor, I'm going to say yes to me: I see Christian, there's two Paul Fisher said yes Stephen and Paul. That's four! Thank you. Anybody opposed don't see anybody. Abstaining, I, think that was all of us I think so too. So I've got Meg. I've got 11 to zero to one to zero and four to zero. Yep could I raise a similar issue with helicopters that some people raised with the news helicopters, which I find more of an issue because I live all the way west near the highway and they hover for hours, often very early in the morning. I know that it's even more complicated with news helicopters because they claim that they're essential and that it's a first amendment right to cover the one thought I have is. Might it make sense for us to pass a resolution just shaming them and saying, were your neighbors, where your customers were often where your own employees live? Can you not do this unless it's absolutely necessary? Can you look into using other means of getting pictures of potholes in traffic and don't we have a resolution on that already I, don't know that we have I thought we adopted one rich oftentimes when you see when there's a news helicopter hovering near where you're speaking about it's, because there was an accident or something on the parkway. Recently there was D.O.T did construction. There was a four inch drop in the roadway that was causing damage to cars and caused a big backup and because of that, multiple helicopters were hovering from very early in the morning for hours. Yes, getting the 10 second b-roll that they put on their newscast. What they'll also do I'm and I don't think that they're processing the human cost of having a helicopter hover over a neighborhood for hours and maybe if we can became them? Maybe if we do a resolution, the West side ride covers it. Maybe it'll get their own employees to recognize that they're harming their own community. What they also do regularly is, if you watch the traffic reports on the multiple networks, they will get the helicopter into position for the live shot and they will stay hovering waiting to be cued by the director of the television show. I know this because I've listened live and watched live at the same time. They do this often and if there's an accident or there's a major backup even more so that gets to be a protracted period of time. They'll get there at 5:45 a.m and they're waiting for the director to get live, and then, when they finish with the live shot, then they'll take off. They do that almost every day, so I would suppose a resolution just calling on them to be considerate and sending it to the networks, and you know we're not involving the Faa we're not involving any first amendment issues. We're just saying like be good. Neighbors, don't do this to your own employees. Is there a way to recommend for them to use new technologies such as drones that won't be as noisy I know that might be out of them? Yeah no I, agree, I think we could say you know, to the extent possible use drones, use, put cameras up on light posts. You could save a lot of money, be more environmentally friendly and not be a environmental hazard to your neighborhood, so I don't think we need to spend more time on it, but I'm proposing a resolution once you draft the proposal we'll do it in at the next meeting. Okay, so we have a specific proposal, yeah, all right, good, any other outstanding business. I just wanted to follow Colleen on 72nd Street and the cross park paths for cyclists on those two issues. Is there any update Colleen? So no Howard I, don't have anything new to update you about or the board, but soon as I do I'll keep you posted I know we are looking into both issues and we'll let the board know as soon as we have something and come present. It is there some indication of when that is going to be I can't give you a definitive response of when that would be. Maybe I want to throw out there maybe spring of next year, but not anytime, soon. Okay, so the extent it could be expedited. That would be great because it's it goes. Certainly these resolutions have been outstanding for a few months. So it's you know. Obviously we want to hear sooner as soon as possible. Howard I believe we have a. We were sent an email that we have a base station. We have to renew tonight. That's correct. Thank you, Andrew. Is there someone here to speak on that? Let me go through the attendees hand, is up right, Mr Cosme. Is it? Let me promote you to panelists right speak before Colleen goes. We should also talk about West End Avenue. Oh no, not Us! Mr Cosme, are you with us? You have to unmute hello. Can you hear us now yeah, please, you know, go ahead, Sir, okay! So yes, so I'm here with Cosme real estate, my name is Teddy, I'm the general manager at the door, transportation company. What we mainly do is we do medical transportation. Is that like Accessor ride similar? Yes, sir? What's your location, please 908 Amsterdam, that's between 100 and fourth and 105th, and could you give us Meg? Did you get the name of this company? You did okay great. Have there been any changes in your operation, sir? No! Not at all. It was a little sometimes almost back to normal all right and do other do a lot of the cars come to your location for it for like for the employees to get paid or to pick up their vehicles or they there's no actual convergence of vehicles in your location, hard to hear you, though Sir you went much, your volume went away. I'm sorry! Can you hear me now? Oh yes, much better! Oh yeah, much better! If you could repeat that that'd be great, so yeah, so that the drivers, basically they get paid via direct deposit, so they don't really see the need to be in the office unless there's something that you know update of paperwork, then that's pretty much the only time that they have to be in the office. Great. Has anybody signed on mark to speak on this issue? Do you know, let's let them raise their hands now, there's no sign up sheet for this meeting and for the public's information. The reason that these things are referred to the community board for a result is what Andrew was just asking about. If drivers converging on a location are likely to constrict traffic, then they want us to opine on that. It seems like this is a an anachronism. The need to approve these things, but here we are approving them. No one has raised their hand Andrew, so I would recommend. We approve the renewal I. Thank you, yeah, okay, so calling the question all those in favor committee. First, if you can raise your blue hands so much, the better I have 11 any physical hands that I need to record. I have 12. I, think that's everybody, okay, so let's call it at 12, I'm in the wrong place. Anybody opposed I think that was everybody. Anybody abstaining. So let's call it twelve to zero non-committee board members I'll vote. Yes, I can't Paul Fischer's voting. Yes, thank you Paul voting! Yes, Stephen is yes, thank you you're still there and is christian with us still, no there's no beachfront okay, so I've got three and anybody opposed anybody. Abstaining anybody ineligible looks like three to zero thanks, meg great any other outstanding business. If not, we can move into new business. So I think Mark wanted me to give an update on the West end open street happy to do that great, so I wanted to let you know that we've had really positive dialogue with Christina and Jessica regarding having the open street on weekends and I believe the hours are from 10 a.m to 4 p.m, and we had a conference call today and just to let you know, we stress the need. You know for positive reoccurring, use and management of the open street. We also highlighted that there will be a need to be constant observations shared with DOT and we'll do the same as well provide feedback that we get, whether it's from the community board or other residents right now. We're proposing 87th street to 95th, Christina and Jessica reminded us that NYPD wanted us to include wanted us to look at 80 1687, because there was he was chair a few years many years ago, because there was traffic congestion along that area. So we're going to reach out to NYPD just to confirm that they've asked us to look at posting. You know the open street revival on social media. We said we would do that once everything is finalized and we have been coordinating with both Christina and Jessica to give out or give them about a hundred eleven by seventeen signs that they can post. You know with you know, on the barricades and we've been successful in getting securing barricades for them. We talked a lot about SAPO and the permits what they need to do if they're applying for permits they have to go through SAPO. So, overall, it's been really productive and we understand that if NYPD is concerned with that block that segment of 8687, we can look at you know moving it one block further to 88, so we'll keep the board posted. Let you know what the next steps are and when this is going to be resurrected again and when it's going to start, whether it's this weekend or the next weekend, you're going to do this in the heart of the winter Colleen yeah they've asked us to do that: who's, hey the two young ladies who are going to be our maintenance partner. You know what in their group what about everybody else who lives on West End Avenue in that district? Why is this being? Why is this so reactive to two people? I, don't think it's two people in general I think well, can you name two more okay, I think folks in the area would like to see this. You know come back, but not you know. Five days a week, just on weekends, only can I just interject a day. This board called for open space during the Covid-19 crisis, so I understand that Howard, but they didn't call for closing the street between on West End Avenue. That was a general indication of support for the concept right of open streets where they're needed and I'd remind you Howard. You and I had a discussion about this a long time ago, and you agreed with me that it wasn't necessary on West End Avenue I never said that Jay, it's Colleen I mean we NYPD was our maintenance partner in I, mean I have to give Christina and Jessica a lot of credit. They see the potential in this in having it and again, at a shorter time, Saturday and Sunday and they're willing to take this on to be the partners for it and the fact that, can you explain what that means? Are they gonna have somebody stationed on every corner? We're gonna rely on them to monitor the open street, to get feedback to us. We're also going to rely on residents who are going to be using it to give us feedback, and you know we're hopeful that it's going to be successful this time around, given that it's going to be weekends, what is success involved? Colleen I was on the avenue today and I could not believe how many blocks have major construction in the street, jackhammers and barricades, and all of that who would want to walk around those places. Well, you know I'm Andrew Welcome to New York city, it's construction. All over this is New York City just now. This is unusual Colleen for any I've, never seen so much on West end yeah! Well, there's big Meg had her hand up. Yeah I did want to note that at a recent committee meeting on this subject, council member Rosenthal was noting that you know she was being asked. Are there any community groups who could volunteer to be this partner because NYPD couldn't and Christine and Jessica came to us and presented a lot of information and noted that they had been forming a group of volunteers and that they were going to reach out to council? Member Rosenthal and be in touch with DOT and so forth, and so, while I understand Colleen, is giving us an update on kind of their discussions with Christina and Jessica, who maybe are kind of leading the group I want to clarify. You know it's not too, and it doesn't seem like it's two individuals who are just trying to sponsor this, that it sounds like they were doing. Some organizing and I. Don't have all the details of it, but I want to remind us all of that. I would like somebody whether it's Colleen or umag, or this Christine, to just give me a reason and I've been communicating with Linda Rosenfall's office, because she's been involved in this. Give me a reason why this is necessary. You're talking now about the middle of winter, with on a street, that's going to still be open for police cars, fire trucks, school buses, ambulances, delivery vehicles, garbage trucks is what is the rationale for somebody wanting to stand in the middle of an open roadway which is dangerous inherently and have somebody Christine or somebody else? If there's an ambulance, two blocks away and there's a double parked delivery truck blocking the lane, what are they gonna do run and pull the barrier away, get the elderly people who are standing or sitting in the middle of a street away in time, for it is a name. It's totally a name. Give me one reason why we need it. I think related, because and I'd like to hear more hold on I think I actually have a request to the committee chairs and or maybe mark when they came at that committee meeting and they made a presentation. Their time tag went first or about some of his suggestions for West, End Avenue and then the two women presented, but their time was truncated and they had data from a survey. They had done about feedback both about what wasn't working about it and what people didn't like and then also things that people did like, but because we were running short on time. We didn't actually get to see their data, and so I was wondering actually, if the committee chairs could share that slide deck as well as tags. Other suggestions for Western give me a reason: I. There were reasons within that data and so I think it will provide information that could be helpful to every survey. The survey surveyed 450 people as I recall, and there were many reasons given why the majority of people who were surveyed supported continuing the opening of those reasons, one at a time and I presented you and Steve Brown presented you with photos on beautiful fall days showing those streets were empty, except for construction. There are not thousands of people using that they're empty and we have 16 foot wide sidewalks. We have two of the best parks in the world within a block of west end or two blocks of West End Avenue. It's in this. They, basically the community is asking for this, so community is not asking: where are they I live on West, End, Avenue and I'm and friends who are not asking for it who are being disturbed and inconvenienced by it? Do you want to close the street? Do it in front of your house? Okay? The point is this is going ahead. Why don't we see how it works out and then we can take well, it shouldn't go ahead, whether it should or it shouldn't it's going ahead, and we can rethink it when we see some results. Barbara do you have something to add what yeah do you have something to add? Barbara, yes, I would like to say this. I mentioned the same thing last month that the cars come off, the West Side highway at 95th Street, and they turn right there. The traffic congestion number one has been horrible. There isn't anybody out there and the cars zip right through those barriers and they don't go at five miles an hour, but they go considerably faster. It's just an accident waiting to happen and in the middle of winter it seems totally asinine again we'll see what happens when these two women take charge and we'll reevaluate at that point, and what kind of enforcement are these two women going to do? We know anything about it. It's Colleen! It's not only two women, it's a group of individuals who will be out there who will be working. What and in all honesty, DOT was asked to work with these individuals to come up with a plan to see what can be done in terms of safely implementing this, and that's why it was shortened from five days a week to two days a week on the weekends which is more manageable. What about rotating, where it is rotating it to where, in the 60s one month in the 70s one, we have open streets, city city-wide and we have partnerships, we don't have them anyplace else on West end, the Columbus Avenue bid is managing one for us at the moment, not on West end no, not on West end, that's correct! So if somebody lives on 68th and west end they're going to walk all the way to 88th street as opposed to walking one block to Riverside park. Is that what you're suggesting it's? You know it's not what I'm suggesting what we're suggesting is to try this out for the weekend and see how it works. What try, what out? What's the purpose, I think we've I'd like you just to add a couple. Thoughts can I jump in sure I've had this. We haven't heard from you Steve, yes, thank you. First of all, I want to acknowledge Colleen that I do believe that Colleen was asked by multiple city members to by city council people to get involved in this, so I think she's doing what she's told my concern is and again I'm just speaking I do not believe. There's broad community outreach or support for this I believe there's isolated and I. Think based on the conversation that I witnessed last week, there was quite a few people on here who did not want this, and maybe we should have done a rich did because I think if we had voted for it, we would have voted against it. Maybe that's a consideration. My perspective is I live right near here, I'm on 85th and Riverside. My issues with this is much different than others. People I used that when the parks were closed and I think that a lot of the support for open streets are when parks and many things are closed. Those circumstances do not exist now and we keep saying hey cove, it's developing. We have to develop well, we have developed, and now the parks are not closed. So that's the situation that I think closed, West end no longer exists. I can tell you that I used it quite often I'm there. In my opinion, no one uses it and they don't not use it because of the traffic. It's just nobody uses it. People go over to the park and I think that it is an inappropriate thing to do. I, don't think so. My question is: if we are going to do this, I believe that this is an isolated group of people. I think it's two people and they have the right to be passionate, want to do it. But my point is I, don't believe anybody's gonna use this, except maybe five or six people. So how can we monitor this because I think if we truly watch this, I'm on that street seven eight nine times a day, because I walk up I walk down? How can we monitor it because I'm very confident that if we monitored this for three months, we would find that little to nobody uses it and then I would like to then take some type of vote because I don't believe anybody's gonna use, it I believe it's a small fringe group of people I think people also have passionate goals of open streets and open things, and they may be that as well. But that being said, my issue is that I, don't believe anybody's going to use this I, don't think it should be open if it's on the weekend so be it at least it's down but number one. How can we monitor its usage and not from the people that are advocating because, of course, they're going to say everyone's using it? It's packed, of course they're going to say they want it open. Is there an objective way to look at it? Number two I put back on the table. Maybe I don't run the committee I put it back on next and next month and vote on it because I think it'll be voted down and those are my two suggestions. Number one: how can we monitor the usage and how can we guarantee that if there is no usage that it would go away and number two I would strongly suggest putting this back on and voting on it because I believe it will be voted down by the community and I believe it will be voted down by the community board? Oh mark, we haven't heard from you on this. Thank you. Well, those are questions. The question is there going to be a way to monitor this, and the question is: can we put this back on and vote on it because I believe? If we voted last time it would have been voted down. The answer is yes mark. Thank you. I want to add to the questions that need answers on this, because we heard a lot about in the meeting a month or more ago. When we were talking about this, we heard a lot about drivers, not observing the barricades or crashing the barricades or being aggressive with and so forth, and so my question I guess goes to Colleen as to whose responsibility will it be to deal with safety on the street, because I'm very concerned about creating an opportunity that appears to be safe. That isn't, and so as cars are accessing the supposedly open street, especially during the winter, when they might not be expecting to encounter people in that street. Are we really is it the responsibility of the monitors, the individuals who are now the sponsors to try to obtain enforcement or to try to obtain some kind of control over the street? It seems like we're asking those volunteers an awful lot, so not something I would be willing to do so. I'm just trying to get at you know, there's a request that I understand about monitoring usage, but the safety monitoring is the one that comes home to me and I was wondering what is the plan and what is the expectation of the volunteers that are signing up for this? Do they is that part of the deal or? How is that a part of the deal so mark? It's a combination of us relying on the volunteers to be our eyes and ears out there and D.O.T monitors it as well, and we also rely on the local precinct to help us with enforcement and the safety aspect of closure. You know during the specified hours I know we have open streets in other areas, citywide that have been successful in other community boards, so I mean it's a learning process. I mean we're hopeful that this one particular one will be successful, given the fact that it's only on again on the weekends. Thank you, okay. Anyone else on this I didn't get on this question. You know Jay, you've been the whole rotation. I've never hand raised for the past 20 minutes. Ah they're rich I see your hand up. You have the floor, rich yeah, so and Jay said you know. If you want this, put this on your own street and I'm lucky enough. I have it on my own street I happen third street and it's fabulous. Having said that, I think people have raised some real issues and one is there's just a complete lack of clarity about what the rules are. I think relying on community members to put the barricades back and forth I mean let's see how it goes, but it's a it's an ongoing issue and you can get into a spiral where, if there isn't clear barricades and there isn't clear signage, then cars don't know that it's a closed street and they'll just barrel down it as normal. Once you get that people won't go on it and you just get this. No man situation where that we've had and I think we need to avoid that I think a lot of it depends on having clear, definitive signage and what I've heard is. It should be five miles per hour. It should be local traffic only and clear, just a clear understanding that pedestrians have the right of way and that needs to be signed in a way. That's not a handmade sign from local volunteers that needs an official looking sign and it needs enforcement and that can't be enforcement from a group of community members that needs to be real police enforcement and, like I, see at 103rd street. Even when the barricade is there, cars will drive around it and they'll drive down the street at 25 30 miles per hour and that basically kills off the idea of it achieving what it desires to achieve, which is turning the street back over, so that pedestrians have more space to do different things in the street and so I. Think in the initial time after this was passed in the you know, the frenzy of Covid-19 in March and April. What DOT did was fabulous, I think as we're looking to continue this on a longer term basis, which I absolutely think we should, because it's a wonderful thing. It needs to be made more permanent and we need you know definite signage, making, clear local traffic only and five miles per hour, and we need to make sure that people on the street are safe so that they're able to go on the street and actually use it and cars respect that they don't have the right of way during the open street periods Colleen. If I could just ask when you do these things like you're talking about doing on west end, and you did before on West end, do you observe traffic on the other avenues to see if they have, if it hasn't increased? If there is speeding up because people are delayed, which is also an unsafe situation? Does D.O.T check on any of that? We do we look at the cross streets and to see you know if there are any changes with traffic conditions and patterns. We do look at that. That's one factor that we look into well cross streets is one thing, but if you're closing off West End Avenue, you need to look at Broadway and Riverside drive as well. Yes, we and we do look at those streets as well Andrew and going back to what rich was mentioned about clarity with signage. We have signage that we are preparing to give to the stakeholders so that those can be installed on the barricades and the signage are pretty clear and you know easy to read as well. I seem to recall, on the other when West end was a so-called open street. You came upon it at 87th street. All of a sudden. There was no sign south of there, alerting you that it was coming, it's possible that the sign was removed. That's why, when we do these initiatives or these programs, we need stakeholders and maintenance partners on board, so they can help us with that, and you monitor their success and or failure the stakeholders. Yes, we do. We monitor it. We do data collection, that's how we know whether a particular street is successful or not, and you do ever do unannounced inspections. Yes, we do go by. Yes, we do we visit the site. Thank you. You're welcome. I would make one final comment as an attorney Colleen. You might want to tell your community sponsors to seek some legal advice, the first time that a car speeds around the barrier that they were supposed to be maintaining and strikes some person who could have been walking on the sidewalk, but it's in the middle of the roadway and relies on it and see if in fact, they're letting themselves in for a liability problem, because I can tell you if it happened to me they would be the first ones. I would go to hold accountable and the second ones would be the city of New York. Okay. Let's all hope that doesn't happen any other outstanding matters, but it will okay. Let's hope it doesn't any other outstanding comment on this: there's a request in the chat from Jessica and that I think for Miss day to ask questions about this. You have to unmute yourself, okay, so let me find Jessica and then I'll find a stay. Jessica try to unmute yourself, hello! Hi! Can you hear me hi, it's St Williams good evening this question and then you, but we don't seem to be able to get through to Jessica. Can you hear us, can you should be able to speak? Jessica says her phone is 832. Oh, is that what's going on? Okay, so I can't promote a phone to a panelist, so I'm just going to unmute you try and speak now, yep. You should have it hello! Sorry about that. Yes, thank you. Sorry! This is Jessica from the open street. So I know that this has been a very lively conversation tonight and you know and I guess I understand. You know we were on the call last month and I know that there's been a lot of like opposition and pro for this open street I live on West End Avenue. So please don't think that, like Christina and I don't live in the neighborhood and we have spoken to many people who live in the neighborhood. So there is a lot of support for this because, honestly, like Christina and I had a long talk about. You know. We met on the open street and we did a survey of people who live like we only handed out surveys on West End Avenue, and you know we only wanted to move forward with this. If we felt we could get people in the neighborhood, because there's only two of us- and we were, you- know, trying to find people in the neighborhood who could do this and who are interested in this, and that is why we did a survey and really, why and honestly like I, see that when I, when we have spoken to other open streets like in the lower east side in Queens, you know I understand that, like part of this I think is that in the past you know it was just a street that was closed. But speaking to these other groups. I just hope that people keep an open mind because, as we speak to them, there is like so many opportunities that you know they have Santa Bike rides or they have Christmas caroling with Coco or there's all this programming that you know we hope to bring and if you have an idea- and you want to bring that to the open street like please do that like and it's why? It's only on the weekends, because we hear all of these concerns about traffic and about you know, safety and I totally get that and you know, I live on 95th street, which is an exit for the highway. So I am no I understand the traffic concerns like I, see the traffic all day long so, and that's also why we removed 96th street, because that was a concern for traffic and we heard what was said at last month's meeting. So this is trying to be responsive and, like everything that everybody's saying about this, you know I know you know we didn't really bring it up at this month's meeting because we're still trying to roll it all out. This is a big undertaking or you know I hope people are inspired by what this can be, because it's an opportunity like when I went to Riverside park last weekend honestly I walked into the park. There were so many people, I turned around and I came home like and I know that everybody says oh there's Riverside it's very crowded and they see that elsewhere and I hope that people can see the opportunities here and maybe go into it with an open mind and understand that this is, you know, we're trying to respond to everybody's. You know concerns here as well, so I just wanted to you know I hadn't planned on speaking about this today, but since this has brought up such a big conversation tonight, I wanted everybody to know that we are being very open-minded about this. We're really trying to respond to everybody here and I hope everybody thinks about that too. So anyways that was all I wanted to call and say. Thank you. I'm going to interject one thing, which is that the last speaker just talked about programming on the avenue and I want to make it abundantly clear, because it was made abundantly clear to me by DOT that any kind of programming on an open street requires a permit from this from the streets. Yes straight activities permit office exactly and that, as far as I know, they're out of the business of giving us those permits. So please be very careful about encouraging programming on a street where it is not permitted, and you know where you need a permit and it's unlikely that it will be granted. So please be please everyone keep that in mind. We have Estee Williams and then I see Erica Gerson's hand and then should we call it a day at that I think so well, mark so I just wanted to quickly say: I actually do DOB permits for a living. So I'm well aware of all the permit process. So that's well I've heard, but we have lots of ideas that don't require permits like self-guided like architectural tours, like wouldn't that be a really cool idea. I, don't know so just think about it. So anyway, my responsible idea on the sidewalk I'm responding to a particular problem. We had with this and I do not ever want to encourage the encounter that problem again. I don't ever want to receive the phone calls that I received about that again, and it is a point of responsibility that I feel called upon to make I'll shut up now. Mr Williams has the floor. Mark Colleen. We explained to the group about the permit process with SAPO and we reiterated that whatever programming they're planning to do, they do need a permit just so you know. Thank you very much. I'm trying to be a good partner in this. Thank you. So we have Estee, Williams and Erica. Gerson is going to be promoted to panelists and then you're back to the board. Hi, it's sd. Can you hear me? Okay, hi Sd, William, so I think the main justification for open space and there's definitely you know a real need for it in certain situations doesn't apply to park, adjacent areas and the particular area being discussed here really is quite close to both areas and people. Who've looked at open spaces in other communities and documented the use of it and whether or not it benefits the community have found that you really do need a full mile to have a meaningful, open space to have a couple of short blocks here and there usually doesn't provide the type of benefit that open space is intended for. I also have a question for Colleen, which is regarding the nearest open space to the Upper West side. I. Believe there's one on West 103rd. Can you tell us a little bit about who, on average uses this open space and just describe like how many people are there roughly in the morning afternoon? What kind of activities are taking place there? Are there? Is there garbage collection? Have there been any issues with loitering crime or people congregating St, it's Colleen I would have to get that information from my colleagues who run this program I'll be happy to connect with you. Offline and I can give you that information, but from what I've known personally and you know the community boards email me- elected officials, email me whenever there's an issue I have not heard of any problems about 103rd street I. Think it's great that and that's good News. However, I'd still be really curious to know how the open space on West 103rd is being utilized and I think that information would be most beneficial and relevant to understanding how one would be used on West, Dens Avenue I would be more than happy to have a conversation with you at the side about that, and then we can connect with the maintenance partner for that because, again, a successful open street it. It's all about. You know having the right maintenance partner, do the programming and making sure that all run smoothly. So we can definitely connect that. Has that been the case on West 103rd? Would you consider that a success I, you know what, as I mentioned, I have not had any complaints and therefore I would imagine it is successful unless, if you know something that I don't know in excess, successful in terms of attracting people to be able to have open public space, not outside I want to know yes, I would imagine so yes and I'm again and I'm more than happy to connect with you and we can talk to the stakeholder who's, managing that location first yeah and see how many people are using it. Thank you, you're welcome, Erica and then I think we're gonna, give it back to the chairs for the any committee members hi guys so I want to weigh in as a member of the community who is totally pro community and community interaction, pro open parks and pro people interact with one another. I walk, often 10:15 20,000 steps in a day all across the upper West side, sometimes in the parks and sometimes on sidewalks. Never in the street I had to fight a hard put I pushed Helen's office, I pushed Gail's office to try to make sure that we could get a street closed down so that my children's school could have access to have a safe activity and lunch during Covid-19, and that was a major effort and with only days to spare, we were able to get it open and it requires having a full-time security guard at each end, and that guard is also helping to make it very workable for the people that live there. Our school also made a choice not to take the parking spaces from the community in an effort to make life good for everyone, and they certainly facilitate my daughters. I was a big thrill when someone pulled out of their parking spot and they were in the middle of lunch and they stayed carefully in their seats. So that's an example of community working hard, but with a lot of resources to make it work and I'm grateful that they have, and it serves a very particular purpose. I can't understand why it would be better for people who happen to live on wet on west end to congregate in the middle of the street instead of having community interactions on Riverside in the park, and on that large stretch or sidewalk I mean the soldiers and sailors monument is like an informal gathering space for the community. It's so wonderful. I've been there. I've done a workout, while other kids are playing football and people are walking their dogs. That's what real New York is. It's people from all over coming together and I think the idea of creating a space that ruins the flow of traffic and is to theoretically enable people who all live on west end, which feels very against this moment of people interacting from across society. It just doesn't ring true or make any sense to me in any way. I think Riverside park is fully functional at this point, and there's really absolutely no need for this. That's my take on it any other outstanding business or new business I. Guess it's pleading into each other and then Steve Steven I just had a request for data. It was maybe for Colleen. Obviously, we've had a lot of conversations over the last year about parking spots and finding a balance and I tried to find the data just on how many parking spots were in the Upper West side and how many may have been lost over the last couple years. I found something from like eight years ago, so it's a question is Colleen. Is there data on parking on the Upper West side that goes back a couple years and then data that also speaks to obviously, there's been a loss of parking spots? Do we have any data on that hi Steve? Sure I can get you that information? If you want to you know, have the board email it to me. I can check with our parking division and get you the most updated status on that for data. Great I know mark if you can facilitate that or if you want me to send something, I'm just trying to find data, particularly that goes back to the last three years, which I think have been. You know a lot of bike lanes that went up. I voted for those bike lanes, but I'm just curious what the impact has been on the upper West side actually could I go out on the line and say the whole committee should get that data I. Think that's very interesting, I didn't know it existed. Thank you for asking Steve I'd love to see it as well, as I'm sure most of the committee would so if that could be circulated to the entire Committee plus Steve. Thank you, Steve Doug. You had something and then rich. Sorry, you don't you know rich. This is just an ongoing concern. I have now that the Covid-19 numbers are going up and it is seems to be apparent that restaurants will be closed indoors. That has not been determined but looks very likely regarding the MTA I am a huge supporter of the MTA and I, buy my monthly card and spend over 130 and I ride it, as often as I can for many good reasons. I am horrified by the number of people not wearing masks and I can tell you again I'm giving my monthly report non-scientific, but I have I regularly use the m7, the m11, the M104, the m57, the M31, the trains, one two three, four five, six nr and q trains I have never seen any enforcement at all for the past month. It concerns me because I feel like I, want to get off of the bus or the train or the subway platform. It's scaring me how many fines have been issued. It is now law, fifty dollar fines. How many fines have been issued? I understand it's all about education and we're not trying to raise money as a revenue source from fining but gosh darn it do it. I would be happy if the fine was 500, because at this point it is egregious and I have seen multiple bus drivers not wearing masks and I have approached them. I talked to you about this Andrew. One of them said I, don't need to wear a mask because I've got the plastic shield, but of course it's exposed they're, not hermetically sealed and I. Don't know if that's actually lawful or not I suspect it's not anyway. This is my public service announcement to say I'm horrified by it I see zero enforcement. This is now two or three months in a row. I can give you some answers. Doug, okay, up until about three weeks ago, or two and a half weeks ago there were very few transit bureau. Nypd police officers investigating the mask wearing a whole host of Nyp officers, now were taken off, the anti-protest beat and put back in the subways, so I have seen them doing. Some enforcement in the subways I have not seen them on buses, I would say, since I have been riding the trains. A lot lately that mask wearing is about 98 99 on the trains. From what you're saying it seems to be a lot less on buses. The bus drivers do not want to get into. You know get their heads bashed in and they're not doing enforcement I agree with you that I prefer they just not let someone on and close the doors, but if they're in the flow of people I guess they can't do that or they don't want to do that. But I can find out for you what enforcement is like on the buses on the trains. It's a little better I'd love to know how many fines have been issued and how much not many that I do know not many at all. Well, we're broke I'd like them to issue fines, I'm with you, my own personal preference. If it makes you feel any better though, and it shouldn't, but if it does that's great, the Sam, Schwartz, Company and Nyu have both done really exhaustive studies and apparently mass transit is not a spreader of Covid-19. The air is refreshed replenished so many times per hour that you're actually safer in a train or bus than you are in a store, a restaurant or a school. But you know that doesn't mean you shouldn't use the proper etiquette and be thoughtful of your neighbors and wear a mask. Oh of course. Yes, thanks I'll report next month, I'll get you some figures. Okay, thank you. Anyone else, yeah rich sorry, a relatively minor thing, but I was seeing reports that Amazon whole foods. Workers are parking in front of the store, putting up a sign, saying a whole foods employee and not leaving their cars all day, not getting ticketed and I. Think that you know we have Tri. We have parking rules for a reason, and it just feels like there are more and more people who are evading the parking rules and store managers at a store that we're not giving it to their competitors. I, don't see why we should let store managers have free parking all day on the street. Are you talking about 97 in Columbus yeah? We should talk to the 24th precinct about that. Then. Yes, I, don't think you know a manager, but you said employees is it the manager or is it all the employees that get to do this? Whoever it is I, don't know who they are, but if it's the, if it's Jeff Bezos whoever it is, they shouldn't be absolutely, and it feels like just overall there's like in on my block, there's a car parking on the sidewalk all day. We just have a lot of parking, that's not being enforced. When you say on the sidewalk, do you mean just a few wheels because the person didn't park properly or they're, actually the whole vehicle's on the sidewalk? It's the Riverside service, road and they're, and that's you know just one of many examples but I feel like there is just slippery slope of a lot of spots not being enforced and I. Think we should check in I. Think it's getting to the point like once we have store managers just leaving a sign in their car and getting free parking all day. It's getting to the point where we might say something got it. Thank you we'll look into that. Howard one person from the community who's been waiting patiently to talk about a security problem, a safety problem in central park. I think. Shall we hear that absolutely? Are you with us Mr Faisal Fazel? I'm sorry, however, that's pronounced. Forgive me, I'm not sure hi all hi. Thank you. So much I just wanted to talk about what happened to me last week exactly a week ago. So it was Tuesday December. The 1st at 7:00 pm I, was running in central park on East drive about 95th or 96th street and I was wearing bright. Windbreakers, yellow reflective bands on both of my arms and I was hugging. The side of the road, so I was not in the middle of the road and all of a sudden. Something hit me and the impact was so hard that I felt it was a car it threw me. The saving grace was that it threw me onto the grass. However I just this is how my knee looked my arm. My wrist was sprained. I have pain in my ribs. I went to urgent care. Unfortunately, there were no break, nothing was broken, but I felt my entire body. Organs went from one side of my body to the other. The cyclist did not stop from what I could tell it was not a racing bike or a road bike. It looked like a Rick Electric Bike and the impact was not with the wheel or even with the handle it came at me from behind I felt body tackled. It was like his body went into me. He did not fall or probably not even swear. I said by the time I was able to get up. He was way down, I yelled at him. He looked back but did not stop and I was in so much pain and shock. I called 911 three times I was unable to even give a precise location, so I basically walked back across the park at 100, Sec second transfers and go back to the west side. That's where I find the police patrol and I tried to file a police report and I don't think it was ever filed. So this was my experience. This was I, always thought that this was relatively safe to run if you're, careful and you're visible, and all that and the impact was terrible like I. Thank you know my luck for being here and being able to talk to you. It's I think I could have basically ended up in hospital or worse, and maybe because of the grass that was, you know what I broke the fall on, but I'm full of pain, I'm taking painkillers, and this could have ended up way. Worse and I. Just want to express that we don't let cars drive on central park at night. Why do we let these really heavy electric vehicle on the park? Thank you. What time of the evening was this, sir? It was around 7:00 p.m. Okay, so it was dark question. Is it aren't these totally illegal in the park at all times? That's my understanding as well. That doesn't mean they aren't. There. I was riding there today and it's a real problem. I'm this! You know, I, don't know what we want to do about it, but it's not just the electric bikes. It's the electric scooters. One passed me today had been going 30 miles an hour and I'm not exaggerating it felt like a ton of wrecks seriously. It was like I was shocked. I could barely speak and the police officer that, finally, after like 30 minutes 45 minutes I found they never sent anyone 911 never sent anyone. The police officer was very cavalier, it's like so it was an accident and when I said I want to file a police report. He said, oh, you want to file a police report and he wrote down something, but there was no police report. When I called the precinct Central Park Precinct, they said it was recorded as a police aide. So this there is no police report. Somebody basically hit me from behind and left me and just like I, don't feel safe, even going for a run in the park. He's like it sounds like we need to speak with the Central Park Precinct and see what's called them four times. Let's see what kind of enforcement they're doing on these electric vehicles we're going to be inviting the central park precinct to come to the Parks Committee in the new year. Maybe we should fold this into that. Absolutely I'm particularly concerned that they didn't accept a police report on this. That doesn't strike me as I mean it sounded like they didn't even want to do it well and that's the problem, and we should look into that. What is their new policy with motor vehicle collisions because I know they change the policy so that they're not doing reports on every you? Don't do reports? I! Guess you don't look so bad. You don't have paperwork so I know that they raise the standard and I think it I don't know what the threshold is, but I'm wondering I would imagine that if there's an injury they still should be doing a report, but they raise the standard which, in my mind, is very unfortunate because I think it reduced greatly reduces the amount of data. That's collected that he would I asked him, and he said he would. He took down information, but when I called there was no report, he didn't give me a number and I called multiple times, so I've called him twice. I called his supervisor. I left four different messages. Nobody called me back, so my only recourse is to actually go to the precinct and attempt to file the police report which I need for accident insurance, because I had to go to doctor and get x-rays and pay co-pays and go to chiropractor so, but this is how the police- basically you know, treated yes, very disconcerting to say about this sorry about it, yeah! Sorry for you just so you know. The east drive around 103rd street is probably also the purview of community board. Eight on the Upper East side, since that's close, closer to Fifth, Avenue I, believe I'll, be in Bh. We may wanna. We may want to contact the transportation Committee of Community Board and see if they've had reports like this Mr Faisal. If you want to come to the Parks Committee meeting, that mark was talking about it's going to be the fourth Tuesday in January, fourth Monday in January on the same platform. Well, let's make sure that we, let's make sure we confirm the central park police for that, because it's not scheduled yet, but Mr Facebook. You have my email address already. You corresponded with me today to tell me you'd be coming to this meeting, so please correspond with me again now that we know what your concern is and I'll try to direct you to the right resource. It may take a little bit of legwork on your part, but let's see what we can do to together. Thank you. So much goodness, thank goodness you can still do leg work. Basically, you have the police officer's name and branch number that you I do I ask for that, and he was really I had to ask for the police report. He said, oh, you want a police report and I said yes, and when he took down the information and didn't give me any number or any copy, nothing I said can I have your like number, your name, and he gave me a card with his name and badge number, which is what I used to call the precinct to get an update, and the update said this is in the database recorded as police aid, not as hit and run. Let me just point out: this is not an isolated incident. This is a massive problem. Anyone who's been in central park in the last several months knows. This is a massive problem and with all due respect to Mr Bazel and I'm very sorry about your injuries you're just one of many I hate to say that, and we have to come up with some way to reduce this, because it's, in my opinion, it's out of Control Howard. To be clear. What are you seeing the issues? People on motorized vehicles going on the park drive at 30 miles an hour causing havoc I, see it all the time now endangering people? Yes endangering everyone, including cyclists, pedestrians, anyone anywhere near them? Yes, this is a big problem just to silent, but deadly. Can you reach out and vote with this issue and raise concern that Mr Faizel's, that the police did not take a report and say that he needs a report? Okay, I'll try to work on the report against that, but again he's raising a much bigger issue that affects all of us, including Mr Vasel in the future. Should he decide I'm saying: should we reach out to the precinct and say that we're hearing reports that this is a major issue and needs to be addressed? Yes, more people are aware of this problem. The better well just to ask this as well. Sorry, my apologies, but just to add to Neil your story. I. Can you remind me what how long ago did this happen to you exactly one week ago it was same Tuesday last week same time. The reason why I just wanted to get a frame of reference. Roughly two weeks ago, my dad and my dog got into a terrible accident with a motorized cyclist. Thankfully my dad didn't get hit, but my dog was well, the cyclist didn't stop and my dog was being dragged across the street for half a block until the actual leash got caught until parked tire dog was hospitalized. Thankfully he recovered well, but this would have been a completely different conversation if they were my dad and not even kidding- and this was on the bike lane right in front of Celeste on 80 84th streets, where my parents live 10 days later, and this was around 11 o'clock at night. But 10 days later, I go visit. My parents, I'm walking my dog on 82nd right by Holy, Trinity Church and a cyclist I'm on the actual sidewalk, a cyclist zips right by me on the sidewalk, a CitiBike which I use a city e-bike which I use, but the cyclist did not care and I screamed at the top of my lungs yelling get on the streets, so Neil I, completely understand you and I feel you, because it's something that's been happening, I feel like lately, and at night we actually tried to walk our dogs. Earlier we tried to just wear reflectors. Do everything that you did on your part to stay safe, we've taken the same initiatives now as well and to Howard's point I. Think the bigger issue is those e-bikes. Is those scooters it's that they look the protected bike? Lane is a great way to protect our cyclists and our pedestrians, but they were designed with a regular bike in mind now that we have these vehicles that are zooming at speeds. That's equal to our car, we're putting everyone at risk. So there needs to be a new way to consider how the e-bikes or the scooters exist on our streets, because this current bike lane situation is dangerous for everyone like if it were on the. If you had more of more time Neil, you know if of this bike. Turning things may have been different. You know, and this bothers me a lot that you got hurt. It really bothers me a lot, because you did everything you could and it blindsided you from the back, which actually happened to my dad as well, and it's like I could barely talk when I called 911, yeah you're, a completely precise location, and at least you got to speak to the cops my dad was in was so confused. He just ran upstairs to my mom. We talked about it and then they talked about it called me. Then we went to the dog hospital and again the first thing that I asked was how's, my dad, is he okay, you know so again, I'm so sorry that you're in pain, I hope that you cover recover well soon, but we have a big issue on our hands as far as how e-bikes and e-scooters exist on our current bike path, yes, I, don't think I'm wondering. Should we be talking? Should we be talking to our parks committee? Should we be talking to our elected officials about legislation that puts a governor on these vehicles, so they can not go faster than a certain speed limit. Isn't that shouldn't that be part of any contract they have with the city they're already supposed to not go a certain over a certain speed and not be capable of it? Yeah wonder if this is I, don't think we're going to settle this tonight? No we're not going to sell this tonight. We will follow up with the precinct that we can pretty much try. Thank you for raising this issue. It's an important issue to all of us. Any other comments, questions criticisms, if not we'll call it a night. I have a motion to adjourn so much and thank you so much everyone be well be safe. Take care everybody! Thank you.
