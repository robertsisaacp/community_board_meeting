Yesterday I think we have a quorum from the committee, so I'm going to kick us off Then you know as folks join, especially our NYCHA tenant leaders.
Chair of cb7's housing committee, meeting If madeline innocent, who shares our nature task force, might be stuck still poll working because of the intense interest in early voting, which is fantastic.
We're joined by a number of NYCHA attendant leaders in our community district to hear from them a bit about what's going on at each development as well.
That's long been scheduled with our tenant association presidents from the NYCHA developments to hear from them directly about their needs and how we can try to marshal resources meet them.
So with that I'll give it back to the chairs, with thanks for everybody, who's coming and advice, to look at our website to make sure that we, when we schedule those meetings, you'll be able to find you know how to access them and to be a part of that discussion.
I sent her the regular CB7 on registration and she registered from the bar Do you want me to kick it off with just a brief update of just whatever is going on at your development that you think is important for us to know any issues you wanted to flag or discuss with us.
I was going to give a little overview of the whole all of the numbers to try to put in context because you're going to be hearing from at least one of the resident leaders from hopefully each development if they can all get online anyway , I work at goddard.
Lot of my work has been with rent, regulated, tenants and SRO tenants, but I've also done a lot of work with the so-called federal eight, which is the name that a number of the nature leaders have taken for the developments and just to help bring people together for mutual aid and support.
That's a collection of 36 buildings, they're, all walk-ups The other big chunk of public housing is Frederick, Douglass and a mix of other buildings and that's between 100th and 105Th Street, and you know going back to Ronald, Reagan Hud and his cutting the national budget for producing housing and for maintaining it.
Public housing has been under assault for decades and there's been a lot of abandonment and demolition across the country and in my talking with NYCHA residents over the decades that fear of gentrification and displacement and privatization runs deep.
Everybody wants, their buildings renovated and maintained, but there's always been a lot of concern and mistrust and fear of displacement and privatization, and the issues that you're going to be hearing is climbing crime and safety.
The fact that the federal government has largely abandoned nature of public housing, as well as the state wise towers, which is going through.
Okay, in addition to that, we have Ramona miner online who's online by phone from the host, though so I might want to give her the floor so that she can speak to issues going on in her building right now, and we also have Mona Lisa from the dome site, who's online, so I rather give the time to them.
The safety issues where people can just get into the building, and I actually was going down staircase one day and some strange person was coming up.
It's some apartments need to be done, they're, not being done, and that's also an issue because they've been sitting for years, Is that a new thing, that's happening, polly Cynthia, management's no longer giving us access to the list of the names of the tenants, not neither the new ones or the current existing ones.
Jack, is not here right now, but he did ask me to speak about his elevator situation, but I'm going to hold off and because I know Mona Lisa's on the line, Okay You and your family.
Well, one of the things that I want to talk about that with the dome site, we're really having a bad rotten problem, the apartment's, getting infested construction on the buildings.
I think all night tenants have been having that problem throughout New York City Housing Authority, but this building is 24 years old and we've been having a lot of problems with it.
Going toward brandeis of Amsterdam I mean Pitch black pitch black People working on the building over there Besides, that the issues with dogs nobody's picking up after they come to this block, but they do not do it in front of their own.
I know that the fire department came after or whatever, and I think they might have gotten a fine Then they stopped working trying to come in the building.
We really need to get on the elevator division of NYCHA to get people in this area on Standby, because the elevators are old and they're breaking down constantly Buildings elevators going out is not just an inconvenience.
My bathroom is full of molds, so It does not make the point that so many residents have lived in NYCHA properties a long time like a lot of housing, the upper west side.
He's speaking to the money that collegiate allocated for affordable, You want something from the store: 14 million dollars left I do not know that it was earmarked for NYCHA.
I want to say about 150 million dollars where every we sat down with the Amsterdam houses, tenants and the harborview tenants and went through all of their all of the things that needed to be done, and so there were new doors, replaced.
There is just so much going on in these developments that I've gotten together with like 10 different presidents, and we put this letter together for Mr Gregory Russ, the chairman and CEO of New York City Housing.
The city and NYCHA are right to want to redefine public housing in New York City.
The properties which, in turn, would enable a level of social efficiency and Minimize substantia substantiation associated with public house through the assistant of NYCHA and relic related city, state and federal agencies, secure the appropriate capital necessary to redevelop the individual, projects.
Doing stuff, like that, that's horrible people are really suffering, and I really got to say any president that wants to get on board with occupy NYCHA Believe me, our own lawyers and everything please get in contact with me.
Talking about their systems for elevators, and I, think it was a two-hour meeting You know about the NYCHA stuff it after two hours.
You know that was taken care of, so I just feel that it's better to work in a focus group, because when you have too many voices too many boards and too many people, you're not going to get anything accomplished.
Many NYCHA buildings are suffering even more since Covid-19, and you know part of the problem.
I, just want to say something, and at one time when well, when I lived under on Wasura before I, came to the dome site development here, we were able to participate with choosing the right contractors to come in and do work at the developments and like she said they do not speak to us about anything.
We know, there's problems with the structure, the organizational structure and the processes and communication, but it just seems over the years that I've been on this housing committee.
You know a lot of what I'm hearing is that we're not having the right people at the table that we need to keep a hyper local focus which seem like good next steps and that we need some kind of way to communicate some kind of set structure that we can work within some of the other pieces about accountability?
I know I realize that we have an issue with 3-1-1 does not work for NYCHA right and my understanding that we have a real black hole in and void in the data, and I guess the question on a legislative level, and perhaps now we can answer this or Erica or remember.
You know one needs to be really respectful of, but the tenant leaders do collect a lot of the tickets and work directly with the management of their building to get those repairs done and hold their feet.
I just wanted to add to what Helen was saying that let's not lose track of the fact that we still are in Covid-19 and with the get food program It's the tenant association leaders who are tasked with getting the food from the truck to the people who need it, which is an amazing amount of work done by volunteers, and I hope.
I mean it's just amazing how much how hard they've been working to help with all of these issues without funding, without any help from outside you know, and how frustrated we have been as a community board to try and help, and I really want to issue a thank you for Larry wood forgot to Riverside for some of the other agencies for Helen, for all of our electeds for Jerry Nadler, for every state, senator every state, assembly, member, Every, all of our city council, members.
Just you know, the community board is meant to be here, especially the housing committee as a place for you to feel heard, and for you to be able to elevate issues and know that you know your neighbors and your leaders are listening.
Nycha is shortchanged over 40 billion dollars from the federal government They need a lot of money.
We need partners in the state government and the federal government with the city to work with the residents and with community members to turn this stuff.
We need new rent subsidies to keep people from you know overwhelming the shelter system, so I'm not being pessimistic because I'm telling you we have a deep problem, but we also have solutions that work.
I mean I'm all for government, but if they're not getting the work done, you know.
Where does HPD come in on this with Hud, because then you know what they're the ones that are responsible to oversee these people that are working in NYCHA and getting things done for us and if they're not going to do it, how can Hbd help us so that we can talk about taking over ourselves?
They should call those housing assistants should make a call to there who could make a call once a month to every Ta leader and just spend some time with them, so they can relate what the problems that are going on and on is not that right.
Let me know what I was going to say: is, let's take away from me tonight in tonight's conversation, because there's a lot of issues that need to be addressed, and we can't do it all tonight.
When tickets are put in the system online, okay, And, we can maybe use that information just to get a picture of what needs to be done for our area, because I do know when I go on the dashboard it'll tell me which buildings have issues with elevators, any kind of way water, shut, down, etc.
Basically we work regarding Riverside, so I think you know.
I know it's being abused in NYCHA housing, where it goes up with absolutely no expectation that any work is going to be done and my heart breaks for all of the difficulties within the building.
