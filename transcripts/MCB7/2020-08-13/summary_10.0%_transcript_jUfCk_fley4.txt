This is where that rendering came from just to give an idea of what it would look like underneath because from the street space coming from the facade, you wouldn't necessarily notice this change, but obviously underneath we're trying to bring attention to the architectural detail that is present and then re-cladding and cleaning up the fascia that exists here and then the frame is an ample and then the rest of the underneath of the existing area, which doesn't have any detail.
Because in that stretch of west end avenue, most of the entrances have traditional canopies, as opposed to you know it's more related back to the building, because the window frames themselves are more of that color on the window, frames that are on the building right now, so keeping in contact with the color of the building but you're lucky because I don't vote with the committee.
There is some precedent along the avenue, particularly when that's what was there historically I was just wondering if there was a picture of the hotel before this particular mark Yes, it's a little hard to see everything down the street The second part of this presentation, Okay, as is we the resolution, is to approve, as is as presented second as presented all right.
, think that's the whole committee, zero non-committee board members mark oldstein, okay and doug climate There are no other non-committee board members when it's not when it's not that's right, so that vote is one zero one, zero Please yes, Obviously the second floor, we're talking about limited visibility from 75th street.
That's existing brick on the facade, If I may, generally speaking, our task with respect to legalizations is: would we have approved it if this were presented as if before neither penalizing them for having not done the correct procedure nor giving them a pass, because it already exists right that we still don't like illegal mark is correct, so I think we could vote So. Given the situation, it's a good solution.
So there's nobody else from the public here Okay, so we resolved to approve the second part, the two parts to the second part of this application So, it's going to be b, one which are the air conditioners to legalize Yes and two b2.
It was a one or two family townhouse that was converted in the 20s into a multiple dwelling and in the process of doing that they took the ground floor or what is the parlor level floor and raised it up to create a taller, and they also raised the basement floor level to street level to create a taller ground floor, commercial storefront with the second floor above which would was used for offices, The, glass, transom, marble bulkhead at the base, brick facade kind of a deco styling, which doesn't read as much in this elevation as it does in the actual the actual views with divided light, casement windows at the second floor for the office spaces that were created, the upper three floors This is a plan of the 1920s storefront, with its deep recess display windows and then separate residential entry to the right for the for the apartments So in the in the 80s.
It aligns with the adjacent buildings, but the original queen and townhouse kind of tucked back there Then we would like to give a better treatment to the existing facade on the second floor without having to reconstruct the whole thing, and the idea here is that we would use a limestone panel treatment with a deeper return at the arched window and then bring back some of the steel casement windows that were part of the original or not original.
The residential entry door of a similar character, the second floor office window Thank, you questions from the committee I assume that labeling, you know showing the signage as book.
and I should mention that as part of this project, we're doing a substantial rehabilitation of the building and the sorry I think I have a full view here, we'll be repointing and replacing all the windows with new wood windows for the whole facade, wow, wood windows, Yes: okay, are we ready to vote or we have more questions?
Although someone, you know sometimes universe, they say there's no such thing as coincidences, but this is actually the neighboring building to the 55 west 86th street there'll be no vote on this right.
