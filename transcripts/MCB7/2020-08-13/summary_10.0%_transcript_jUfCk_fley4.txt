I, do not know you're right there by the Lucerne ride by at 9:30 at night, tonight: 55, West, 86Th, street?
Let me just take a moment to unmute the 201,826 number, and can you tell us who you are and what application you're here for I'm going to be presenting for 305 West end Avenue!
Thank you very much for taking minutes and the first application, I believe, is 305 West end Avenue.
It has been approved for the fabric running portion of this existing, underneath just to give you a little understanding of it, there used to be a two by two hideous drop ceiling down here, with some fluorescent light.
This is where that rendering came from just to give an idea of what it would look like underneath because from the street space coming from the facade, you would not necessarily notice this change, but obviously underneath we're trying to bring attention to the architectural detail that is present and then re, cladding and cleaning up the fascia that exists.
It appears to me to be a creature of its time, which is of the 1970s and 80s when I believe it dates back to, and I'm wondering why you know, even if you were to have a marquee like structure as opposed to a more traditional canopy.
But we've seen other things in this kind of a context that I that As far as marquee versus canopy on west end, just as a point of reference, two doors south of my building, the building has a marquee and it once was the hotel, mayflower and then a nursing, home.
The resolution is to approve, as is as presented second as presented all right, also, all those in favor or maybe I'll make a roll call.
I, think that's right, so that vote is one zero one, zero Obviously the second floor, we're talking about limited visibility from 75th street.
Let's see context again so on 75th street, I'm, just going to zoom in here for a second to get an idea.
I think this is on 75th street between west End and Riverside.
They were concerned about the safety of the residents, so they got it in they also at the time, had a permit for the second floor, mechanical and the contractor at the time, and his understanding thought he had a permit to install these units at the time.
He thought he was approved to install these units and he gives his concern for the safety of the residents because they are older and they have certain health conditions in the building.
It is for the units, yes, and then with that because of OSHA there's the second portion of it, which is why we're talking about the screen Is because of OSHA, because this parapet is too low in this existing location.
The street here, there's actually three So, as you can tell here, there is an existing water iron front here that at 75th street, all of these locations- If you want that, are installed back, there, e3, let's see and the fence is staying as is right.
I'm just going to go back for a second just like I'll walk you through the rest, Just, there's some of the other equipment that was up here- This is our now current condition, which is these are the mechanical units that have been installed.
We approve the installation of a four foot, brick wall with the railing on top We're, treating it as a new application.
, we'll see what her vote is zero for now and those non- committee board members here: What's your vote on the second two parts of this application and are you with us?
This is a facade restoration for a building at 55, West, 86Th street, located in the block between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West in the upper West Side historic district.
It's used as a very like open, glassy, porous storefront and, at the same time, I think mimicked tried to mimic what was going on in the original Queen Anne style upper floor with another archway, but in a sort of paired, down, 1980s, post, modern, reified approach, not very appealing large glass plate with a polished granite with some other detailing on it.
We would like to give a better treatment to the existing facade on the second floor without having to reconstruct the whole thing, and the idea here is that we would use a limestone panel treatment with a deeper return at the arched window and then bring back some of the steel casement windows that were part of the original or not original.
The residential entry door of a similar character, the second floor office, window.
, the more you show us, the original, the existing condition, the more we're going to vote for anything else.
Yes was that true in men in black chairs, today, right, yes, okay, So, that's one two, three four five committee members,, Oh Madge, did we get your vote on the Senate?
Think that this we've already received approval from the LPC to cut new openings into the penthouse and reconfigure the fenestration we're looking at installing hope's steel window, units, I'm painted a dark brown color to match the LPC approved color for the building windows, the taped off areas.
Have, the french doors facing West and the New Bay window to face south, correct Are we ready to vote yep That's a proposed resolution.
This is a complete coincidence, although someone, you know sometimes universe, they say, there's no such thing as coincidences, but this is actually the neighboring building to the 55 West 86th street.
