Yet Rather works in Midtown, And they've been doing remote, since you know basically March April, And they've already said that they're not going to go back until at least the end of January of next year.
They're not open again, they're, not I mean not that not that I would make a subway station a destination for going for cocktails, but it was actually a pretty good place.
And, there's another empanadas place opening and a lot of good food, Let's get the show on the road.
Given me a letter state that I could present to the committee that that she has not heard any noise in the last year and a half of construction and that she's not opposed, and we will have in addition to that acoustical engineer who will be providing sound proofing once we're ready to open.
Now And it's for 480, Amsterdam, avenue, good We have an application for a liquor license at 480 Amsterdam for a Tex, Mex restaurant.
Acrosss the street, I'm, going to defer to the people on the committee, but before I'm, going to express my personal opinion, you're still downstairs from a residence you're next door to a a residence for that That may be a little tough.
We close about 1 am You know some people that want to come by late at night on a on, maybe a special occasion or something, but quite frankly.
We should try to reach out to the community and let them know You know I do not think that this particular restaurant tour should be penalized.
Is that everybody would be at 250, west 87th street last six months have kind of changed that no I get that Linda, but I do think that, Because, we are on zoom and people do not have to leave their homes.
I, just like to know that the community has been informed and if they have We, do not really get public.
There's more like six places within a two block, radius, I'm, going to ask questions Jacob how Lady, how Lady I'll, let you guys open?
I. Think because of the MTA Are you know everybody out by midnight, because people got to get the truth like we do that people have to get trained to get home.
Okay, I'm, not driving, I'm, parked, but You, know I just thought it would be better taking it in the car instead of the restaurant, because after this I have to go back to work.
It did not say after Covid-19, so I put 12 A.M, because that's the law right, now, We, you know you're not allowed to be open.
You might want to think about, like in 2022, we might be past or living with Covid-19 Kind of a lot of people after work would come And I did not want to put an hour that you're not allowed to be open.
What yes, Cindy got, has had issues in the neighborhood Lady She's, a great lady, but I, guess that you know to Aurena's point, and everybody else is that if you, if you erroneously, completed your application and you actually are requesting for later hours, I, you probably would want to modify remote.
You know it's not a bar, go to his restaurant three or four times.
With with the weather, changing, we decided to actually finish the room downstairs, and it just happens that there's that there's a second bar in that room, which you know in what seems to be the very like distant future, could be good for parties and for events, The bar won't actually there's no plan anytime soon to actually be used.
Based on what we've learned, We took steps to remedy the situation following our meeting with the Community board and were and were further able to kind of to do more sort of invasive work within the space following the shutdown when we had the fire from the building next door come to our building and we got all that water damage, and at that point there was major like renovations being made in the entire building.
We on the community board have nothing to do with who signs a lease and where, and in this case the one good thing is that it's not going to be a bar open, till 4:00 A.M all night So I do not know anybody else want to open on this.
I was just going to say that we have so many vacancies all over the upper West side, that we have to be grateful when a new business wants to open and actually shed some light on the street and show some life there.
Why this an issue came to me and Jill told me that she was harassed by somebody named Gina who claims she's from the West 79Th Street Block Association, and when Jill went to wanted to speak with her and find out what the problems were.
I do not want to say turning, you know looking away, but I understand that all of our businesses need support, but there are some people that are pushing the limit and they are endangering their customers and their employees and the public- Nobody has their mask on when they're eating generally.
Also April, you wanted to say something, What, you're, able to say to restaurants, because I am running into that periodically, where I've gone in and just said, look at you've got to do a better job of separating people or clearing the sidewalk.
I am scared to death of our second wave starting So. If I can hear other words or other things to be said, I'm interested to hear what other people are saying, but at some point Peter I would say from your point of view, given your position, you know you can always tell them.
Restaurants, that there's a couple of things: they're close to going out of business, so they're just trying to get every dollar they can before they run.
In the neighborhood and, unfortunately, you could, you could say to them, You know, that's what they're going to say it's on your right, but I was only talking about cases where you know the proprietor, like also, and also.
It was to extend, expand the permits for food, vendors and food trucks for street side and curbside food trucks, because from her perspective it was a gateway to entrepreneurship, for immigrants, for you know, first time for, but so are restaurants, so are Bodegas, and so are people who pay rent, and so I find it.
You know of street vendors, brick and mortar places and all that to to work with it.
We are a city of street vendors, it makes, or you know, There's got to be better regulation and also health department.
All for a food truck to you know to be able to go, but to a but a curbside seating in a restaurant and maybe serve the same food right.
