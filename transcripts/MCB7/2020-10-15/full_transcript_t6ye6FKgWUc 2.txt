We live around seven o'clock in the morning and by that time, coming acrosss the on the dry border. It's already packed coming into the city. Is that right, yeah wow, because it was particularly bad wow. That's not good news. You know, because we absolutely can't accommodate everybody needing to come to commute by car. That's right, there's no place for it. Yet there's no place to put the cars there's, not enough room on the roads and we need the subways, but I do not know what's going to happen with that, and this is with many schools close still and right, and now currently this especially the past couple weeks, the in the evening at the Russia, where Russia were going home in central West, is particularly heavy. Also, is that right, yeah wow? Well, I guess people will learn by pain. You know right because it's got to take them a long time to get. You know to westchester or rockland County right, and I do not believe that I mean there's still many businesses that are not bringing their employees into Midtown, yet so yeah. So when that starts happening, it's going to be, it is, although I do not know, if that's going to happen, but there's a friend whose daughter lives rather works in Midtown and they've been doing remote since you know basically March April and they've already said that they're not going to go back until at least the end of January of next year. So right so many yeah, that's right! Yeah, let's see how bro it won't open for a while. Oh no, the you know the opera canceled until next September right and now the New York Philharmonic has done the same thing. So hey Barbara, hi, Barbara good to see you hi Christian, how's, everybody, they're, okay, doing okay! So sorry to hear about your dad. Thank you yeah! Thank you. Did you end up going to Puerto Rico, or was that not I? It was possible. I decided against it at the end, because I would have to quarantine at least for two weeks on the way back yeah. Well, I would consider that to be not possible. You know yeah. In that sense it was not possible. Yeah, hey, Josh, hey Josh! I was supposed to go visit my brother and a friend, and I was worried that I'd have to quarantine. When I went there and it turned out, I would not, but then I would I would have because they're in Virginia and North Carolina Quarantine, coming back on the way back, yeah right, yeah, thanks emma hey sima hi and that's Linda. Oh, it looks like I spelled: Linda's name wrong. He has sorry german twist to it. That's right! Hi there hi there. Why can't I open this further. You have an f in your name. Now, yeah, that's my fault. You have to put in the names each time mark everyone every time. Yes, yeah, there's no way, there's no way to do a block email because the whole point of a webinar is you get a unique code, that's specific to you. So you have to enter each one in order to get that wow. So it does not automatically and does not automatically enter it. When somebody says yes, I want to participate. I have to enter you so that you say yes, I, like the you gave me. I like what you did there, you see my name, I'm and it's not even two more minutes, but we've got a we've got a we've got a we've got a quarrel. We've got a quorum, I'm starting the webinar so that we'll let the attendees in and that means that we're both live streaming and recording. Now, hey I've been live, streamed and youtubed all day, turnstile officially opened. Today. That's awesome. I heard you styled this up the subway thing. Yeah we got picked up by CBS, ABC New York, one West side. I guess I'm confused. Did it close yeah? There was a pandemic and they had to shut down. Because I was then I was down there and you know during the pandemic and there were places that were open, but they were not they. The Cubie House was open, but all the food services were closed and then on September 15th, easy paella opened, but today was an official opening where we got 20 out of the 39 already open and then by in the next two weeks, they'll be 27, so it'll be 70 percent and now we're doing the whole thing with public color, this unbelievable student. So that's the next one we're doing the next two weeks, another press conference and it was did Cam street survive. Huh did Kang, Street survive yeah young Kang. Is there young king? They are. They are really that they are terrific and there is a bar at the other end of that place. I do not know they're not open again, they're, not no, that's too bad because they have really good beer. I mean not that not that I would make a subway station a destination for going for cocktails, but it was actually a pretty good place. You know MTA is offering to you know, instead of paying rent you're paying off of your profits, so Josh where merchants was, would be a great bar for you fabulous space. Yes, indeed, he's excited. I can see this. I know you're trying to play it down very subtle. I got it unbridled enthusiasm, yes, so anyway, but it was exciting but easy paella by the spectacular could you imagine, the paella is like something you'd have in Seville and and boil the ramen place is open and there's another empanadas place opening and a lot of good food, so cool yeah, let's get let's get the show on the road. Let's get the show, it's all ready hold on hold on one. Second, I need to pull up the minutes. Just give me one minute. Sorry, okay, we have four applications tonight, so you know that Andrew and madeline are not coming. I'm is arena coming. I do not know. Is it reyna on this committee? Oh, that might have been my bad. I might not have sent her the the petition yeah, because I got up I'm trying to update the committee lists and I might not have added her to the list she's doing has she joined the committee. I believe so she's expressed interest in doing it. Let's consider her not appointed yet so we do not screw up the quorum. That was Christian's fault. It's not mine. No, it's me. Yes, we can hear you we'll be starting soon. I'm sorry! I apologize. I do not see myself. That's okay, hi, Peter, hi everybody! There you go! Thank you! Charles Hi, Charles, hello, Good morning and Louis skibar is here and Carrie canfer, and this is coming back house man, it's cool, hello, anthony and hello hi. This is gary. How are you hi Gary? So we're probably going to mute everybody kind of mute themselves as we go along until it's your turn? That's probably the best way, because you know what happens. Somebody calls you. Your dog starts barking. My dog starts sparking all the time, so welcome to the business and consumer issues committee. Are we seeing? Are we ready? Are you yeah sorry about that? Go ahead? Okay, so we have 163 Amsterdam avenue. These are all liquor licenses. We have four liquor tonight, so this is Damiana who's here for Damiana, Charles, Lynn, hello, Charlesman, hello, I'm the attorney for them. Okay, can you give? Can you give your information to sema so that we have your contact information? Your email address, it's Charles at Charles, Lynn, L, I, n, DOT com? Okay, you know Linda. I believe all this information is in the forum that he appears to be here too so yeah, okay, you want to give us tell us about it. This is a mexican restaurant to be a mexican restaurant on the corner of 67th street and Amsterdam avenue. It's about 2200 square feet. It will be. The hours of operation will be from Sunday to Thursday, from 11 o'clock in the morning to 12 midnight and from Friday and Saturday from 11 A.M to 1, especially in A.M. That's great and you're. You've only got background music, yes, okay and I see planned provisions will be, will include an acoustical engineer. Yes, we went before the board about two years ago where we received approval, but there was a one of the community. Members had come to the meeting and she lived right on top the very first floor of the restaurant and she had been complaining about noise. So we afterwards we worked out with her she's. Given me a letter state that I could present to the committee that that she has not heard any noise in the last year and a half of construction and that she's not opposed, and we will have in addition to that acoustical engineer who will be providing sound proofing once we're ready to open. That's great any questions from the committee just one other thing. These are very experienced operators. They have seven eight restaurants in in Manhattan telewater on 50th and the avenue was their anchor restaurant they're very well known within the city. I eat a tomato all the time it's around the corner from my office. There you go yeah. Would you be doing deliveries well, considering the pandemic family, better you're, going to be using third Party Third Party for that or you would yeah you're the only grab hub and those other times? Yes, I do not have any other questions. Anybody else has any questions. Anybody from the public here attending shall be called question: yeah, okay, so all those in favor just raise your hand. So we have one two, three, four, five: six, the committee members, the six zero the boat non- committee members. That's two! That's two: zero! Okay, great! Wonderful! Thank you! Welcome you very much! Thank you. Let's see, who's next is Avenue Jacob. Is it Jacob George's? No, yet Jacob, hey, Jacob, okay, hi, Jacob, okay, so hi everyone hi arena, you made it my natural yeah, we're here, Maya Culpa, that's my fault that you did not get the invitation. I'm glad you found your way. Yeah we're here. We're excited to be here happy to see everyone welcome to the committee Marina, our newest member. This is exciting, so we're on our second application, nfl application now and it's for 480 Amsterdam avenue, good yeah, I'm Anthony Cognon, I'm here with my daughter, Cara hi there hi we have an application for a liquor license at 480 Amsterdam for a Tex-, Mex restaurant. We currently have a place with the same operation at 49th and 2Nd Avenue. I'm sorry can you can you back up for one minute and spell your name? Please U L, I n a n and are you the owner or and the owner yeah, I'm the principal the 100 shareholder and my daughter here works for me and also my son works for me and he's currently at the location we have on 2Nd Avenue, that's a family business. How are you doing right now? It's very well! It's doing very well! It's you know. Second Avenue is a good strip and the outdoor seating there is helping us a lot. So we're doing pretty good business. Though awesome. Can you clarify the actual street address on Amsterdam? Yes, you mean raccoon lounge, you're right. Remember we'll put these up, because I guess you did not get these earlier, so soldier, Mcgee right, yep, soldier mckees, oh my gosh, when we all go back to my heart, hey was not that the harping shamrock. Oh god, I have no other idea what was happening. That was the site of the harp and shamrock with one of the best pool tables in town the best part. Well, now we hope to make it the best Tex- Mex restaurant in town. I think that's great. What's the Cross Street in Afghanistan, it's right on the corner. It's on the North West Coast, Corner, Third, Street, yeah, you've got Burger House and then Florida mayo to the north yeah. So is it it's with the the old Jg melon yeah? Yes for the raccoon, it was harp and shamrock. I see you're planning to open to four o'clock in the morning. Yes, okay, we'd, like to utilize. We open at 11 A.M in the morning and we'd like to stay open to 4 am where we are currently located. By the way we have a 2 am license five nights a week and then Friday and Saturday is until three am when that was approved by Community Board six about four years ago. They told us to come back in a year and they'd give us a full liquor license, but we never went back because, quite frankly, we did not really need it, but the place we have on 2Nd Avenue is quite a busy spot and we're moving it acrosss the street to a far bigger location in a couple months time and community Board six have approved us for a 4 am license acrosss the street, I'm going to defer to the people on the committee, but before I'm going to express my personal opinion, you're still downstairs from a residence you're next door to a a residence for that's, for that is a subsidized residence. I think four A.M, maybe a little bit during the week. That may be a little tough. Can I get some opinions from everybody else here? I was going to ask the question anthony. Why till 4 am? Are you planning to host private events? No we're not, and we do not even stay open until four A.M. Quite frankly, on second avenue we close about 1 am but it's just something we'd like to have in case there's. You know some people that want to come by late at night on a on, maybe a special occasion or something, but quite frankly, we close at 1 am on 2Nd Avenue and we stay open until about 2 or 2:30 on Friday Saturday, but it's just something we'd like to have for so we do not have to go back to the community board at a later date. If we want to somebody books, a party or something, and they want to be there until 3:00, A.M or whatever it might be Linda do we have any brothers. We've had absolutely no violations where we are. We've had no companies but you're here now and you're here now and you're surrounded by residences. So that's the only issue that I'm dealing with and Amsterdam avenue you know ostensibly closes between two and three. I live on Amsterdam, well that that's actually not entirely true, there's at least four places within two blocks of there that have four Am liquor licenses. At least you know what do we know what right what the soldier Mcgee's had and they had four they did. I I'm curious as to whether any residents from the community are on this call. It does not look like it right. No, I do not think so yeah. My feeling would be to say yes to approve this with the understanding that if we do hear from your neighbors that people are coming out late and they're disturbed that we will ask you to come back and discuss it absolutely and maybe, and maybe Barbara and Linda in preparation for the committee meeting. Maybe we should try to reach out to the community and let them know because you know I do not think that this particular restaurant tour should be penalized if other bars in the neighborhood can stay open to four 100, it's different. If it's maybe two right now and then this will be three and then there'll be four or five and then we'll have the situation we had many years ago with the bar crawl that never seemed to end. So maybe we I would be in favor of granting the permit until four, but I do think for the full board meeting the community should be notified. They are notified- everybody, oh so, but we have not heard from anyone. Is that what it is an applicant is required to post within the perimeter around the world? Okay, so no one's just we just love it. So no one seems to mind any object. It's a different world right now. We've got zoom instead of normally. What would have happened is that everybody would be at 250, west 87th street last six months have kind of changed that no I get that Linda, but I do think that, because we are on zoom and people do not have to leave their homes, it's so much easier to weigh in and if you do not want to weigh in you can send an email. I mean it's just so much easier these days, I'm not questioning whether the community is objecting or not. I just I'm just I just like to know that the community has been informed and if they have, then I'm perfectly fine with with making a decision without them weighing in historically yeah. We do not really get public for most of the applications. People do come up with specific applications when they are interested, so you know we do get them and we get. Sometimes we get them in large numbers yeah, sometimes right. Sometimes nice numbers right, but I think I missed just to say. I think I misspoke, I think, there's more like six places within a two block radius, I'm going to ask questions Jacob how Lady, how Lady I'll, let you guys open? What is your permit for all right? I think I'm off Mute now so, typically now with the with the MTA restrictions, we close around 11 o'clock so that we can get everybody out and home by one o'clock. Typically, we would see ourselves open until like about 1:30 and that's just because of the trend on the upper West side. There is not as much late night in terms of like what we would see and because we're like predominantly more of a restaurant than a bar like the service, is being driven more by by food, but we have a 4 am license. You do okay, yeah and just to add to that I think because of the MTA most places are you know everybody out by midnight, because people got to get the truth like we do that people have to get trained to get home, so we have everybody out by midnight and but we, but all the places, at least on the west side of the street and some on the East Side Street are 4, am from 84th down to 79th. Is all four am licenses? Okay? Well, then, you should not be penalizing a new restaurant exactly. I need your as you know, because and if we get complaints, then we'll discuss it and but I do not think that's going to happen anytime soon. It's certainly not still the pandemic, not anytime, soon yeah. So, yes, Mark. I also noticed in the when you put up the application that there were that they checked yes for live music acoustic and live music. Amplified. I'd like to hear a little more about that, because that is something we'll hear from the neighbors about him check for live music. I thought it said background music yeah. They only have background numbers number 10., we're primarily a restaurant as well by the way. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you typed in live amplified, live acoustic. I apologize we're all good. Thank you so much okay, so I think you know listening to Josh and Arena and Barbara and everybody on the committee. Does everybody? Is there a consensus here? So we shall we call the question yeah, let's call the question all those in favor, so that would be one two, three, four, five, six seven. So the bodies, seven zero committee, members, non- committee members- that is two zero. Okay! Good luck! Thank you. When are you opening it's going to be, I think about mid January or so that's great. That's fast yeah! Well, we have some construction to do, but we're going to get moving on pretty soon we love Texas the upper West side. Thank you very much. Welcome congrats! All right! Thank you see you soon bye! Next, let's see next is 26 Columbus avenue. What street is that place? What's 74th hi guys? This is Gary Igor Camper nice to meet you all hello hi. Where are you I'm here? Oh sorry, I'm in the car between restaurants, I'm taking the zoom core car driving. Okay, I'm not driving, I'm parked, but you know I just thought it would be better taking it in the car instead of the restaurant, because after this I have to go back to work. Okay, so tell us about it, I'm not sure. If you guys heard of our company, I mean our restaurant group, it's called kasaki. We have multiple restaurants, we have one on Barry. We have another one in the hamptons in Southampton, and you know here on upper West side and one in Midtown on 54 between Madison and Park. We actually grew during Covid-19. We were featured just last. Just this week we were featured on the Wall Street Journal on Fox 5. Our restaurant group actually grew during Covid-19. It all started. We actually opened our first one in January of 2020 and the end of the month, and we had one full month, one and a half, and then we had to close down March 14th and we did not have a takeout model and my experience and background is in marketing. I own a digital agency that let me turn on the lights. Maybe it'll be better in the car. Sorry, you guys, I own an agency that builds brands. So we do a lot of work for Northwell. We built Optum.Com, samsung Citibank, you name it. So the kosaki brand was a brand that we built for you know the partners instead of building it for clients. So during Covid-19 we, you know, I had the experience with marketing and branding and I was able to build a beautiful takeout box that was all over Instagram. That was all over the city and we are actually one of not many that actually strive there in Covid-19. And so are you proud? Are you primarily like delivering and grab and go? No, it's a Omakasi concept, so it's so that was the challenging part. So we have an Omakasi bar where you know you're paying per 60 course it's about 12 pieces of Nigiri, three appetizers and a dessert, and it all happens in within two hours. I actually made a mistake on the app because see on my app. I do not know why it said hours of operation. It did not say after Covid-19, so I put 12 A.M because that's the law right now, you know you're not allowed. We, you know you're not allowed to be open. We try to close by 11 o'clock and by because you know of all Mt and everything and by law we have to be closed by 12 o'clock right so obviously after Covid-19 we wanted to keep the same. You know hours that the former guyers had, which is still three in the morning, but Gary your license does not expire to 2022. So you should be oper your operating hours. You might want to think about like in 2022, we might be past or living with Covid-19 and you would be able to operate later. So maybe your operating hours should coincide more with your the term of your license, which will be beyond 2020. right, yeah, so yeah we were thinking if it's okay, you know what we do also, especially the you know, on the upper West side on the Upper East side, we were thinking like at the industry. Kind of a lot of people after work would come and you know like just grab some sushi grab it to go, and I was thinking- and I the only reason I put 12 o'clock is because I thought it's now and I did not want to put an hour that you're not allowed to be open. So we were hoping that we would be able to keep the same hours that she had in Guyer's. Even that she was a bar we're not at a bar. We were totally different crowd. You know it it's a it's a it's a higher ticket. You know yeah on average, I would say it's about a hundred thirty dollars per person. It comes out to you know. You know I just had another costume the other night. We have a new another new omakasi on Amsterdam avenue in 79 cool. Have you guys heard of our brand? No, I have no personally, no where's, the other one person. Has you see yeah Gary? Are we actually? I do not want to use serp, Christian and Linda's. No I'd like to ask some questions. What yes, Cindy got, has had issues in the neighborhood and I'd like to know if she's still a partner, or is this a completely not this? Is I have a person yeah? So what happened is we came in originally as a management, but once we were in there, I'm like? Oh, my god, this is not us and we worked out a deal where I'm buying her assets. So there's a purchase asset agreement and she's out she's going to be out as soon as that's done. It's we're totally different than what it used to be before I was actually pretty shocked. I was like whoa. What did I get myself into yeah? We have the same pr, lady she's, a great lady, but it's just it was. It was not for it. Definitely it's not our crowd and I knew either it was us or we had to go because we could not be there. So it's a it's a totally different, all right, so she's not on the license anymore she's. This is not going to be no she's done and the I guess the I guess that you know to Aurena's point, and everybody else is that if you, if you erroneously, completed your application and you actually are requesting for later hours, I you probably would want to modify remote. Do you have? Do you have legal representation with you today? Are you no I'm by myself? I do have legal Thomas Mcallen as my attorney, but I went through different community boards. I went through CB2 CB1, you know pass with colors and you guys are definitely a nice bunch. I did not think I would need an attorney. We have a good model. You know it's not a bar, it's not a club, it's not loud! It's prestigious, you know in our hamptons location, John George ate three times in the last four weeks. You know we have you got ta, go to his restaurant three or four times now. Well, yeah he has topping rose, that's not far away. His wife actually really loves our food. We import fish directly from Japan we're very high- end. You know we have a big following and we have a great crowd. So does all of all of this votes really? Well, then the question is, could you say, and I'm going to ask, can, could he get it modified by full board? No, I think I think Doug asked the right question. He needs legal representation. He has to go back. That is the point yeah. He has no idea, he needs to go back and he has to change his application. I do not think we can't listen. We can't we get this, then we're voting on 12 o'clock, we're voting for 12 o'clock. The question. My question: is there time between now and full board for your attorney to go back to SLA so that it could be presented at full board with the modified hours or do you have to or does he have to wait a month, so I'm going to actually can I jump in on that yeah? I do not see any reason why you could not, as a committee, write a resolution that approved whatever you think is the right answer, and if their application does not match that answer, then they have approval for whatever you say they have approval for no, I do not agree. What is that? That's someone who's disagreeing with me. I do not agree Mark. I think we have to vote on the app okay Mark, who is jake, Locke, not sure no yeah, but I think another thing for you guys just to. I think the reason if you like, let me just finish the thought to Irena's question, which is we frequently as a board, take, for example, in preservation. We will approve things conditioned upon a slightly different state of fact, so we so recently there was a proposal for a glass railing, and we said okay as long as it becomes a metal railing. So so, if they, if the applicant- and in that case the applicant agreed with us- and so it was not a problem, but you can define the nature of your approval and if it does not marry up with what they end up in front of the SLA with then that's on them, but we do not have to hear it again and you can and you do not have to delay the process. That's my thought. Okay, I see hands. Go ahead, oh move yourself! Okay, can you hear me yeah? So in the past we have done situations where we have approved conditionally upon receipt of a revised floor plan before changing applications, and then we've just either asked the applicant to post if necessary, or just you know, make sure to have the paperwork to us. The correct many times yeah by the time the board meeting rolls around. For that thing, that paperwork reflects and I feel like we should be able to do that here. Yeah, we have an issue in the chat. Can you can you delete Carolyn Smith yeah Carolyn Smith we've got some real people. I did. This is our first zoom bombing in in seven months. Michelle Parker has a question yeah. I concur with what said I concur. Can you hear me yeah? I concur with what sema said and at preservation we write it as a recommendation, but I do not think you need that mark. I think we can do like what sema said. I think you've done it. Yes, when you were when you were coaching, I think I think what we can do is approve it with. You know what you think about your hours and then conditionally approve it Gary, and then you have to come back at full board. Then we can say: hey, look, we conditionally approved it, and here is the application from SLA the modified application. I have a couple questions so, first of all, if you look at the past application that was up, you guys shared a set after Covid-19 hours. My application does not say that you know my application just says hours and I was afraid to put anything after 12 o'clock, because those are understood right now. You know yes, the reason why I'm asking is because I want to wrap this up and become fully kasaki and get guyers and for them to go on, and so what, when does full board happen like I'm not totally like? How does how will this work? It's November 4th Tuesday the first Tuesday of the month, not this time, November 4th. I would have to wait for the full board before submitting to SLA. No, do it now do it tomorrow? No, what happens is that a gallery that at the committee level, we approve or deny, and it still goes to the full board in the following months for actual approval, got it got it okay, so I was actually with my insurance bro. I think y' all guys have not boarded up Andrew ridgie. Yes, we were speaking yesterday and I- and I was saying that, oh my god, I hope this is okay, because I filled it out till twelve o'clock because I do not have an insurance broker. What are the hours that you want to use? If we could keep her hours 3, even 2 A.M, I will be cool whatever you guys are fine, I'm fine with honestly, like it's a very minimal part of our business. Okay, Michelle you've got your hand up amuse yourself Michelle I did not. I was just putting my hand up, but not to speak. Oh I was just stretching. We clarify what the hours of the desired hours of application right to 2 A.M 2 A.M. What was the start? What's the opening 12 P.M 12 P.M, we're open, 12, P.M and then to 2 A.M? Okay, you want to check this out. We have a la carte outside we do have a la carte inside. We prefer to do Omakasi, but we have a la carte outside you know. You guys should definitely come. Try it we're definitely we'll do a favorite in the city yeah. This is this is exciting. Okay, so can we put into our resolution that the applicant has has requested a modification from noon to 2 A.M and that we approve it pending approval by SLA, oh joe, about planning? Can we do something like that? We can that's kind of like I think we just said, like you just said, but we do not even have to say pending approval by the SLA. We can just say that we are proving for him to do after two o'clock in the morning. Are we going to say something like pending receipt of a revised application for clarification? You want twelve to two seven days. Correct! Yes, okay got it; okay, guys you want to call the question: yes call the question. Okay, all those in favor, that's one, two, three, four, five, six, six against abstaining one. So the vote is six zero. One! Zero! No committee members, that's two zero! Okay! That's great! That means I'm good to go. Yes, good luck! Welcome to the name of it! Thank you great. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. All right guys have a good one. I appreciate always taking the time enjoy. Okay, let's see it's a showing to all chat from Stephanie Rupp, I'm here as a resident of 100 8th street. I've never attended, but we've noticed that Dunkin Donuts is moving acrosss. The stream we've been concerned so Stephanie we'll get to we're going to go through the first we're going to go through our agenda and then we can talk to you about Dunkin donuts, but we do not really have a lot to say about Dunkin donuts, because it's not they do not have a liquor license and they do not have an outdoor cafe, but we can. We can address these things, the former Mansion diner. I think. Okay, so hi there. Okay, so now, I've last and certainly not least, Jacob Hodge everyone hi hello. So, oh my god adventure! No, we heard. Are you good, you're good? You hear me all right, good, yeah, all right, Jeffrey, daddy there! No Joseph is here hello, hi. How are you so she was. She helped pull everything together so that we can be here tonight. So I'm very grateful and she's here to answer any questions if she can help in any way because she's been a big part of the application process. But for us not much is changing. You know the downstairs. Space has been brought up in the past and we had already received approval on the space downstairs and then with us acrosss acquiring Maison Pickle. We did not really have the bandwidth to make something like to make it happen downstairs and now, with the anticipation of like needing more indoor seating with with the weather, changing, we decided to actually finish the room downstairs, and it just happens that there's that there's a second bar in that room, which you know in what seems to be the very like distant future, could be good for parties and for events, something that we're all aspiring for better times in general and it's there. But the bar won't actually there's no plan anytime soon to actually be used. We just figured we go through the process now just to have it and to get it out of the way have it available and if it ever happens, to help in service with the additional few tables downstairs great, but but yeah we're just hoping to get us stocked up and make it look good. The back bar and that's about it like for Us Jacobs is the same concept. We're not doing something different downstairs. It would be Jacob's menu in the downstairs room. How many tables will you have down there? So it's that off the top of my head. I'm trying to remember: can you can you pull up Brian's? Oh I have it here. Yeah so downstairs is one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine ten, eleven twelve thirteen one just double, checking that one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine! Actually these are twos one, two, three, four five. So it looks to be about ten tables. So I'm sorry we're not we're not like I'm not so accustomed to zoom, and this is tiny, but the way the plans are showing it according to the dimensions from the architect. There are, for example, like two tops pushed together, but this would be under normal. Sorry, I'm getting pop-. Ups too, this would be under normal seating regulations, it's not being represented as tables with six feet being six feet apart, but obviously like in our plans and in regards to filings. We want to set the precedent of having the additional tables in the space. Of course, when the time comes, it would not be set in that manner. There would be much fewer tables, so it could end up being, let's say we're showing like 10 tables. It could end up being like five tables in the entire space, but everything counts at this point right. I think this is similar to the flicker license previous words right, not talking code, we're talking beyond code right here, absolutely yeah. What is the sound proofing for so the soundproofing is just a general construction protocol based on what we've learned so there were there were in the past. We had some issues with the sound going above to the upstairs spaces. We took steps to remedy the situation following our meeting with the Community board and were and were further able to kind of to do more sort of invasive work within the space following the shutdown when we had the fire from the building next door come to our building and we got all that water damage, and at that point there was major like renovations being made in the entire building. So, just learning from the previous experience and like getting to know what would be necessary for sound isolation. We ended up installing the proper foam in the seat in the ceilings. That's all and there's tenants currently living above us. We have not had any issues with sound. I mean this is this is still this is below grade. So I mean I really have no problem with four am because the only people are going to be disturbed at 4. Am will be your other customers upstairs yeah. So it's one of those things that I think is good to kind of like have in place, but we've never actually executed, like our 4 am license, except for new year's eve. I think we may have gone like people are trickling out at 4 am but that's about it. It's it's pretty much. I know. Yeah hey, what's happening, just what's happening with the Alibaba space. Are we going to see you next month with that? So they we had a conversation with the building. It seems like it's moving in that direction where it could really assist our operations, because we do not actually have full cooking at Lucky or at Tiki Chick. So yeah we get along really well with the building. We have a really good rapport and yeah. It seems like it makes sense. Okay, anybody have any other questions. Okay, let's call the question. Then all those in favor there's a one, two three, four: five: six abstaining against not eligible to vote. Yes, yeah, okay, so the vote is six zero. One non- committed members and about this two zero one, two three, four, five, six seven. We have seven yeah, so it was six zero one yeah just in full disclosure. I procured this deal. I am generally very much in support of this, but it would be the right thing to do to declare myself ineligible because I represented the landlord and the tenant, but I am all for you. Jacob thanks Mr Amsterdam avenue, it's cool, okay, so we've just we've gone through our agenda. I think let's listen to Stephanie Rupp, hello, Stephanie, you wanna thanks! Let me let me just say thanks for doing this, everyone thank you very much. You've been doing some great philanthropic stuff and really Jacob thanks for being a rock in our neighborhood yeah, it's been it's an absolute pleasure and I'm glad that we're able to still be here. Thank you for the support awesome. We are so blessed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So Stephanie for the record. Just a can you hear us hi everyone. I do not. Are you waiting for me? I can't hear anything. Yes, we're waiting for you. Yes, okay, I'm sorry! I do not know why the volume is so low, but I can't really hear you hang on. Oh now I can I'm sorry. I apologize I'm juggling a simultaneous meeting on an on zoom on my other device and it's been a little bit complicated. My name is Stephanie, I'm a resident at 108Th Street on Broadway. I'm grateful to to you guys for running this board. I've never been here, I'm a stranger. I know you did not know who I was initially so thank you for allowing me to observe and participate. I'm reaching out to you, because I noticed our family has noticed that a dunkin donuts is moving in acrosss the street. We were surprised to see it taking the place of manchester diner and we were sad to see the manchester diner close when business got really slow and I just thought I would see I do not know how these things work. I do not know how leases are approved. I have no idea. I have no background in this, so I'm just here to learn. We were concerned about Dunkin donuts arriving in the neighborhood. There are lots of schools in the neighborhood like there's ascension school, there's, Mott hall, there's booker t. So there are a lot of kids. A lot of kids and kids and inexpensive donuts mean lots of empty calories going into kids, but it's also just kind of a bummer. It's not a it's, not a from just from our family's point of view. It's not a fabulous establishment to have right, acrosss the street. So anyway, I'm here just to ask that question. I do not know how these things are decided. Maybe we have, as a community no say in which businesses are on our streets, but I'm just here to learn. First of all, dunkin donuts is wildly popular all over empty calories and all- and it's really up to the parents, to work with their kids. That's right! Two! It's always a bummer. When you see a privately owned enterprise become part of a chain right. We on the community board have nothing to do with who signs a lease and where- and in this case the one good thing is that it's not going to be a bar open, till 4:00 A.M all night so and Dunkin donuts has pretty good coffee. So I do not know anybody else want to open on this one. They do not have a good car. Do not you Donut says I'm sorry go ahead, I'm so sorry Mark go ahead. No, you go first, you go. I was just going to say that we have so many vacancies all over the upper West side, that we have to be grateful when a new business wants to open and actually shed some light on the street and show some life there. Where you know we have so many places that are just dead right now, so I mean there's nothing we could do about it anyway. We really, as Linda said, we have no option to you know if it were a house of prostitution or something like that. We would definitely have a lot to say, but I mean you know for Dunkin donuts. I think there's nothing. We just thought we we're just here to learn about the process. Let me just let me just jump in on that, because Barbara made one of my points for me, so thank you, barbara. You made it better than I would have the so I'll. Add two more things to the discussion. One is that as a recidivist PTA president for years, I can attest the fact that, whether the coffee's good or bad, they donate a lot of it and that's a very good thing for the community so hit them up for sure and then in terms of so what do we do? And what do we not do from sort of a scope perspective? This committee is, as you heard tonight, charged with approving or opining for on behalf of the community, with respect to two basic kinds of applications. One is to the state liquor authority with respect to liquor licenses and that's what the agenda is entirely tonight, the other when it happens and right now it's in sort of hiatus because of the open streets. Dining is whether or not a sidewalk cafe can be used. This committee has also been very active during Covid-19, especially in trying to connect businesses, especially small local businesses, with anything that can help prop them up during Covid-19. So they've run a couple of very effective webinars about very granular. How do you apply? Which one should you be looking at and how does it work and where are some of the pitfalls and they've gotten some experts to come and talk about that? So that's what we do as opposed to telling you what we do not do, but the advice is absolutely correct that what we do not do is otherwise approve or disapprove of privately negotiated transactions between a willing, renter and a willing and a willing lesser right got it. Thank you I just happen to know. I am familiar with the space and I, by the way it is a duncan Baskin. It's going to be Baskin robbins and Duncan they're owned by the same company. There's going to be even more sugar there. I'm sorry, but you know, I think, and you know I'm just on a personal note. Yeah. I was sorry to see the manchester diner go. I pers personal I'd rather see a diner than but Duncan brands are franchised, unlike starbucks, which is a corporate. So it's a co-, op board that owns that. Building from what I understand and it's an individual franchise franchisee, I was going to tell Stephanie to come on over to Amsterdam. We've got five new small restaurants, opening calaveras, which came before you last month. It is up and running yeah. There is a little falafel place called Zod and then there's two vietnamese places and a indian restaurant that should be opening within the next month and posino on 103Rd street has come back. Thank goodness so just come on over perfect. We will we and I appreciate all of the work that you guys have done during cover 19 keeping the restaurants open and keeping letting them be outdoors and helping with that whole process. It's been wonderful. We've really enjoyed the neighborhood because of that- and I guess that's part of the reason why we were so disappointed to see Dunkin donuts we're like really anyway. So I just thought I would come to ask the question and I'm very grateful for all of your feedback and all of your guidance. Thank you. So much come every month. It's fun yeah! Okay! Now I'm worried stephanie. If you want to make it yeah, I find it interesting. Yeah preservation, landmarks. All you know really interesting part transportation. Oh you've got your hand up. I have one little issue. I do not think we can do anything about it tonight. This is this. Has something to do with Blondie's, which is on 79th street between Broadway and Amsterdam, full disclosure? My husband is their accountant. That's why this an issue came to me and Jill told me that she was harassed by somebody named Gina who claims she's from the West 79Th Street Block Association, and when Jill went to wanted to speak with her and find out what the problems were. This woman just threatened an injunction and to put her out of business and hung up the phone yeah. I spoke to mark about this briefly. I thought. Maybe the committee could do some sort of mediation if we could find this Gina person. What we'll do first is call to reach out to Dale Brown who's, the president of the West 79Th Street Block Association, and see if she can talk to her and what is Gina's issue about Blondie's. Does she live upstairs or something? No, we do not know. I do not know children know where she lives something about loud music which live music, which is there's no live music at Blondie's, and I- but I spoke to mark about this already today and just to tell you a little more in order to mediate. But I'd be glad to jump in. I think Linda's idea of contacting Dale is the right one. Okay, great yeah, that's my opinion too. I do not think there's something for us to do just yet and that they should they should approach the the Block Association. So we have not got enough problems. Oh my god, but we know this person is really not a member of the association it could be. It could be and you're right she's, not in leadership. I know that much because for because of the Lucerne, I'm in close contact with Dale and with I think the other guy's name is Arthur. Who are the leaders of that Block Association? But but she could be a member, you know, yeah, that's true and Blondie's has put up with a lot with the guys from the Lucerne. I know our legacy businesses going. No, it was originally owned by Doug Grebel yeah, that's right and they had a spot down in the that diner down on 67th street 76. yeah, which is yeah. It started off at 77Th and Broadway actually in the old shelter place, yeah, so to be continued, but I thought I'd tell you all and it's too bad. I still understand the substance of this. I do not. I do not get what the contention is. There's a noise complaint or this noise and people are standing up without masks on and I'll get more particulars. If it's live music that they're complaining about they've got the wrong place. There is live music around the corner, and sometimes you hear you hear it. I think it's a pizzola yeah, it's not it's! I had dinner there, the other night. It's a it's a it's a non-. It's an acoustic trio. It's not exactly! There's a lot of that on Amsterdam yeah. It's really nice! That's what you thought. Maybe it's Amsterdam Avenue noise. Actually she did a really clever thing. It's a sports bar. She put the tvs out the wind they face out the window so so that there is one thing that is going on there Michelle and that actually leads right into something that I heard from somebody else today and it's more in the way of it's more in the way of a heads up than anything else. I do not think there's any action for us to take, but I want to make sure that this committee is aware of it and it relates to the viond restaurant. That's at around the corner from the beacon, yes, the diner, the diner kite place yeah and if you're familiar, they have a curbside, dining enclosed area like a lot of places do and they and they also have the sidewalk use, and this is on the side street, which is probably appropriate in that one instance. But it is, you know, narrower than the Broadway frontage, but they have tables against the wall and they also have tables against the curb, and so people who are using the sidewalk are walking in between which is a little bit awkward. I've seen that a lot but they're not supposed to have against the curb I- and this is my inclination we observe it. I can tell you that the beyond on 83rd street has you know they they've moved their curbside to the side street and it's so it's a little more congested. This is a D.O.T thing, though they're the ones who issue these. Yes, my personal, just to finish my thought, my personal view is that is that the mark is that eventually, if DOT gets involved, then that's between them and D.O.T. I do not really want us to be an enforcement agency, especially at this time, and especially in this crisis right, you know, as I'm thinking about it, the Utopia diner is doing the same thing hard against a bus stop and if that's the only way they can make a living. Then let's see what happens. Things are going to change when we, then, when there's a vaccine or antibodies whatever, but right now we're going to change when the weather changes too. So it is for sure. I just wanted to say that it seems to me that there's a lot of places that are out of compliance and one that got written up in the West side, rag very favorably- is that I can't think of the name of it, but it's on broadway in the 90s. I think it's in the 90s, it's a french restaurant and they have those pods on Cafe, Du soleil. It seems so crazy, but there's a lot of places like that where they put plastic on three sides. So I do not think that anybody's really checking until the weather gets cold. You know, let's try and give everybody let's try and give our local businesses a leg up. You know I mean I think you have to be a that's the problem. It's just not healthy. It keeps the air clustered in there. Well, I think customers would make their own decision whether to eat it or not. Pedestrians. I will say that they were out today because they came to a couple of our places to make sure that we were being compliant in terms of postings for capacity that we had all signage up for Covid-19 restrictions. You know using Sanitizer face coverings six feet of distance. They were checking for all these things that we had a log for our employees to sign when they come in temperature checks, so they did start coming around today, because I know that a couple of our spots got, I do not say hit, they just got hey. This is what you need to be doing if you're not doing it. The next time we come around. There will be fines, but if you're doing it just keep doing what you're doing, but they are out there now different than D.O.T checking on seating on the street. Yes, Tar told me that when he was walking the dog that they were in front of tiki bar today, so they're out there, you know I mean I just dealt with the underground market today. Just be compliant. Yeah do not be compliant, so I'm dying to get to the next subject, guys yeah I'd like to. I want to just say something about this subject. If I may well, I agree with Mark and with Linda about kind of. I do not want to say turning, you know looking away, but I understand that all of our businesses need support, but there are some people that are pushing the limit and they are endangering their customers and their employees and the public- and I am not okay with it because I have walked through and I love these businesses and some of them are my clients. So I understand it's outside, but if you're jammed, if pedestrians are walking through and they are literally walking- you know everybody, nobody has their mask on when they're eating generally. So it's an issue and it's going to get colder and it's probably going to kind of remediate itself, but I just you know there there's some that are going to end up. What's that listen call, 311 uncomfortable and I make walk on another side of the street and some people are pushing the limits and I'm not saying that we be we're, not enforcement, but I'm just aware of it and they could ruin it for other restaurants. What's that I completely agree with you and we want to you know many neighborhoods are experiencing a recurrence of Covid-19. We want to get rid of it and we never will if, in fact, we turn a blind eye to things that are blatantly. I think, there's a difference between wait, a minute guys, I think, there's a difference between turning a blind eye and being flexible, and if you find something that you feel is really egregious right, get on the horn call 3-, 1- 1 and that's your responsibility as a citizen. That's right, community vote or not agreed right. That was going to be my say. Also April, you wanted to say something: Doug I'd be real curious. What you're able to say to restaurants, because I am running into that periodically, where I've gone in and just said, look at you've got to do a better job of separating people or clearing the sidewalk. I do not want our neighborhood to be yeah a. I am scared to death of our second wave starting yeah. I know it's coming, but it's the same time. Oh come on Peter they're not going to listen to you individually, even though you're a mocker, you know well, I do not know I'm trying. So if I can hear other words or other things to be said, I'm interested to hear what other people are saying, but at some point Peter I would say from your point of view, given your position, you know you can always tell them. You know I encourage you to follow the regulations, and you know these are the regulations you know it's up to. You know just be aware that there could be consequences. If you do not, if you do not, you know, that's all you can do yeah. I think it's worth. I think it's. It is worth it especially if it's a neighborhood place and you know the proprietor. I think it does not hurt to say something you're. The mayor has. It has said that we can continue to run these kinds of street cafes permanently and they would not want to jeopardize their ability to operate next season. So you know, I think, just letting them know like hey guys. You do not. You may not realize it, but people are watching you and they may be calling 311 and reporting you and then, when you're going to apply next year, you know these it might. It might hurt your chances, maybe that's the way to approach it. That's true, but I think that just from my experience there are a lot of establishments bars. Restaurants, that there's a couple of things: they're close to going out of business, so they're just trying to get every dollar they can before they run out. That's sad, but it's reality, and there are some operators that just do not care and they and it's not. They do not even care during Covid-19. They do not care at any time. They do not care about noise, they do not care about crowds, they do not care about trash, they do not care about anything, and these are the same people who do not care about being compliant or taking responsibility to protect themselves, their customers, their employees in the neighborhood and, unfortunately, you could, you could say to them, hey and I feel like if you do this you're, almost putting yourself in a position of retaliation in a way because a lot of times these places are going to say, go, you know, do what you know go you know whatever yourself. You know, that's what they're going to say it's on your right, but I was only talking about cases where you know the proprietor, like also, and also, let me just say that, like we have such a large population of older people on the upper West side, I agree the Doug's point I mean I was I mean I have to be honest. I was at Seraphina and I was shocked and not only do they have tables on the curb they do not even have expansion on the curb, so God forbid that, like a car would jump the sidewalk they would plow right into these people. They do not even have a barrier on that side. You want to put people on the curb at least put a barricade there of some kind, but they're not even doing that, and then you see these older people trying to get through the block. It's really unfortunate, but this falls on D.O.T to be enforcing. You know well I'll, give you a great example arena. We warned a really good proprietor. Very you know who's been in the neighborhood for 20 years on the corner of 83Rd and Amsterdam, and he opened his precipitously opened his windows, but he had a permanent roof. You know he had doors that opened completely so because his older customers were not comfortable sitting curbside and he got nailed by Soa, not D.O.T got nailed by SLA and before oh gosh, two weeks, rightfully so by the way yeah two weeks, and we had warned him. It's not like, and then he said well, I did not know. I said yes, you did you know so, but he had been so. You can only go so far, but if there's something that's really egregious and I think it behooves all of us as residents of the upper West side, then you do call 3- 1- 1, because it's the same thing with the masks. You know I mean I've, almost gotten punched. You know because I've yelled at people with master told people wear a mess at a certain point- everybody's very sensitive and very reactive. So I think it you know Peter have relationships, we all have relationships with repriors, but in some cases it may be. You know it's a great look. Maybe you know it may be. You know it may be just better to call 3- 1- 1. If you know and say hey look. I wish you were compliant and they say well, you know all go to old and then you just call 3- 1- 1 and if there are enough calls that's what will happen. D.O.T will give them a fine and they'll have to lose. They'll have to change their seating, most er. Everybody has been willing to make changes and I mean the so it has not become a rough thing yet, but just it is everybody's pushing the limit, or I should not say everybody. Many people are pushing many people because there's a lot of desperation out there, Peter yeah, absolutely even with good operators, because we've got a lot of good really do I've seen some great operators. You know where they're supposed to be having six foot separation of the tables, and then they get an extra deuce or someone that wants to sit and also they put the table in between and then now there's no one that has six I've seen it with my own eyes, and I have you said anything yeah. I did in this case and I won't re, but you know it's very dangerous and I think we all safety is first okay now, which brings us to the next discussion: New business, Intro 1116. I sent you guys a link, I'm wondering I know I do not know. We got this link about 20 minutes before the meeting. I know I know, because I had to wait for cooking. Let me tell you what intro 1116 was brought up in 2019 by Margaret Chin, Council member Margaret, Chin and a whole bunch of folks signing off on it. What it was to extend, expand the permits for food, vendors and food trucks for street side and curbside food trucks, because from her perspective it was a gateway to entrepreneurship, for immigrants, for you know, first time for, but so are restaurants, so are Bodegas, and so are people who pay rent, and so I find it especially in these things. So this is why I want to talk to you about it. Maybe we can have the discussion next month. If you're not comfortable, we can do another zoom, we can do a series of emails. I would like you to look into it. So what it is, we've got right now, there's and this if you read, there's no regulation. So if you have a permit a a vendor, a vendor permit food vendor. Permit food cart. Permit! You can go anywhere. You just cite it yourself. There's no situation! You're, not there's! No regulations required that you know where you can be situated as there are with newsstands, for example, so it's kind of a free- for- all and even though it extends for the next three years it starts. It would start next year, first quarter if they get it passed. So what it means is that there would be a glut of food carts and of food trucks in the various neighborhoods. Now they may not want to come to our neighborhood, for example, but they're in their neighborhoods that need more food trucks and all, but because there's no regulation they can go anywhere they want, and that means they are competing. Halal is competing against. You know, sitos and so on and pizza place is competing against a pizza place. Okay, so there's comments. Here's the discussion, barb your hand, was up first all right. I do not think this is very different from the issue that came up in 2018. I was still working for the Columbus avenue bid. Then I was very involved with this. I know Andrew Ridgie was as well, and this is not that different, there's one here. What it's the same! One they resurrected it yeah, there's a little more that they now have some kind of a special committee that they're putting together for for vendors, but there's no enforcement. As you know, I'm Peter, I'm sure you do before you we'll see Barbara. If you excuse me from what I've read from what I've read, there are some new stuff there that I had not seen before. They are actually advocating for the creation of the informant's unit and they're more specific about it. This time, they're also advocating for a permit to beat by borrow so that so many permits for this burden is only on, let's say in the Bronx only in Manhattan, only in Queens only you know, and I really said that they were going to do a specific areas with it, but it was not explicit in what I've read there, where the specific areas would be and then, as you said, they're also advocating to create a a committee or a commission. You know of street vendors, brick and mortar places and all that to to work with it. So it is better, but I think we need to study it. A little bit better, so you know so that we can come up with our own suggestions. I just wanted to say that there's a huge problem with enforcement with vendors and I'm sure that Peter has dealt with this too, where you have one guy who sets up two other guys, his left and his right. They do not have any licenses, but they xerox their real license. They're, not that person they can get very hostile, very nasty. If you try to deal with them, the police do not want to be bothered with it. There's too much other stuff going on now. I have not dealt with this in you know a year but yeah. I do not see that this is awful, it's awful and so absolutely the wrong time. When we're trying to keep our shops open so yeah, I mean competing against somebody: who's paying rent who's, paying payroll taxes, who's, paying it's a big difference. Doug, you had your hand up yeah, so there's a number of issues, and I actually promised one of the merchants in our neighborhood a grocery store that I would I would relay his message, which is that this particular grocery store in this neighborhood pays over a hundred thousand dollars a month in rent and every day. Fruit stands open up within feet of his store, and his point to me were a number of points he's inspected regularly on all of his produce and he's some of the supplies that are being sold again. This is not. This is alleged. Some of those some of the fruit and produce is not necessarily inspected. The same way that his produce is, and it's a you know, direct. You know it's just direct competition and we've seen it in so many other cases where a vendor with no restrictions will just pull up in front of a competitive business and undercut them when they're paying no rent. They do not have the same kind of obligations under the health department. There are, some of them are cooking right and with they have their generators and gas right, and so a restaurant has to have a proper vent all the way up to the roof, and it has to be you know, inspected, and these guys are cooking and do not get me wrong, I'm from New York. So I love a hot dog and a pretzel and a canis. That's not what I'm talking about this is. This is getting to be a real issue and the other issue that I, because I watched some testimony back in 2018 the licenses themselves were there was a huge black market for this. These licenses right, so someone had a license, they paid 250 dollars and then they end up selling it to somebody else for 3, 000 or 30 000 and so they're, making money on the city's back and if anyone's, going to make money. So I've heard the idea that all licenses that are current completely get you know just torn up and you issue brand new licenses and the people that actually are licensed have to be the same individual or you know I, but I the biggest pet peeve. I have are our competitive businesses opening up right in front of a brick and mortar. So I it's not that we do not. We are a city of street vendors, it makes, or you know, but there's got to be better regulation and also health department inspection. How do you know? I mean you're dealing with raw chicken or a lamb or beef? You know there was some discussion about their grades like the restaurants are graded, but I just think it's not in, but that's not in the legislation. Right. Oh that's, great, exactly is that in Covid-19. Hopefully it will be. You know this will be over by second or third quarter 2021. But if this, if this legislation passes, that means it's a free- for- all for a food truck to you know to be able to go, but to a but a curbside seating in a restaurant and maybe serve the same food right. So it's going to add lots of street more stuff on that street clutter. So the question is: would anybody like to take a stab at a letter? Do we think a letter is effective? I think we have to make a statement. I know mark it's a bci statement. You look tired, I'm sorry! It would not be a community board station before we do that. I'll say that we should table the discussion. We should go back and study the legislation and have one another meeting to have a real discussion, but we can really discuss it on the merits and then we can talk about doing the letter yeah. The other thing is that Andrew's not here- and I know that he knows all about this way already. I spoke to him earlier tonight. He said he wanted to be a prize of this because he's very much against you too. Obviously yeah. I watched his testimony yeah. We should put this on the agenda so that folks know because they will come. They did come to a previous meeting before I was chair about this and it's fair to give them that hearing. That said, I have. I have no patience for these unregulated and, what's the word, I'm looking for fairweather friends, they show up when it's profitable, to take the excess business away from our brick and mortar stores and then disappear and go God knows where else there are communities who are successful in having. I think it's actually a zoning issue where they deem an area not hospitable to zoning, which is why there are no food carts on fifth avenue in the 50s and why there are in effect 12 at the right outside the trump hotel in Columbus circle. Under the current regulations, there are certain areas that are prohibited right, but it's very hard to become right. Yeah right had a deleterious impact on the these small stores will be on fit in the 50s between 6Th, Avenue and 7Th Avenue, because they're competing you know with the obon pans they're competing with and they're losing they're losing traction depending pretty and you've got the food trucks and people are lining up around the food trucks, not that they're less expensive. They may be more interesting, but that's what they do. They do have an impact and not a positive impact on brick and mortar yeah. So let's do this right as it were. Let's invite the other two bids and hope that Peter can join us too, because I'm sure that Monica and Nicole will have plenty to say right and let's and let's hear from the there will be immigrant advocates for sure that come and we should hear them and then and then let's do a resolution and see where, wherever that leads us Allison. I just wanted the inherent hypocrisy with that whole idea, because I do not know what a bodega is. I do not know what a vegetable store owned by a korean family now second generation is, retail has always been a gateway, including my great grandfather, who owned a general store in South bend Indiana from Lithuania Retail has always been a gateway to immigrants and to say that brick and mortar does not have the same standing as a food truck. Is ludicrous I'd like to invite some of the restaurants and stores that are concerned that have spoken to me? Maybe they would be wonderful? Okay, so should we do this for November yeah, definitely yeah for the November yeah, we'll put it on the agenda guys unless, unless they're certain somebody wins the election and I'll be in Canada, so Australia yeah you're not going anywhere in Canada. Because can I tell you something? I have clients, I have clients and Laurie sobo. You know publisher, they've already bought places in Canada. It's not that easy to be there of course, see you later very much from in Toronto, so I'm hoping she'll put me up for a while Robert SBA just joined us just like two seconds ago, hey Robert looks like this meeting's wrapping up. Is there something you wanted to jump in on before you? We go amuse yourself, robert you're, muted, still and jump in quickly unmute or do not. Although good to see you good to see you, how are you I just walked in so I figured let me jump in the meeting. I did not even know what time it was. So thank you, oh good night, hello and today, okay, so I think, should we let's see it's, it's 7 50. a great time for a martini. So should we call in tonight folks yup, let's go tonight? Thank you. Thank you for coming participating. What's the old one vote for the kennedy of your choice but vote for the right one, please you're, coming from Chicago.
