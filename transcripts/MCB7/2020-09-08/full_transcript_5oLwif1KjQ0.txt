Okay, how's it going guys hi there good to see you christian, hey, howard, I'm there do you see the message that Noel said a little a few minutes ago, just a few minutes ago. Yeah. I guess we'll have to try to figure out what he's got going on right, hey ken yeah. If Noelle has figured out how to do this, then that would save us a couple of steps yep as long as it conforms to what we were putting in our bylaws amendment, which I think it will mark correct me. If I'm wrong, there was the resolution calling for specific sites on West loading zones at specific sites on West End Avenue in Central, Park West, but other than that I looked. I do not think there were other resolutions calling for loading zones. It was probably embedded in the in the bike Lane ones. I looked at the one that was adopted in connection with cobit and there was nothing in there Amsterdam and you know we. This is on me as much as anybody else be remember. Victor scalise was approaching us about changing the parking regulations at certain intersections so that so that handicapped vehicles could pull up to the to the curb cut. Yes, I need to. I need us to get back to that. So I'm going to say something about that tonight during new business and then I'll try to follow up with him and find out exactly what we need to do great yeah. Hmm. So I had a first tonight I was paying a shiva call by zoom or virtual. Remember, bruce at the hardware store or used to be at the hardware store his dad passed away over the weekend, so they actually had a shiva sitting shiva by zoom. Some zooming shiver. That's interesting! You can not bring cake that way. I know it's the that's what I was thinking too: hey Andrew, Hey, Mark, hey Andrew, hey howard, all right, I'm going to start the webinar that will allow the attendees to come in and the recording to begin so we're a couple minutes early, but I thought let the attendees get in and the price goes. The Ira Gershon Horn is the first attendee welcome. Ira and for once, we have a meeting where the number of attendees is not in the hundreds, if not thousands. How about that? Oh howard, did you see that the long island railroad held a press conference this morning to announce an update to the long island, railroad train time? Now you can see how crowded the diesel trains are and the history of when the most crowded trains are and which ones you might want to avoid pretty sophisticated yeah pretty sophisticated. Did you see the article recently why London's public transportation system is in much better shape than New York very interesting as well? Very interesting, it's nice that a certain country understands how important their transit system is to the future. Well, also, there's interesting that they, the number one reason was there's. No one person responsible the governor can put point the finger at the MTA that can point the finger at the mayor that could point the finger at the federal finance. There are just so many when everyone's responsible, no one's responsible, you bet Andrew, do you want to do the introductions tonight? I think I did it last time. I'm happy to do it. It's just item. One is your item, so you should introduce that one for sure I'll do I'll do item one. We can alternate whatever right. I did speak to Montessori or I emailed with them concerning tonight's request for for a play street. So I hopefully they've done everything they need to do and they'll be on board tonight and show up yes and show up it's like the old adage. You got to be in it to win it. The lottery. Hi everybody, hey, hi, Doug howdy, I'm going to have to get a fall verdi square photo! It's the green. The tree relates have not changed yet. Doug do not worry well with global warming. I think it'll be you know. I hear that Los Angeles had the highest temperature in the history of record, keeping yesterday yeah 21., I heard 123 or either it's was that in city limits or east yeah in the valley, wow and then in a single day Denver, I think, broke a record for highest and then lowest right, so you're getting a snowstorm 25, something like that dropped about 70 degrees. But you know the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere on earth was in El, Aziziah Libya, and I think it was 136 or seven. So that's pretty scary. That is scary. Yes, and there was that town in Russia, literally above the Arctic circle that reached over 100 degrees, fahrenheit wow. They usually they asked what they usually do in the summer. They said that we usually go snowboarding and what day of the year was that it was sometime this summer it went over 100 degrees, there, wow scary, it's snowing in Colorado right now for anyone here, I'm not there. My parents are, and it's an 80 or 90 degree change there or something yeah. It was 90 degrees yesterday and it's 37 degrees and snowing. Now, that's really scary yeah but snow does not stick if it's not below 34.. Well, it's sticking. I do not know when the last time you were in the photos of the rockies, but it is definitely sticking there shall we get started. My clock is showing 6:36, 31 or yeah, actually hang on just a couple of seconds: hi colleen thanks for joining, because a couple of our committee members are, I resent the zoom link at 5:30, but apparently not everybody got either the original or the other one. So I'm going to go back and try to resend it one more time. So please give me just a couple of seconds: okay, oh shoot what the hell happened. Julian. Are you going back to school yeah? Next, not this coming Monday but Monday after that yeah, I'm not hanging out blended learning, but I'm in the I'm in the fourth cohort, so I'll be trying it out in like the second week but yeah I thought stye was not having any person at all. There was a lot of people advocating for fully remote learning, but our plan that we've ended up choosing we had to create an exception model is basically full remote learning, except the students who opt into blended do their full remote learning from either the gym the auditorium or the cafeteria. So the students who are coming into the school building are just sitting with their device inside a space and not actually interacting with their teachers, which is it's a weird model, there's nothing that has something like that yeah, it's weird. Are you going to go in or just going to stay remote Nyu students having a party with hundreds of students in Washington, Square Park in the world? I saw that no masks all right, so William Ortiz was able to join us. I'm not sure what happened. I resent all the zoom links at 5:30 tonight and still a couple people did not get them yeah. I received the link for tomorrow's bci meetings. I think maybe you might have mixed the names or the committees possibly but anything's possible, but you were in the list. So I do not know why. I think that's John has not updated the list, but it was me who's doing it. So we can't blame John on this one anyway, so anyway, howard and Andrew, whenever you're ready go ahead, yep we're ready. It is now 6 34. welcome everyone to the September meeting of community board, Manhattan Community board, 7's transportation committee, I'm howard Yaris, and I'm co- chair of the committee. Andrew Albert is the other co- chair, hello folks, and we are going to alternate to tonight with the agenda items. I will take agenda item, one which should go very quickly because it's my agenda item and I'm not proposing a resolution, I'm just this is more informational. I think we can all admit that there, the proliferation of deliveries has resulted in a lot of double parking: a lot of obstruction of roads, traffic, unsafe conditions, all sorts of problems we have adopted resolutions, one in particular comes to mind calling for loading zones on Central, Park, West and Western Avenue. I live on central park, West, there's literally not one loadings down there, so this is more informational. I'm just interested in people's comments lost your audio. Looked into this or have done anything it froze up for a second, it's back to our request to put in a few loading zones to enable this great increase in deliveries to legally yep. Okay, we're merely going to be sending a follow- up letter. That's the informational component, I'm just wondering if anyone had any oh, this is freezing up everywhere. I have I have one coming. I know that since we now have the protected bike lane on Central Park West, which has produced parking, it makes it more difficult for when people do not park on either side, so yeah lots of zones are called for. That is. That is definitely an issue. The loss of 425 parking spaces on the east side of Central Park West. In the request for loading zones on Central Park West. That makes it a lot more difficult to put that kind of restriction in. But there are some special cases on the street that probably need it for sure. Howard went out. Maybe he realized he. There was a problem with his connection and he's probably going to come back in a second he's here. He's your boy, oh he's here, Andrew Howard, you're, muted. I could just as I could not hear what the request is that we're talking if howard, can kind of really point out this a little bit. I just was not sure it definitely blanked down, and I could not hear a lot of what you said. There is no request, it's just purely informational. The double parking is a problem. We've adopted resolutions in the past and we're just merely it's purely informational, following up with the DOT on these resolutions we've adopted because it does not seem it's only gotten worse, that's the whole point and I have to apologize. I'm calling in from an place that I'm that's not my home and the internet may be less reliable. Howard. Has anyone canvassed or spoken to representatives from the buildings along Central, Park West to gauge their concern or their interests? Obviously, as Andrew said, they had a lot of concern about the elimination of all those parking spaces and I think it would behoove us and certainly D.O.T to to take the temperature of the people along central Paul Quest to see what their interest or objections to loading zones might be. Well again, we've already adopted a resolution on this, so this is merely following up, but any information. That's why I ask for information, input criticisms. If you have any information, I can tell you in my building, people find this to be an enormous problem. My next neighbor is 100 years old and I saw her navigating between park a double parked car and other parked cars. So it's a real problem where we are so yeah. Any further information would be useful, but again the whole point of this is just for. Following up on things we've already done. Could I ask Colleen a question? Howard hi. Absolutely, yes, go ahead, hi Colleen, you did a pilot on or is or in the midst of a pilot are not you on West End Avenue. Can you tell us how that's going? We did a pilot on what the loading zones yeah I'd have to get back to the board on that, because I do not have any information on that with me. I can find that from our Bio Engineering division and get back to the board, but I know the board had sent a resolution on this and I think a follow- up letter is good, howard. Okay, we will put that together for you, but it is. It is troubling. I I'm just pretty kind of stating the obvious on my street, literally between nine and six. There is never it's there's two lanes in one direction. There is never use of two lanes. I mean never 72nd street, where we just recently adopted a resolution. There is, I thought that the double the lane of double parked cars was similar to the lane of cars parked along the curb it was a solid wall. Is the D.O.T looking at this and we're just curious what the Drt has to recognize? This is a problem. I just wonder what they're doing with regard to this I mean when it comes to loading and unloading areas, and especially when we install the bike lane, we look at cross streets to see how we can add to that being that we've took away. You know quite a few parking spaces where a lot of parking spaces in the area. I would say that you know our parking division or our engineer. Division would probably go out there and do the survey to see what locations would be feasible to add those additional loading zone spaces if we're doing right now. I do not believe we are given the constraints and the lack of resources. We have to go out there in the field. I guess Covid-19 has thrown a wrench into it. But again when we adopted this resolution, there are zero loading zones. It is literally impossible for Amazon ups, the Us, the U.S mail, all of these organizations to do their businesses legally, where we, where I live, there are zero spots. So it's a it's a real problem and I and Covid-19 is the biggest problem we face, but again to the extent that any resources could be devoted to this. It would be great sure, definitely our there's a hand up and some by a person, who's also putting something into the chat. So at the right point you may want to call on folks. I do not. I do not see the handout it's Mark. Friedman Bill Ortiz has his hand up okay and we have rich robins too and rich robbins, so Mr Friedman. Why do not you go first, then Bill Ortiz and rich robbins, Mr Friedman. You have to unmute yourself, oh maybe I have to unmute him. Sorry, I was in the process of giving that power to you, howard, but I'll get I'll. Get you all right. Okay, I think I now have a voice now you can hear we can hear you. Thank you. Well, I live on West End Avenue, and there is a some loading zones have been put on West end Avenue, each Alternate Street, the East side gets one. The West side gets one. I think the long and short of it is. It does not solve any problems because they are not used the trucks that you refer to, whether it's ups or others. I happen to know this because my sons worked at ups prefer not to use a loading zone spot. The worst thing that could happen to one of those trucks is that they in fact get double parked in. They have no interest in leaving the car in a parking spot. They are told to leave it double parked, you're, not solving anything. By doing that, you're only taking away parking spots- and I will mention the parking spots- I should disclose I'm a little older, they're actually used by older people, so howard, your reference to the 100 year old person that has to navigate the street. It's actually the 100 year old person, who's more likely or the older person is more likely to need the parking spot rather than the younger people, so that wraps it up. Errol fairness, there's an enormous problem out there and again D.O.T has to look at it. Our idea was loading zones if they think there's a more effective way to address this problem of rampant double parking. We're all here at our community Board yeah howard as usual, there's at least 10 alternate ideas, many of which I could suggest just do not mention loading zones. You keep putting them onto the wrong solution by giving them the answer. They accommodate your request. They feel then they are responsible to the community, but their job should be to find the solution independently. They're the expert I could say 100 agreed our letter- will really make it clear that the problem is double parking. We have. We have, we've had a couple ideas, one of which is loading zones, but we defer to them, as I've said so many times in these meetings. They are the experts, not I who's next bill Ortiz. I just had a couple of questions to point out there. Maybe Colleen may have some of the answers. Do we know of any other areas in Manhattan or even all of New, York City, say Bronx Brooklyn Queens that are currently using loading zones and those communities are similar to ours. What has been successful? What have been some challenges because I know we're talking about it. It's up in the air, but my I like the idea of loading zones, so it can be a streamlined process for shipment and deliveries to be done in an efficient manner. Just my fear is that these companies, whether it's fresh, direct or whomever, would want to park in a very specific area if they have, let's say the loading zones on 62nd street, but they have a bunch of shipment for the high hundreds you know. Are they really going to go there? Are they going to try to sneak their way through? You know the hundreds drop off a couple of trucks and some bikes, you know so just wondering what we have seen around New York city. That has been successful to make this happen and how we address concerns of kind of sneaking around the system to accomplish that goal. Dude. That's really an excellent question because I do not know if we did a cross borrow impact study to see how effective these are in terms of one area in one particular community board, as opposed to other, I would imagine- or at least I would think, a lot of the seabees they they are very unique and different in their boundaries and in terms of the deliveries that they get. And someone mentioned that because of Covid-19 they've seen an increase in delivery, which is deliveries which is really very true, but I would not know how successful they have become, but I will find out if there is or if we have done any study initial study and what the findings were with that. I will I'll look into it and I will get back to the board, but that's a really great question: if there is some kind of impact studies and how effective it has been in other community boards and colleen, oh colleen, if you could also look at something, I've pointed out a number of times on the in the case of the Columbus and Amsterdam avenue loading zones, I knew this was going to be the case. Unfortunately, I was proven correct if a delivery is being made to- let's say the West side of 83Rd street, but the loading zone is on the east side. They do not use the east side and walk the delivery acrosss they double park where the loading zone is not, and I wonder if Dftp has done any kinds of studies on compliance with loading zones. I can find out okay, rich than Steve Brown than Jay at all. So two quick comments on the the ticketing of double park vehicles. I just responded in chat. I saw that Ira Gershonhorn wrote that the police do not enforce double parking. They actually do. They give out a lot of tickets, but for one the delivery companies factor these the cost of the tickets into the cost of doing business, and they also pay a reduced rate if they have a lot of tickets- and I think for me it's a policy issue of getting whether it's City, Council or the state to come up with some new category of aggravated double parking that can't be reduced down and might get more expensive. The more you do it because it's a real safety hazard double parking. I like that I'll also know that the other is totally separate. Issue is on Central Park West. I know 400 parking spots were removed, 425 and those were all Tuesday Friday spots, and I had said a year ago when we passed this, that D.O.T should talk with sanitation and see if it might be possible to make half of them Monday Thursday spots and half Tuesday Friday, so that we're not losing all of the the spots for two days a week, but not impacting the other two days at all so Colleen. I do not know if that's something that could be looked into right. That's all for me, yeah I'll, just note that the city has a policy of the larger the company, the lower the fine yeah Crazy Steve Brown you're up. Can I got a couple comments, but I did have a question that I put in the chat. When was that resolution that you're talking about howard that was passed? I'm just curious. I do not know the resolution I unfortunately do not have. I do not have the exact date, I'm pretty sure it was again December 2018. I mean multiple years ago. Right I mean it definitely has not been in the last okay. I think it was like two years ago: okay, Steve, we all went out and surveyed blocks sections of blocks and and saw where it was appropriate and where it might not be appropriate for the loading zones. Okay, I did want to offer some information. I printed something out. There is a program that is addressing this on West end it was put in last year. This is kwon the D.O.T, I'm quote: unquote we're looking at more efficiency to utilize, curb space and reduce the number of double parked cars. The new parking regulations along the portions of the West end have been city- wide residential loading zones. The loading zones will work to provide curb space during daytime and evening hours to allow the pickup and drop off for passengers, as well as loading of loading and unloading of goods and helping more efficiently to utilize, curb space and reduce the number of double parked cars, DOT notified and all the Community Board chairs and elected officials before implementing, and we will evaluate the effect of some connection to give results. So, if you're asking for information to there is Ken mentioned, there is a program. It is a pilot program and it is supposed to specifically be about this, and my suggestion is rather than what's going on. Why do not you specifically find out what's going on with this program and what is the data? I think that would be the most efficient thing I live on Riverside. I do not see it. You know I do not experiencing the same things as howard. I do not see the proliferation of car of drop- offs. I think West end actually all the cars that I know. I can't speak to the Van to drop- offs, but vans. I mean people dropping off, are using these curbsides. There was a lot of car space taken away again very frustrating, but I would I would do that before we're sort of advocating doing something else I'll speak to west end, not on central park. My other two points are: I just want to caution that we have a very delicate ecosystem, that we speak on a lot of different topics and I think the ecosystem of you know parking spots, although to many people is not a great topic this. These are people that are first responders. These are people. This is, you know, a third of the people and they're very nervous, and I would just be very, I would just be very nervous, continuing bringing up topics that somehow end up leaving in more parking spots, and I think, there's a you know. We have all got behind the vikings because it makes sense that will get rid of parking spots. I think we have to take in all the people and I would just be cautious about talking about loading zones and this zone's just it feels like maybe we're going back to that period of time where there was a lot of conflict on here and I'm going to voice that I speak to people that have to commute out of the area nurses going to different areas. They are parking and they need these parking spots, and I just think we have to stop thinking of them as casual things to take away, and I think that for the last 100 years there's been people since cars have started. There's people double parking. I do not think it's any worse or any better. I think it's an issue, and I think riches I'd be in other diets, but I'm just not for taking away parking spots in the middle of a pandemic and wait in which we sort of talk about often that this is a lot of a lot of issues and I'd like to just make that point. We've got to be consistent, it's not the time to be doing that and I'm actually against even sending the letter because the letter it's two years ago, it's not a recent. I do not think it absolutely. This resolution reflects modern thinking and I personally would not even want you to send a letter just so you know, because I do not think that this resolves the thinking of this board as we speak, you have to stop getting rid of parking spots. I do not think loading zones are, you know, there's other ways to look at it and we have to stop piecemealing the laws of loading of a parking spot. Steve you did bring up. You did bring up a good point which was raised earlier, which is we should get an update from D.O.T on how West End Avenue and the changes that we're seeing there are. We have a program, I mean you have a program. Everyone knows about it, howard, the two of us chatted once about it. So you know it's here. You know if you want a next step, get the update on the program absolutely, and I will find out from my colleagues when we can do that. Okay, thank you great and we'll note that in the letter yeah first of all, let me say I second everything that Stephen just said and a couple of observations, partly as a preface to a question that I have for Colleen. I live on West End, Avenue and I live in the zone. The 87th to 95th street zone. That is still a quote open street West end Avenue, as especially in that area, is a logistical nightmare. Prior to the pandemic, West End Avenue was narrowed from two lanes on each side to one making drop- offs and double parking, a dangerous activity, and now with the streets. They call them open, I call them closed to all, but local traffic 12 hours a day, local traffic people who have to do pick up and drop off and turn to go on to Riverside or Broadway, plus the normal deliveries plus sanitation vehicles. And now, as the school year starts, we have a slew of school buses in the morning and in the afternoon it's an absolute nightmare. So Steven's observations are. Excuse me Andrew's observation for somebody, whether it's if it's D.O.T, fine, looking at West, End, Avenue and seeing what's happened, is absolutely essential plus for a few block area. Con Edison has been there closing down what little space there is for the for the last couple of months. I think they're replacing gas mains along there. So as a preface to my question to colleen we're now in stage four, let me add to that observation. Living along West end the closed street. Virtually nobody uses that street except a limited number of pedestrians every now and then who could easily be walking on what are some of the widest sidewalks in our district? So with the city being in stage four at this point, what is the schedule for closing these open streets and restoring them back to the way they were before, not to mention the unintended consequence of traffic being a total mess on Broadway? Turning on 96th street access to the West side? Highway, I mean it's created a catastrophe, so when a when, are they going to restore these streets to their normal usage sure so the closed street concept again, that was, that is a program that we initiated over the summer to allow for the social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic. It's my belief that, of course, the streets are going to be reopened. I do not know exactly when they're going to be reopened, but once I have more information we'll share that with all the community boards, because we have closed several streets to allow for social distancing in in Manhattan, and these streets are maintained by the partners that we have who come out and put the barricades out and then remove the barricades after you know, you know the closure has ended. So I'm sure when we have that or when I have that information, it will be announced. Okay on West End, Avenue yeah, it's, unfortunately, the police that have had to absorb the the job of putting up and removing the barricades, and that's simply another factor in why it seems so inane to leave those streets. So- called open at this point, especially with these wide sidewalks. Frankly, social distancing was never a problem and Jay. We have an item about. We have an item about a request for a neck down, because when school starts, Westin Avenue is going to be a very different kind of street. Obviously, yes, can I just say this was merely supposed to be an update on a follow- up letter on a double parking problem and not a general discussion about open streets. So it's going way off unattended. Good luck with that. Howard. Good luck with that I know tangents of where we love to go ken yeah. I was originally going to talk about parking, but I once again I feel like I'm living in a different city from Jay. I'm not seeing you're right you're rapidly trying to create the city you want. I am hundreds of people a day. Thousands of people perhaps are enjoying the open street on West End, and I know for a fact it's a safer street, so I would love to see it become permanent and and also the cross streets like 103Rd, but back to parking. We have a. I mean it would be great in the best of all possible worlds to provide free car store, long- term car storage for people on our curbs. But we also have a rampant double parking problem and we know that double parking is very dangerous for all street users and we also know that providing free parking to people is one of the main incentives for owning a car and using a car. So do we as a board and we as a city really want to be encouraging car ownership and usage, particularly at this time, when we're trying to get people on bikes, get people on back on mass transit. So we have a choice. You know it's a question of free car storage or doing something to make our streets function better. It's actually pretty limited free car storage and there are not any number of people that must have a car. You know my feeling is: let's make the transit system as great as we can as affordable as we can and as easy to use and safe as we can and that's how we get people out of cars, but the person that's driving to a job in oredel, New Jersey, for instance, or way out in hop og. You know some people need a car. We do not have to penalize our residents, who need who actually happen to need a car. Well, I suggest a real quick thing here. Maybe the chairs could call on the three remaining hands or two remaining hands and then sort of wrap up at the end right now they really need to move on yep. This is just an informational, roberta and then Barbara, I had my hand up, and I kind of annoyed that you called on somebody twice before you call them on those of us who have not spoken, but I'd like to move this on. I think we need to get information from Colleen. We have an agenda that is long and we've all almost been 30 minutes on this. Yes, barbara yeah, I not to belabor this. I just want to say that I agree with Steve Brown's comments. I am not in favor of writing a letter. I think. If the letter does go out, it should be a vote of the committee, which is how, in my opinion, all letters that are written by committees are approved by the whole board, they're, not written by one chair or two co- chairs, and I and that's what I'm asking for Barbara point of information. This is not a policy. This is really reiterating the resolutions we've adopted. He ate that howard, but this was a resolution that was passed over two years ago and it's you do not send a follow- up letter without sending it to committee members to ask them for approval. In my opinion, yes, if it's something new, but this again we're just moving on. But the point is that this is a resolution that has not been acted on by the DOT and we're merely asking for the status of what they're, what they're doing that's all this all is that this letter is going to do if we, if we just can't, ignore the resolutions, I think actually that would be inappropriate. Well, you do not have to accommodate, but my request is that we vote on it on this and it's not just the letter on the status of the loading zones. It's also as you've heard a status on West, End Avenue and how the new arrangement has worked out again. It's merely a follow- up. I've debated whether it's so we're going to move on to something new, which is a request for a neck down at the southwest corner of 96Th Street and Weston Avenue next to the public school. Is there someone here to speak about that? I am oh roberta. I had roberta so the problem with the neck down we and colleen well knows: we've asked for this. We had a woman was almost killed at that spot and I'm sorry I've forgotten her name, but she has come before the community board many times to explain about that street. She and I and Colleen, worked. We tried to get the board of her building to what happens right now is if you have a neck down the building on the corner with the neck down signs some kind of agreement with DOT that they will maintain and care for the neck down. Unfortunately, the neck down is next to the school, and the school can not sign this waiver. I had recently seen a resolution passed by board four, which I forwarded to howard and I'm not sure if I forward it to you Andrew, but I'm sorry. If I did not anyway, they have a resolution with a similar situation where they requested that D.O.T agree to do this without the the school signing on it. There is a local community that are willing to work on it, but they do not have the ability to sign a contract with the city. So I suggested to howard that we have a resolution similar to what Ward 4 had and the community. The local community has agreed that they will work to clean the sidewalk and maintain it during the time when the school is closed. Roberta, do you happen to know if the agreement that you're speaking about with board 4 had any special requirements after, for instance, a snowfall or anything like that? No okay, I can get you a cop. The resolution is very simple, okay and has it been approved by D.O.T? I do not know. I do not know what the status is. Oh okay, because we've been asking for this for ages, I know, but well before somebody was killed there in fact right, but the problem is that they were told and there's been a group on the block that has been working hard to get this, but they were told that a local building had to sign a contract and the building that this woman lives in was not willing to sign the contract. Yes, whereas you know my building would be willing to sign a contract, but there you know, because of all the new building, that's going on 96th street. So I do not know. I do not know. If Colleen knows the status of that resolution, the resolution was just about, I think maybe June or July. So cb resolution is right. Cb4 resolution is relatively new and I think they sent it to us, maybe about a month and a half ago right. The thing is and Roberta- and I have we were working together to see if we can get something accomplished at that corner, and I do recall with the neck down. We need a maintenance partner for snow removal and garbage removal and we tried to get the building to help us with that. But you know, because of the you know, language with the you know with the agreement and there were concerns about liability, and I think the building did not want to take on that task in terms of becoming liable with anything and trip and fall and hurt themselves yeah and the PTA was not willing to take it on, because you know there are times when there's nobody around the school right and I think it had something to do with their contract and union, something right. So some. So where are we we're nowhere? Still, I'm just saying it can't hurt Andrew. Can somebody pardon my ignorance? Can somebody describe a neck down? It's where it's, where the sidewalk is extended out, so that it its cars have to go around it and it also you've seen them they're these big, wide sort of a circular thing at the end of the sidewalk there's now a it narrows the str, it narrows the side street and it also makes it easier to talk. Crossing I mean there's now there were flexible barriers that widened the left turn from west end on to 96 for the access to the highway that that's a different kind of thing, we're talking about on nine seconds, so this would be for cars, exiting the the parkway like no in the northbound direction, and getting off at 96th street going north going West East going east right. We want to protect people at that at the corner of West end, so it's for eastbound traffic on 96th. Basically, that would that then be forcing the two lanes that come off there into one lane before they get to west end. No, but it narrows the street. No, it will slightly narrow the street and of course, if you're making a right, southbound turn onto west end, you'll have to be in that southernmost lane. Obviously, but there'd still be two lanes yeah. Okay, a lot of us have a whole bunch of us stood there. Marissa may have also been there, but I know I know Helen has, and I know that Andrew has and I'm not sure what the board has, but we have stood there at school Crossing times. Maybe Mark has also been there, and we've watched I've been there at other times as well and watched the crossing guard has a really hard time maintaining safety for the children crossing the street. It can't hurt to ask, and the fact that board 4 has already requested, may make our case a little stronger. So I'd like to propose a resolution that community board seven requests a neck down at that particular corner. Have we ever done this in a resolution before roberta? I think we have, but we can certainly do it again. I think we have. We may already have resolutions about that particular intersection. Are you going to recommend language as to the maintenance of this, or just say, as per the agreement with board 4, or how are you going to word it? Why do not? I get bored four's resolution which I unfortunately do not have in front of me, and the language was very simple. Okay, when would you get it because, if we're proving this tonight, I'd get it, but in the morning, okay, so you want to. It was basically various. It was just basically not talking about maintenance. It was just talking about that. D.O.T would provide a and agree to put the neck down. Okay, anybody from have any comments on this before we move this, because I think we've been roberta said she wanted to raise a resolution. I want to second it and I want to say that we should vote on it tonight and not wait for a language. It seems simple enough that we can write our own language. We propose a neck down on 96th street. Well, you can't you either have to vote or not. You can't vote on. If the resolution comes about tomorrow, we can't vote on it. You can do it now. The resolution I'm proposing is that we request a neck down without a sponsor for the corner of Southwest Corner languages, southwest corner of 96Th and west end along 96th street, with without the necessary, without the need for a signature. Well, actually, the resolution. The proposal has been proposed and seconded. If it's okay, we can all vote, we can yeah all those in favor. You still have hands raised. I do not know. Okay, oh yeah, they are raised. Is there a discussion on this issue, if not put your hand down? Otherwise, I will call on you well we're back. Can you do the lower all hands thing, because I thought we raised our hands to vote? Yes, I had my hand up to make a comment. My thing says all hands are raised, so I can't I load this up already. Somehow, okay Ken make your comment and then we'll vote. Okay. I just wanted to speak in support of this it. It's just so crazy that we are prevented from having life- saving infrastructure such as this for want of a private maintenance part partner who has to get insurance and assume liability. This is just crazy. The city should change its requirements on this, but in the meantime we should vote yes on this resolution. Okay call the question: all those in favor either raise your hand is someone on the committee willing to act as the secretary for this meeting. I hope somebody is taking minutes. Is this someone who would be kind enough to volunteer only you can see the hands only Mark and Andrew, and I see two hands in the attendees. I'm not sure what that's about but yeah. I, the rest of us can't see the hands I'll just raise it, because I can't see I it says, lower all hands. So you I do not have the option to put mine up. It thinks it's up so I'll, just vote. Okay, we have. Should we let the two community members speak yeah? Maybe we should okay Andrew as a co- host. You do not have the resign option. I do not have what option you do not have an option. Andrew! Oh you can't raise your own hand. Something was missing. I just have to raise it and Howard and Mark have to virtually raise their hand. We have to do it yeah. We have to do it physically yeah, so it looks like Mark Friedman, who was actually Daniel Friedman and then Anne Watkins had her hand up as well. Those are the two that we saw before the vote. I understand, but I thought I understood the chairs we're going to call on them for a brief comment. Yes, Mark Friedman, a brief comment: okay, Mark. Thank you for ensuring that the community gets some input into these discussions and for clarification. It's Mark, Daniel, Friedman friends. Call me Daniel got it. Okay, essentially two things. You know, I like anything that will calm the traffic at that intersection. One of the major problems, aside from the fact that all the infrastructure from the neighborhood has been moved on to 96th street and that's what causes the real problem. It's also that when they did the calming of West End Avenue, they made one lane one lane and suddenly it gets a 96th street and the one lane in each direction explodes into two lanes. So everybody switches into the left turn lane right turn lane. I got to make a move lane all at the same time. So it's a recipe for disaster. That said, if you want to do the curbs the expansion of the curb, which would have a calming effect, why is not a little bit of pressure put on people like fettner who are getting buildings on that block for free? What is the pressure put on someone else to pick up that responsibility? The school can't do it. We all understand that, but this Mr Freeman Mr Freeman, if I could interrupt both to move this along and to answer directly cb7's resolution on the fetner project raised as one of its conditions that they work with the department of transportation to be the partner for that neck down intersection, and so we've done we've used whatever leverage we can in that regard, the other person who so thank you, we're thinking quite alike, the other person howard was Ann Watkins. Do you want to call on her yeah and I do not see her hand up Ann Watkins. Thank you all so much for your work on this. I think that intersection in particular, is a really tough one for us on the upper West side with cars. You know flying through and with the school there and all of us, oh you're, breaking up. Well, I think you're gone. Do this yeah, okay, I'm inferring a thumbs up, though just so everybody is aware. We have repeatedly asked for speed cameras at West, End and 96, also from a variety of angles. That is a very unsafe intersection for a variety of reasons. People speeding down trying to beat the light people trying to make the turn northbound and then west on 96th. It's there's a host of issues there. You can't do enough for that intersection. So I move I move. I think we should vote on this. Let's call the question all those in favor either raise your hand by hitting the left hand or raise your hand physically. Let's see here, we have one two, three, four, five, six seven eight raised virtually two more physically, so it's 12. all hands down. Did you? Do you count? Eight plus two is ten you're? Sorry! Yes, you have. You have a mission as an attendee, so we have 10 voted in favor. Anyone opposed anyone abstaining one. So we have ten. It passes the committee ten zero one. Nine committee members. Sorry hang on Hang on. I think it's ten zero. Three I had Barbara William and Jay as abstaining. Is that correct? Oh, yes, 10:00 3, 10:0, 3, 0., okay, 10:0 3,0, non- committee members. Andrew! Can you do this count because I'm recording the vote? I got it. I've got Shelley and me with physical hands, cindy Christian with virtual hands. So that's four in favor you have Ira. Also. I do not see Ira. Where is this okay? So that's five? Okay, all those opposed all right! Christian is your hand. Are you against this resolution? No, I forgot the lower okay. Anyone opposed anyone abstaining okay, so we have what was it five looks like five zero one: zero, okay, five zero. Who is the abstention? Steve Brown? Okay, five: zero, one: zero! Okay! Andrew! Do you want to do the next resolution sure we're talking about the everybody knows where the tragedy occurred by 730 West end Avenue, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm going to interrupt for one. Second, it's! Actually it's not 730 west end Avenue! It's a little further up. It's actually the corner of 97th street. That's what I thought yeah it's 97:96 and there is no 730 west end avenue, as as Jane Thompson was very kind to point out to me. So it's a I'll get you the exact address. It's the Paris apartments is the address, but go ahead, but anyway, just the southeast of southeast of 97th and west end. I believe exactly right. The Paris is 752 west. Thank you. Thank you thanks Shelley, but everybody knows where we're talking about. It was supposed to be totally free of vehicles to allow for visibility for cars, moving west on 97th and turning south on West end. So we do not have another horrific murder there and unfortunately, whatever means have been used to daylight. This space are being just just ignored and trucks are parking there. Vehicles are parking in that space, so we are requesting DOT to put in boulders or any kind of I think they're called boulders. But D.O.T may have a fancy word for these. Where exactly this is the southeast corner on 97th of 97th and west end? There are now two boulders there are, but there's no boulder on the avenue side, and so trucks are believe it or not pulling into the intersection and backing into in between the boulders and the curb. Yes, I thought we requested this, which is already a very unsafe move. But can you imagine honest to God? You can't make this so up. I jump in we we've raised this many times and I know colleen you've been working on this and there's the issue of just what you can do, but what DOT has done is made this intersection more dangerous by completely blocking sight lines from 97th street into the intersection where it used to be small cars parked there. It was daylighted to make sure there was visibility, and now large trucks are using that space. It's something has to be done to prevent trucks from backing into that spot. So it's colleen from DOT we did put in the granite block and I think there was a request for another one and the reason why we can not put the other one is because the sanitation truck, I think it had to do with something with the sanitation truck, would not be able to get at that corner as well. If I'm not mistaken, I think there was a safety issue with pedestrians as well, but I have to go back to my email and see what it is, because I did respond to the Community board about that and I think Lisa Orman and I were talking about this a while back. We were going back and forth to see what we can do to make it much better, and I mean you know: the trucks really should not be there and again it's back. It goes back to enforcement. I think the regulation is a no standings, not enforcement. The pd has been there that the pd uses that spot themselves. We can't rely on them to enforce they're, not going to do it. We've seen over a period of months that they're not enforcing it and trucks are going there if we're relying on something in place there that stops a truck from backing into that to that area. Let me see how creative we can be. We certainly do not want another cooper stock on our hands at all. No, I was there today and I did see the boulders that are on this, though side street side, but you're right there. None that would keep a truck from backing into the space. That's unbelievable! Even if you put some rubber stanchions. That would stop them, but would let the the sanitation trucks come by so colleen? Are you going to get back to us on what is possible for this location? Definitely, I will thank you so much you're welcome. We have a request: yeah, nope, okay. We have a request by the Morningside Montessori School for a play street on 100Th Street between Broadway and West end Avenue. They submitted this request several months ago, and I told them when our September meeting would be so is anybody from from morningside montessori in the audience today and I'm assuming meeting notices went to them mark I'm guessing that happened. I was not aware of a particular request going to them, but the agenda's been up the way it always is, and there was an e- blast about it as well, and I told them today to the meeting of over a month ago. We could revisit it. If I mean I do not, I might I'm not from there, but I was speaking to a friend today whose kids go there, and I know that it's something they're really looking forward to. I do not know why there's no one on the call right now, but I think it's important to keep kids safe. I can't speak to all the details because it's my case I did. I did speak via email with the with somebody from the Montessori School and asked if they would have both ends of the block staffed in case somebody either with an accessorized vehicle or an emergency vehicle needed to get through, and they said absolutely and that I said, will they be in contact with the school and they said absolutely yeah Colleen, I'm kind of surprised they're, not here too, because they reached out to me as well and penny. I know penny added them on the agenda, but what I will share with the board with you and howard, is the link that we have been advising all schools to go to and apply through the department of education for the outdoor learning program. So I will share that with both you and howard and copy mark on it and if the school contacts you please share that link with them, so they can also apply through that for the open school outdoor learning. Okay, absolutely, but I'm just so surprised, they're, not here tonight, yeah. Unfortunately, we can't we can't pass it without them. Here I see Cindy's hand in case you want to sure cindy yeah, I'm on the board of another school in the district, and we did not come to transportation because we were told to use that link. So we are not doing what the normal procedure would be. We were just filling in the for like what the city has told. The heads of schools to do is to just go through directly through them through that link. So what Colleen's saying I think, is what the schools are understanding now cindy. This was for a play street, not for outdoor learning. It's. I think. It's all the same thing, though I think they're treating it all the same, because for us we do not really want it for outdoor learning. We wanted. You know some closure of the street to allow for kids to come in, and you know give them space to maybe have mask off time and things like that not to set up desks or anything. I think that my understanding from my school is that that's the way we were going. We were going through the Community Board Mark, and I spoke about this a while ago and we were kind of trying to the school was trying to feel its way through and then once we saw the link, we just decided that that's the instruction we were given was to go. That way. That's all. I think, that's probably why the school, I hope, you're right, because otherwise they're going to lose a month. I do not think that that's. I do not think the procedure anymore is to go through the community board, even for just the Play street outdoor learning. Yes on that yeah, I think so that's right, so the DOT will grant these requests without input from the Community board. I do not even know if it's a dod at this point. No, it's going through the DOE it's going to deal with yeah is it on the edoe website. I just share the link with you mark Andrew. I got it. Thank you. Thank you yeah. So, okay question. Then it's being handled it's does the oe reach out to the community board. The city has a process to either reject those applications or approve them yeah. So, let's make sure they've approved a bunch apparently already right, yep so Sarah. If you're in touch with somebody who is from that Montessori School, I'm going to forward the link to you, maybe you could send that to your contact and then, if Andrew or Howard could send the same link to whoever it was that you were in touch with, then we will have done our job. I think, if you could send it to me, sounds good appreciate it. Thank you thanks, shelly, okay, why do not we we're on to the next item, which is the review of the district needs statement? Andrew, and I have revised this. We could send out the revised version to the committee. Cindy witnesses. Excuse me, that'd be great yeah cindy. When does this have to be done by? I was hoping that everybody would get it to me before the before the steering committee meeting, because otherwise you're going to be shamed at the Steering committee meeting. Okay, we will send this out and if you have any comments, criticisms, questions alternative language. Just let me know I'll do this by tomorrow. It's definitely updated in many ways. Let's put it back, that's very helpful. Thank you very much. We cleaned it up, that's great okay, so that takes care of the district needs statement. The next thing is follow up on outstanding business, including restaurant seating and curb usage I'll just open the floor. To this I also say one thing off the top of my head. The restaurant seating, I think, is a big success. It's kept a lot of restaurants in business and I for one hope it continues, and I think our community board should help restaurants in any way. We can so there's that issue and any other issue that people want to bring up under new business. It's better- and I heard on the news today that a very sad statistic: if we do not get indoor dining by the cold weather, we may lose 65 percent of restaurants in New York City, it's pretty good yeah. I can't tell you I'm shocking as Bc I can been. You know, we've been encouraging this. You know beyond October 31st andrew with the Hospitality Alliance Hospitality Alliance will be in college and and of course, you know, they're suing the state and the city now, because they're not they're, not restaurants in Brooklyn and Staten island are suing yes right and a hospitality alliance, and I know the major last week said that they will come up with guidelines this week, but I I'm not holding my breath. I think the governor and the mayor are failing the pressure any other new business. Elizabeth is speaking, but it's not very loud. Maybe a little louder Elizabeth talk about what we should do in consultation with Bci Elizabeth. Can you repeat that you are very you're very low, so I do not know what can you hear me barely yeah? So sorry, this is the first time in six months. I've had technical issues. My comment is just that I think anything we do should be in consultation with Bci Christian. I know you're on the on the call tonight, but when it comes to the dining issue, I think we need to do that jointly. Absolutely we have two hands raised on this Steve Brown and J Adolf Steve yeah. I just wanted to bring up the issue that I briefly brought up in the board meeting and hope to either put on next month or address, but I find that there's a really big problem with with people driving the wrong way on the bike lanes, and I think it's exacerbated now because of this exact issue, because you have you know, excuse me someone's falling in my lap now that you have it's sort of tied to this issue and now that you have well it's even worse, because now that you have the restaurants with the portable areas, they're right aboved on it, I can tell you that last week I took a ride from six to eight up and down just because I kind of wanted to see what was going on. I had. I could not finish the run. I mean I had never felt. I admit this during six and eight, so maybe there's a lot of delivery foods, but it was unmanageable. It was extremely dangerous and on a couple occasions I sort of pulled over out of frustrations and I was talking to waiters and waitresses and they said they're terrified, because they only look the one way when they're sort of coming acrosss, because that's the natural thing to do, and in one case I had to run out and say stop because I think they were going to hit a waitress. I think it's a potential time bomb and I do not. I do not want I'm not a fatalist, but these bikes you're talking about or scooters or skateboards or what it's mostly. I mean it's any transportation, I'm against. It's mostly bikes, and I will say unfortunately, it's a lot of delivery guys and to rich I mean rich, can join in. I think it's complicated. I do not want to demonize people, and I do not even want to come. I just want to point out. You know maybe there's a constructive way and I do not want to demonize people, but it's a fact. It's a fact that this happens consistently and I'm telling you that what's going to end up happening is- and I do not again want to be- it's you're- going to hear about somebody- who's trying to deliver food or snapchat to go to the bathroom they're going to be hit, and now that you have the motorized ones they are coming really fast and I'd like to either ask that it'd be put as a as a you know on the next month, and I and I come to it from a constructive manner. I do not know you know, maybe there's a. I think I brought it up if there's a herd mentality to police people. Let's do it. If there's a way to do. I love New York and stop going the wrong way. Let's do it, you know. I do think that it might be interesting to tie in with Bci, because I do think a letter to restaurants telling them we are asking for you to instruct your delivery people not to go the wrong way and be a good citizen could be an interesting idea as well. But you know instead of coming this is I want tickets? I want this. I just want to point out what I think is a problem and maybe there's a positive way for that. We can do this. There's organizations that reach out to bicyclists, but I just I just feel it's a problem. I mean I literally could not finish my ride and I like to ride my bikes and although I sometimes support cars, I always support bike lanes and it's really tough. No, it's true. I've recently eaten outside both on Columbus and on Second Avenue, and I was just amazed at the wrong directions and how many times, servers and patrons were almost hit by speeding by speeding bikes, scooters, skateboards and, unfortunately, even a rebel. Yes, they're back. Okay, wait. Let me make a comment on that, actually, not that many restaurants are using their own bike delivery anymore. It's mostly the delivery services. Yes, those are the ones that we have services. I mean that's great news, I mean: let's send it to the services, then yeah, how about we get a permission from spike leaders to use his expression. Do the right thing go the right way: Jane, Howard and andrew. The this item is new business and next month's agenda. You know what new business and all business and next one's agenda are all merging, so go ahead. Okay, so go ahead. First, I have a request of the chairs, which is, I would like to send a foia request to the city of New York for the CitiBike contract and any information that the that the city has on accident on accidents involving CitiBike, renters Jay. You could do that as an individual. I know I could do it, but I think it would garner a little more attention. They have an absolutely obligation to pay attention whether it comes from one person or all 8.5 million. It's so you're not inclined to join that. I would I would you could use my name. I just do not know how to do it. You seem to know how to do it. Well, actually, I'm sure the city has a has a process which I can find out right. This should be something anybody can get and howard part of it, and I know I've you've told me before that. You've gotten generally no cooperation from Citibank when you've asked them to appear before the committee City Pike, not bank, CitiBike. Yes, yeah, that's what I said. I did not space anyway for next month's agenda. What I what I plan to do between now and then is draft a resolution which I will send to you, two chairs amending the state vehicle and traffic law, particularly the vicarious liability statute. As I'm sure you're aware, in New, York state owners of vehicles are responsible for the actions of anyone using their vehicles with their permission for a long time that statute applied to rental car companies as well, so that if I rented a car from Hertz- and I got into an accident which I was responsible for Hertz was vicariously liable and the practical effect of that was that a victim of an accident had a viable, financially secure entity that could be responsible to them because they were either a self- insured large corporation or they carried liability insurance and under the state law. A vehicle is specifically not defined as something that is human propelled, I.E, a bicycle with the with the great increase in bicycle use and with the city being a and particularly the city council, being a supporter of an increase in the CitiBike stations and the increase in Citibank. I'm concerned- and I do not have statistics only anecdotally, an assumption that the more bicycle usage you have, the more accidents there will be and right now anyone who's involved in an accident with a CitiBike user may have no viable recourse in terms of insurance or responsibility. So my proposal, in the form of a resolution which I will send to you before the next meeting, would just for the purposes of the vicarious liability statute, make it apply to companies that engage in the rental of bicycles and to make sure that we're not talking about local bicycle stores that rent a few I'll that I'll have a threshold for the number of bicycles that they would have to be renting to make them responsible, and the net effect would be that if a CitiBike rider hits a pedestrian and injures them that pedestrian will have recourse under state law against citibike, as so just a corporation wanted to simply send it to both me and Andrew. I will sounds good Sarah hi thanks yeah. I just wanted to mention for everyone on the committee and anyone listening that we are having an event. Next Thursday called we walk west end walk we're just activating the open street there with some civic organizations. Artist, Jody sperling who's on the broadway task force will be doing some of her dancing in the street, which she's done every year for the past couple years. So it's going to be all socially distanced, masks required, etc, but it should be great. I dropped a link in the chat, so you can see more information. Thank you. Sarah next up is Barbara Adler all right. I just wanted to mention that now that rebels are back, I think it's time to have them come to a meeting again and address us. The rebels seem to be somewhat out of control. I've seen them in Riverside park, they're on the greenway and they're not supposed to be so many of them are not following the rules you know I forwarded. Did I forward to you, or I did forward to the committee rebel- has been in contact with me and that this whole time I think, raised it. We asked you if we could put it on the agenda this month. Okay, we'll put it on for well again, it was. It was right before this meeting we have a whole month, we'll put it on for the next month. Thank you, I'd appreciate it. Something else I think should be on an agenda, and maybe we should get somebody from Congressman Nadler's office to be in the meeting with us because they have raised the issue before I do not know. If any of you have noticed, but the incredible increase in aircraft noise every night there's hovering helicopters everywhere. There are aircraft that are not avoiding Manhattan airspace, but are flying right over us. It's gotten to an unbelievable racket lately and I've looked up and I've used binoculars and they're hovering over Manhattan a lot of them and aircraft that are supposed to be using the rivers to go. North South are, you know to say fuel or whatever are continuing to use the island of Manhattan as their route. So I do not know how many else have heard all of these helicopters endlessly. But I know it is not from it is not for traffic accidents every night. So I plan to ask somebody who has experience with the Faa to to come to a meeting and speak about the increase in aircraft noise. Yeah andrea. If I could just jump in really quickly on that congressman Nadler has a bill that would block private non- emergency helicopters over the island of Manhattan. So you may want to include that when you reach out absolutely that's great, we voted for that as a board yeah. I thought we did, but anyway yeah, we endorsed them. Yep, okay, we have yeah two and a half years ago, the transportation committee unanimously, and then the board unanimously passed a resolution. It was on behalf of hundreds of seniors on 106Th Street. The seniors live 273 of them in the Red Oak residents, halfway between Amsterdam and Columbus on the north side of the street on. In addition, hundreds additional seniors come to the Red Oak Senior center on the opposite side of the street, about the same distance, and both of them are at the summit of from Columbus to and Amsterdam both streets. There are hills that go up to a summit at the center and on the opposite side of the street on the south side of the street is the adult daycare program from jewish home that serves hundreds of people and the people at the Red Oak, the Red Oak was established as a frail elderly senior resident the people. Almost everyone has a walker, a wheelchair or some or cane or some mobility assist, and likewise the people who many people come there and the adult day care center. We requested for a crosswalk with and signals that could be used to allow the people to walk acrosss the wide Street of 106Th Street, it's dangerous for a number of reasons. One you! If you're coming in a car from Amsterdam towards Columbus, you can't see the other side. So the part of the other side is where the red Oak residents would be crossing. It's same from the other side for the adult care people. On top of that, the people would have to walk in any time, but certainly in the winter, even worse, to the far end of one block to cross and then up a hill, and so it's extremely difficult. This was requested and passed unanimously. We've tried over the past year. Again we got letters and from the residents and users there was a site visit and so on. We need this done and it affects hundreds and hundreds of seniors in our community who are frail and need this help. Why it can't be done to me is a big puzzlement. I think we have to have an answer. Well, Colleen is colleen on the call. Yes, I'm here, hi shelly, so I was at the side visit we had with shelly initially when all of this came about, we did look at a mid- block crossing level, a mid- block crossing signal, but at the time when we looked at it, we found that the pedestrian level of crossing was very insignificant, but then we decided that we would look at a day where it's more significant, where the crossing is occurring. So we agreed. I think it was on a Friday when we came out there and we looked at it was it was supposed to be a Friday, but it was a Monday when that or I think or Tuesday. When people actually came okay, so we were there, I mean we have initiated the Mid Block traffic signal study and, as I've informed, the community board. All of this is on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic, because the traffic pattern right now is not normal, so once traffic resumes normal in the surrounding areas and for that particular block, we're going to resume the study and we'll get back to you Shelley and we'll let the community board know of our findings. I do know how important it is for the mid block Crossing, because I saw for myself. You know that there is kind of a hill and if a vehicle is traveling, you know there's that blind side that you might not see, but then again it people should not be crossing block. But I understand that the issue of the elderly and of the seniors having to go to the end of you know that intersection to make that crossing to go acrosss the street. So as soon as I have information about the Mid, Block, Crossing Signal and the study I'll keep everyone abreast of it. Okay and the winter's coming before we know it. I know I know hopefully I'll have a response before then. Okay, if I, if I may comment, the issue, is partly because a lot of mobility impair early that have to cross and you're right. It's not it's not very frequent. It's a sporadic in terms of like when they have to go for therapy, but they do not need a permanent signal. It can just be a on- demand signal and it would be, it would be a pedestrian request signal. You know for a request light, it's not always on, but we've talked with. We've talked with D.O.T for many years about this and that, while it is not mandated because of whatever the federal regulations are, we've worked with D.O.T to try and get them to understand that the seniors are there, there's a large number of them they cross anyway, and we definitely do not want one of them getting killed or maimed or harmed yeah. There's a rise in the street that blocks visibility and we're not going to try to have 150 people cross just to prove that there's the quantity you know and asked them to put themselves in danger yeah on fridays. We have a lot because there are a lot of activities we know going on the afternoon so yeah. I think it's important because she has been working beyond you know. There are certain regulations that say you can't do this because of this, that the other thing and Colleen has really met with us on numerous occasions over the last four or five years and colleen, I can't thank you enough. We we've tried to do everything every which way to kind of get this through. I think it's important to know that you know when we initially looked at this. It was denied but keep in mind. The traffic patterns do change whether it increases or decreases, and you know it's every so often we would, you know, be required to take a look at this and initiate new studies as the traffic pattern changes. So this is something I'm glad that we were visiting again because you know it might. You know it might be feasible given if, when we look at the traffic conditions as they get back normal so and I will try to get you a response before the winter heads up- okay, I believe the precinct wrote a letter of support for it. Oh yes, they did. Thank you thanks. Chelsea. Thank you. Thank you, rich Richard yeah, just a quick thought on this, and then I want to get back to what Steve's comment, but if we can't do studies until things are back to normal, when are things deemed back to normal, and does that mean that it could be a year or more before we can do a study and again with winter coming? I do not think there's time to wait until we've gotten back to whatever normalcy we might ever get back to. So I think it's more urgent and if something could be done right away, that would be great back to Steve's comment. I've been begging for years for a joint transportation, bci meeting about the issue of delivery cycles. I completely agree with Steve. We can't have cyclists riding the wrong way or riding on sidewalks and it's a question of what can be done about it. I do not think we can rely on the police to enforce it and they are to a large extent. They are commercial vehicles and they're under incredible financial pressure, and there are a lot of humanitarian issues with with delivery cycles. So I do not think it's as easy as saying we should ticket them, even though we do need to figure out some way to end the issue, and I think a big part of the issue is the financial pressures are incredible, especially these third- party delivery services pay so little that they basically have to break the law to be able to make any money, and a big part of the problem is that the people who expect food to show up at their door within 30 seconds of ordering it often give low tips so and they're also the same people. They could also be the same. People complaining about delivery, cyclists going the wrong way and riding on the sidewalk, so I think there's a public education component to it. There's a business component to it, there's definitely an immigration and just humanitarian issue of these poor people trying to make a living, but by all means Steve. It is a massive safety issue and I think, addressing one issue without looking at all. The other parts won't be successful and we need to to put our heads together to think through just what can be done and who should be enforcing. Should it be DOT, should it be, should there be some way of publicizing or coming down on the the delivery? Businesses, the seamlesses and grubhubs are law changes needed what can be done to stop it from happening, but it's definitely a more complicated issue than just ticketing and we need to think through and just try to weigh in holistically on the issue. Thank you. It's clearly a safety issue and then we're moving on to a similar or even greater safety issue with Doug. Thank you. I wanted actually listening to so many people's comments, including Stephen, Brown and rich Robinson. Now so I concur. I ride a CitiBike often, and I can I mean- I'm happy to be here talking to you safely, because within this last week I had some very close calls with people that were going the wrong way and they were at least two occasions where delivery, guys that were screaming down. Amsterdam avenue, no lights, no reflectors, and actually one individual happened to have a dark bike. Dark jacket and I almost did not see him and we would have had a head- on also observed- and I mentioned this to howard a I was riding down on Columbus avenue on a bike lane and there was a an e- bike which was actually closer to a large rebel. Looked like an electric like a vespa and he tried to overtake me on the lane. I did not because he was so quiet, he pulled up onto my right side and we almost had a serious collision. He skid I skidded. We both came to a stop and I basically said you're not supposed to be on here and he said no. I am an e- bike, I'm allowed on here. Well, there was a scooter. He was, you know, is a very large piece of equipment and I'm pretty sure he was not allowed on there. So I'm seeing a tremendous amount of reckless behavior which dovetails nicely into what I'm about to say. I have to imagine that I'm not the only one that has heard and seen this, but it is getting more and more common. There are some groups of reckless motorcycle riders and atv riders that have been riding up and down Amsterdam Avenue, and I mean literally up and down Amsterdam Avenue and Columbus and Broadway. It is now nightly and central Park West too many of these vehicles, because I have taken photographs with a zoom lens are not street legal they're motorbikes they're all terrain vehicles, four wheelers, they are doing wheelies, they are going through red lights. They do not pay attention. I have seen them go downtown on down on the wrong direction on the avenue on bike lanes on sidewalks doing literally 360s there. It's not a question of, in my opinion, I'm not an expert, but in my opinion it is not a question of if it's when there's going to be a serious injury fatality. These are reckless lawless people. They have to be stopped. I have spoken to many police officers as well as higher ranking police officers, who have all told me they do not have the ability to pursue. I understand that logic. Can I just interject Doug and they say the ability they say the authority there's a difference. Well, okay, yes, physically they have the ability they are not permitted to pursue. It is a apparently an NYPD policy. I understand that I'm not a policing expert either, but this has to be stopped because it's going to result in a death or deaths and it may be their own lives too, or a combination of so I've seen this is this: it used to be more incidental, they go in groups. Doug I've heard them. You can hear the din of them blocks away. Absolutely you can hear them coming and by the way, this is not to be conflated or confused with some small groups of lawful riding motorcycles who are following the traffic laws and our street legal bikes. I do not have a problem with those I'm talking about the ones that not street legal and are reckless nightly so again from my own non- scientific poll of speaking to maybe four or five different police officers, some commanding officers they've all said we're not allowed on one incident. Just last week a police officer told me that it's even worse than you think he said we were on our way with lights and sirens, going up, Amsterdam avenue on a call, and we came upon this group. The reckless motorbikers slowed down intentionally to slow down the police car. They then put many of them had their iphones and were photographing themselves with the police car behind them to make it look like the police were in pursuit which they actually they were not. When the police officer basically said he had to get on the Pa system and said we are not following you. We're in an emergency call get out of the way yeah. They were basically harassing the cops and surrounding them so and the cops basically can't do anything so anyway. I would like us to just one question: when the cops say they can't do anything. If you have one, let alone 10 or 15 motorcycles, going the wrong way on a major New, York City Avenue, they can't they can't do anything. Well. The policy, if I make the policy of the police department is that they won't pursue, because it is, it is believed that in those social pursuits they end up more in fatalities than not, and I'm sure that there that there's a lot of truth to that, because these motorcycles, who are already reckless, are absolutely going to scramble and go on to the sidewalk and just you know, so I understand the logic behind it, but there has to be a smarter way. I in the past I was told that the NYPD occasionally will infiltrate the social media of some of the meetup groups and then they'll arrest them or stop them where they're meeting up or where they're concluding their ride. That's the point follow them wherever they stop get those license. Plates numbers, they're, non-, registered vehicles, they're not registered, I see or if they are they've taken their plates off for the ride yep and the and the vehicle that apprehended you in the bike lane the motor vehicle did that have a license plate. You know so frazzled it may very well have the so I'm seeing a lot of just this is concurring with what Stephen Brown is saying. Is that there's so many different vehicles taking advantage of the bike lane? That should not be on the bike lane and they're going the wrong way, and it's extremely dangerous. So you know, and with regard to delivery, cyclists. I've mentioned this to you before I heard what rich said versus we do not. You know you know they're not tipping. I I'm probably one of the few board members that has had the distinction of actually being a delivery. Bicycle delivery person in this neighborhood. I do not care about the bicyclists ethnicity, their immigration status. I want them all to be happy and healthy and wealthy, but if they are going to endanger the lives of anyone in this on the upper West side, they have to be stopped, and if it's a question of eventually having everyone registered licensed place, they all should have helmets. They all should have lights, reflectors and be compliant. It is it's getting to be. It already is the wild west. And yes, I love to order my food, and I would gladly wait another 10 minutes so that no one gets hurt not about in any way hurting these delivery, guys and restaurants who need the money but reckless behavior and is absolutely unacceptable, and it is I'm getting an earful from every friend, relative and constituent in this neighborhood, and we have to do something about it on the transportation committee. After all, we are the transportation committee and it has to include that subset of things. So it's bad. You know it in the more and more bike lanes we have, which is wonderful. We have to have lawful riding they're going doug. Would this work for you could if we, if we invite the 200 and the two four precincts representatives to be at our next meeting and speak to them about this surge in illegal writing, I would love it. I have a feeling- and I could be wrong- that this is coming from a much higher authority above the local precincts. I think it's coming from the commissioner in the city and again I respect their decision, but because this has exponentially gotten worse, something has to be done and I'm sure that the police, who are experts, can figure out how to do it, and I think we should. We should ask them and let let's hear it from them, what they can and can not do yeah and by the way. Just and again I do not mean you know, howard and Andrew. You are the co- chairs of this committee, so I do not mean to use serp any of your authority, but I would love to just know just from an informal poll. Am I the only one that had been seeing these motorcycle riders not at all? No, not at all. Thank you by the way. Thank you thanks Doug for bringing this up, we will pursue yeah. It's simply unacceptable. It really is somebody's definitely going to get killed and it could be one of them, and I do not want to see that either. But absolutely not you know you can't speak much less the wrong way and go and blow through lights. Somebody is not going to see you in time. These things are fast someone's going to get killed. It also sends a signal to the extent people see that I think everyone feels slightly more emboldened to skirt the law on their own, whether they do it or not, is another issue. But when you see law breaking it's I think people are just feel like the law is something that you could choose to agree adhere to or not that that's why I think people are actually doing it more often and more I I've been seeing distinctly different, there's no consequences right, yeah! Okay, thank you for bringing that up and we'll definitely address that and rebel at our next meeting. Ken's hand is up yeah yeah Andrew go ahead, go ahead, yeah! I'm just amazed that we've been talking about problems with bicyclists and rebels and the occasional group of teenagers going through on motorbikes, and yet we're not talking about. What's really killing and injuring tens of thousands of people in this city and hundreds on the in our district- and I do not know, we have not talked at all that there's an epidemic of speeding now in the city there's something like twice as many tickets being given out by the speed cameras citywide as before the pandemic, people got in the habit with the empty streets of speeding and with the streets slowly filling back up. They have not let up on the gas pedal, and this you know is something that is really killing people and really injuring literally 15,000 people a year city wide and about 400 every year in our district. Why is not this a topic? Why are the nuisance infractions? And I mean the you know the solution I mean we do not want people going the wrong way in bike lanes, but there's a very easy solution, and that is what my mother and Father told me when I was very young, which is look both ways before you cross the street. I do it, I'm sure other people can do it, and but how about the topic of? What's really killing injuring people, which is cars failing to yield and speeding? I'm guessing that, because there's laws on the books, the police, can enforce those things. What you've heard tonight is things that apparently can not be enforced but are likely to kill people. No, let me just talk through this interjection. Wait, writing the wrong way down. Amsterdam avenue going through the lights has to be illegal period. You would think no doubt about that, but and by the sense that my the new business was sort. You know, since Ken mentioned that I just would like to respectfully respond, which is that I am for all safety, and so this is not mutually exclusive. I do not want to see motor vehicles rotten irresponsibly, but I am seeing this and I will I will personally I'll, send the committee the videotapes. It is horrifying if they are going through red lights, doing wheelies they're going to get t- boned, and I it's going to happen. I'm really surprised. In fact, one of the police officers told me that they actually do believe they've had accidents, but because they are afraid of getting caught. They do not report. They do not report an emergency room somewhere, but I can I'm all with you, I'm about safety, all acrosss the board. Well, really, if I could just respond, this is a question of priorities. This is it's as though you know we're Dr, Anthony, Fauci and we're in the midst of a Covid-19 epidemic and we're worrying about the common cold. That's yeah! I do not think that's a fair. I do not think it's a fair comparison, I'm just going to say the same thing, I'm all for arresting every single person. That goes through a stop sign and I get offended every time I hear you. Try and minimize anybody else's needs that I'm not missing, I'm just saying: okay, guys, okay, let's go I'm just I'm not minimizing it at all. I'm just saying do not speak for me, speak for me, I'm not speaking for you, I'm speaking for myself. No, we should put this in perspective. That's what I'm saying they're not in perspective until you want another bike lane, then it's all thing. God forbid. Somebody say something different than you. Okay! Ken! Can you go ahead? I think I'm finished. Thank you. I think the message the clear message here is: we got to enforce all illegal movements. Yes, I agree. That's the key here and, if you're going to have the police next month, let's talk about that too and again, and I'm sorry I do not. I do not mean to have I'm not have the last word here but again respectfully to Ken. I am not only talking about bicyclists going the wrong way. I am talking the particular new business I brought up tonight are heavy motor vehicles 200 ccs 150 Cc's that are speeding doing wheelies that will kill an individual, I'm not talking about lightweight vehicles. It is an emergency in my opinion, and if you, if you have not seen it, can come to Amsterdam every night, everything I've seen it's so loud. You can hear it from your home. We will speak. We will put on the agenda for next month. Have the 20th precinct and 24th precinct to address the most egregious behaviors again recognizing they do not have the resources to do everything everywhere to how best to deploy their resources so as to keep people safe to deploy their resources in the most effective manner to stop the activities that endanger people, the most, that's what we're going to speak to them about and how they do that. That's for us to discuss next month, when they're here right now, I believe mark thanks in the spirit of new business and hopefully, thankfully, to change the topic a little bit. We were approached over the summer by someone who was an expert in the the conditions of our streets. These are the handicapped folks who are trying to get from who often need to use some form of motor vehicle, whether it be a taxi or a private vehicle to get around town, especially considering how few of our subway stations are. Handicap, accessible, elevator, accessible and one of the issues is that gaining access to the curb, even where there's, where there's daylighting, which would be a perfect place for that vehicle to pull in, is prohibited because it is no standing at any time rather than no parking. And so the request that was made to us and by no means is this. The only solution to the problem, but one of the things that was suggested to us is that by taking selected places, curb access and changing it from no standing to no parking would allow these vehicles to pull in and to access the curb for the length of time. It would take to offload a person in a wheelchair colleen. I'm wondering if you can help me understand what we would need to do in order to achieve that change in regulation and what kind of follow- up would be required on our end, either as an individual or a community board, so that we could have enough of these around our district so that the folks could could have reasonable or easy access to the curb Colleen. Are you still with us? She is thank Heavens, and I'm still here. Oh okay, great, you know with the no standing, the no standing that sign indicates that vehicles hold on I'm pulling up the signage hold on okay, so no standing anytime. That indicates that vehicles may not stand at the location. You may not wait or stop to load and unload packages or merchandises at the curb, but you may stop to expeditiously drop off or pick up a passenger, so they can use that they can use that. Then the key word is expeditiously, pick up and drop off a passenger, the no stopping no stopping is more stringent. That means you can't even stop there at any reason whatsoever. I think with the no parking regulation which is the sign indicates that vehicles may not park at this location at any time, but you may stop to load and unload packages or merchandises at Curbside, and you may stop to expeditiously drop off or pick up some of the passengers. I think with the no parking anytime if we were to install that regulation and I'm going to confirm that you would have people who would park there with placards in the no parking area as opposed to the no standing anytime. I think no standing is fine. I can't imagine a police officer would give a ticket to someone letting off an elderly or handicapped person by the curb for like half a minute, and you can't do that. You can't do that. You can access the curb to pick up and drop off, but you know it has to be expeditious. You can't be there for like 10 minutes or more. I would imagine- and it does not take that long. You know for a pickup and a drop off depending on that sounds like even with a wheelchair colleen. Could you and I follow up on this and I'll, make sure I loop in the chairs, because I want to be responsive to this community member? It's a handicapped person who I'll board I'll forward you, the regulation that I just read great. That would be very helpful and I may need to follow up with you on that, because I want to make sure you're just right mark it's Elizabeth here. I left this in the chat, but just on another issue related to disability and access. There have been a number of people who have reached out to me about again the outdoor seating and the sidewalk space, and I know this is probably a vci transportation issue and Colleen. I do not know if you have any thoughts on it, but I think a lot of people have said that their wheelchair accessibility is very limited, depending on which street they're walking down or avenue they're walking down based on the streets- and I realize that's- you know very anecdotal- and it's just a few people who have reached out, but I felt like given that you had mentioned this. We should also reference that so thank you. We have two people from the community who, like to speak, the first one is Ellen Azerin. Let me see I have unmuted, you can go ahead. Okay, can you hear me? Yes, I can- and I say this almost with apologies to the very serious matters that I've been listening to taken up tonight, because I think safety is above all, and I acknowledge that. But there is an issue. That's been kind of my issue forever and it just seems to get dropped between the two, the cracks between the various agencies that have jurisdiction over central Park, I'm a bicyclist, I'm on the West side. I go from the West side to the east side on a regular basis and we keep asking for some kind of dedicated safe bike access acrosss the park CB7 has taken it up. The transportation committee has talked about. It falls into parks and recreation. It's my understanding that CB7 did pass a resolution asking for a task force and I do not think they've gotten back to us. Is there anything we or I'll volunteer to do my part in it to follow up on it, because I do not think it's very high on the priorities list and compared to some of the things we've been talking about tonight. I acknowledge that, but still it I mean, we've got two and a half miles of crosstown. That's just blocked off to a very important new form of transportation that is bicyclists, and so I'm forced to either walk my bike acrosss the park or take some ridiculous circuitous route around dirt paths and I've tried them or do something that I'm not supposed to do, which is right on the path and even though I do it carefully and safely with re, respectfully I'll get off my bike. If I have to I'm doing something, I'm not supposed to do- and I do not like that. So what can I do or what can you do? Well, we've already adopted a resolution and called on for a task force, so I defer to colleen to let us know what if anything has been going on. Colleen hi, I have to be honest with you. There's no movement on this. As of yet and again, it's all due to the pandemic, the board did call for a task force, but I do not believe we decided on whether we would move forward with having a task force. We said we would work with the conservancy and parks and look at the area to see what's the best plan that we can come up with to improve the area and we would share them with the Community board. I'm sorry am I correct in understanding that it's been deferred because of priorities, because I would argue that it is precise because of priority. It's just because of cobit a lot of things. A lot of projects have, you know, been put on hold yes, and my answer to that is it's precisely because of Covid-19 that we've seen such a tremendous increase in bicycle bicycles as a means of transportation, thus the transportation committee- and we have not provided for them as adequately as we might, and we have been working city, wild citywide to install more bike lane miles, I mean we're doing 38:39 acrosss town, we just did 61st 62nd, which is temporary. So and I'll add that colleen you're going to be working on 72nd street very shortly right, correct, we'll be looking at that. I totally acknowledge and appreciate all the things that have been done. I'm specifically talking about the two and a half miles that block access on the upper West side. That is called Central Park and must that be totally ignored. I commend all of the new bike lanes. I commend everything you have done. This is not to criticize any of that. I just would like to get some movement on this. I put my hand up okay, how about, given that the city is putting up emergency bike lanes on many streets, how about just the D.O.T and the conservancy and parks getting on a zoom call and figuring out a couple of for the moment, emergency crossings of the park on a couple of paths that would do it for now sure I will. I will discuss that with the conservancy importance. Thank you thank you, and how will we hear back from you? Could colleen just I'm always in touch with the Community board, and you should always check the Community Board transportation agenda? Okay, thank you. You're welcome just colleen, as Mrs Zorin said this is this is not something that's should be done when we're not being occupied by Covid-19, which is the top concern. This is part of the response to Covid-19 putting in safe bike lanes to allow people to get around safely. So I see it as part of the response to cobit it's not as something that we'll get to after Kobe. Anyone else had his hand up before. I do not know if he's still with us. I do not think so anyone else well, it seems like we have a interesting October meeting plan planned. Indeed, thank you and we have quite a few things and if there's nothing else, motion to return thanks. Everyone thanks everyone good night guys, thanks for attending bye-, bye, bye watch those neck dance.
