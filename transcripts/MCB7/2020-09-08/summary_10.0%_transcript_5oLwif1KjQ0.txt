There was the resolution calling for specific sites on West loading zones at specific sites on West End Avenue in Central, Park West, but other than that I looked.
I think we can all admit that there, the proliferation of deliveries has resulted in a lot of double parking, a lot of obstruction of roads, traffic, unsafe, conditions, all sorts of problems we have adopted resolutions, one in particular comes to mind calling for loading zones on Central, Park, West and Western Avenue.
I live on central park, West , there's literally not one loadings down there, so I'm, just interested in people's comments Looked into this or have done anything it froze up for a second.
I know that since we now have the protected bike lane on Central Park West, which has produced parking, it makes it more difficult for when people do not park on either side, so yeah Lots of zones are called for.
In, the request for loading zones on Central Park, West.
They had a lot of concern about the elimination of all those parking spaces and I think it would behoove us and Certainly D.O.T to to take the temperature of the people along central Paul Quest to see what their interest or objections to loading zones might be.
We did a pilot on what the loading zones I can find that from our Bio Engineering division and get back to the board, but I know the board had sent a resolution on this And I think a follow- up letter is good, howard.
Actually the 100 year old, person, who's more likely or the older person is more likely to need the parking spot rather than the younger people, so that wraps it up.
Our idea was loading zones if they think there's a more effective way to address this problem of rampant double parking.
We know of any other areas in Manhattan or even all of New, York City, say Bronx Brooklyn Queens that are currently using loading zones and those communities are similar to ours.
That's, really an excellent question because I do not know if we did a cross borrow impact study to see how effective these are in terms of one area in one particular community board, as opposed to other Or at least I would think, a lot of the seabees they.
If there is some kind of impact studies and how effective it has been in other community boards and colleen,, if you could also look at something, I've pointed out a number of times on the.
If a delivery is being made, to- Let's, say the West side of 83Rd street, but the loading zone is on the east.
They, give out a lot of tickets, but for one the delivery companies factor these the cost of the tickets into the cost of doing business, and they also pay a reduced rate if they have a lot of tickets- It's, a policy issue of getting whether it's City, Council or the state to come up with some new category of aggravated double parking that can't be reduced down and might get more expensive.
The new parking regulations along the portions of the West end have been city- wide residential loading.
The loading zones will work to provide curb space during daytime and evening hours to allow the pickup and drop off for passengers, as well as loading of loading and unloading of goods and helping more efficiently to utilize, curb space and reduce the number of double parked, cars, DOT notified and all the Community Board chairs and elected officials before implementing, and we will evaluate the effect of some connection to give results.
Think the ecosystem of you know parking spots, although to many people is not a great topic.
And I would just be cautious about talking about loading zones, and this zone's just It feels like maybe we're going back to that period of time, where there was a lot of conflict on here, And I'm, going to voice that I speak to people that have to commute out of the area.
I, think it's an issue, and I think riches I'd be in other diets, but I'm just not for taking away parking spots in the middle of a pandemic and wait in which we sort of talk about often that this is a lot of a lot of issues, And I'm, actually against even sending the letter, because the letter it's two years, ago, it's not a recent.
I do not think loading zones are, you know We have to stop piecemealing the laws of loading of a parking spot.
That is still a quote: open street West end Avenue, as especially in that area, is a logistical nightmare.
Prior to the pandemic, West End Avenue was narrowed from two lanes on each side to one making drop- offs and double parking, a dangerous activity, and now with the streets.
I do not know exactly when they're going to be reopened, but once I have more information, we'll share that with all the community boards, because we have closed several streets to allow for social distancing in in Manhattan, and these streets are maintained by the partners that we have who come out and put the barricades out and then remove the barricades after you know.
Frankly, social distancing was never a problem and Jay. We have an item about a request for a neck down, because when school, starts, Westin Avenue is going to be a very different kind of street.
Obviously, yes, can I just say this was merely supposed to be an update on a follow- up letter on a double parking problem and not a general discussion about open streets.
I was originally going to talk about parking, but I once again, I feel like I'm living in a different city from Jay. You're rapidly trying to create the city you want.
Thousands of people perhaps are enjoying the open street on West, End, and I know for a fact.
Do we as a board and we as a city, really want to be encouraging car ownership and usage, particularly at this time, when we're trying to get people on bikes, get people on back on mass transit.
You know my feeling is: Let's make the transit system as great as we can as affordable as we can and as easy to use and safe as we can And that's how we get people out of cars, but The person that's driving to a job in oredel, New Jersey, for instance, or way out in hop og You know some people need a car.
The point is that this is a resolution that has not been acted on by the DOT and we're merely asking for the status of what they're, what they're doing that's all this all is that this letter is going to do if we, if we just can't, ignore the resolutions, I think actually that would be inappropriate.
So we're going to move on to something new, which is a request for a neck down at the southwest corner of 96Th, Street and Weston Avenue next to the public, school.
Think the building did not want to take on that task in terms of becoming liable with anything and trip and fall and hurt themselves The PTA was not willing to take it on, because you know there are times when there's nobody around the school Right, Still, I'm, just saying it can't hurt Andrew.
So this would be for cars, exiting the the parkway like no in the northbound direction, and getting off at 96th street, going north going West East going east right.
We want to protect people at that at the corner of West end.
So I'd like to propose a resolution that community board seven requests a neck down at that particular corner.
The resolution I'm proposing is that we request a neck down without a sponsor for the corner of Southwest Corner languages, southwest corner of 96Th and west end along 96th street, with without the necessary, without the need for a signature.
Colleen you've been working on this And there's the issue of just what you can do, but what DOT has done is made this intersection more dangerous by completely blocking sight lines from 97th street into the intersection where it used to be small cars parked there.
I think so that's right, so the DOT will grant these requests without input from the Community board.
I know you're on the on the call tonight, but when it comes to the dining issue, I think we need to do that.
I just wanted to bring up the issue that I briefly brought up in the board meeting and hope to either put on next month or address, but I find that there's a really big problem with with people driving the wrong way on the bike.
Lanes, and I think it's exacerbated now because of this exact issue, because you have you know, excuse me someone's falling in my lap now that you have It's sort of tied to this issue , I can tell you that last week, I took a ride from six to eight up and down just because I kind of wanted to see what was going.
I've seen them in Riverside park, they're on the greenway To you, or I did forward to the committee, rebel- Has been in contact with me and that this whole time, I think, raised it.
So once traffic resumes normal in the surrounding areas and for that particular block, we're going to resume the study and Let the community board know of our findings.
But I understand that the issue of the elderly and of the seniors having to go to the end of you know that intersection to make that crossing to go acrosss the street.
Are, we've worked with D.O.T to try and get them to understand that the seniors are there There's a rise in the street that blocks visibility and we're not going to try to have 150 people cross just to prove that there's the quantity you know and asked them to put themselves in danger , I think it's important because she has been working beyond you.
People complaining about delivery, cyclists, going the wrong way and riding on the sidewalk, so I think there's a public education component to it.
I'm happy to be here talking to you safely, because within this last week, I had some very close calls with people that were going the wrong way: Where delivery, guys that were screaming down.
It is now nightly, and central Park West too many of these vehicles, because I have taken photographs with a zoom lens are not street legal On the avenue on bike lanes on sidewalks, doing literally 360s there.
Last week a police officer told me that it's even worse than you think he said we were on our way, with lights and sirens, going up, Amsterdam avenue on a call, and we came upon this group.
I mean we do not want people going the wrong way in bike lanes, but there's a very easy solution, and that is what my mother and Father told me when I was very young, which is look both ways before you cross the street.
Well, we've already adopted a resolution and called on for a task force, so I defer to colleen to let us know what, if anything, has been going, on.
