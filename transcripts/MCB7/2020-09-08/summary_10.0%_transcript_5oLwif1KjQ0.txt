But, you know the highest temperature ever recorded anywhere on earth was in el aziziah, libya Usually they asked what they usually do in the summer , They said that we usually go snowboarding and what day of the year was that it was sometime this summer, but snow doesn't stick if it's not below 34 : hi colleen, thanks for joining, because a couple of our committee members are I, resent the zoom link at 5 30, but apparently not everybody got either the original or the other one Are you going back to school, I'll be trying it out in like the second week.
I will take agenda item, one which should go very quickly because it's my agenda item and I'm not proposing a resolution I think we can all admit that there, the proliferation of deliveries has resulted in a lot of double parking, a lot of obstruction of roads, traffic, unsafe conditions, all sorts of problems.
We have adopted resolutions, one in particular comes to mind calling for loading zones on central park west and western avenue.
In the request for loading zones on central park, west But, there are some special cases on the street that probably need it for sure.
As andrew said, they had a lot of concern about the elimination of all those parking spaces and I think it would behoove us and certainly dot to to take the temperature of the people along central paul quest to see what their interest or objections to loading zones might be.
Where we just recently adopted a resolution, There is I thought that the double the lane of double parked cars was similar to the lane of cars parked along the curb I mean when it comes to loading and unloading areas, and especially when we install the bike lane, we look at cross streets to see how we can add to that being that we've took away You know quite a few parking spaces where a lot of parking spaces in the area.
Our idea was loading zones if they think there's a more effective way to address this problem of rampant double parking We're all here at our community board as usual, there's at least 10 alternate ideas, many of which I could suggest.
That's really an excellent question because I don't know if we did a cross borrow impact study to see how effective these are in terms of one area in one particular community board, as opposed to other or They are very unique and different in their boundaries and in terms of the deliveries that they get, and someone mentioned that because of covet they've, seen an increase in delivery, which is deliveries which is really very true, but I wouldn't know how successful they have become, but I will find out if there is or if we have done any study initial study and what the findings were with that But that's a really great question: If there is some kind of impact studies and how effective it has been in other community boards and colleen, if you could also look at something I've pointed out a number of times on the in the case of the columbus and amsterdam avenue loading zones, Unfortunately I was proven correct.
The new parking regulations along the portions of the west end have been city-wide residential loading zones.
The loading zones will work to provide curb space during daytime and evening hours to allow the pickup and drop off for passengers, as well as loading of loading and unloading of goods and helping more efficiently to utilize, curb space and reduce the number of double parked cars, DOT notified and all the community board chairs and elected officials before implementing, and we will evaluate the effect of some connection to give results.
Don't see the proliferation of car of drop-offs I mean people dropping off are using these curbsides There was a lot of car space taken away again very frustrating, but I'll speak to west end, not on central park and I.
They are parking and they need these parking spots and I think that for the last 100 years, there's been people since cars have started people double parking and I- think riches I'd be in other diets, but I'm just not for taking away parking spots in the middle of a pandemic and wait in which we sort of talk about often that this is a lot of a lot of issues and I'm actually against even sending the letter, because the letter it's two years, ago- This resolution reflects modern thinking and I personally, wouldn't even want you to send a letter just so.
You know, because I don't think that this resolves the thinking of this board As we speak, you have to stop getting rid of parking spots, I, don't think loading zones The laws of loading of a parking spot You did bring up a good point which was raised earlier, which is we should get an update from dot on how west end avenue and the changes that we're seeing.
West end avenue was narrowed from two lanes on each side to one making drop-offs and double parking, a dangerous activity, and now with the streets they call them open.
I, don't know exactly when they're going to be reopened, but once I have more information, we'll share that with all the community boards, because we have closed several streets to allow for social distancing in in Manhattan, and these streets are maintained by the partners that we have who come out and put the barricades out and then remove the barricades after you know, you know, the closure has ended, Okay on west end avenue, yeah, it's, unfortunately, the police that have had to absorb the the job of putting up and removing the barricades, and that's simply another factor in why it seems so inane to leave those streets so-called open.
Thousands of people perhaps are enjoying the open street on west end It's a safer street, so I would love to see it become permanent and and also the cross streets like 103rd, but back to parking I mean it would be great in the best of all possible worlds to provide free car store, long-term car storage for people on our curbs We also have a rampant double parking problem and we know that double parking is very dangerous for all street users, and we also know that providing free parking to people is one of the main incentives for owning a car and using a car So. Do we as a board and we as a city really want to be encouraging car ownership and usage, particularly at this time when we're trying to get people on bikes, get people on back on mass transit, You know it's a question of free car storage or doing something to make our streets function better It's, actually pretty limited free car storage, and there aren't any number of people that must have a car.
This is not a policy He ate that howard, but this was a resolution that was passed over two years ago and it's you don't send a follow-up letter without sending it to committee members to ask them for approval The point is that this is a resolution that hasn't been acted on by the DOT and we're merely asking for the status of what they're, what they're doing that's all this all is that this letter is going to do if we, if we just can't, ignore the resolutions, I think actually, that would be inappropriate You don't have to accommodate, but my request is that we vote on it on this and it's not just the letter on the status of the loading zones.
So we're going to move on to something new, which is a request for a neck down at the southwest corner of 96th street and weston avenue next to the public, school Sorry I've forgotten her name, but she has come before the community board many times to explain about that street Unfortunately the neck down is next to the school, and the school cannot sign.
I did speak via email with the with somebody from the montessori school and asked if they would have both ends of the block staffed in case somebody either with an accessorized vehicle or an emergency vehicle needed to get through, and they said absolutely and that I said: will they be in contact with the school I know, penny added them on the agenda, but what I will share with the board with you and howard, is the link that we have been advising all schools to go to and apply through the department of education for the outdoor learning program.
I just wanted to bring up the issue that I briefly brought up in the board meeting and hope to either put on next month or address, but I find that there's a really big problem with with people driving the wrong way on the bike.
But at the time when we looked at it, we found that the pedestrian level of crossing was very insignificant, but then we decided that we would look at a day where it's more significant, where the crossing is occurring or When people actually came okay, so we were there, I mean we have initiated the mid block traffic signal study and, as I've informed, the community board.
If I may comment, the issue is partly because a lot of mobility impair early that have to cross It can just be a on-demand signal A pedestrian request signal , There's, a rise in the street that blocks visibility and we're not going to try to have 150 people cross just to prove that there's the quantity you know and asked them to put themselves in danger , I think it's important because she has been working beyond you know.
You know it might be feasible, given if, when we look at the traffic conditions as they get back normal so and I will try to get you a response before the winter heads I believe the precinct wrote a letter of support for it But if we can't do studies until things are back to normal, when are things deemed back to normal, and does that mean that it could be a year or more before we can do a study and again, with winter, coming I've been begging for years for a joint transportation, bci meeting about the issue of delivery cycles , I, don't think we can rely on the police to enforce it They are commercial vehicles and they're under incredible financial pressure, and there are a lot of humanitarian issues with with delivery cycles.
Are law changes needed what can be done to stop it from happening, but it's definitely a more complicated issue than just ticketing and we need to think through and just try to weigh in holistically on the issue, It's, clearly a safety issue and then we're moving on to a similar or even greater safety issue with doug I wanted actually listening to so many people's comments, including stephen brown and rich robinson, I'm, happy to be here talking to you safely, because within this last week, I had some very close calls with people that were going the wrong way, where delivery, guys that were screaming down Amsterdam avenue, no lights, no reflectors, and actually one individual happened to have a dark bike.
Amsterdam, avenue and I mean literally up and down amsterdam avenue and columbus and broadway It is now nightly and central park west too many of these vehicles, because I have taken photographs with a zoom lens- are not street legal On the avenue on bike lanes on sidewalks doing literally 360s, there These are reckless lawless people.
I mean we don't want people going The wrong way in bike lanes, but there's a very easy solution, and that is what my mother and father told me when I was very young, which is look both ways before you cross the street I.
Covid-19 that we've seen such a tremendous increase in bicycle bicycles as a means of transportation, thus the transportation committee and we haven't provided for them as adequately as we might and we have been working city, wild citywide to install more bike lane miles you're, going to be working on 72nd street very shortly , right, correct, we'll be looking at that I'm, specifically talking about the two and a half miles that block access on the upper west side, that is called central park and must that be totally ignored.
