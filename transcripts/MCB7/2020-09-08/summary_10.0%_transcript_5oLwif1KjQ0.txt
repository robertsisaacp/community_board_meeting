If I'm wrong, there was the resolution calling for specific sites on west loading zones at specific sites on west end avenue in central park west, but other than that It was probably embedded in the in the bike lane ones.
I think we can all admit that there, the proliferation of deliveries has resulted in a lot of double parking, a lot of obstruction of roads, traffic, unsafe, conditions, all sorts of problems we have adopted resolutions, one in particular, comes to mind calling for loading zones on central park, west and western avenue.
To put in a few loading zones to enable this great increase in deliveries to Okay, we're merely going to be sending a follow-up.
I know that since we now have the protected bike lane on central park west, which has produced parking, it makes it more difficult for when people don't park on either side, so yeah Lots of zones are called for.
In the request for loading zones on central park, west.
They had a lot of concern about the elimination of all those parking spaces and I think it would behoove us and Certainly D.O.T to to take the temperature of the people along central paul quest to see what their interest or objections to loading zones might be.
Actually the 100 year old, person, who's more likely or the older person is more likely to need the parking spot rather than the younger people.
Our idea was loading zones if they think there's a more effective way to address this problem of rampant double parking.
We know of any other areas in Manhattan or Even, all of new york city say Bronx Brooklyn Queens that are currently using loading zones and those communities are similar to ours.
Let's say the loading zones on 62nd street, but they have a bunch of shipment for the high hundreds Dude, that's really an excellent question because I don't know if we did a cross borrow impact study to see how effective these are in terms of one area in one particular community board, as opposed to other.
If there is some kind of impact studies and how effective it has been in other community boards and colleen,, if you could also look at something, I've pointed out a number of times on the.
If a delivery is being made, to- Let's say the west side of 83rd street, but the loading zone is on the east.
They, give out a lot of tickets, but for one the delivery companies factor these the cost of the tickets into the cost of doing business, and they also pay a reduced rate if they have a lot of tickets- It's, a policy issue of getting whether it's city, council or the state to come up with some new category of aggravated double parking that can't be reduced down and might get more expensive.
The new parking regulations along the portions of the west end have been city-wide residential loading.
The loading zones will work to provide curb space during daytime and evening hours to allow the pickup and drop off for passengers, as well as loading of loading and unloading of goods and helping more efficiently to utilize, curb space and reduce the number of double parked, cars, DOT notified and all the community board chairs and elected officials before implementing, and we will evaluate the effect of some connection to give results.
Think the ecosystem of you know parking spots, although to many people is not a great topic.
I think we have to take in all the people, and I would just be cautious about talking about loading zones, and this zone's just It feels like maybe we're going back to that period of time where there was a lot of conflict on here, And I'm, going to voice that I speak to people that have to commute out of the area.
And I, think riches I'd be in other diets, but I'm just not for taking away parking spots in the middle of a pandemic and wait in which we sort of talk about often that this is a lot of a lot of issues, And I'm, actually against even sending the letter, because the letter it's two years, ago- This resolution reflects modern thinking.
I live on west end avenue, The 87th to 95th street zone.
That is still a quote: open street west end avenue, as especially in that area, is a logistical nightmare.
West end avenue was narrowed from two lanes on each side to one making drop-offs and double parking, a dangerous activity, and now with the streets they call them.
I, don't know exactly when they're going to be reopened, but once I have more information, we'll share that with all the community boards, because we have closed several streets to allow for social distancing in in Manhattan, and these streets are maintained by the partners that we have who come out and put the barricades out and then remove the barricades after you know.
We have an item about a request for a neck down, because when school, starts, westin avenue is going to be a very different kind of street.
Obviously, yes, can I just say this was merely supposed to be an update on a follow-up letter on a double parking problem and not a general discussion about open streets.
Thousands of people perhaps are enjoying the open street on west end, and I know for a fact.
Do we as a board and we as a city, really want to be encouraging car ownership and usage, particularly at this time, when we're trying to get people on bikes, get people on back on mass transit.
What they're doing that's all this all is that this letter is going to do if we, if we just can't, ignore the resolutions, I think actually that would be inappropriate.
So we're going to move on to something new, which is a request for a neck down at the southwest corner of 96th street and weston avenue next to the public, school.
So I suggested to howard that we have a resolution similar to what ward 4 had and the community The local community has agreed that they will work to clean the sidewalk and maintain it during the time when the school is closed.
Cb4 resolution is relatively new and I think they sent it to us, And I have we were working together to see if we can get something accomplished at that corner : We need a maintenance partner for snow removal and garbage removal, and we tried to get the building to help us with that.
There were concerns about liability, and I think the building did not want to take on that task in terms of becoming liable with anything and trip and fall and hurt themselves The pta wasn't willing to take it on, because you know there are times when there's nobody around the school It's, where it's, where the sidewalk is extended.
So I'd like to propose a resolution that community board seven requests a neck down at that particular corner.
The resolution I'm proposing is that we request a neck down without a sponsor for the corner of southwest corner languages, southwest corner of 96th and west end along 96th street, with without the necessary, without the need for a signature.
For us on the upper west side with cars you know flying through and with the school there People speeding down, trying to beat the light people trying to make the turn northbound I think we should vote on.
And I know: colleen you've been working on this And there's the issue of just what you can do, but what DOT has done is made this intersection more dangerous by completely blocking sight lines from 97th street into the intersection where it used to be small cars parked there.
That would stop them, but would let the the sanitation trucks come by We have a request by the morningside montessori school for a play street on 100th street between broadway and west end avenue.
I know you're on the on the call tonight, but when it comes to the dining issue, I think we need to do that.
I just wanted to bring up the issue that I briefly brought up in the board meeting and hope to either put on next month or address, but I find that there's a really big problem with with people driving the wrong way on the bike.
So once traffic resumes normal in the surrounding areas and for that particular block, we're going to resume the study And And we'll let the community board know of our findings.
But I understand that the issue of the elderly and of the seniors having to go to the end of you know that intersection to make that crossing to go across the street.
There's, a rise in the street that blocks visibility and we're not going to try to have 150 people cross just to prove that there's the quantity you know and asked them to put themselves in danger , I think it's important because she has been working beyond you.
I, don't think we can rely on the police to enforce it They are commercial vehicles and they're under incredible financial pressure, and there are a lot of humanitarian issues with with delivery.
It is now nightly and central park west too many of these vehicles, because I have taken photographs with a zoom lens- are not street legal On the avenue on bike lanes on sidewalks, doing literally 360s there.
I understand that I'm, not a policing, expert either, but this has to be stopped because it's going to result in a death or deaths and it may be their own lives, too, or a combination of so I've seen this is this: This is not to be conflated or confused with some small groups of lawful riding motorcycles who are following the traffic laws and our street legal bikes.
Last week a police officer told me that it's even worse than you think he said we were on our way with lights and sirens, going up, amsterdam avenue on a call, and we came upon this group.
