I guess some people bought homes in different parts of around New York and didn't consider the Wi-Fi availability. They must have bought him a long time ago either that or they did consider the Wi-Fi availability. I'll chose places that didn't have it I remember when I was a young and rubicam. They actually published a little book of everybody's contact information from the board of directors down to about my level and I. Remember looking one day when in complete boredom at the area codes for the weekend houses, how about realizing how it was my first introduction to how important various people were because the further away they were. You know the weekend houses that you had to take a plane to it's like. Well, no, that's a pretty! That's got to be a pretty serious executive because yeah all right, I'm gonna, start broadcasting, because that'll let the attendees in the room, okay, I, think 60 West, 76th Street is first okay. I have the slides ready to go I appreciate the other one? We actually heard a particular resolute of a single apartment on the other one is it's called the White House? It's actually at 86th Street and Central Park West, that's 262, Center, Park, West I, remember very well because it was in the first Fame movie and the apartment we saw was right above the main entrance, and it was one of those ones where originally it had multiple light and the building basically is all one over one. So apropos of our cb8 colleagues, it's one over one aluminum, clad windows and anyway. So it's interesting that will be coming back to us for a master plan. Yeah I did I did see that they had approvals on other window placements. I wondered why they didn't do a master plan then, but it they told us that they were working on it uh-huh and indeed- and that was one of the reasons why I thought we shouldn't approve the last one. So we'll see what they have to say. This time around looks like Mary. Derrick's is with us: hey, Mary I was what are you here for 60 west 76? It's a real okay, I'm, just gonna go ahead and promote me to panelists Monsieur. Is that you done me for my workload? Okay, so I'm gonna rename you Doug, so we know who you were I dog, I'm. Sorry, I Susan got all the big guns. Tonight we got word Dennis, son, I, guess, on the other one right Susan. Would you take minutes? I was gonna, ask Josh, but he's not gonna, be here. Okay, all right, I'm! Sorry, too many times recently, it's okay I'm, the problem, Thank You Josh won't be here. Kay won't be here. Maybe Peter won't I'll have to ask where the quorum. Well, we need meds and J. You need Majan J right, cuz David's here. If you want yeah okay, can he take minutes? He loves two key minutes. He's a secretary, Lotus Club, he's okay, it doesn't say any place that I five one six blank 773 who's, that this is Katie from old Shan, representing ownership for sixty West 76th Street project. Why can't I rename you huh I can't rename you okay, you're gonna remain five-one-six--, okay, good [Applause] Mary. If you look at the attendees, which of them are people that are on your team for tonight, nobody yet well Katie John Gordon is coming and I don't see him here. Yet I just see four one: two three four five: six, seven people that right I've got eight now, but yes, mm-hmm so I'm. Sorry Katie is with you. Yes and John. Gordon is coming the architect. What's Katie's, last name, I'm, sorry, what's Katie's last name: okay, it's poppy! P, oppe, good thanks, AJ I, take minutes for you, but then I can't share the screen to show them. I'm gonna ask Jay, he's gotta, be unmuted, hey Madge, so we do have a quorum. You have a coin. I meant. Are you able to unmute Jay mark, hey hi Jay? Yes, I! Need you to take minutes tonight. Okay, I appreciate, thank you and we can get started right. Yep you have a quorum. Go ahead, do have a quorum. We will be missing, Josh and Kay and we hopefully Peter, can connect but he's out of town. So, let's start with the application for 60 West 76th Street, please. My name is Michelle Parker I'm, the co-chair of the committee, the Preservation Committee, my other co-chair is Kate Karpin, but he's out of town, and we have everybody else want to introduce yourselves from the committee Susan Schwarz Schwartz, manche Rosenberg Jay little. We have Doug Magali and, of course, our esteemed chair mark Dylan, also known as the IT guy good evening. Thank you all right, so 60 West 76th Street, who is making the presentation Johnny Gordy, who seems to be having trouble with his video uh-huh. All right, give me one. Second mm-hmm I see the architect. Yes and I'm. The preservation consultant Mary durricks. Oh I, see me there. He is Mary Hey spill, your Leslie D I II are my C K X. It should be on screen. Oh there, it is yeah, it's got it and there's John. We met Mary through our esteemed former colleague, Misha hunter. Yes, socially pause the screens and we get going. What do you want? Mary, yeah, okay, so I'm? Sorry, this is the application for the ad a compliant ramp. Yes, give me one second, and then you the answer will be yes. Thank you. Give it a try now, John, isn't not behaving itself, no lot of things over to find the right line. Okay, I think I have it everyone see this get started, yes, sir. So this is 60 West, 76th Street, it's a building located at the corner of 76 of Columbus Avenue, also known as 331 -, 339, Columbus Avenue, and this side here is on this Avenue. These are commercial storefronts, and this is 76th Street we're going to be presenting to you is the entry, the residential entrance to the residential portion of the building, which is on 76th Street, and this photo is from Google, because the building actually is scaffolding on it now, so we thought this would be useful to at least show generally what it looks like without scaffolding, because that gave us a little bit of a challenge. So we took a picture of what it looks like you know. Just a few days ago we took this picture cumber the scaffolding. So it's a little hard to show you the character of the building, but that's it as of today so go to the next page. This building is located in the Upper West Side Central Park, twice a short district. It was built, as it says it on the map 1890 to date, 294 architect was Henry Anderson and Renaissance Revival style building. So our project is to address the entrance that are residential to make it a be a successful. Existing steps are here at the sidewalk. That's one step, there's another one, it's a little hard to distinguish, but there isn't no right before the doors here. So that was our task to figure out how to get people in this building. So I wanted to sort of ask it. Mary wants to present any more historical points at this stage. The presentation before I get into you know, John I think that what I'd like to do is skip ahead to the to the to the pictures, and then you can come back to the design, know the after the drawings all right. So that's 1940, it's very hard to see, but those little white squares are the four piers to the to the railing okay John. So we were only able to find a map from these were tagged. Photo excuse me a photo from these historic photos of one of the neighboring buildings that happen to clearly show something in front of 61, 76th Street, and we zoomed it in here. So this is just a zoomin of that portion of the photo and you could see what we're trying to show you here. It's this. These piers are very altered. This is what's going to be altered, some more for the for the ramp. They have had many resurface things. The latest is a kind of a thick concrete with a bunch of aggregate in it that bottom part. There is not original there's nothing about these I'm, not sure if these are actually original, because I looked at a lot of flats buildings, which is what this is and I found. Only one freestanding fence, pier that was masonry and it was a column, so these may not even be original. They it's the fence is definitely not original. Now they've been very altered. Who knows what they looked like originally, even if they, if they exist, sit in 1894, but this is this is the condition now John? Would you move on to the next one? Oh well, the next one is the same with the curb and the and the curb has been resurfaced painted all over time and I. Think John, that's probably the end of it yeah so I think that just gives you the story. The entrance, as is very typical, has been altered. Fences are often altered and this one is two and John I think this would be a good time to go back into the proposal, yeah so again back to the front entrance with this sort of one. So you know what we have here again, just remind you, I, said: there's a step here and there's a step here so find a way to get in a wheelchair into this building and so and there also just so, you understand on these sides behind this railing and behind this railing, there's Airways. So these drop off here it happens to be these odd little platforms that are higher than the curves and oh I want to point out too that this photo is not a today photo because again they're scaffolding there. So this is a bit of a you know like one of these photos from Pluto, where we were able to get it without scaffolding. So you see the full entrance in one shot without any interruptions other than a couple people so I know it's things. Yeah I'm, sorry go ahead. What are they for these platforms? Oddly, we all. We noticed, we don't know for sure, but they're right below these two batters sure. First, the odd thing is I, don't know, be good. Tell them if you look very closely they're blocked off of little bars horizontally, so I assume, so no one just goes and sits in there to block people, but if you were coming from fire escape and be kind of a trip as it to get out so I think it's just there to stop people from using it and that's kind of ignoring the safety of the fire escape, but otherwise, if these weren't here I would assume these lighters would drop you into the area which it's not a good idea. So that's all I can think of so our proposal. Well, we looked at this and we thought if we had to do some sort of you know, lift or something it would be pretty hideous honestly, so we were proposing to do ramp. So that's we wanted to come up into this level of the lobby, but to do that, we need to extend this that out in order to get a ramp up to the higher of those two steps. So you're. Basically, two steps higher. We were able to negotiated, so it's about 13 inches of increase from the sidewalk up to second step. So we did a quick rendering of what we're proposing based on that prior photo and so we're proposing to take that platform out. That was over here in a sense, just lower it and adjust its size, so that becomes our landing and we're in filling the area way in the ramping up to this level and then that step as I mentioned is pulled out to here. So you just walk up two steps here and then the ramp lets you through here. The reason we have to present to the Commission is we have to modify this here right here, because its depth is too it's too tiny to space behind it between this and this. So that's you know. One of our requests is to change that and then, of course, since we're building the step out, we have to fill this in covering the existing stone here with new material, and our goal is to use a stone that matches. So that's the basics of the proposal. Of course, there's railings at the ramp. We had to put a portion of the guard across this way because the area way still goes I, don't know. If he's over here, there's the area way stills to protect people from falling we're going to cut the curb here, we're basically gonna in a sense cut the curb and a portion of the existing railing out and use it to fill in this part, and so this really is pretty much thing, as is other than the cut and we're making the make this landing. And then you just go through a little tax, the handrail further for the ramp itself. Back here, okay, now we have to an actuator button to which we'll see and the other goal as I show go through. The presentation should be along the wall here. So then we did drawings to show like the existing condition and the proposed so existing condition here is the with that platform, which are removing converting this to a landing here. Rebels up here, J, you have a question, so your modify as we're looking at the entrance, this concrete pier to the left will be you you're, cutting away some of the depth. Yeah I'll show you that right, yeah, so okay, I get that and the one on the right, though, is gonna, stay the same yeah I. Don't we don't need to change that one? So we would I just curious. If aesthetically it would be better to modify the one on the right as well, so that at least there's the symmetry of the two piers yeah. Let me let me move to the next slide. We did. This doesn't show both pier. So this shows you if you're standing, you know close and it's an axonometric. This is sort of the condition of we the amount we would remove of the back of this pier. So it's a little more than half, because we need to get a three foot clearance between the pier and the stay. Why your yeah, why you have to reduce the depth of the pier to get the access from the ramp? My question is: isn't it going to look weird so one of a better technical, architectural term to have one narrow, pier on the left and one wipe here? You know one pier on the right gets twice as why it is yeah since they're not original to begin with. Why not make them symmetrical yeah, we don't know there certainly altered. We just don't know if they're original in there, somewhere or not I mean there may be some core of brownstone somewhere in there I it's a good suggestion. Sometimes the other way to go in preservation is to make the changes you have to, but not make the changes you don't have to so it's kind of like one way or the other yeah on this well I mean I, understand as a matter of general practice and not altering historical material structure, etc. If you don't have to put in this case number one, nobody knows if they're original and number two aesthetically it just seems it would be a lot a lot better to make them symmetrical, can I just okay guys. This gives me one second I'm about to move from an iPad to my PC, which is now available. So can we move forward yeah? So the word just did some plans. This is the existing condition showing what we're moving, which is really just this portion here and the new ramp we're. You know removing that. This is just a proposed plan showing the new landing the ramp from here to here, and then the removal, the portion of that pier the back portion, and you can see its relation size-wise to the other one that is not proposed to be modified and then what we showed you this picture already. The historic banks photos again just recapping this real quick. These are just a series from different years of these piers and how they've been changed so many times this 2009 2011, 2014, 2017 and current these were. We were able to find online various resources photos. These are all current photos. You can see the condition here of where we would remove this ironwork cut this off and that's where the rampe ago, and then these are the close ups. We were just explaining that's the curve which proportion of which over here will be cutting, but we believe it's just a concrete curb, because it's just has this: it's just painted on a boat is see, it's dripping off, and this is a granite that there's a close-up of the granite step. So we'd like to get a granite that matches our suppliers are very confident they can get a match to get the actual sample about the area way. Yes, you may what happens to the area way in the area that will be the ramp. Well, we're covering it. So it won't be open anymore to the sky, we're not doing anything other than I mean it still be open to the air of the outside. Okay, the whole thing, thank you. So the ramp would build from this side of this curve all the way to the building wall. So if I were to go back to the plan quickly, there's still a portion of that anyway open back here, but it's just where the planning starts to the for the end. Here. It's supposed them- and this there's an airy way over here to on the other side, but we're not obviously not touching anything over there right so jumping back. We have to put an actuator button so that when someone is in a wheelchair, they can push a button to have Thor automatically open so Graham. Those are interior features. I can have operators on the door hardware. Our goal is to keep everything with the door. The hinge is exactly the same, we're just going to add hardware to it. We just have some details: I I'm, sorry! Well, what happened with the discussion on making the piers symmetrical? Well, we just ran through the rest of the yeah. We just ran through the rest of the building, so our would you consider making them making them want the pier on the right, as you enter the same depth as the width depth. That's the pier or load left yeah. All could I jump in on this sure, thanks I'm with Jay and would actually go, maybe even a step farther, which is to say that not only do I think that the piers should be symmetrical, but that the replacement of the fire escape landing ought to be balanced out. The fire escape obviously is a retrofit. The building is older than the building code. That would require the fire escape. So my guess is that was an improvisation and so in order to balance out the aesthetics as well as the function, what I would think would make a world ascent is to make both piers trim both piers as you need to on the on the east side of the entrance and then extend the landing to cover. What is now that cockamamie iron thing so that the fire escape lands on something more solid than a catwalk and had that come to the street as well - the trip hazard, as you said, and truthfully I'm almost indifferent about the piers entirely, because there's no way that material that's on there now is original or appropriate to that building it ought to be. It ought to be some other material so and I'm not I'm, not in the least bit worried about the dimensions of it in terms of your cutting. It I do agree with Jay that it would be symmetrical and I think it ought to be something much more in keeping with the facade or some radical departure with some complementary material. So if you wanted to make them out of granite I'm, not recommending that, but that you know it's another element, it's another material, that's already there or to make them out of or coat them out of stone in some way to match the current first floor treatment. All of those would be superior to what you've got there now and I. Don't think that, with the exception of my recommendation about the fire escape landing, I, don't think it's any more expensive than anything else. You're looking at well mark just so I understand you're suggesting getting rid of that platform, which I agree with by the way, and so you would be extending the fence to the pier, basically, no, what I would be suggesting because they do still need to have the landing for the fire escape above, so what I would do is extend. Why do they I mean you're, not gonna, you're not going to have it. On the other side, the fire escape on the other side goes down to the to the proposed ramp right to the end, to the beginning of the proposed ramp. So like well, the other fires. Yes, you have to have some base there right now somewhere. Why not just fill it in or make it concrete and extend the fence, which would be almost symmetrical with the ramp I think they are okay, so you already have a landing. Okay, I, not just extend the fence. I J I didn't understand that to be concrete, it looked like I can't walk to me. So I agree with you, okay, but I. Don't think it would be proper to put a fence across here. If that's very, to say, because if someone comes down then how do they get out? You take away the fence on the east side of that ramp and have it go to the same landing that the front door goes to right, correct, yeah, just pick it up, lift it out and put it against the wall against the remaining railing, and you probably look better yup, a simple change. Good I mean I, think we're open to coding with brownstone as an option for these peers and I mean I, obviously, would want to discuss this with the landmarks that I noticed that in the series of pictures you showed earlier, there was one from 2017 that seemed to indicate that they were brownstone. No, it was just a different stucco coding, just brown, but yeah. If you could do a stucco coating I, don't know what the mechanics or construction involves, but if it could match I want to ask another more radical. Well, you know solution to these two piers is that you just get rid of both of them, and you just put it simple, but beautiful and sort of that would be much more in keeping with Westside railings. As far as I'm concerned, right I mean truthfully if the piers were finished in a better way in a brownstone way that I don't mind them at all, but your suggestion would be I think equally appropriate I think both are possible. So what do we do in terms of an ultimate resolution? Are we are we getting a commitment to either reducing the right-hand, pier and coating it in an appropriate finish and or getting rid of them in our? What's? What should we? What should we assume is your representation as to what's gonna happen, yeah, John and Katie I think that we can and should at minimum, commit to recoding them and cutting them both and coming well, the cutting I, don't know John I think has to think about that one well, I have to do that if you're gonna take the fence away, that's now on the fire escape landing. Yeah I mean, if we're going to pursue this other idea of just modifying this. So you can go this way then this would this face is too narrow to get through right. Well, so you have to consistency to both cut and I. Don't think it's a big deal to coat them, I mean it's their organ and once they modify this one they're gonna have to do some nations where you work on it anyway, so they may as well code it, and they can just coat this one too difficult thing, but I'm open to it Katie. How do you feel about you have a feeling one way or another I mean at the end of the day, I really just I'm hoping to get this done as quickly as possible. It's a human rights issue, and so you know well agreed to I guess kind of whatever it takes so that you know we can get the ramp up. So the tenon in a wheelchair can access the building a lot easier. So whatever is needed, you know on the proposer side, we're all flexible this willing to take your susan. You wanted to say something: yeah, I, just I think these suggestions are great. No, it seems like if you code it in the matching color it'd, be less obvious, that they are not original, so I think that would blend in better and I really agree with these symmetry issue. Match yes, I agree with all of that, but I think if you have someone who has a disability in the building who needs a wheelchair, couldn't you do this as it is right now and on going do the rest of the work like cutting down those stanchions and painting them? That could be done once the ramp is in so the person who needs it can have it extra time and work once they're making the change to the one thing at the ramp end they could they could do the other work and just a few extra days. That's my feeling and lbc. In my experience every time we propose something they don't want you to come back with another proposal right. We want to execute the whole thing, part of its done and then a little bit done later. We want to get exactly I. Think I, think this I think at this point. It's up to us to fashion a resolution conditional on what we decide are the changes that we all seem to agree on and if there's you know two alternatives that we consider acceptable, just condition our approval either one either one construct or the alternate sounds right to me so mark you want to help us with the resolution with the conditions. First I think you got Susan's hand and then I think we ought to double check to make sure that there's nobody from the community that wants to be heard. Okay, thanks guys I'm just curious about the Expediency of this, because we don't another full board meeting until you know September. So what happens essentially, LPC will probably not wait for us to have our full board meeting. So this will be one of those instances in which we go down to LPC with a committee resolution and whoever it is that presents at LPC will make that clear and it'll come up for a vote in September just to ratify what we do as a committee just for our good practices, because either LPC will agree with this, so they won't, but either way we should be internally consistent with our own procedures. Yeah I'm, going up. That's great! Thank you. We're special for August yeah you're, safe yeah. We have. We have a negotiated understanding with LPC that on a project that we consider significant enough to require full board, we request same and they usually honor it in this particular case, since we all have an interest in getting this done, so whoever the personal persons are that need it. We certainly shouldn't do that. So, as Mark said, will submit a committee resolution and either one of the co-chairs or whatever will go to the LPC and represent us I think what I think we're fine, yeah and just to close the loop on that it was Jay who negotiated where I guess, Jay and Gabby who negotiated that with LPC. So Bravo and I concur that this would not be a not be one of the ones where I would hold it up before a full board vote, even if it weren't the case that there's somebody who's handy, yeah, okay, so Michelle! You want to see. If there's anybody in the audience, I don't think so. But you can write anybody from the public want to say anything about this application way to do. That is to raise your hand the way you raise your hand. Is you put up your participants screen and then on the bottom of your participant screen? There should be a little blue hand erase if you're, calling in by phone and want to be heard. You raise your hand by pressing star nine I, didn't ask if Doug wanted to say anything. Doug you're still with us right, I'm here, I think the proposal that were beginning to flesh out is appropriate. Thank you all right mark. You see any raised hands, I, don't but I don't have control of the screen right now. John does go to the top. There should be a bar that says the red bar that says: stop chair, I, don't see I, don't see any ratios do I have to give control back over to you. Mark I've now got it. Thank you so I think you're ready to propose a resolution. Okay, so will accept the plan with following modifications. I would I mean I would make the approval conditional fulfilling one. It sounds like we have two options. The first option is to remove both peers. Is that one option? Well, it's the conditions are one that you make the peers symmetrical, whether out of masonry or replacing them with an appropriate with a with a metal finishing peer. That would be reflective of the Upper West Side community and so and have them be symmetrical or retain them as retain them as masonry and have them coated in a brownstone like material and then - and then - and then the other option is to extend the new landing to align with and the fence to align with the other fire escape landing. So it all appears to be symmetrical and in the same is that about right, Jane yeah, so those are cumulative, I, think mark I. Do we all know yeah I mean do we want to with number one? We all agree, definitely that the peers have to be symmetrical either in their current masonry construction but narrowed so that they're, equally narrow or I just flesh out from either the possible someplace marrow I thought that John I thought that John had to or you originally had something about. Urns, oh I didn't hear urns iron I my mistake, so iron work basically an extension of the railings okay I mean I'm fine, with making a conditional and either/or we have to don't do we have to say if they retain the piers. We already said they have to be the same color right, the same depth and also to recoat them to an appropriate Brown stone, color yeah, just off the railing. Look the same as the current railing, the current railings being reused. Okay, yeah I think the current railings fine I'm just saying talk. It's all consistent right, yeah, okay, watch! Think about all right. All those in favor of the resolution as written and revised yeah, just raise your hand we have or I can call Susan yes Jay, yes, Doug yeah man and neither Peter no Josh Newark AR here. So that's 1, 2 3, 4, 5 0 of 5. Anyone opposed no or non-committee board members in favor aye, so that's 1 0 the resolution as amended passes. Thank you very much. Thank you. Looking forward to your August 8 at LPC, good. Thank you. By the way it was a lovely design very appropriate to that building. Thank you. Thank you all good night. Thank you. Okay. The next application is 262 Central, Park West. This is for a master plan governing the future installation of Windows and that's good hi. This is Ward Dennis I'm, one of the presenters mark. Could you please make Kevin Daley and Samantha Johnson panelists Samantha will be handling the presentation and Kevin and I will be speaking and then, if you could also make mark the card and Sarah sure speakers allowed to speak as it were, okay I will I will do formal introductions to Jay okay, while we're at it Steven Stoker. Are you a member of the community or yes, even Stephen can be admitted. He's part of the board. We're a small group solved from what everybody, okay and then of 201 blank 0, 1 0. Can you let us know who you are yeah? That's deep scholar, that's also Steve scholar, okay! Yes, that's me I've dialed in so it's better connection and I represent the board, as does mark the card very good and then nine one, seven, four, nine, that's Kevin Daley! That's also given to you. Okay, yeah. Sorry again, my phone signal is a lot better than my internet signal right now, I'm very good Samantha's. Last night jon-fen Johnson, it's showing how my screen is Samantha Joe we're all here, go ahead: okay, good evening again everyone. So my name is ward Dennis with even squeeze bars and partners with the preservation, consultants, 4c, 262, Central, Park West. My colleague Sarah sure, is here as well: Kevin Daley and Samantha Johnson from Walter B, Melvin. Architects are the project. Architects and Mark. Picard and Stephen scholar are representing the board building so Samantha. Can you put the presentation up? Can we spell Stephens last name there we go so I. You all have seen prior applications for windows on this building and I understand that on past applications, you've asked why there isn't a master plan here. That is exactly what we're here for is to present a proposal for master plan governing future installation of Windows. It's I think you'll see it's a very well designed master plan proposal for one over one: double hung: windows replicating historic brick, molds, reinstating the architecture of the larger openings and providing for a uniform approach going forward in the future. So the building itself, 262 Central Park West, the 15 story, apartment building, designed in 1928 by Sugarman and Berger. It occupies the full block from 86th Street on the left to 87th Street on the right, with three Street frontages and a total of 796 windows on the primary facade. So we have a lot of windows and, as you can see, there have been a lot of approaches to windows on this building over the years. It's a it's a very restrained in design building, but the hodgepodge of windows will cap off any of Windows, takes away I. Think from that restraint and from the overall design, it's primarily a mix of one over one aluminum windows, a lot of which predates designation and single pane tilt and turn windows also predating designation. You will also see that the changes to the tripartite windows, in particular at the corners, has been as been a big loss to the architecture of the building, and many of the existing double-hung window is because they do exist, predate designation. They don't have the kinds of profile and dimensions that we would typically see on a landmarks approved window. So replacing all of these, this mix of modern windows will allow a return to a more uniform fenestration pattern in a more timely manner and as you'll see, the original windows on the building were six over six. We are proposing one over one. We think that will, among other things, it will lead to a more timely replacement of windows. People won't hang on to their one over one windows in favor of more dividing lights, so we think that will lead to a quicker adoption of the master plan than doing a six over six other. Are there only six over six? There are no windows left on the building I'm. Sorry, there are no historic windows left on the building. Okay, that's! Actually the next slide. So is sharing this pause. You won't! Let me advance there we go. Can you all see that we're still in the building tell you Adam I'll jump in and do it from my end? Okay, oh can I ask up to 796 windows. How many are you replacing? So this is a master plan which will govern future replacements, so as tenants or as owners are replacing their windows in the future, they can go to the master plan as long as they're following the master plan, they don't have to go to a public hearing. They don't have to come back to the community board. It's all been in essence, pre-approved so long as they do. What the master plan says right, but every one of these windows is going to be replaced, or there is some that have already been replaced by the prior from your prior applications that won't be replaced this time around or in the P. Well. So this time around could be any time from now, theoretically till the end of time yeah. But you know probably over the course of some years, they would be replaced as owners sell their units or as long as once you upgrade their units wore as these older windows, and some of these windows are twenty or thirty years old. That's about the full lifespan of an aluminum window. That was gonna be my next question, but there is. There is no timetable on which the whole replacement is not there's, no current requirement to replace windows yeah. So this will be a piece meal replacement. Ask people individually, and you see you've seen this on many other. You know master plans in the area or will. If someone wants to replace their windows, then all of the current single pane windows will have to be replaced with one over one: yes, okay, yes and one over one with the right profiles and right. The problem, no more I mean no more replacement by single pane window. No okay. So you asked the question just a moment ago: Jay, but there are two primary window: sash types on the building, one over one: double hong's and single pane, Tilton turns or fixed windows about 70% of the windows are one over one and about 30% or single pane windows. There are no historic windows on the on the building now, but do note that even within the one over one and the single pane there's a big variety in these windows because they were done at various points over time. Tripartite windows we'll get to those. Oh okay, I'm, sorry, you're, always one side ahead of me. Actually, this time, two slides out of me: oh no, only one next time, please mark so tripartite windows, the group windows, the tripartite windows, were actually a very important organizing feature of the building when you look at them towards the corners and how they're arranged on the buildings they had wider mullions than what you see here, particularly with the fixed windows, also note that the single pane windows are generally much closer to the facade. They don't have the depth that they that the historic windows would have had, or even the depth that the double hung windows would have had, so that too takes away from the reading of the building, particularly on a building like this. That does not have a lot of architectural decoration. The fenestration really becomes a big part of the architecture. So next please mark and then paired window openings. You can see that these have been heavily modified as well with different bullion types. Historically, they were wider. Mullions and they've been replaced with narrower emollients next, please. So these are the historic photos of the building. The tax photo on the left two tax photos on the Left, showing the original configuration of the six over six windows, and you can also note if you look at those corner tripartite windows, that they had much heftier mullions between the between the sets of sash, and they were also set slightly deeper within the windows. The two photos on the right are from 1990 the designation photos at the time of designation, and you can see even at this time the multi light windows that remain most of the lower sash had been replaced over this time. Most of the windows were six over one and the windows were starting to get replaced with one over one and single pane. Windows, and part of the reason that was allowed to happen was because a lot of these windows had been purchased and ready for installation prior to designation. So, even though they don't show in the designation photos, these are all grandfathered window conditions in the designation photo by the time of designation, about 55 to 60 percent of the windows were 6 over 1 and about 15% were 1 over 1 and about 20% were single pane. So next slide, please one of the things we're thinking about. Can you just repeat those numbers 55 to 60 percent were 6 over 1 about 15% were 1 over 1 and a little over 20% for a single pane. Thank you, you're welcome. Obviously this is a certificate of appropriateness and we have been thinking about the appropriateness of installing one over one windows on this building. One of the things we looked at was were one over one windows used historically on this type of neo-renaissance building in this period and shown on the slide. Here are four examples from within the district showing various buildings of similar design, all of which were originally built with one over one windows, including the one at the far right, 263 West, End Avenue, which was designed by the same firm, Sugarman and Berger. So we think that, in terms of this period, building and the architecture of this building, a one over one window is appropriate historically and next slide. Please and then looking at this in the context of similar master plans, I think all of which came before you in the past, the similarly one over one windows were approved for master plans in lieu of the historic configuration of multi light windows, and that was the case across the street from us at 271, Central Park West at 87th Street, which originally had nine over one windows and the Commission approved a master plan for one over one windows and further up the further up. The drop. A venue, 327 Central Park West at 93rd Street, which originally had six over six windows landmarks, approved a master plan with one over one windows. The findings for these proposals are very consistent with the findings that we're putting forward for our building in terms of consistency with buildings of that period and date and style, and obviously the one across the street is in, is in our immediate contact and then next slide. Please and then this is just a more recent example. From last year of a similar master plan which landmarks approved, the building originally had multi light windows and the Commission approved a master plan. I'm sorry, the this case, architectural character, was a major consideration for the Commission. It's a similarly plain style building where the windows take on a higher order of significance that it might on a more decorative building, and this was one of the findings that the Commission made in this case, and we think it's relevant because it's a more recent approval. So next slide please. So this brings us back to the building itself. This elevation shows the windows that were approved by the Commission since designation. A lot of individual apartment owners have come forward either at staff level or through public hearing to get approval for their windows and obviously every time a tenant wants to change their windows, and it requires a public hearing. It comes before you and, as you have asked at prior meetings of this committee, that this should have a master plan, so that is that is the application here. I'm going to hand it over to Kevin Daley, a Walter B Melbourne architects, to take you through the details and the specifics on the design of the windows. Thank you. Thank you very much can finish me to hear me. Yes, okay, wonderful. We could move the next slide. Please. Thank you very much for having us by the way I new Halloween with for dentist and presented. This is a slide showing obviously the it was so the master plan on the left is a existing elevation with their colors, indicating the different types of windows that are present on the building, the light blue, showing an existing double-hung one over one sash, a couple of different colors red and light purple, but her pink that show two different types of tilt and turn windows insurance. There are a couple of different configurations, one we believe we're at the structure pans around the older, the remnants of the old window frame and one where the window was completely replaced, brick to brick. There are smattering of windows that fall into those categories and those are yellow. You can see it's a it's a hot spot in the sense that there isn't any one particular window that dominates any part of the facade, even in the replacements. The windows sometimes are very close to the opening of the masonry, that is to say that the glass line is very close to the masonry line. In many cases, it's also quite Beach, so there's a even sort of the look, the reflective character that they'll be munching along the street. There's a different depth pattern. There's a lack pattern. What we're hoping to do with the acceptance of the master plan is to make for a consistent installation with consistent details. So that really doesn't look like it's a mix of many things. It looks like it's a single design, as it was originally again, I guess. Moving to the next slide, we see the north and south elevations, which are in the same way in each care on the Left. It's the existing configurations, highlighted by color on the right. Of course, a single set of conditions I'll remind you of the slides that Ward showed previously. The triple windows sometimes vary and having thick in deep or planar mullions, as through the double windows and the molding set. That's present on the existing one over one double hung windows varies from varies panning to more complicated mouldings, none of which really reference the assort mullings, which is thinking we're able to correct. So if you look at the next slide, please this is showing top and bottom the most prevalent type of existing one and one double on windows contrasted with one of the two types of proposed double hung windows. Let me expand on that briefly. We in this master plan have compiled two sets of details, both of which match the historic details as well as we can and match each other. The idea is that if the shareholder wishes to have a different type of interior finish, or especially, if when the manufacturers change their standard details, we have two sets of windows that we can go to allow for consistency on the exterior. Even if there are changes on the interior finishes desired by the shareholder or if one manufacturer should happen, change their details, we still have another to go back to, but this particular slide is showing an all-aluminum double on window, which should we be spending much of our skyline on at the bottom. That's compared with a standard typical double hung window present on the building right now. I think the thing that I want to point out to you most closely is one that's obvious as a result of this master plan, if we're going to the effort to recreate a moulding set, but the perimeter moldings and the moldings of the mullions that separate windows in a gang window, the current time they're very simple, rectangular, aluminum panning, sometimes going over estimate irreal, sometimes know the effect is very plain and as a result of there being 70 different types of windows on the building, it's clean but confusing. We have the opportunity and are taking it here to create single moulding set at the mullions and the fabric. Molds of the windows surround all the way around the edges of the window that matched the historic and then well. Of course, even in a couple of different manufacturers match each other, we were able to take a bit of the existing aluminum panning off of one of the those on the street facade and found the prick mold of the original window, underneath frame still remained, although fashioned still and the volume were all removed. So it's not a not a scenario where we could restore the existing window, but we were able to take very careful measurements of the moldings as it happened a similar application a couple of years ago on one of the rear facades of the building. Also, did it probe to try and find the moldings and they match so we're very confident that we have the historic, brick mold and that's the molding that we approached the manufacturers to make sure they could reproduce next slide. Please this again is essentially the same slide, but only a different manufacturer. This is I want to say Anderson, but for some left correct excuse me, we have a luminal, clad wood window by a different manufacturer which I'm taking pains to point out, has the same molding set and the same details as the all aluminum window, which we can believe matches the historic configuration of moldings and overalls pretty closely. If you go to the next slide, please moving into some details. This is three versions of a plan section, so you know cut about midway through the height of the window horizontally and looking down. In all three cases we are showing at the core, the old wood windows still there, as has been pointed out a couple of times. That's not the case uniformly. However, we're showing here because the details are, the new windows will accommodate you store window, so we don't have to remove a stork material where we find it which warms my little preservationist part and it does make for a consistent installation, regardless of the existing window conditions at the top. The existing double hung window you'll see that the what little the original frame that is there is hand over with that rectangular aluminum, padding that we mentioned and the amoliant has that same condition where, whatever there is covered over by that rectangular panning, the mo Lian's are fairly wide in that first leading edge, and that makes for a very broad plain, looking mo lien and a very plain-looking rips around our first mold at the window surround we have both of the window that the intended closed windows at the bottom left and right and in both cases we're able to get a yes exactly a custom molded panning to go over the existing system, whatever it is, and that matched is. You see very carefully it there's a couple of little phillotson, assignor Ekta, it's a it's a it's a simple movi, but we're able to replicate it pretty accurately, with both manufacturers and the dimensions that are shown show that we have roughly the same dimensions with minor variation from each other between windows. You don't believe that those will be visible for the eye as warded pointing it out. You don't have any of the existing windows to measure directly from you use the multiple attack photos that were available to us to try and scale using photo manipulation, try and get this Buddha sense as we could of the dimensions of the mo Lian's that were original and we match those directly in creating the existing detail set. We believe from the work that we did on computer and in the field that we have a pretty accurate rendition of the existing windows next slide, please. This is a cross-section of again an existing double-hung window and the two proposed windows I think I would end up saying the same speech over again, but can be clear. The existing window is fairly simple, built on the sometimes on the guts of the removed window, sometimes brick to brick. We're able to recreate the molding set, regardless of the existing conditions that matches the historic pretty accurately these windows. There isn't a lot of complexity in the stash configurations, in other words they're generally. Each stash is about a size of the window, which is to say we're being virtuous, but it's not complicated to match the sash configuration from the historic to propose pretty accurately I. Believe that's the end of the presentation. There's one more slide. That shows some tilting term windows, but if I may, if that's okay, with Michelle Thanks, so I'm looking at the meeting rails on the three windows here, and none of them seem to match to me, but it could just be my unpracticed I. They seem to be different dimensions. What are we looking at and is that just a trompe l'oeil or something I, think it's a trompe l'oeil based on the Faculty of self I will say that the chunky existing aluminum double-hung windows have fairly broad wide meeting rail and that's just the sport. Well, the recent historic character of those window sash the two proposed windows I, if you zoom in on the dimension of those two windows, I, believe that they're fairly close to each other. Yet two and three sixteen to two and a thirty-second, so they are within roughly 1/16 of each other, okay I'm in terms of their leading edge that present themselves to the viewers eye, of course, if most of them agree yeah. So what you're seeing is, of course an architectural you know fill that's meant to show that those are the wood windows need to change the appearance of it and, as you see the whole slide, okay, any other questions, any member of the committee, the only just as a matter of policy as far as a basic determination as to whether replacement windows have to reflect the original historical configuration. Our general standard has always been that if the vast majority of existing windows have already been changed, then we've been comfortable with approving similar changes from six over six or whatever to two double hung: windows, and obviously that's the case here. So I, don't think it's an issue! Susan, don't see you yeah sue. Do you have a question? No, but I agree. Jay I mean it's sad that we've lost the original. Perhaps when knows but I'm grateful, there's a master plan and the hodgepodge will be reduced, so yeah Madge can't hear you I agree. Doug just to comment, agree with Susan that it's unfortunate that we've lost the original, but it's great that we have a master plan. Could you explain something to me? This is why would somebody put a single pane window in? Why would somebody use a single pane window unless maybe it's the end of a hallway I'll handle that uninterrupted view all right? It sounds like you're all in agreement with this. Yes, so call the question. Sorry not so fast. So in my building, as you guys all know, she's way three, there were one of her one windows installed forever and then the LPC got wind of it and opposed it and required them to put back in the six over six. So that could be done, but I think it's not realistic here. So we'll say that I again I applaud that at least they want to have a consistent look. Okay, you know it could be done, but it's not gonna be done good. Is there any member of the community here that wants to speak about this application? I guess just out yeah this chickens, yeah, so I'll, just I, won't take too much of your time. But I will remind the committee that we had an application on this building for a set of windows more or less directly above the main entrance on Central Park West, and it was controversial at the time and it was controversial at public hearing, because the standard that we were led to want to use and sort of adopted was whether the wind, whether the decoration of the building taken as a whole, was such that the that the loss of the multi light fabric on the on the facade would or would not affect the overall impression of the building and 370's Riverside Drive, which our former colleague Misha presented to us and 150 West 79th Street, which I see when I walk out my front door are examples of highly decorated buildings, with lots of wedding cake features and frou-frou and so forth. Another technical term that, at the time we distinguished from this building, the committee was still comfortable going forward with those windows above the main entrance as one over one windows. I, don't know how their profiles compared to the ones that are being proposed today, but it but an LPC. There was concern about these windows. Those windows I'm, sorry, because this is the opportunity, if there ever were to be one. A master plan is the opportunity to restore the building to what its former glory should have been. I am NOT ignorant of the likelihood that those with those tilton turn full pane windows would keep them and probably encourage their grandchildren to keep them as well, rather than replace them with something that I think is more appropriate. But the question to me is appropriate. I think that the aluminum is a compromise and an appropriate compromise, but I can't get myself all the way to 1 over 1 versus 6 over 1, so I'll be abstaining on your resolution, which I somehow I'm going to guess is going to be to approve market seam here. Oddly I'm sorry is that I thought the original was six over six I'm. Sorry you're right six over six you're right. It originally was six over six and then by the time of designation. A lot of that had been modified to six over one, and yet there are no original windows in the building. Well, they're on to be clear. When designation was coming down, Central Park West toward the building the building moved quickly like an awful lot of buildings did in the 1980s to replace windows in advance of conversion to coops, sometimes and in advance of the of the impending historic district. So they were considered grandfathered. Even though we saw slides that showed that at the time of designation, there were a fairly healthy number of legacy, Windows or butchered legacy windows, not a condition. I would want to see returned, but this is. This is the one chance. A master plan is the one chance to say what the future should be, but I don't vote with the committee. So don't worry about it. Word and I also fought tooth and nail in my own building to preserve the divided lights and I feel torn about this one, for the same reason say explain to us why how the fenestration will be somewhat unique in our somewhat for lack of it's not as simple the architecture. The building is not simple, not simple to look at, but so maybe the applicant can take over help me out on this. Well, I can talk a little bit about the application from the board perspective and shareholders perspective I mean we're very proud of this application, we're being very responsive to the requests of cb7. In the past there is a long history of a proofing, actually inferior style double hung window. This has architectural elements that harken back to the building's original structure, because the windows original structure, so we think this is a very practical and useful approach because of that precedence of a hundred and seventy windows that have been approved over the last 15 years that are relatively new. The other reason that actually I want to correct word on. He said that the building that the window life is about. Twenty or thirty years in our building, it's going to be quite longer, because we have a window maintenance program that the building pays for it to maintain the windows in original condition, and we think it will be potentially generations until there is significant penetration of a new window style. So what a great concern is amongst the shareholders is that if a new window style is introduced and there's already many different window styles on the building, it will lead to a very chaotic look for a very extended period of time, much more so than you would see elsewhere. And this is a very critical intersection. So we really think that this plan- and it won't look good for a very long period of time, because the double-hung windows will be up there with the tilting turns and an occasional six over six might be introduced. So we think there's a very practical and useful implication application for both the legal precedent as well as that fact that we have this unique building financed refurbishment program that has maintaining these windows, and that program also signals to you how important this application is to the building. I mean the tilt intern applicants are willing to sacrifice their windows for this window style, they're willing to do it in fact, ten years ago, three years ago there was an application in front of you, where an apartment converted from tilt and turn to double hung, but if it were tilting turns at six over six, it just wouldn't happen. So I just want to make those points on behalf of the building and why you're, seeing this application from us and I can give me one second I'm. Sorry I should have mentioned that I very much appreciate the detail, even though I can't get myself all the way there. The detail of the architectural approach and the replication of the more appropriate mountains and so forth is noted and very much appreciated. It is far better than the slap in the off-the-shelf version that we sometimes say. So. Let me let me correct myself there or just so I'm clear on your position. The U is your position that you would want to go back to six over six or six over one as it was designation. I would go back to the original condition, which is six over six percent, but I would accept aluminum instead of wood just to go back to so you want to go back to six over six, but you would accept six over one yeah, but I applaud the attempt to have a uniform look but yeah because, as they say, it's a long term solution and like this is our chance to say what should look like okay, but did two sort of A mish-mosh building in a way it is, and that's why I don't think these went over ones would harm it rather than trying to go back to something that probably is not as fitting and I am worrying. So let me turn it back to word: I was just going to respond further to I. Think was Michelle's question about the architecture is appropriate, as Steve mentioned landmark says it's when a year history of approving one over one windows on this building, including recent approvals in 2014 and 2016, and the Commission's findings in those decisions were based on the fact that there are no existing his sort of windows and but in particular that by matching the operation and the brick profile and by maintaining the uniform eautiful beautiful unity of the facade in terms of configuration, materials and finish, I was much more in keeping with it was much more harmonious to the building. It is a. It is a simpler building, as mad just mentioned. One over one window is appropriate on the style building the Commission, particularly in their prior approvals mentioned. This is the precedent of similar one over one windows on similar buildings of that period, style and design, so all which I think you know in particular getting that uniform window appearance is probably the Paramount goal. Obviously of all of us here and a one over one window is appropriate for this building landmarks have found it appropriate many times in the past. The difference here is that we will now have a much more refined one over one window as Mark was pointing out. The details on these windows are very carefully designed and designed to follow the original, and therefore it will be a much nicer looking building than the existing one over one windows, even if they were uniform. So we think that is appropriate to the architecture of this building and getting that uniformity is a very important aspect if I may add one practical aspect to this, which, in turn in terms of speed of adoption, which isn't necessarily a criterion theo pc uses. But I wish to mention it. Not only are we talking about the idea that much has been mentioned by steve that the shareholders might be more in tune with making the change with this plan on the books, the very existence of a master plan. You know, as designers, we often describe to owners that, as it smoothes the path, the real pc and makes adoption of the window as part of the renovation an easier process, more windows are included in renovations or changes in time to come. So, there's an extra reason why we couldn't, with the adoption of this master plan, that the change from the hot spot we have currently to a more uniform set of windows. You know there's a second reason or an additional reason why that adoption might happen more quickly. Thank you. Okay, we're going the resolution is to approve as presented sounds like it I'm gonna call. This will be a roll call sue Susan. What's your vote? Eckstein J, yes, Doug! You still with us Doug approve! Thank you match approved myself is approve and that's it for the committee's. So the resolution passes: 1 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 0, non committee board members present and voting Mar. It's me and I abstain all right, so the resolution passes. Thank you very much. When do you are starting this work, not doing any of the work now right. Do you have a public hearing sign of mind? Oh, we hope we hope to have the neck mark in August, September, water chamber or September. So I'm sorry say it again: you would be in September, yes, okay, then you'll have as long as it's not the first Tuesday. You will have a full board vote to go with you worried, you're wearing a sling. Are you okay? Oh my goodness, bicycle I don't want I, don't want to do rail, I'm, sorry meeting into a bike. Yep. Thank you. I just got out of mind with my broken wrist, so have a full board vote if it's after, if it's in September and then few anyway, so that'll take care of itself. Okay, thank you very much presentation stay cool. Do we have any business to discuss? I don't know. Actually let me just mention the letter. Yes, of course, which pretty much tonight's discussion. So cp8 has written a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Committee, a commission saying please don't approve any more master plans that don't replicate the original multi light fabric of Windows in any building on in community board 8 and community boards, 5 and I believe three have signed on to it and I put the I sent the letter to our co-chairs, asking whether we wanted to, but noting the previous history of having approved under certain circumstances like tonight. The replacement of multi light with or historic, multi light with replacement windows that are not so I wasn't comfortable signing sending on to such a letter. Unless the chairs were the chairs were not as I'm understanding it. Michelle okay, he's not here, but he but I think he replied to the email to you saying not so much and I just wanted to raise that with the committee and let you know that I will not be signing on to that letter in part, because it would be duplicitous to do so after this vote and 150 West 79th and 370 Riverside Drive and a few others. So I wanted you to be aware that that's out there yeah and full disclosure I sent you that little blurb about what a master plan is yeah issue and additionally telling you there are master plans for new hoods you're, the Ark sure. So maybe that's what that community board should do, have a master plan, for they should designate a neighborhood as a master, an area where there should be a master plan, but I walked up and down a couple of streets today and I. Don't know how we would do that I stand corrected, but unless we're talking about the really new building I, don't know how I can tell you how? Because my building, which is built in 1923, had this the I guess they're in over eight replaced by single one over ones for many years and then somehow LPC caught cotton onto it and they informed them. They had to replace them all. So it can be done. It looks much better, so it can be done. It can be done to Michelle's point about neighborhood master plans. That would mean that even a building that didn't originally have six over ones would have to install six over ones in order to be consistent, stone Street that I mentioned yeah exactly and then the other thing to consider here is the LPC formula and the formula was recommended to us about, judging whether or not to replace multi light based on the presence or absence of decoration on the facade. You may remember: 771 West End Avenue, which is another building that had it was actually in an h-shaped, and so it had a West 97th, Street facade. It had a had a West, End, Avenue facade, and then there was a little interior courtyard facade and we approved it because it had a lot of wedding-cake features and LPC through it back. You know enter only after a lot of arm-twisting when it came back to a public meeting. Did LTC vote I think it was six to five by the way to approve the one over ones. So it's a moving target at LPC as well, so I don't know how these guys will fare, but your action here is consistent with other actions. You've taken so I think that's to our credit, even if it's not to the Commission's anyway, we will have a meeting in August regular day, I guess so right, listen! We haven't scheduled it, but let's yeah, yes, yeah I, don't think we'll have another one, but if we do we'll find something else to talk about. Thank you thanks so much running because we wouldn't had a quorum without you so very appreciate. You.
