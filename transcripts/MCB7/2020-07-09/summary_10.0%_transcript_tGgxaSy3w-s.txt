The attendees in the room, okay, I, think 60 West, 76Th Street is first okay , We actually heard a particular resolute of a single apartment on the other one is.
Central Park West, that's 262, Center, Park, West I, remember very well because it was in the first Fame movie and the apartment we saw was right above the main entrance, and it was one of those ones where originally it had multiple light and the building, basically, is all one over one.
John I think that what I'd like to do is skip ahead to the to the to the pictures, and then you can come back to the design, know the after the drawings, all right.
This is just a proposed plan showing the new landing the ramp from here to here, and then the removal, the portion of that pier the back portion, and you can see its relation size- wise to the other one that is not proposed to be modified.
That's, the pier or load left All , thanks I'm with Jay and would actually go, maybe even a step farther, which is to say that not only do I think that the piers should be symmetrical, but that the replacement of the fire escape landing ought to be balanced.
What is now that cockamamie iron thing so that the fire escape lands on something more solid than a catwalk and had that come to the street as well- And I think it ought to be something much more in keeping with the facade or some radical departure with some complementary material.
You take away the fence on the east side of that ramp and have it go to the same landing that the front door goes to right, correct, yeah, just pick it up, lift it out and put it against the wall against the remaining railing, and you probably look better , mean I, think we're open to coding with Brownstone as an option for these peers.
Think if you have someone who has a disability in the building who needs a wheelchair, could not you do this as it is right now and on going do the rest of the work like cutting down those stanchions and painting them?
And it'll come up for a vote in September just to ratify what we do as a committee just for our good practices, because either LPC will agree with this, so they won't, but either way we should be internally consistent with our own procedures.
There are no historic windows on the on the building now, but do note that even within the one over one and the single pane there's a big variety in these windows because they were done at various points over time.
When you look at them towards the corners and how they're arranged on the buildings, they had wider mullions than what you see here, particularly with the fixed windows, also note that the single pane windows are generally much closer to the facade.
Here are four examples from within the district showing various buildings of similar design, all of which were originally built with one over one windows, including the one at the far right, 263 West, End Avenue, which was designed by the same firm, Sugarman and Berger.
We think that, in terms of this period, building and the architecture of this building, a one over one window is appropriate historically and please and then looking at this in the context of similar master plans, I, think all of which came before you in the past, the similarly one over one windows were approved for master plans in lieu of the historic configuration of multi light windows, and that was the case acrosss the street from us at 271, Central, Park West at 87th Street, which originally had nine over one windows and the Commission approved a master plan for one over one windows and further up the further up.
A venue, 327 Central Park West at 93Rd Street, which originally had six over six windows.
The. Findings for these proposals are very consistent with the findings that we're putting forward for our building in terms of consistency with buildings of that period and date and style, and obviously the one acrosss the street is in, is in our immediate contact and From last year of a similar master plan which landmarks approved, the building originally had multi light windows and the Commission approved a master plan.
A lot of individual apartment owners have come forward, either at staff level or through public hearing to get approval for their windows and obviously.
The master plan on the left is a existing elevation with their colors, indicating the different types of windows that are present on the building.
Even in a couple of different manufacturers match each other, we were able to take a bit of the existing aluminum panning off of one of the those on the street facade and found the prick mold of the original window, underneath frame still remained, although fashioned still and the volume were all removed.
It's not a not a scenario where we could restore the existing window, but we were able to take very careful measurements of the moldings as it happened a similar application a couple of years ago on one of the rear facades of the building.
The sash configuration from the historic to propose pretty accurately That, shows some tilting term windows, but if I may, if that's okay, with Michelle Thanks, so I'm looking at the meeting rails on the three windows here, and none of them seem to match to me, but it could just be my unpracticed I.
But I will remind the committee that we had an application on this building for a set of windows.
It was controversial at public hearing, because the standard that we were led to want to use and sort of adopted was whether the wind, whether the decoration of the building taken as a whole, was such that the that the loss of the multi light fabric on the on the facade would or would not affect the overall impression of the building and 370's Riverside Drive, which our former colleague Misha presented to us and 150 West 79Th Street, which I see when I walk out my front door, Another technical term that at the time we distinguished from this building, the committee was still comfortable going forward with those windows above the main entrance as one over one windows.
Well, they're on to be clear: when designation was coming, down, Central, Park West toward the building, the building moved quickly, like an awful lot of buildings, did in the 1980s to replace windows in advance of conversion to coops, sometimes and in advance of the of the impending historic district.
This is the precedent of similar one over one windows on similar buildings, of that period, style and design, so all which I think you know in particular getting that uniform window appearance is probably the Paramount goal.
So Cp8 has written a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Committee, a commission saying please do not approve any more master plans that do not replicate the original multi light fabric of Windows in any building on in community board 8 and community boards, 5 And I put the I, sent the letter to our co- chairs, asking whether we wanted to, but noting the previous history of having approved under certain circumstances like tonight.
