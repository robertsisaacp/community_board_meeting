I, think 60 West, 76th Street is first okay , West I, remember very well because it was in the first Fame movie and the apartment we saw was right above the main entrance, and it was one of those ones where originally it had multiple light and the building, basically is all one over one.
John I think that what I'd like to do is skip ahead to the to the to the pictures, and then you can come back to the design, know the after the drawings, all right.
That was over here in a sense, just lower it and adjust its size, so that becomes our landing and we're in filling the area way in the ramping up to this level And The reason we have to present to the Commission is we have to modify this here right here, because its depth is too It's too tiny to space behind it between this and this.
There's the area way stills to protect people from falling we're going to cut the curb here, we're basically gonna in a sense cut the curb and a portion of the existing railing out and use it to fill in this part, and so this really is pretty much thing, as is other than the cut We're making the make this landing.
Second, This is just a proposed plan showing the new landing the ramp from here to here, and then the removal, the portion of that pier the back portion, and you can see its relation size-wise to the other.
That's, the pier or load left All , thanks I'm with Jay and would actually go, maybe even a step farther, which is to say that not only do I think that the piers should be symmetrical, but that the replacement of the fire escape landing ought to be balanced, out.
You, take away the fence on the east side of that ramp and have it go to the same landing that the front door goes to right, correct, yeah, just pick it up, lift it out and put it against the wall against the remaining railing, and you probably look better , mean I, think we're open to coding with brownstone as an option for these peers.
It's, a human rights issue, and So you know well agreed to So the tenon in a wheelchair can access the building a lot.
Think if you have someone who has a disability in the building who needs a wheelchair, couldn't you do this as it is right now and on going do the rest of the work like cutting down those stanchions and painting them?
And it'll come up for a vote in September just to ratify what we do as a committee just for our good practices, because either LPC will agree with this, so they won't, but either way we should be internally consistent with our own procedures.
Here are four examples from within the district showing various buildings of similar design, all of which were originally built with one over one windows, including the one at the far right, 263 West, End Avenue, which was designed by the same firm, Sugarman and Berger.
The. Findings for these proposals are very consistent with the findings that we're putting forward for our building in terms of consistency with buildings of that period and date and style, and obviously the one across the street is in, is in our immediate contact and From last year of a similar master plan which landmarks approved, the building originally had multi light windows and the Commission approved a master plan.
Even in a couple of different manufacturers match each other, we were able to take a bit of the existing aluminum panning off of one of the those on the street facade and found the prick mold of the original window, underneath frame still remained, although fashioned still and the volume were all removed.
It's not a not a scenario where we could restore the existing window, but we were able to take very careful measurements of the moldings as it happened a similar application a couple of years ago on one of the rear facades of the building.
But I will remind the committee that we had an application on this building for a set of windows more or less directly above the main entrance on Central Park West, and it was controversial at the time It was controversial at public hearing, because the standard that we were led to want to use and sort of adopted was whether the wind, whether the decoration of the building taken as a whole, was such that the that the loss of the multi light fabric on the on the facade would or would not affect the overall impression of the building and 370's Riverside Drive, which our former colleague Misha presented to us and 150 West 79th Street, which I see when I walk out my front door, Another technical term that.
At the time we distinguished from this building, the committee was still comfortable going forward with those windows above the main entrance as one over one windows.
This is the precedent of similar one over one windows on similar buildings of that period, style and design, so all which I think you know in particular getting that uniform window appearance is probably the Paramount goal.
So cp8 has written a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Committee, a commission saying please don't approve any more master plans that don't replicate the original multi light fabric of Windows in any building on in community board 8 and community boards, 5 And I put the I, sent the letter to our co-chairs, asking whether we wanted to, but noting the previous history of having approved under certain circumstances like tonight.
