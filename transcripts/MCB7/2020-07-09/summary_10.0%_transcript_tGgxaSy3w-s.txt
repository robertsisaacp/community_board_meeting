I guess some people bought homes in different parts of around New York and didn't consider the Wi-Fi availability They actually published a little book of everybody's contact information from the board of directors down to about my level Looking one day when in complete boredom at the area codes for the weekend houses, how about realizing how it was my first introduction to how important various people were, because the further away they were I, think 60, West 76th Street is first okay, West I, remember very well because it was in the first Fame movie and the apartment we saw was right above the main entrance, and it was one of those ones where originally it had multiple light and the building basically is all one over one.
The presentation before I get into you know, John I think that what I'd like to do is skip ahead to the to the to the pictures, and then you can come back to the design, know the after the drawings, all right, So, that's 1940, it's very hard to see, but those little white squares are the four piers to the to the railing Only one freestanding fence, pier that was masonry.
There's the area way stills to protect people from falling we're going to cut the curb here, we're basically gonna in a sense cut the curb and a portion of the existing railing out and use it to fill in this part, and so this really is pretty much thing, as is other than the cut and we're making the make this landing Then we did drawings to show like the existing condition and the proposed so existing condition here is the with that platform which are removing converting this to a landing here.
Second, This is just a proposed plan showing the new landing the ramp from here to here, and then the removal, the portion of that pier the back portion- We were just explaining that's the curve which proportion of which over here will be cutting, but we believe it's just a concrete curb, So we'd like to get a granite that matches our suppliers are very confident they can get a match to get the actual sample about the area way.
We just ran through the rest of the building, so our would you consider making them making them want the pier on the right, as you enter the same depth as the width depth That's, the pier or load left All , thanks I'm with Jay and would actually go, maybe even a step farther, which is to say that not only do I think that the piers should be symmetrical, but that the replacement of the fire escape landing ought to be balanced out.
What is now that cockamamie iron thing so that the fire escape lands on something more solid than a catwalk and had that come to the street as well - the trip hazard, as you said, and truthfully I'm almost indifferent about the piers entirely, because there's no way that material that's on there now is original or appropriate to that building.
You take away the fence on the east side of that ramp and have it go to the same landing that the front door goes to right, correct, yeah, just pick it up, lift it out and put it against the wall against the remaining railing, and you probably look better , mean I, think we're open to coding with brownstone as an option for these peers and I mean I, obviously, would want to discuss this with the landmarks that I noticed that in the series of pictures you showed earlier, there was one from 2017 that seemed to indicate that they were brownstone What do we do in terms of an ultimate resolution?
They, don't have to come back to the community board Ask people individually, and you see you've seen this on many other You know master plans in the area or will were actually a very important organizing feature of the building when you look at them towards the corners and how they're arranged on the buildings they had wider mullions than what you see here, particularly with the fixed windows, also note that the single pane windows are generally much closer to the facade.
So cp8 has written a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Committee, a commission saying please don't approve any more master plans that don't replicate the original multi light fabric of Windows in any building on in community board 8 and community boards.
