It's a challenge. Yeah, I'm getting ready for the election. I'm working the polls, I'm doing all this training and stuff. Oh God bless you! Thank you early election and regular election yeah. It's going to be tough, we're going to vote early yeah because I can't wait one more minute. I know I know they're talking about a month. It's a month to go. Oh, my god, speaking of elections, I'll refrain from naming the person Linda voted already and ignored the instructions and voted twice. Oh really! Well, you know we do not follow directions. I just deleted all the prior votes: yeah good! Oh okay, hey rich! You expected us to follow the rules. What would you want your vote to count there? You go I'm trying to keep the vote open, fair and secure hi mark.

I see people have different backgrounds, but I have not learned how to master that. Yet I was just going to ask you polly, because I've been running it as well. Yeah you have to go back to your profile, I think huh. Oh that's what it is: okay, yeah. What is it michelle? You go back to your profile. I did all that I even went on youtube to try to find out it's. I gave up Lisa I'm going to try again tomorrow. No, I did the same thing. I do not know. I guess you know. I need somebody to walk me through it. Well, someone told me my computer is not up to date. That should I get a newer model, I could be able to do that. I do not think that's possible. I think you could download something and access that I do not know I'm going to find out rich. What do you think yeah hands how old the computer is? Oh, okay, yeah I saw someone who captured a picture and he just put it in the background, and that was it was not complicated. I do not know. Oh really yeah, I'm going to try that yeah buy that one who knows where early voting is in our in our district. I do because I'm working it where is it westside high wow convenience yeah? Yes, okay, not till October, 24th, right, ah October, 24th, okay, there's different times go online and get the different times every day is different. It covers a lot of different times. It's very good, but I think it's going to be very crowded. Oh boy, in the lower part of the district, it's at the atrium at Lincoln Center for the lower part of the district, oh good, to know you're better off going to Philadelphia. What time are the polls opening madeleine one is at ten one is at seven different times different days, seven in the morning, like seven yeah earlier, and then it closes like at three and then it's 10 to 4. I can remember the other thing. It depends on the day. Right almost every day is different right. Okay, folks, I'm going to start the webinar, which means that the attendees will now start to file in and hopefully, we'll start to record. Why would anyone vote in person it's so easy to vote by mail? I've already voted only if you live near a creek apparently and then my guy got the carotid virus. So we have an hour to discuss that issue. Okay, well, folks are starting to file in. We had nearly 200 people register for this meeting, so it's going to be a trick trying to get in as many people who want to comment as possible, but we'll do our best. Welcome everybody. Let's give a few seconds get a few seconds for folks to file in as attendees. I hope, they're all wearing masks. That's so funny! Ken governor had some interesting words this afternoon. On that subject, I will leave it to the governor to repeat them, but it was quite a performance. I did not hear it I'd like to hear it tell me another time another time, yes, that good okay people are still filing in as attendees, so I'm going to give them about two more minutes and then I'm going to say hello and then we'll have a very brief public service announcement and then we'll get to our business session. I'm assuming our secretaries have worked out between them who's doing the minutes. Thank you. Okay. At 6:32, I'm going to call us to order here. We are recording. We are live streaming and I am welcoming you all to Community, Board 7's October full board meeting just a recap of the agenda, which was online. Essentially, we have our business session first, where we do matters that relate to the applications that we are charter mandated to pursue or follow up on, and those areas in which our committees have been active. A little bit of an unusual practice for us this evening is that we have a report from originally. It was going to be from the 20th precinct commanding officer, Neil Zuber, but in fact both the 20th and the 24th precinct commanding officers, so deputy inspector noguchi Yaguchi, as well as captain Zubra, will be with us and that's going to be more or less at 7:30 P.M, assuming their duties. Allow that timing, but I'm given to understand that they will. What we're going to do is hear from each of the commanding officers and then we're going to allow 30 minutes for public comments specifically related to those reports. There'll be a public session toward the end of the meeting, as we usually do, but we wanted to do this as a way to accommodate the police officers and to make sure that there was an opportunity for some public comment. While the commanding officers were with us so that there were questions that they could be there to answer them and then would not have to try to, you know, leave and then come back or what have you so that is more or less the plan for the night. We will work in our board officer election process into the business session, either before or after, depending on how well we do with time. You will hear me moving everybody along tonight, I'm going to try to get as much time as we can to hear from as many of our constituents as we can. I have a public service announcement. Some of you may remember. Last year there was a generous way in which a community member was making Thanksgiving happy for a lot of families and was recruiting volunteers. Jason Haber is with us, and I'm going to call on him right now, who I believe will be asking for volunteers again: Jason, take it away, hi everyone thanks so much mark for having me Jason, you're kind of scratchy there is there a try. It again is that okay, it's a little scratchy so cut to the chase, we're getting out of turkeys again this year, we're going to try to do it. It's going to be a challenge later I mean we shut down and come back on and bring it back up normal. I wonder if the issue is with the bluetooth earphones. Might that be better? Well a lot better! Thank you very much and thank you. Let's go very fast here. So every year my family and I give out turkeys for thanksgiving to members of the community this year, we're aiming to feed 5,000 people for thanksgiving. It's going to be an enormous logistical challenge because of Covid-19, but we are working with goddard Riverside to find a way to pull it off. Last year we had some great volunteers from CB7. If anyone wants to volunteer this year in a safe way, you can email me Jason, Jasonhaber.Com, and we're going to try to figure out a way to make this work. It's not a guarantee yet, but we have a plan kind of in place right now and hopefully we'll be able to pull this off. We do not take donations, it's just something I pay for my family pays for it, but if you'd like to help volunteer, let me know Jason if you would put your your email in the chat so that folks can find it, and I assume that's the way to get details as to where and when absolutely it'll be Tuesday the 24th all day it takes about six seven hours to give them out fantastic. Thank you and thank you on behalf of the community, for what a great thing that is. Thank you very much, thus end of the public service announcement. Let's get to our our business session and first up is the Preservation Committee, Kay and Michelle. Has our resolution tonight very good? Thank you. This application at 26, West 95th street, was for a rooftop edition, a rear, facade extensions, a rear yard excavation and a stoop restoration. This application was already heard at LPC this morning and I presented our resolution and mark was at the meeting as well. So I guess I should start you see on the left. The far left the building really has. They really removed all of the facade that makes it look like the building that it was when it was built between 1892 and 1893.. It's a great neogra Renaissance Revival Row house, but does not look like that now, so they want to. What they want to do is put a the stoop back in, but it will be a straight scoop, as opposed to an l- shaped do and they got approval for the straight scoop on the theory that a stoop a straight stoop is better than no stoop at all. But there was some conversation about an l- shaped stoop which, both at the committee, the preservation committee level and the landmarks level. There was talk about how hard it would be to do that. Given that there's a tree a tree pit, I think the tree is about at least 60 feet high now humongous tree. It would cost a lot of money to re and maybe even kill the tree to move the tree and tree pit and but more importantly, the and therefore they could not put the l- shaped loop in because it would not be ADA accessible. So LPC approved a straight stoop with respect to the rear, the rear yard, the backyard the applicant wants to fill in the l- shaped yard, with a one to have. It continuously go acrosss the backyard and that was approved and the applicants they worked with us. They were very they compromised. Well, I thought they agreed to install metal railings instead of glass railings and keep the fenestration. That is how the windows are placed the same and use the same material that was used for the rest of the original building, with respect to a rear yard. Exca mark did you want to say something about that. I see a quizzical. Look on your face. Oh no, that's just me you're doing great with respect to the backyard excavation. What they wanted to do is remove some soil and bring the backyard to code and install six foot or six foot wooden fence and they agreed to install planting beds and an overflow drain to capture water runoff at the perimeter on the perimeter of the building of the yard. Excuse me: they agreed not to install spot or flood lights if they thought about that in the future, but rather something called night sky lighting. With respect to the so one two three did. I cover everything yeah. I think I oh with respect to the rooftop. Yes, an LPC, the rooftop was approved with modifications. Oh sorry, let me backtrack a little. The rear yard fill- in was approved with a modification that the applicant work with the LPC staff to reduce the height of the addition, one story, and that would make it uneven with the present l- shaped extension, but we'll let them work it out because they're the experts with respect to the rooftop, we approved that a committee and it was approved with a modification at LPC. This rooftop can not be seen from the street and it is an approval where the materials would be Brownstone, colored Stucco in the front and brick to match the rear facade on the back with a roof height of 10 foot, 4 inches what LPC their approval was contingent on pulling back the rooftop, I think in the front and the back. They wanted a smaller footprint on the roof and, okay, you want to say something or anybody on the committee. I think that summarizes it yep. The only thing I'll add is that the reason we're voting on this, even though because LPC voted on it earlier today, is that it is important for the Preservation committee's work to have its own body of precedent to refer to. So this is not wasted effort, it's important that we are internally consistent and therefore that's why we're putting it on tonight's agenda and letting it go forward, even though LPC beat us to the punch yeah, I if I may say the block is a beautiful block. This building is empty and it's a single family. That's going to be living there, so it'll be an asset to the community and the block, and I and we met the owners of the building and they seemed like mentioned kind of people. It'll be great, very good. So is there anybody who has a question on this mark? Can I just add to what you said: Mark go ahead just I did not want you to give the impression that, even though we were considering this after LPC has acted, that they did not get anything from the board. So, just for the record, the committee disposition of the application and vote etc was before the commission. That's right for the hearing. That's right and I spoke as well, and they made changes to their presentation after the committee, as Michelle said, looks like Jeanette has her hand up. Yes, it's it sounds like all good. I was just curious with the stoop going straight out. Is there a constraint on the sidewalk with yes that big trick, not with a straight scoop that there will be no constraint on the sidewalk with the straight stoop with an l- shaped scoop? There would have been because the tree in the tree pit that massive tree in the tree pit would have would it would not be enough space between the l- shaped scoop and the tree pit, but with a straight stoop, there's no problem the tree, pit's, not in the way or not, but the stoop goes out far enough that there's still plenty of room for pedestrians to bypass walk by. That was my question. Yes, that's right there. It is as a straight great. Yes, okay, it looks like looks like Richard. Ash has his hand up just a suggestion that, because this arises frequently with this committee, that if LPC is considering a matter after the committee votes and before the full board that the board be circularized about it. If anyone has any alien comments, just so that we know about it in advance rather than arrears, okay, yeah. Thank you, we'll make sure that happens, but you have to remind me a few times yeah I mean it sounds like a great project but yeah just good people. Some of them are not yeah you're right, you're right, it looks like Jay has his hand up just just following up on what Jeanette said. I believe that the applicant said that originally LPC staff had approved the l- shaped front stoop, but that D.O.T, which has the final word on the distance between tree pits, etc, would not approve it and that that's why they went to the straight stew, yeah you're right Jay, not only that D.O.T ADA would have to be consulted if it was an the l- shape stoop. As you said, it would not be ADA accessible if it was an l- shape and there was somebody LPC, D-, O-, T, oh and parks had something to say about the tree. It would have been a very costly, maybe a very it would have been a costly venture for the owner and thank you for bringing that up. Okay, I say rich robbins and then maybe we can vote yeah. I just Wanna. I know I've spoken out a number of times against enlargements of brownstones as the especially as the victim of one. These have great impact both on the row of houses, and this is looks on Google maps like a completely untouched row of houses, but also on the so- called donut in the back, where it greatly impacts neighbors, and I just feel that there's no need to enlarge these brown stones, especially if it's found a full house. If you want a huge building, do not get a brownstone, do not taint with our neighborhood and I'm sure they're, very nice people, but it just sets a really bad precedent and I think we should just always oppose enlarging up or back round stones just because of the impact they have. So I'm voting against it and I hope everyone else does as well and especially you if we do not, if landmarks has already acted, I think it's just good for us to set the precedent of doing so. May I respond to that. If you look at the map of the doughnuts on the block, there are many l- shaped extensions to the brownstones and in addition to that, there are one or two buildings that brownstones that built a separate structure at the tail end of the yard coming from the rear toward the building, so that was particularly unattractive, but some people got approval to do that. Okay, so let's go. Let's call the question: I'm going to do this one by just a raise of hands. So if you have, if you can raise your hand, virtually the blue hand, please do so now for a yes and if you have to raise your hand physically, I will scan now. I have to raise my hand physically, so I'm voting in favor. Let's see, let's let the hands calm down for a second and then I'll, take the the virtual the physical hands mark. I do see two hands raised by attendees who are not board members. I do not know if they wanted to speak about this. Oh I'm, not speaking, we are voting. Well, no, I'm sorry hands down. We did not call on the community for this matter. So if you wanted to speak on this matter in the chat rich, would you put it in again, please in the chat, there's a sign up form to sign up to speak tonight? If you wanted to speak on this matter, please do follow the link and sign up right now, although I see the hands are now down. If anybody wants to speak on this matter as an attendee, please raise your blue hand now and we'll call on you and otherwise we're going to vote Nope, I'm not seeing it. Okay, let's go on with the vote, then. So please raise your hand if all those in favor please raise your hand and if you have to raise your hand physically like I do. We will then get to you after that. So I see a lot of blue hands and, let's see I vote yes, I see Peter Sampton. Voting, yes is two Shelley is three poetry. Is four audrey is audrey? Yes, I'm right. Next to you in the gallery. Okay, Linda Alexander is six Doug. Clyman is seven. I already got ethel and I think that's all the virtual hands, so I have seven plus Peter and Doug Mcgowan, oh Doug Mcgowan. Thank you. I had Peter, but I did not have Doug Mcgowan. Thank you and I have that mark. I had oh thank you. Thank you Robert, that's nine. Did you get the weight and louise is ten? Thank you. Okay, so that's 10, plus 29 is 39 in favor Paul fixture in the chats votes. He approves. Thank you. That's 40.! That's yes! Okay! So now, let's see all hands are lowered. All those against. Please raise your hand either the physical or the virtual. I do not know if you're getting this, but as people raise their hands. The Brady bunch screen changes on me. So forgive me. It takes a couple seconds for it to calm down all right. So I see four blue hands. I'm looking for rich because I'm sure he's voting. No there he is rich, is no I'm looking for other physical hands and I do not see them so I have one plus four is five against hands down now again, please is anybody abstaining and I do not see anybody abstaining and no one is ineligible for cause right nope. So I have 40 to 5 to 0 to 0.. Does that work? Julian's saying? Yes, thank you and that's all we have for preservation tonight. So I say thank you to preservation and Linda. Linda Alexander is going to take the helm for Bci. Our colleague, our colleague, Christian Cordova is out with a family emergency. So if anyone wants to know more about it and we can crispy, Christian lost his father on Friday, so he won't be with us. If anyone wants to send him a condolence card, we all have each other's addresses. So next, the first from two to five they're, pretty pro forma, so just to go over them. 373 Amsterdam avenue was lavella. 225 restaurant Corp was God. What was it? Oh, it was Bistro cassis, 201, west 106 will be a mexican restaurant and it used to be Ellington's, which will now be in the former henry's. So there's this is all good news guys and then to West 69Th street. We know there's no restaurant at 2 West 69th street, because it's the pancreatitis and it is in the park, but they needed an address. So those are the first, the four SLA applications. If there's anyone who would like to comment, otherwise, I recommend we bundle. Let's do it any questions. Whoops, it looks like there's somebody in the attendees Peter Arnson. I just let Linda know that it's a mexican couple but they're serving american food- oh okay, sorry, Peter and they're. Probably I got a feeling this meeting will last longer than their open hours, but go ahead. Okay! Well, shall we call the question folks? Yes, let's call the question and we're voting on all of these at once right, so blue hands up. If you can physical hands, if you can okay, I can't wear our blue hands tonight. Are they in the Q&A they're under pan a participant yeah, I'm totally out of it today, all right so physical hands? I have Mark Diller. I have. Let me see SLA one, so I have Mark Diller. I have rich robbins. I have shelly fine Peter Sampton Doug Mcgowan is five louisa craddock is six. I see, ethel is seven Doug clyman is eight what'd. Your is not what audrey is nine. Thank you. Anybody else, Paul sure are you there. Robert is ten. Thank you and Paul. Fisher are you? A yes looks like you are. That's 11. I have 11 plus 33. is 44., we'll call that the vote and lower hands and now we're going to say anybody opposed. Do I see any opposed either physical or blue hands, I'm not seeing any okay. So that's a zero anybody abstaining and I'm not seeing any hands of any variety, and is anybody ineligible for Cause Doug Andrew? No okay, so I have 44 to zero to zero to zero Linda. Let's go to the next one. West end Avenue. Okay, here we go 15 West End Avenue is a Morton Williams, and so they had a beer and wine license and they're going to expand it to a full liquor license because they feel that their shoppers can use that. So we did not have a problem with it, and so I hope you do not either so. If anyone would like to speak, please do so. If not, I suggest we call to question just look the quick, quick opportunity for anybody in the public to weigh in not seeing it. So, let's call the question all those in favor: please raise your hand now use the virtual hand if you can and if not the physical hand so and for physical hands. I have Mark Diller Shelly Fine is two: let's see, why is this moving around Doug Kliman is three Doug. Mcgowan is four nice of the dogs to be together? Peter Sampson is five rich robbins is six louisa is seven looks like audrey is eight Paul fisher. Also Paul Fisher is nine. Thank you, Robert SBA. Do I missing you I'm? Yes, you are so I'm raised the blue hand. Excellent. Thank you for that. So I have nine plus 32 is 41.. Okay, let's go to lower hands. Thank you. Anybody opposed. I see one opposed and any physical hands. I see no physical hands, so one opposed and anybody abstaining. I do not see any abstain, either way physical or virtual, and is anybody ineligible for cause? I have 41 to 1 to 0 to 0 on that one very good and the last pci is our former colleague Jeff Bank made an application for carmine's he's taking the space next door directly next door, the contiguous space to car mines and they'll be doing take out, but they will also they're also applying for a full liquor license. We thought that was a great idea. I hope everybody else does too so. Does anyone have a comment about that? I implore you to read our bci minutes. If you have any reservation questions, I'm not seeing any hands. Are we ready to call the question? Are there any? Is there anybody from the public? No one signed up, no one raised their hand very good rich. If you would rich, if you would put the stand- up sheet again into the chat every now and again, that would be great. Thank you. Meanwhile, we're going to vote on 2450, Broadway carmines. I'm sorry go ahead. What this is no just a clarification. They already have a full liquor, but it's it. Their extension into the contiguous space necessitates the application just so that they can serve in that space, but it's not. They already have a full liquor, they're, just extending their physical footprint. Okay very quickly, I just want to say: Doug, took the minutes to Bci he's been crazy busy. He came through like a trooper, they were perfect minutes and thank you, Doug Kleinman, okay, let's call ready to go all right, so I'm voting with that being said. Doug should do it all the time. Yes, the reward for hard work is hard work. Okay, so voting, let's see so I'm in terms of physical hands. Let's do it again. I've got Mark Diller, I've got shelly, fine, I've got Peter, Sampton I've, rich robbins, they're, jumping around again here, let's see louisa I've got Doug, clyman is six Doug Mcgowan is seven. Robert is eight. I'm looking for Audrey Paul Fisher is nine. Thank you audrey. Are you a yes? It looks like you are? Yes, that's ten and I do not see any others. If I have not called your name and you're, not blue, then I missed you. So I have 31, plus 10 is 41. and let's lower those hands, okay, anybody opposed either virtually or otherwise. I do not see any I'm not seeing any okay. So that's a zero anybody. Abstaining ethel is abstaining. That's one! Anybody else! I think that's! It is one and any anybody. Thank you for reminding me to remind you. Oh man, I'm sorry Maj. Are you voting maj? Are you voting abstain match? I'm sorry! What's your vote? Are you voting to abstain, Ned Rosenberg, all right? Well, the vote I have right now was 41 to zero to one to zero. If somebody could follow up with madge and adjust the vote, if that's an error, please let me know, but I want to move us along. So I'm going to say thank you to Bci and call on it's transportation, next right, yeah, so Andrew and howard take it away. Okay, I'm going to take this resolution. Many of you have seen us advocate over the years for curb extension at the southwest corner of 96Th and west end. It's a very dangerous place. Cars are flashing by going to and from the henry Hudson parkway Ps75 is at the corner. There's turns happening in every direction. It's a zoo. We have asked for curb extensions and DOT has told us. The only way you get one is if you get a sponsor to take care of that curb extension we have, we have looked around for Sponsors Council member Rosenthal has looked for sponsors. We have not been able to get. One roberta showed us that board four has also asked D.O.T to waive the sponsor requirement to get a curb extension in a dangerous place. So we are likewise asking DOT to waive that requirement and put a curb extension at the southwest corner of 96Th and west end, and that is basically what the resolution reads. Okay, I'm happy to take a question. If there is any you know the curt, the sponsor really is only an issue if there's an extremely heavy snowfall. Fortunately we have not had too many of those in recent years, but I think safety should outweigh this crazy requirement and I urge everybody to vote for this. Curb extension thanks. So Andrew I see a few hands. Shall we just call on them sure? Okay, so I see well. First, I want to go back to Madge. Are you what I just load your hand, manage your hand was up was that was that the okay Next is Jay Adolf got to immute there Jay. Yes, I have a quick question. Andrew just can you briefly describe what this extension will? Look like, there's a there's, a variety of treatments that D.O.T could use from a physical, curb extension to a designated area that is defined by bollards. There's any number of things they could do to make this the turn. Basically a much safer turn pedestrians. Yes, please they had some bollards there for a while, I think, and they have lines forcing you to make a wider turn. You know the ballads are in the middle. The ballads are in the middle of nine. Well anyway, just can you describe so we do not have a specific configuration is that it would be on the southwest corner along 96th street, a certain distance west from West End Avenue, it's up to D.O.T to to choose exactly which treatment they would use, but we want the curve extended so that it's a wider turn and pedestrians have more time and are more visible. Would that force the traffic coming off the West side highway to go from two lanes to one lane going east? No, I think two lanes is maintained. Actually that's right, okay, good thanks sure. So next speaker, I have is roberta, followed by Michelle. Then thank you. So in 2017 the principal Bob O'brien wrote a letter to the board. I did not copy the board on it because they could not find it because it's somewhere in the office and there's no one to retrieve it for us, but he he asked that it's a very dangerous streak for his children to get acrosss the street we've been working on this for three years over three years and it just the traffic officers are very upset. Getting children acrosss. The street is like taking their lives in their hands, so I urge everybody to vote for this and the board acrosss. The street will has agreed to help remove snow in the winter when the school is closed, but they were not willing. The board was not willing to sign a contract, so we do have partners but they're, not official partners thanks. Let's look the next hand is Michelle Parker, followed by Ken Coughlin, followed by Richard Ash. I saw I assume the sponsor is the one who maintains the area who picks up the garbage, who removes the snow, who calls D.O.T if some piece has to be or a bollard has to be replaced. Yeah, that's some of the things a sponsor would do. I do not know that they removed. I do not know why there would be garbage there. I mean I guess there could be occasional litter, but it's basically about heavy snow removal and and if there was a planter in it, they would maintain the planter Andrew. The school will maintain it when the school's in session yeah. That's a big plus here that yeah, but they can't maintain. They can't maintain it in the summer and weekends and holidays when they're, not in session, of course, and in the summer, it's likely there's less need for a sponsor too right. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, so next is Ken and Richard Ash, and then I think I see rich Robin's hand. These are called maintenance partners and they have to, in addition to take care of the space they have to get insurance, which is not is not always easy to do and which is scares off a lot of potential partners. Curb extensions are proven to save lives because they shorten the crossing distances and the slow turning vehicles, but the city won't adopt a simple measure proven to prevent injuries and deaths unless a private group promises to sweep up and provide insurance in case someone injures themselves in this newly safe space. In other words, to make something safer, they need to get insurance to keep it dangerous. They do not need insurance. What kind of sense does that make also? This is this is a matter not just of safety, but of equity. It's hard to find maintenance partners with insurance and even harder in low- income or very residential neighborhoods, so certain intersections go without if they're in low- income, neighborhoods or very residential areas. We should be doing this. Actually, the city should be putting these in by default and we should not have to jump through these hoops to get to make our streets safer thanks, Ken, Richard, Ash and then rich robbins yeah. I Ken really laid out the argument. My concern is that our letter be strong enough and indignant enough to get somebody's attention. It is outrageous that a matter that everyone agrees involves the safety of children should be held hostage, the willingness of some private citizen to take over the city's obligation- and so I would I would urge Andrew or whoever writes the letter to incorporate Ken comments and really make an effort to embarrass the city if necessary, go public on them. That's great! Just it's an amazing and it's short- sighted, because if a kid ever does get injured the city's going to get sued, you know and it's going to cost a whole lot more than maintaining a little couple of feet, square feet of of cement. Exactly and let's work with you on that letter, take a look at it and the city should look at Pl at intersections that have high pedestrian accidents and or fatalities, and put these things in themselves without waiting for a community board. But if we have statistics- and we should include those two and also mention the principle- yes, indeed, thanks- there's a new principle- that's school, but I'm sure they agree rich and then I think Amy him excuse me. Amy Hyman has her hand up yeah. I just want to echo both Ken and Richard Ash, in that this is essential. It should not be something that we need a sponsor to make the streets safer and to Richard's point. We need to be really strong. I would hope that we're going to vote close to unanimously, if not unanimously, for this, I think the resolution needs to be incredibly strongly worded, as does the letter, and I have a friendly amendment that I put in chat, recommending that we say curb extensions are proven to save lives. We should not need a community sponsor to install critical safety measure at a very dangerous intersection directly in front of an elementary school howard and Andrew. I hope you accept that as friendly. Oh, absolutely, okay, all right so rich make sure that you email that text to Andrew Howard and me, so we make sure it gets into the final version of the rest of the strong resolution yep and then we'll work on the letter, Amy you're up and then I think that'll might be it. I just wanted to thank everyone for putting this forward. We pick up in a normal school year anywhere between 25 and 50, kids from Ps75 and walk them up to 104Th and Columbus, so that's a long walk for them and that interception is probably our greatest fear in getting them to us. So I want to thank you guys, very much from us and from all of the families who go to Ps75 for hopefully making their walk a little bit safer. That's yes, and that, then, an intersection is doubly a dangerous because people rush the light at 96th and west end to get to the highway, and we have asked for cameras at that intersection so far without success. Well, I think we're ready to vote. I think, just as a reminder to the board, we actually tried to get the the one of the developers who, in euler to be the sponsoring partner for that intersection as a as a part of the conditions for their euler. The Department of City planning did not see it our way. So this is- and this is a better solution anyway. So I'm with you all end of my monologue and now let's call the question about cameras. Should we put cameras into the resolution? I do not think we should. I think it might give them an out. Okay, correct and also cameras, probably is something you want to take a global look at not just do one- offs. So, let's put that on a future agenda, all those in favor of this resolution as amended. Please raise your hand now virtually if not then physically. Some of us can't do the virtual. So, okay, so now we have one screen filled and I am going to do. The count again it's mark is one rich is two Peter is three Doug Mcgowan is four ethel is five louisa is six Robert is seven. Shelley is eight Paul Fisher's. In there too, I got Robert Right Doug Kleinman is nine Paul Fisher is ten audrey. Do I have any others, audrey Isaac says eleven. Thank you audrey, I'm just not seeing you tonight for some reason: audrey's 11 anybody else not seeing any others make one more pass here. So I have 29 and 11 is 40.. Let's lower the hands. Okay, anybody opposed do not see anybody opposed so I'll, go for. Abstentions. Anybody abstaining. I see one two. Anybody else abstaining, that's it there's two and then no one's for cause. So the vote I have is forty to zero to two to zero and we'll, oh, I'm sorry were there. Three abstentions looks like three. Sorry spoke too soon, 40 to zero. To three to zero is what I have now. Okay and the last one will be mine, and that is the bylaws amendment. The bylaws Amendment is an amendment that would allow us to vote virtually. As you know, our bylaws say that we vote for our board. This is voting for board officers now not for resolutions like we just did, and our board officer voting sheet per our bylaws has to be on paper in written in blue ink, and you have to actually physically sign it, and so the resolution that we announced last month for our bylaws to amend the bylaws is to add a provision that says that, if we're taking an election of officers during a period in which we're permitted to vote and hold meetings digitally or virtually as we are right now that we would that we could do it using a Google form or similar document each one of you has received that document by the way, but I won't get ahead of myself but the, but the amendment that is necessary is to allow us to vote using this method, because the only other way is if we call out everybody's name one at a time- and this is a more efficient and more it more properly emulates. The way in which we take our would take our vote. If we were in person, I see Adam Herbst's hand raised Adam. Do you want to be? Do you want to comment on this, or are you commenting for something else? All right? Can you hear me mark? Yes, you can go ahead. I was just curious if you're going to change this in the by- laws, but the community still be able to in advance know who the people up for the the positions would be on the board. The answer is yes, the answer is yes, because the way it will work is that we do not change anything else in the bylaws, so we would still have one meeting at which officers are nominated and then a separate meeting at which they are voted upon. So we nominated candidates for officers in at our September meeting and we're voting on them tonight, and that would continue to be the practice, and I see Adam Rosenberg looks like you're trying to comment on this as well. I just wanted to make sure that there was going to be a clarity to the public and that there's going to be a process by which people could get on there and see what's going on who could speak, etc. That's my interest, thank you yep, and we will continue to announce the results of the election. You know in real time and then and one of the virtues of this method is that we would be able to do it because this is about. Are there any questions from my colleagues on the board? I think this is pretty self- explanatory, but I want to make allowances for anybody who has a question and I am not seeing any hands. So, with your permission, I'm going to call the question and I'm going to because this is a bylaws amendment. I'm going to do this as a as a roll call vote, so please be prepared to unmute yourself and give me your vote on the amendment and I'm going to start with Barbara Adler. Yes, thank you. Jay Adolf! Yes, thank you. Andrew Albert, yes, Linda Alexander, Rosa Uranus, yes, Richard Ashe! Yes, thank you! Stephen Brown! Yes, thank you. Elizabeth Caputo, yes, Josh Cohen, yes, Christian Cordova is not with us. Ken Coughlin, yes, Paige Kelly, I do not believe, is with us Paige right, okay, louisa craddock! Yes, thank you, Catherine De Lazaro. She will read Abstain. Thank you. Mark Diller votes, yes, Bev Donahue, yes, Robert Spa, yes, Lolita Ferran Lolita may be training for for voting. Yeah. Okay, Shelley Fine, yes, Paul Fisher is a yes in the chat julian Giordano, yes, Amy Hyman! Yes, thank you! Madeline innocent, yes, Audrey, Isaacs Audrey. Can you hear you need to unmute I'll? Come back to Audrey K carpen? Yes, Natasha Kazmi, yes, Doug, Clyman, Yes, Blanche, Lawton I'll come back to Blanche saralind! Yes, thank you! Doug Mcgowan, yes, Courtney, Clark Matakas, yes, Ira mitchneck, yes, Clary Newell! Yes, William Ortiz, yes, Michelle Parker! Yes, thanks Jeanette Rauch, yes, Seema ready, yes, yeah, Andrew Ridgey, yes, rich robbins, yes, Madge Rosenberg, Thanks, Melissa Rosenberg, yes, Peter Sampton! Yes, thank you. Where am I here we go meg Schmidt, yes, Susan Schwartz! Yes, Roberta seamer! Yes, thank you! Ethel sheffer, yes, polly Spain polly are you with us probably may have had to leave for training as well. Yes over there. I'm sorry spoke too soon. Yes, uranus second call and Howard yaris. Yes, second call is for Audrey Isaacs Audrey. Can you hear me? I do not see audrey on the list either. Okay and the other one I missed was Blanche. Lawton Blanche. Are you with us? I do not see either of those and I'm just going to call one more time for polly Spain, but I think she's left the meeting. Okay, yes, hey, there's colleen! All right! You voted, yes got it; okay, oh no! I'm sorry! It was not polly. I missed. It was Irena Stennett that I missed right, I'm sorry! Yes, I voted before I thought I had you. I'm sorry just took me a second all right. So arena sent it. I do not see her name on the list either. So so I'm going to call that a day. So we have one two, three, four, five, six seven mark. Did you get Paul 44,142? Yes, I got Paul. I got 42. Yes, one abstention, so 42 to 0 to 1 to 0., okay, which means that when we it's 7:25 are the so that concludes the business session other than voting for our officers, a notice to the community as well as to my colleagues. I believe I mentioned this in a in a in a message earlier this month, but with the withdrawal of one candidate for vice chair. We now have as many candidates as there are positions and the only thing that remains to be determined is which will be the first vice chair and which will be the second vice chair that was explained in the email to you earlier today in closing your ballot, and we will turn to that ballot after we hear from the police department, assuming that the police department is with us, so Captain, Zuber and or Deputy inspector yaguchi are you with us, you may need to unmute yourself. I do not see that they're with us. If somebody else would double check me double check me on that. I do not see him. I do not see the mark in the pen and did not see them right. So let's do this. Let's start our elections, Committee presentation and we'll get as far as we get it. When the police department joins us, we will immediately pivot to them, even if we're kind of in the middle of something. So that is the so and a personal word of great thanks to our election committee, who had to sort of invent this way of voting on the fly and then do it again. So Christian Cordova, who could not be with us, was incredibly helpful with this rich robbins jumped in at the last minute to bring it all the way. Acrosss the finish line, Barbara Adler, Susan Schwartz, and who am I forgetting? Oh Josh, Cohen, who is the chair of the committee? Everybody did yeoman's work to pull this off, so many thanks for all that effort and so Josh. Why do not you unmute and start us on the election process and then we'll get as far as we get and then we'll pivot to the police as soon as they can join us? Okay. So the first thing is that we just wanted to introduce, have each candidate introduce themselves and just give a quick short bio, because there are some new members of the board- we're not here and maybe not know everybody so well so Mark Diller, who is running for chair if you could give everybody just a quick bio sure. I am, let's see I've been on community board 7 since 2008 I was chair from 2011 to 13, and I was I've been chair for this past year. The term will end in November. I am a lawyer by trade and have been working in that capacity since 1985. I am prior in my volunteer life prior to Community, Ward 7 was largely being a recidivist PTA president and school leadership team member, where I tried to lobby for funding for education and children issues and one of the things that one learns in trying to advocate for children is that schools need support, and one of those supports, of course, is the budget, but another support is a stable home, so you start find yourself advocating for affordable housing and for food security as well, and so that is a brief bio of me and my volunteer life. Thank you and now we'll go to Andrew for vice chair, we'll go to Andrew Ridgie. First. Thank you, hello. Everyone! I I'm Andrew, Ridgey, Proud, Upper, West, cider, have lived on and off in the upper West side for many years have been back on the board. Now, I guess, for I've, read now three or four years I just have finished my first forum as first vice chair in my personal life, I run a not- for- profit trade association that represents the city's restaurant and nightlife industry. So, as you all know, it's been quite a devastating time for our small businesses. So I'm passionately fighting for the industry around the clock and trying to share that experience and insights with the board and always an open year, tends to be more of a virtual year these days for anyone on the board. That really has any other issues live in the district. With my wife and five- year- old daughter who is now we, I guess, we're all doing a virtual, blended learning and trying to figure out how that works, but we love the neighborhood, love the Community, Board love being in the role of vice chair and look forward to, hopefully continuing to serve the community and I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Thank you. Next would be Doug Clyman, hi everyone. I am very honored and privileged to serve on this board and on behalf of this community, which I've lived in since well, let's just say, 55 years born and raised New Yorker and Upper West cider, I went to public school here. Pac87 is 44 and even kindergarten. Before that I am my professional work, I work as a commercial real estate broker specializing in small businesses. That's restaurants and stores I work in retail real estate, which is you can imagine, has been very challenging, and I do my very best to put in lots of small businesses and fill those vacant stores and do whatever I can to help in that regard, which has been a challenge, but I'm up to it. Also. I've been president of a tenant association, which is also happening to be a michelama building and was a a member of the Mitchulama Task force. The former Manhattan board President Virginia feels to help with transitioning buildings out of Mitchell, because the building I lived in unfortunately, was transitioned out. So we tried to make a very good deal for everybody and I'm proud to say most people stayed in their apartments, which was the goal, I'm just very honored and privileged, I'm finishing my first term as second vice chair and I'm committed to listening to the entire neighborhood and every one of my fellow board members and just to keep doing what's best for our beloved neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you. Doug. Now we're going to go for secretary and we'll start with Beverly Donahue. Yes, I've lived on the upper West side for 46 years with my husband. We raised our two sons here, they're in their 40s now so no longer with us in the same apartment, at least- and this is my first year on the board, I was appointed by Helen to serve an unexpired term this past spring, I'm recently retired. I spent my career in mostly in government and then in non- profits towards the latter part of it. I was at New York City OMB for 10 years. I was the Cfo of the Department of education for seven years and then for 15 years a vice president of a non- profit called numeration. It focused on school reform and I recently left that post. I care a great deal about this neighborhood and have focused in my time here on education and budget issues, and I look forward to continuing to do so. Thank you, and now julian Giordano, please hi everyone. My name is Julian Giordano and I'm really looking forward to serving with Bev as a co- secretary next year, I've been on the board for the past one and a half years. Now I serve on the Yel transportation committees and the bylaws and communication task force. I am 17 years old. I am the only high school student on the board. I grew up attending pre- k, elementary and middle schools in the district, and I currently go to Stuyvesant high school, where I'm currently in remote learning, government and politics, and especially local government, has really been passion of mine. For a long time, I helped found the west 64 through 67th streets, Block, Association and I've been interning with a few local elected officials. Also being a student is really important to me and I really care about student voice, especially student involvement in government, and so I'm the president of my school student government and I and I represent students acrosss the city on the Chancellor Student Advisory Council, for the Department of Education yeah. I'm really grateful for this opportunity to serve on community board seven with the opportunity to be secretary- and I think this past year, especially with the transition to remote communication, has been really important and I'm really proud of the work that we've done as a board as a transportation committee and as co- secretaries to advertise our meetings on Link Nyc's on social media and I'm looking forward to continuing network this year. So thanks everyone. Thank you now. If there's anybody who has any questions or any comments for any of the people that are running for any of these offices, now is your time to speak. We need to raise our hand. Josh, like yes and your hand is raised, my hand is raised thanks. I just want to thank all of the five folks who are stepping up to be in leadership. We're really looking forward to having you again my question or many of you again and some of you for the first time. My question is really just more about looking at issues related to gender and people of color and making sure that our board reflects what's happening not just in the country, but in our neighborhood and just by looking at the five members of the board by no it's a it's a great group I'd like to know, if any of you want to add sort of some specific proposals and ideas that you might have about how you're going to make sure that those issues are prioritized on our board going forward. Mark. Thank you. So I'll jump in on that we've been doing some great work on expanding the reach of our board and the opportunity to be of service in a variety of capacities in a variety of neighborhoods. I think the housing committee meeting this month will be yet another expansion of that, and so so that's one way in which I personally will be looking forward to that in a very different way. A number of us have been putting our heads together both within our board and then me with other chairs of other community boards, to try to pull together an inward- facing bit of work on issues of race, equity and and accountability and transparency, and we're working with the president's office to try to come up with something that would be tailored to what our board would want to see and use, but still be something that would be useful in the ways in which we move ourselves forward. So I look forward to that, of course requires money that we do not have, so we go to our managing partner, as you will the borough president's office who is interested in trying to work with the boards to come up with something that would be useful in that regard. There are a couple of other things we could talk about in terms of the ways in which our budget resolutions this past year, especially reflected the way in which we want to be of service to a broad swath of our community having to do with those who are the least able to enjoy the benefits. What what a lot of us do enjoy in terms of affluence in this community and I'm going to stop myself there, because I'm going to encourage everyone to be brief. So I need to I need to practice that, but those are just some of the ideas that I think might be responsive to your question and thank you for asking Elizabeth Next is Catherine Delazero, catherine. There you go. Thank you. I also want to thank everyone in executive leadership and building off Elizabeth's question. Mark I'm wondering if you can be a little bit more explicit, because we spoke about anti- racism, awareness training and I understand that. There's not funding and, as you just said, there's not funding for us to do that. Work as a board. Apart from the borough president's office, and given that this feels urgent, it's always urgent. What are your plans in terms of what to do what we can do? That's concrete to support diversity and inclusion and keep those conversations about anti- racism going? We spoke about and Madeleine just suggested, on the chat that we could do it ourselves. But could you be a little bit more explicit about what your plans are? We did speak about an inclusion and diversity task force at some point, but if you could be a little bit more explicit, that would be great thanks. So there were a number of folks who were interested in an inclusion and diversity task force, and my intention is to convene that and to try to come up with some topics that I was actually just speaking with the President's office today about this to try to make that a little more concrete. There is not funding for any one board to do one thing, but the idea would be to try to create something that would be useful for multiple boards, even if they did not all take it. At the same time, there are a lot of details to work out and that's what I want to come to that diversity and inclusionary task force to do is to set some parameters. That would be useful in terms of doing that kind of work, and also to come up with something that's reasonable. In terms of you know, racism and diversity training often can be a multi- day multi- hour workshop. That involves work before the session work during the session and then follow- up work thereafter, and so we need to be careful about what we're trying to build, and that's one of the things that I want to come to a group of our colleagues to work on to make sure that no one of us is calling the shots on this and that we get a good cross- section of what people will actually participate in and we'll actually meet the goals that we have for it. So that's a little more detail about what I'm trying to do. I thank you. Okay, so I'd like to just rich Richard, put a lot of work into setting this all up, and so he probably would be best to explain to everybody or take it from here again. Richard awesome job setting everything up, so please go ahead, yeah and credit to jerry who, unfortunately, could not make it. He set up the original version of this, but basically it's a Google form. We needed a secure way of knowing that people are voting for themselves, so everyone should have gotten the link. Everyone should have gotten an email from penny that has three things in it number one. It has the link to the vote. Actually it just has two things: it has the link to the vote and it has a unique code that you put in as the last question, sorry to throw up Richard, but the police are ready to talk. I think we should get them in so we can. Their time is and then get back to this after okay good. So let's do that so rich just hold that thought and we're going to call on. I think it's deputy inspector yaguchi who's with us is captain Zuber with us as well. I am Mark, I'm here terrific, so maybe we go in number order, call on the 2- 0 and then the 2- 4 for an update and then we'll have some Q&A and I'm sorry rich. If you could put into the chat the sign up sheet for anybody who wants to ask a question or make a comment, we're going to be limiting those to one to two minutes please so we can get as many of them in as possible and without further Ado Captain Zuber. Thank you for joining us. Sorry forgot to unmute for a second good evening. Everyone thank you for joining us. Thank you for including us in this again, so in the 20th precinct. We're noticing we're following trend lines when it comes to crime, where we're seeing slightly more property crime happening this time right now than we were a couple of months ago, but we're actually below a few numbers where we were this time last year, so the trends seem to be falling in exactly the same. What would we would expect and we're doing our best to address that as it comes up very happy to say that what we are not seeing here in the 20th precinct is what we are seeing in other parts of the city is that's the violent crime, especially the violent street crime. Even when you look at the categories such as robbery, what is classified as a robbery is the theft of property with the use of force by and large. What happens here. The 20th precinct is that those robberies that we take are shoplifting they're, where a little bit of force or threat of force is used, not the violent street type robbery that you are we're seeing other in other parts of the city. I apologize. I really do not have any prepared remarks and I understand that there are quite a few people who have questions you'd like to just get to those mark sure, but let's call on inspector Yaguchi first sure, good evening. Everybody again thank you also for the invite just for from the 2- 4 precinct point of view. I think we've talked about this before in other meetings, but this summer we've taken an inordinate amount of shootings. We have nine shootings for the year. That's up from one. Last year, eight of the nine shootings occurred in the summer beginning on June 19th we've had a number of shots, fired incidents as well in the last month, or so certainly we're not seeing the violence that we did in July, but we're still seeing some spots of it here and there in terms of the property crime we are up in burglaries. I think I've talked about in the West side. Rag and burglaries are up both residential and commercial birds. The commercial burglaries are mainly happening on the overnight hours. People breaking into storefronts residential birds mostly consist of package thefts, we're basically of individuals getting unauthorized access into a lobby, not somebody's apartment, but getting into a lobby and taking packages. We've had a large number of those steps occurring, and so that's basically the point of view from the 2- 4. I am good thing is we are down in robberies significantly, which is forcible taking a property on the streets which, which is one good news that we have for the year but, like Captain Zuber said I know, there's a lot of questions out there. So I'll leave more time for that very good. So I'm just going to pivot right to the questions. We're going to ask folks to we're going to call on folks first with priority who live in the 2- 0 or the 2- 4 precinct, and then as time allows we'll keep going after that so and I'm going to go more or less in the order in which I've received them here. So the first person- and we do ask you to keep it to one to two minutes- is Maria Danzalo or denzillo. Forgive my pronunciation, followed by Erica Gerson. Do we need to do something to unmute you look if rich and Doug can help me with. That would be great. So do you want to be on point for unmuting if we're both doing it we'll cancel each other out either way is fine Doug? Why do not you? Do it sure I'll? Do it and then timing you'll do timing, yep, okay, were we on muting? Now, I'm sorry, I read it off, but it's first person is Maria Danzillo, followed by Erica Gerson, followed by Jody Basi markov, if's, how I pronounce it. I do not see a maria in the attendees. I just do not know there. You go hello yeah. Can you hear me yep? Please go! Oh sorry, I'm last time I spoke, I was on my laptop and it did not work. So I switched to my phone sorry about the delay. So this is my third or fourth time. Speaking at the meeting. Thank you very much. Our NYPD and members of the committee. I'm a member of the West siders for safer streets group, 15,000 plus members, I'm a 40-year resident of the upper West side. I just want to again ask the community board to take our issues seriously. I know that when the announcement was made that people from Lucerne would be moving downtown community board, one stepped up and did quite a lot to you know, try to stop any movement into their neighborhood and based on you know the significant. What they said in their statements is that it was based on the you know, significant deterioration of the upper West side and increasing crime and other issues that were, you know well documented over many months. But we have felt in our community that the board is not hearing us and not taking us seriously, and the whole issue has become so. You know incredibly politicized. Just this past Saturday there was or Sunday there was a ceremony or that's what you want to call it where the building was wrapped up in ribbons with all kinds of people speaking and the press and everything else. It's turned into this huge circus and at the same time there were two major crime incidents in the neighborhood one which was witnessed by someone from our group. You know the assault of a person on the street on Columbus, Avenue and 70Th Street. So you know the irony of having this. You know ribbon- cutting ceremony at the same time that these crimes are occurring and having our community board just not hear us or you know. I appreciate you're, giving us some time today. But where are you? Where is the board in standing up for? What's going on in the neighborhood the you know, I understand that you know some crimes. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to cut you off because that that's well past your two minutes. Oh sorry, okay, no, not at all. Okay. I will perhaps later we'll have a chance to answer some of those things right now. What I'm really hoping we can do is make good use of the time of the commanding officers of the two precincts. So what if folks are raising their hands? I would like them to be asking questions of the NYPD and we'll certainly make time to Community board matters after that. But let's use the time of the commanding officers as best we can so the next person is Erica Gerson. If Erica could be unmuted, followed by Jody Bossie Markov, followed by Megan Martin hi. I want to be respectful, but you asked us for our for the forums not making it clear that this was for the NYPD portion, so I'd very much like to be heard tonight, but I want to be respectful of your parameters, so you want to talk about other things than that. That's great, we'll keep you on the list, how's that if you promise to call me again you're still on the list, I'm not deleting you Jody bassof markov for the NYPD mark. There's a question hi. Can you hear me now? Yes, go ahead, oh hi! So thank you for taking thanking me and thank you to the NYPD. I have lived on the upper West side for 25 years and I'd like to say I've never up until now felt so unsafe. So I just do not. I think the police are doing a great job with what they have, but I do not see them out there. I do not see anyone and I hardly see police and I'm. I seem homeless on every corner encampments of people. I've been approached multiple times aggressively for panhandling. I can't go to fairway and Cinderella's anymore. The way I used to go there I mean every time I walk out. There's someone panhandling approaching me that the platform acrosss the street from the train station on 72nd and broadway is littered it's for one, it's just filthy and for two there's people passed out everywhere: it's just I'm really. In 25 years, I've never seen the upper West side to this condition with the homeless and the crime going up. Thank you for your comments. Oh I have one more. I mean if you know I actually, on 76th and broadway at about 8:30 at night I saw a homeless person urinating in the doorway right there. Next to the lululemon shop, I mean I do not think that is the neighborhood that we know for the last 25 years. Thank you so to the to the commanding officers, do you have a response about what folks should do when they see things like that? Absolutely. Thank you very much, and I, since I got here in February, we've been hearing this same refrain over and over again it's it's about the rising and homeless on the streets. It's about the rising of all of the categories that come with, that is a root cause and then there's all of the other quality of life, issues that go along with it and we've been working very hard to address those quality of life issues within the parameters that we can actually work on, and one of those things that we've been putting out to as many people as we can talking to our neighborhood councils talking to our neighborhood block associations on meetings such as this is please, when you see a crime, when you see this violation happening, please call 9-, 1- 1, please let us know right away when you do that. You enable us first to get the best possible response at the time when it's actually happening and, very importantly, it allows us to document these crimes and these violations so that when we go back and we do our analysis, that is constantly evolving, we are putting our officers in the right place at the right time where they can do the most good when they can do the most good. And I have to say that since we really started this outreach after the first reopening after the pandemic, when people were going back onto the streets and after the little bit of unrest that happened in June and July, we've seen a drastic improvement and the people are contacting us and all of these forums are talking about the improvements that they're, seeing that we are working in the right direction. That has a lot to do with the officers on the street, but it has just as much to do with the community those who are working with us, those who are letting us know the eyes and ears out there. You know your streets, you know your blocks, you know your neighborhood, you know what does not belong and unfortunately we can not be everywhere at once, and it's very obvious when we are there, since we are all in uniform now and we are all in marked police cars for the most part now. So it's very obvious when a police officer turns onto the block. So if somebody is there with nefarious reasons, if somebody is there to cause some kind of trouble, it's obvious to them when a police officer comes onto the block so that they're just going to wait, they're going to wait until there is no police in sight, so we really need everyone call 9-, 1-, 1 immediately. Let us know and be willing to communicate with us while we're there any follow- up information such as what the person looks like what he's wearing what she's wearing. What's where they've gone since you called 9- 1- 1, so that we can follow up and get the best possible response. Thank you. I want to give deputy inspector yaguchi a chance to comment if you want to. Otherwise we can move on yeah. Our 311 is something that I looked at. I know Neil looks at it every day when we wake up as part of our email. So we definitely look at that. Like he said, speak up a recent community council meeting, one of our stores complained about increased homelessness around 93 and v- way. So the foot pulse that we've deployed, we earl we had them earlier in September up on, like five nine six in b way and we actually brought them south to nine three and B way. So my message to all of you is that the these kind of Forums Community Council meetings, 301 calls 911 calls they do help us move our personnel to give you a little bit more presence to the extent that we can, while you're out and about thank you, I'm going to interrupt for just a second, and this won't count against anybody's time, but I'm noticing in the chat that there is an increasing amount of what I would consider to be disrespectful and troublesome ways of expressing ourselves. We have the advantage of our two commanding officers with us and I want all of our meetings to be as respectful in virtual time as they would be in person, and so I'm going to ask folks I'm going to ask people to please use decorum and respect in all aspects with each other with the members of the board and certainly with respect to our police officers, who are with us at now, eight o'clock at night to make sure that we get information directly from them, and so I'm seeing Mr NIMBY. I'm calling you out right now that if that does not stop, then I'm going to ask folks to remove you from our room. This is just not how we can conduct business. This is not how we conduct a community event. We need to be speaking in a way that builds community, and I know that that's very difficult in these circumstances, but that's exactly where I'm coming from and I will not hesitate with that. I'm going to turn. I see that there are some hands from my board. Colleagues, I ask you to hold on because I'm I promised we would get to the community first, and so I am going to go to the community first and I think I think Megan Martin was next. Is that correct, followed by looks like Peter Artson, followed by Taylor banning? So if you could unmute Megan Martin and we're going to keep going on that on that vein? Hi, can you hear me? Yes, please go ahead. Thank you so on Sunday. Actually I was the eyewitness of that attack on Columbus and around 2 P.M, a group of young men attempted to Rob the phone store on Columbus avenue between 70 and 71St street, and they actually proceeded to viciously beat one of the workers and then they sped away in a waiting getaway vehicle. This was in front of pedestrians, children, senior citizens, people just trying to eat outside muffins Cafe. I mean I've lived on the upper West side for seven years. I have never seen anything like this on a weekend daytime event and just this past weekend, I can count for four pretty violent incidents. Three teachers were assaulted on 89th street. We all have heard about Rick Moranis assaulted at 7:30 in the morning on 70Th in Central, Park West, multiple car, break- ins, along Riverside, drive a robbery at gunpoint on CBS on 86th and Broadway, a woman had her chains stolen, basically just grabbed off her neck, so I mean I respectfully captain Zebra. I do hear what you're saying if you're looking at just some raw data, but I look at comstats too every week and these incidents- this is not normal. This is not. This is our new normal in the upper West side. So we need to find solutions, and is this going to be more patrols, more plain clothes officers, more security cameras. I mean the data is pretty clear. The NYPD is our greatest resource to make our streets safe. This is going to help our community recover from the devastating financial and public health crisis that we've all just faced, and I guess one of the questions that I think is a lot on our mind is: are your officers being diverted because of these sort of weekend events that now we're seeing more incidents happen in the lower 70s? So I have a few questions in there and I would really appreciate, if you guys, can answer them and just looking for solutions here, because I think people feel very unsafe. They feel very unsafe walking into stores. They feel very unsafe, walking down the street, and I can tell you I'm very shook up. I'm usually have my two young children with me and I'm very happy that they were not there. Okay, starting with the most high profile, those the Rick Moranis assault, that's something that was completely out of the blue and it does not have any connection to anything that we've seen otherwise happening here in this precinct or the other precincts. For that matter. It seems to be a completely random attack. There. Just is no explanation for it. The investigation is ongoing. We've had several crime, stopper tips we're following up on each of them as upsetting as that is for everybody. Obviously it's most upsetting for Mr Moranis and he was adamant that he did not want his name out. It's an unfortunate leak with the press in front of his building, we're still in communication with him and, as I said, the investigation is ongoing. The attack. What you said was the attempted robbery of the cell phone store. I'm aware of that also it was actually not an attempted robbery, though not to split hairs, but they did not go in to steal anything. They did not attempt to steal anything. They went in to have a cell phone repaired, they got into an argument with the owner and they that argument turned into a violent fight. So we did take a report for him. He was assaulted and that investigation is also ongoing in terms of the other crimes, the other property crimes, whether it's theft from stores or the theft on the street. It's upsetting there's no question about that and it's most upsetting to the people who witness it and I think honestly, when you look at the numbers and not to minimize any victim, because whenever something happens to a person, that's the most important thing right now to that person to that family to their friends and to their neighbors. I think that part of what we're seeing is there's a hyper awareness right now in the neighborhood on the upper West side because of the recent stories because of what's happened this summer and everybody's paying a lot more attention to it and we have meetings. We have people here into the precinct and we speak to them. They always come out and they say the same thing that it's like they've finally opened their eyes and they see what's happening around them. The numbers are not drastically different, higher or lower than they were this time last year. The types of crime are not drastically different, higher or lower than they were this time last year or the year before that. It's just that, I think, there's a lot more awareness of what is happening. What that's doing for us is it's allowing us, like, I said, to drill down on it and to put the officers where they can be used the best when they can be used the best some of the issues that we're having now it's no secret we're having budget cuts. So in the past, where we may have been able to use some overtime to put some extra officers on the street, that's not really an option right now. On top of that, where we used to use overtime to put officers into other parts of the city, we're having some issues with that, where we're taking people from working their normal tour officers working their normal tour and instead of them working here in the neighborhoods, where they're normally assigned they're going towards the mobile field forces or the responses for the protests, they're happy, we have a list and it's called minimum manning. It's the minimum personnel that have to be working at any given time in a precinct and we never ever go below that minimum manning. So there's always sufficient numbers of police officers working in the sectors answering the 9-, 1- 1 calls. So when I talk about using these extra officers to move them outside of the precinct, we're talking about officers whose primary job at that time is not to answer 9- 1- 1, it could be the domestic violence officers, it could be the highway safety officers and we're backfilling those spots with other officers. I'm sorry Megan. I know you did have a few more questions in there. Would you repeat anything else you wanted me to get into or well I just. I just think that you know whether or not it's you know you're saying it's perception or it's reality. I think that the idea that perception is reality and people are for sure you know the the robberies and the break- ins of you know. Vehicles are our reality and for people who have lived in this neighborhood for many years, including myself and my family, you know we are. We are noticing an incredible uptick of these incidents, and so you know what has changed whether or not it's you know regarding your staffing, where how the plane's closed officers are in the neighborhood, I did actually go back to the phone store on Monday and the workers did tell me that they were trying to rob the store, and I did so that you know the whatever. The circumstances were that they were canvassing the neighborhood looking to for opportunity. So I think that that's sort of an important point to make, but absolutely now that's something that they did not say that to the officers on the scene. They have not said that to the detective since then, if I do not know if you spoke to the same employees, who were there at the time or maybe they got the story second hand from the victim that we actually took the report for, but all we can do, is we investigate the crimes as they're reported to us? I'm sorry, I mean to cut you off. I just wanted to say that no and I just think that what you know whatever it is that you know we as a community can do whether or not you know it's. You know more security cameras. It's you know it's helping to with you know more security guards, it's playing close officers, you know what is it that our community can do, because I know you know in speaking to our neighbors and our my friends and the stores I mean people do not feel safe, and that is what is going to help bring back our community in terms of how devastated kobed the devastation that Covid-19 happened. So this is this is just such an important aspect of that we're never going to have this occur. I have to say that we enjoy a great partnership with all the local businesses and the buildings, whether it's privately owned buildings or the apartment buildings that have security cameras out front. I can't think of any time where we were turned away in doing our investigation, where they would not allow us access to their cameras. That's absolutely vital for us in this day and age as soon as a crime is reported. The first thing we go out and do one of the first things anyways. We do a video campus. We talk to. We have points of contact with all the local businesses in all of the apartment buildings and we know which cameras are pointing in what direction that allows us to follow perpetrators and victims, both during the crime and then before and after it allows us to do things like get the wanted posters out in almost real time, so that the police officers on the street, who are out canvassing within minutes of this crime, happening we're able to get to them. Pictures from security, camera from private security cameras, not NYPD or New, York City, Security cameras. It is absolutely a huge help in terms of property crimes that are happening at night. Inspector Yaguchi had mentioned this major uptick that we're seeing in package or most of the burglaries that are happening are packages that are left unattended in lobbies or in hallways of apartment buildings. And what can the community do? Get the information out there through your block associations through your neighbors associations and let people know please do not leave Amazon packages outside, do not leave them in lobbies where they're visible, if they're going to be left even up on the second or third floor, where they're not visible from the street, try to get them out of the hallways so that when people come into the buildings, they do not see them there and, most importantly, keep your buildings secure, keep the door locked. If there's a doorman, please still have the door locked because the doorman can be distracted. He has to go on his brakes sometimes and if there is not a doorman in the building, if somebody comes and buzzes to get into the building, if they hit the buzzers a lot of times, they'll hit two or three buzzers until somebody just instead of coming to the door, just lets them in that's how the thefts happen. So you have to let your neighbors know that this is a real problem that is going on, and safety and security is really everybody's responsibility. Thank you. I'm going to move this on, but while I look for the next name, if the two commanding officers could expand on that answer, just briefly to say what the community board can be doing, I know we have a budget oversight, issue or responsibility, and I would be interested in your ideas on that and, if there's anything else, that the community board can do to support efforts to for safety. That would be probably very helpful for all of us to hear so. Please go ahead, and while I'm doing that, I think the next person is the next person Peter Arenson. Is that correct, followed by Taylor banning, but but the captains, Uber and Inspector Yaguchi go ahead. First. Thank you. This is Peter arson with the Columbus Amsterdam bid north of 96th street, and I want to thank both of the ceos for coming out hi office, deputy Inspector Yuguchi, so I've got a couple of thoughts. First, one is that I hope that that you could talk a little bit about the guns and gangs and I'm hoping that that's being reduced. We are not seeing what we were a couple of months ago. So I'm I have hopes for that, but in addition, I wanted to just bring up the with fewer people out on the street. The people with mental health issues are more of a presence and we're getting reports about them. We're trying to communicate that in many cases they disappear before or they if they see the police coming they take off. So that is an issue that I'm not quite sure how to deal with so and the last one is just that really appreciate having the open streets for restaurants, the residents and the restaurants have been appreciating that considerably, having the space for both walking and for seating, and that actually has changed some of the dynamics with the people that have mental health issues and they are not as likely to act out in some cases thanks if there's any comment or response go ahead. Otherwise I'll call on the next person, so that's taylor banning good evening. This is Taylor banning I'm a resident of a different community board. Actually, thank you for the chance to speak. I just I just wanted to add that you know homelessness is not a crime and I hope we can all apply the same accountability to show towards ourselves to show respect when speaking about homeless individuals and to follow on that, I was wondering if the officers on the call would be willing to share what tools they use and what tools they recommend their officers, use to support and provide services to street homeless that they come acrosss. Thank you, oh also, 311.. At my community board we talk about everyone on a lot. It's not perfect, but it's a way to help at least provide services to a homeless person. Okay, I'm going to I'm going to leave to leave that question there. We did try to prioritize folks who live in our district in the 2O and the 2:4 first. That question has been asked. So let's answer that and then and then we're going to move on. So I believe the question was what tools are being used when approaching street homeless? That's for us, I guess just real quick. Our homeless outreach unit has been disbanded, so obviously we used to have a dedicated unit for that, just as an example, we had one homeless individual. I think that most people in the community know about I was at 96Th, Street and Broadway had all his stuff all over the place right at the entrance of the subway. I encourage my cops to begin a conversation with him not to remove him necessarily, but just to get to know him see what his goal was camping out there. They got to know him, they started talking to him. They said that he was a very nice individual about a week later, somebody came up. They were actually doing a patrol right about two blocks away. Just because of the homeless, complaints that we've been getting an individual came up to them and said there was a person that was screaming I'm going to kill. I want to kill people, I'm going to kill, you cops ran over there and they heard it themselves. Obviously something was disturbing him and they sent him away. They called an ambulance for him and he went to the hospital to get some psychiatric help. He was a back out the next day and then the officers were able to speak to him again, and I guess because of the encounters that they had previously, that the individual was a little bit more trusting of the cops and the next day he was gone. I do not know where he went, but please do know that we understand that homelessness is not a crime and that we are trying to deal with it in different ways by trying to get them help or trying to talk to them, trying to find out what is going on in their lives. You should also know that we also did reach out to goddard Riverside. They sent somebody out there to try to offer services. Of course he refused, so we are trying different ways of dealing with this. Thank you. I believe the next person is. I only have the first name christy, followed by Sandra Smith, followed by Nicole Melt Metzker. Excuse me see Diamond Correct, I just have christy on the street, but that might be right. Hi, how are you I just had a quick question. I just wanted to know by what percentage are 311 quality of life, complaints up through the end of September? And can you speak a little bit about the broad categories of 311 complaints received by each of the 20th and 24th precincts? Please sorry, 7 an issue with my audio. In the beginning, I heard that the second part of the question about the broad categories of three- on-- one complaints- yes christine, okay, so just in case anybody's unaware three one is. It was originally designed for non- emergency calls. So if you see a crime or if you're the victim of a crime in progress or if you have an emergency requiring an ambulance or a fire department, you call 9- 1- 1, 3-, 1- 1 would be more for other services throughout the city and it could be not just with the police department or the fire department. It could be with sanitation, with Parks Department, with department of Homeless services, which seems to be our biggest increase here on the upper West side, and so I'm sorry christy just one more time. But what did you want to answer? I just wanted to know like the percentage that it was up from through the end of September for quality of life. Complaints. I'm sorry, I do not have it exactly because the individual categories were up and the homelessness was the most drastic increase. Where was that increase exactly? I do not know christie, I'm sorry. I do not know the exact number you want to email me either that or I can yeah I'll forward it mark. I can afford it to you and you can share it with the rest of the Community board. I'm sorry! I do not have it on me, no problem. Thank you! That's great! I also do not have any. I do not have specific numbers as to what the increases are compared to last year. The complaints that we mostly get in two four are mostly those noise complaints, followed by parking issues and homelessness issues. I would like to say really quickly that if you were to ask any precinct any neighborhood around the city, what the number one complaint is almost universally: it's: noise complaints for the first time here in the 20th precinct, we're noticing. That is not the top complaint that it is actually the homelessness. Now. Okay, I'm just going to have a quick note that it's 8 15.. We invited the captains to be the captain and the inspector to be with us for half an hour. It looks like they are game to stay a little longer. If that would be great- and I have a couple a few more we're not going to get to everybody in this part of the session, and we did invite our elected officials to speak to us starting around 8:30 8,45. I noticed that Assembly member Dick Godfrey is waiting patiently to speak. I ask him: I ask his patients a little longer, but we're grateful that you're with us- and I do not know if there are others are as well. So, let's keep going with Sen, I'm sorry, Sandra Smith is next, then Nicole, metzger for sure hi there. My name is Sandra Smith. Thank you for having me. Do you hear me? Yes, go ahead, yes, hi! So actually I had a different question. It was about traffic, but since we're on this topic, can you captain Zuber really explain to all of us bail reform? I think we're very confused with what it what you of what the police officers are really allowed to do as far as, if someone's committing a certain crime like, if is it a violent crime, a non- violent crime and then they're back on the street and then how many times like it seems like the same person can perpetuate the same crime over and over again. But that's I mean that's the way. I do not know if that's what you're seeing, but maybe you can explain it to us. That is absolutely what we're seeing. I wish I could explain it. Sometimes I have a hard time. We all have a hard time comprehending it. Bail reform is not something specifically to New. York City is to New York state and it happened a little over a year ago. I think was when the first push started about 15:16 months ago and without getting into the politics of why or why not. It felt that giving cash bail was unfair, so effectively what it did was it. It stops people from being held in jail after they'd, committed a serious crime until they were, they had their court date so effectively, instead of being in jail off the streets, they're back out and yes again without getting into the politics of it, we have seen a drastic increase in the number of recidivists who are out committing the same types of crime time and time again. So I guess the question. Oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry we're going to have to limit it to what okay sorry go ahead. Okay, I'm trying to get as many people as I can. I get it. Thank you. The next person is Nicole Metzger, and then I see that Erica Gerson wants to rethink her having given back her time so, and that may be all we get to and this round, but we will have public session after this. If the commanding officers can stay with us a little longer, that will be great, but if not we'll continue to hear public testimony. So let's go to Nicole Metzger, followed by Erica Gerson and then see what time it is hi mark thanks so much and thank you to the NYPD I'd like to understand. If Helen Rosenthal has reached out to either of you directly to understand your resourcing needs, especially after the influx of 700 homeless, into the community within 10 blocks and whether or not you've had any direct discussions with her. I do speak with council member Helen Rosenthal, usually a couple times a week, either through text messages or emails or phone calls to talk to her about our staffing issues would really that's just not the way that our staffing issues are decided. That's through our department. Our department are the ones who who assign officers, not the city council. I'm sorry Nicole. Does that answer it or do well? Do you need additional resources? Because from what everybody's saying on in our group right, 15,000 people do not feel safe on the streets and we do not have enough officer present. I was sexually harassed in Riverside park twice in a week twice in a week and the guys got really close to being while I was with my boyfriend and before dark twice, and they got really close and continued to engage with us for a while. I should not have to feel that worried, walking my dog at six o'clock P.M in the upper West side. We need more patrolling in Riverside at dusk, you're, absolutely right. So how do we address the resource needs? Because I do not want to hear budget constraints anymore? I want to hear action and what can we do outside of budget constraints to restore public safety? I do not know, but I believe that it is 100 budget constraints when you cut the budget of a department, and you tell them that because of that they're not allowed to hire any more people- and you still have retirements, then just the rules are. Your numbers are going to go down. Well, if she controls the budget or can influence the budget, and we can put in our district needs statement that we need more police. How do we get this to happen? How do we get the October class of recruits that was cancelled back reinstated? So in six months we have actual officers on our streets, walking the beat keeping us safe. I think how do we do? That is exactly what needs to be done, if that's what what you're pushing for- and it's not just with one council member, but it's with the entire city council, it's with all the elected officials- that's 100! What we are asking for so Mark! I do not know how you can raise that, because I do not see Helen on the call tonight, but it's really important that we get additional funding for the NYPD. So I will respond out of out of turn to say that the Community Board also submits recommendations on budget priorities, and I think everybody on our board just heard you, and that will be a topic of a discussion later on this month. So thank you for that and I'm going to pivot to Erica Gerson, for what will be the last word I think, on this round of our matters, because we still have to do our voting and we need to hear from our elected officials and then we need to hear from the rest of the public on this and other issues as well, so with great thanks to the to the NYPD for being with us, let's go to Erica Gerson and then we'll continue on with our meeting, and there will be further public comment after that. Thank you so much. I appreciate the time and nicole. I think you raised a great point and I hope that the entire community board is listening. We've there are 15,000 of us who are feeling extremely frustrated. We outnumber other groups that are opposing us by 15 to one. So, as members when you vote for things, please keep in mind that your job is to represent us we're having the same problem with Helen Rosenthal, who seems to have forgotten that her job is to represent us as a way of background. I am born and raised on the upper West side, I'm raising four children on the upper West side. My family has repeatedly volunteered at the homeless, shelter at our synagogue on the upper West side. We pay a whole lot of taxes on the upper West side and we donate money on top of that to support our most vulnerable populations in our neighborhood, including children and families who are food insecure. It is a fact it is not a feeling. It is a fact that our community is overburdened with our share of our fair share of shelters and beds. It's unclear why our helen Rosenthal would say that our community would welcome more when we clearly are number nine in the city for the amount that we're sheltering and no community can do this alone. It's not about not in my backyard. It's about. We have to do this in a way. That's sustaining that can allow everyone to feel safe, including the 10 of our community, that lives below the poverty line, including the 10 of our community, who has to walk these dangerous streets with their disabilities, including all of the people. Who've been relocated to our community for safe shelter. We have women and children, who've left abusive situations, they deserve safe streets too. This is not about rich against poor. This is not about not in my backyard. Every neighborhood should be doing its part, and the upper West side has done more than its fair share for long enough, and I hope that the Community board will continue to advocate for us. It's a fact that people who are chemically addicted attract drug dealers. I taught my son today how to make a call. I hope you guys caught him. I sent him a picture. It was on 79th street by the church. It's a fact that when people are drug addicted, they bring the drug dealers. It's a fact that where there's drug dealers, drug addicts come to get more drugs and it's a fact that people who are drug addicted need to resort to crime to fuel their addiction. This is unacceptable and we need our community board and our elected representatives to stand up for us any comments or final words from from the elected. If I'm sorry from the actually sorry, if I can just ask the officers a question when we ask at the end of a crime, if we, if we're willing to submit our name and phone number, I did not submit mine today, because I've heard that the criminals will get our name and phone number. Is that true? And does it hinder your case against them? If we do not share our name and phone number? Just to answer that last question? There are new discovery rules in place that are a little bit more. That allows the defendant to get a little bit more information, but I think some of some of those rules have been kind of fixed to protect the identity of the victims. So just so you know it was part of the original criminal justice reform package, but obviously there were concerns about that, so I believe they fixed it. I have to get back to you on like the details, whether it was in the law or something that the courts came up with. So I think, if there's a way you can reach out to me, I can definitely get back to you with a with a more concrete answer on that one. I forget what your first first part of that question was I'm sorry. I was asking if it's more difficult for your case. If we do not share our contact information, do you need us to do that to help you succeed? I think no, just in terms of contacting you, it would be easier, but you do not necessarily you can share whatever information that you know whatever you feel comfortable with. Thank you. There are Erica. There are certain times when you call 911 certain crimes that we're investigating that, if it's an anonymous caller it it limits what the officers on the street are allowed to do and the reason for that being. It's unfortunately, it happens where two people could have an argument and one walks away and calls 9- 1- 1 and says yeah. He has a gun. You need to come, stop him right now and they're anonymous. So there's good reason why that is. It does not mean that you actually have to give the full spelling of your name or your phone number, just saying that you're willing to meet with the police officers if you're willing to stay on the line and answer questions to the 911 dispatcher. That immediately takes the police officers who are responding to a level where this is an accurate, verified, caller who's calling about an actual crime, so that things like that to to make quite a bit of a difference. Thank you so much. Thank you inspector negotiate. Did you want to chime in on that before we wrap this part of our meeting up? No, I think Neil covered it better than I did well. I thank you both for being with us. We are going to hear more public testimony later in the meeting. I see what my colleagues have their hands up. Is this you're waving? No, I'm sorry you're waving. Yes, is this about the NYPD? Okay, I'm going to give you each like one minute or two minutes each guys, because we've, the point of this exercise was to hear from the community, but I see your hands up, so I'm going to go in the order of Madeleine, Amy, Sarah and Courtney. Just because that's how you appear on my screen: go ahead. Omg, I'm sorry! Okay, I'm in the 24 present, and I was wondering about math squaring how is the police enforcing mask wearing because I won't go out after five people are not wearing a mask and if you ask them put on you go into these stores that the even the owners are not wearing masks. All the workers are not wearing masks, and then you have people going to the stores not wearing masks, and I will comment- and I think I'm going to get myself in trouble. If I continue to do that, but I did go to police officers and ask them to enforce some young men not wearing a mask in the store and they did not want to do anything. How should I approach that up on the upper West side well, upper West side on near Douglas houses and the grocery stores in the neighborhood? How will I deal with that from the 24 present? I believe the sheriffs have kind of taken on the enforcement regarding the masks. You can certainly let us know in places stores that you're having mask issues with and we can definitely refer those complaints to them. Well, they said they won't say anything to people they're afraid they're going to be hurt themselves. So how does the store owner deal with that? This I mean again like we can speak to the store owner and again, if there's, obviously a chronic issue which seems like it's the case. We can definitely refer that to the sheriffs. Is there any way that any place that I can add on madeleine? I got ta. I got ta cut this off, I'm sorry, I just Wanna get the complaint if you can put it in the chat: okay, thanks, Amy and then Sarah and then courtney and then Jay real, quick, please because we're running behind schedule here and I apologize. But first I want to thank the NYPD. You guys have a thankless job and I really do appreciate it. I'm going to take it one step further than madeline. There are many times I live in the 20th. I work in the 24th that police officers are engaging with the public without mass on. So I just ask you remind your police officers, it's for their health and safety as well as ours, and I just see that too often. The other thing I'm going to make a ploy for is. You should also include ps6 unless the 24th precinct can speak to their jurisdiction, which is the Frederick Douglass center. You know there are different issues in that community and I'm not sure if the 24th can speak to it, but I do encourage us to think about ps6 coming and then my question for the two precincts is: how has 911 over this summer? I live on 79th street, I'm primarily working from home. There are so many times that I hear the ambulances pulling up on our street, so how is that number increased, which is different than a 311 again in terms of the numbers? I do not know versus last year? How many it is. I talked about earlier in the meeting that we had a very unusual summer that was filled with a lot of violence. So just on that, I can probably tell you that there was an increase in calls. So that's amy, if I may also it's something 901 calls is not something that we generally track, because that can go to the fire Department to Ems. Also, it's also important to note that a lot of the times when you see a police car and an ambulance show up together. That does not mean that there is a crime. It means that both were sent. We had one just yesterday, where we're actually police officers were on scene, doing cpr until the fire Department until Ems were able to get there a lot of the times it's for somebody who's, just not feeling well or it could be for somebody who's mentally, not feeling very well and the police officers will go. That does not mean that there was any kind of crime or there's any kind of anything to be worried about. I was not thinking it was crime, but there is an increase of ambulances in this neighborhood on a daily basis, especially on 79th street. I understand that. That's something that unfortunately I would have to specifically ask for a report on that. I just do not know. Thank you, let's go to Sarah and then courtney and then Jay yeah. Thank you. I this is for the 24th precinct and I think Peter Arnstein touched on it as well. When you said mentioned the dramatic rise in shootings that to me is very concerning. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. If we know what the cause is and what's being done to address that, thank you. Thank you so much so part of it. I can't get too much into it. We for the most part. We know a lot of the players that are involved. Some of them are repeat players that keep showing up to shooting incidents. I can't really get into it too much. There have been arrests made. Obviously that means there's a court case going on, so I can't get into the details of it in instances where we're still working on the case. Obviously there's an investigation going on, so I do not want to get too much into it. If it's any comfort, we have identified individuals that are involved and in some cases the same individuals are popping up in multiple shooting incidents. You should also know that I've met with the district attorney's office multiple times throughout the summer, so we're working together to make sure that that the case that they're building and that we're building with them, our detective squad is going to be a strong one, and then it's going to be when they, when the cases do go to trial, that it's going to be a strong case and we're looking for. Obviously that's going to get them off the streets. You should also know that our detective bureau is also involved on working on cases and looking at the individuals that are driving the violence. So I'm sorry, I can't get into the details as to who's doing what names the causes who's aligned with who. But if it's any reassurance we are working with multiple partners, both outside the NYPD and within the NYPD, to try to get some of these shooters off the streets. Thank you, courtney. We're going to go to you and then Jay, so if we could move along, please thank you. Hi! Thank you to the NYPD for being here tonight. Ceo Zuber. I wanted to ask a question- and I realized we're running behind time, so I'll reach out to you offline, but my question was related to last fall. Ceo malin talked about kind of what they were doing to address very localized upticks, and I wanted to see whether there was some sort of a of a strategy in place there. I'm happy to reach out to you offline to talk about that, a little more in order in the interest of time. I did want to say one other thing, which is the importance of the data collection. We've been hearing a lot about the 911 calls and the 311 calls. I know people in the chat were talking about the importance of calling 3- 1- 1. I would just encourage everyone. We've talked about before to download the 3- 1- 1 app and use that as a way to also record data. That is how the city tracks this stuff and they need the data in order to understand trend lines. All the trends we've been talking about tonight. They need that data. So I would just encourage everyone to make sure that you have that on your phone in case you need it, it's a lot easier. It's really fast! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! If I'm moving folks along too fast. If there's a quick answer to this, then please go ahead and give it to Nicole's. I'm sorry to Courtney's. First question: I do have a very quick answer and exactly what that comes down to is deployment. It's a one- word answer, and it just means that we take the statistics. We take the calls that are coming in. We analyze them and we put our officers where they need to be when they need to be you're, going to see that with the neighborhood coordination officers, the newly appointed youth coordination officers and a new suppression team that we're putting out it's going to be the end. The former anti- crime officers are being rebranded as a suppression team, so you're going to see them out there. Do you need more funding for that? Yes, if you're offering funding I'll, take it and just real quick. A lot of people have told us in the past that they're afraid to call 9- 1- 1 that they would rather call 3- 1- 1, because they're not sure of what they're seeing or what they need rises to the emergency of 9- 1- 1. I would just like to say for everybody, who's listening to get the word out if you're not sure, call 9- 1- 1, if you're not sure. If this is a true emergency call, 9- 1- 1, our 9- 1- 1 operators know that if it is not something for an immediate response to the police, they will then reroute it to 3- 1- 1 one will not upgrade things so if you're, not certain nine on one thanks, Jay you're up and then we're going to get back to our the rest of our agenda, with thanks to the commanding officers, yeah. Just a quick question for inspector yaguchi on the open street between 87th and 95th street on West End Avenue, which is manned by police officers. Since, notwithstanding the mayor's declaration, when he declared the open streets requiring a community organization to do it, we have police officers who are have to take care of them and the open street itself, which, in my opinion, was never necessary, has created enormous problems at the intersections of 96th and broadway and 96th and west end with backups bottlenecks. Confused drivers confused pedestrians. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not it's time to restore that stretch of West End Avenue to its normal configuration it's more of a D.O.T decision, but I do think that it definitely helped during the pandemic just to spread people out, and I think it was. It was a great idea just to allow people to spread out and to walk around, but obviously it getting dark earlier. Traffic normal traffic levels have come back to normal, so I agree with you: it does create a huge traffic issue leading up to 96th street, but that will be a DOT decision, but that's what I'm observing myself. I know there's been a lot of complaints about cars going through west end. On that point, we have tried to do our best to try to get better barriers. We've had to replace our wooden barriers multiple times throughout the summer, just because either drivers do not see the barriers after it gets dark, they're running into them. We've also. I've also instructed my cops to show a little bit more presence over there just to just so people to clear up some of the confusion that you just mentioned, because drivers are confused sometimes, and so we are doing our best to try to maintain some kind of presence there. Obviously we do have other issues that we have to tend to, but since that complaint we have seen that in 301, we've seen it in the west side rag as well. We are trying to be as responsive as we can for those people that do use that use that open street. So thank you for that and thank you for both of you joining us for a full hour now of what was going to be a half an hour of public comment, and so we're grateful for that. Obviously, there are more folks wanting to speak than we can accommodate we'll do our best to reach as many of you in the next session part of the public session, but we do have about a half an hour or 40 minutes worth of board business that we need to do right now. The first thing we need to do so. Please join me in thanking the the commanding officers of the 2- 0 and the 2- 4 captains, uber and Inspector Yoguchi, for taking the time, especially this in the evening, to be with us and to share those thoughts, and we will continue to be. We will continue to be in touch about these issues. So thank you for that. We're going to pivot now I know that elected officials are lining up and joining us when we told them to, but we need to get our voting underway for our election to make sure that we do that before we lose Quorum. So I'm going to go back to rich, who was in the middle of explaining the last throws of how to vote. If we can do that quickly and get going and then we can tabulate the votes while we are hearing from our elected officials rich, are you ready to roll? Yes, everyone got an email from penny. That email has a link that email also has a unique code. Click the link fill out, the form put in the unique code hit Submit and you voted okay. So does anybody have a question about what they need to do now, and this is only board members? Obviously I do not see any so. Oh madge go ahead match. I can't open that windmill attachment. Is I try to my computer on my phone either one okay, then the only thing I think we can do is take your vote. You actually do not need to open that attachment. It's just a link and your code yeah. So click on the link, not the document. Oh okay, let me try that forget it very good. So, with with Josh's and Rich's permission, I'm going to say, let's all vote, so if you would go to your forum and click away so Mark, I see that there are already a number of votes and I'm looking at the time to see when they came in okay, Peter voted at 741 elizabeth at 8, 20. Catherine at 8 35.. You know the as long as you're voting during the meeting. That's actually kosher. You just can't vote before the meeting or after it. For that matter, I voted too early did. Do you see my vote there? This is Robert. Then. If you voted before the meeting started, then go back and do it again, please, oh, it was during the meeting. But during the meeting is okay I'll. Do it again? Can you see it Richard? You did not call off my name. Do it again? Okay, that happened really early and I was deleting before we got to okay. If there are no more questions, I'm going to, let everybody do their thing with voting and meanwhile we're going to welcome the most patient member of the assembly. That's Richard Gottfried is with us. Thank you for joining us. I understand, Gail is with us, and Linda is with us as well, and if there are any other electeds who are with us, please put your name in the Chat and Julian has his hand raised. I just wanted to mention we have. We might want to quickly just vote on approving the minutes from last board meeting. Maybe do not do it now, but just so we do not forget, like we have in the past. Sorry, I'm going to chair I'm going to task you with reminding me again before we adjourn, but thank you for that. So I'll do that from the guy who wrote the minutes and did them so well, so that's only fair assembly, member gottfried. Thank you for joining us. Welcome to Community Board seven happy to be here and it's been terrific. Listening to this discussion, I Wanna join in thanking our precinct commanders for being here, and I want to give a special shout out to julian giordano, who is attending my high school alma Mater and Jerry Nadler our congressman, and I have been fast friends since we met in our first week at Stuyvesant high school September many years ago. Two things I want to mention quickly, one, the terrific news we got from the courts a few days ago about the victory, at least at the state Supreme Court level, about the West 66Th Street. Building the positive ruling on the on the so- called mechanical voids decision is really terrific and hopefully that will either convince the developer or, if not, hopefully it will be upheld on appeal. Last thing I want to say is you know: there's been a lot of advocacy for people to vote by mail. People should certainly do their absentee ballot. If you, if you can mail it in if you can drop it off at an early voting site, but I really want to encourage everyone who is willing and able to do so to vote in person vote in person at an early voting site or at your regular polling place on election day. It's really important that on election night, the national TV networks are going to be broedcasting a nationwide total vote. It's really important that the votes, let me avoid blatant partisanship, but it's really important that the West side's votes show up as part of that national total. If that national total is not a good one, I'm concerned we're going to see some really nasty events going on in this country. I think you all know what I'm talking about by the way. If you do vote absentee, you can still vote in person you're not voting twice the board of elections before they open the absentee voting envelopes. They look to see whether you voted in person. If you did, they never open your absentee ballot. So if you want to mail in or drop off an absentee vote, that's great, but at all, if at all possible vote in person either at one of the early voting days or on election day. That's my message. Thank you. Assembly member, appreciate it and appreciate the delicacy of the no partisan politics at the Community Board part of it. Thank you very much. I'm going to go next to our borough. President Gail Brewer. I understand you're with us and are unmuted. Yes. Thank you. Thank you! Dick godfried. I do not think you or during that, as fabulous as you are, wherever the head of student council at Stuyvesant, and I believe that Mr Giordano is either incoming or already head of Stuyvesant student council just throwing that out wait a minute gail. I never got elected anything in high school, but Jerry Nadler got elected to every position, including school president. He was the most phenomenal candidate in the history of Stuyvesant high school. All right! Well, I guess Julian's got his work cut out for him because I'm putting my money in but anyway, I just had to have fun with that. One. You've got a very amazing board member. Needless to say, you better there's a couple of things: the schools- I guess we are doing- there- are no devices. I do not. You know you have their parents on the zoom. My phone is ringing off the wall, not all in district 3, but certainly around the borough. District 1 on the lower East side is missing. 534 devices. Just to give you an example: that's 500 children who are not doing virtual because they do not have a device. So that's a huge issue. We're focused on it we're going to continue just fyi. Second, we did give out masks and sanitizer and census information the first day of school for the elementary school children, and you know we're just pushing sensors. I know you see consensus, but what we're now, with the extra month we have, we did a mailing to the manhattanites who left. I think I might have mentioned that 35,000 of them from the ballot requested during the primary the league. When voters did it, there's been some good returns. We took out ads in the island Connecticut and the catskills saying. If you live in Manhattan, you must fill out the census. With your Manhattan address. We are trying everything we are also focused on the large buildings. It's not just that people. You know enumerators can't get in, because I have to say that between revenue and the 32 bj they've been very helpful. It's just who's in that apartment, so we're trying to get information that way through the management through the doorman. Without getting into all the specifics, we gave out money to non- profits that came from the governor. We ourselves sent out 280 postcards and what we're going to do in the month of October. In addition to all the above is we're going to focus in each community board. There are 12 in Manhattan on the lowest performing census track in that Community Board, and I do not know what it is in 47, but we will find out. So, that's just you know we're trying everything, because the people who left to be honest with you are killing the New York City numbers because they used to be in the 80 percentile in terms of filling out the census. The other thing I just want to mention is helicopters. I am swamped with helicopter complaints. I do not know how many are coming from New Jersey, the only ones that are from New York are coming from downtown teleport, which we've tried to eliminate all those that are tourists anyway. Just to say it's frustrating people are flying. I do not know how much is tourists. I do not know how much is the going to the airports, Et cetera, Et cetera, but we're going to try once again. This is like the deja vu, because the numbers are increasing. We do not have tourists now, so I do not know who in the world is flying in these other helicopters. Other issue, which is endless, is the after hours variances. I got a call today until midnight. Somebody is allowed to be doing development. I do not who can give such a vob permit, but anyway, all the after hours issues are ongoing and we're going to be focusing on that. I want to mention the masks, because I think the police officer get mixed messages. We wrote a long time ago saying everybody's complaining about police officers not wearing masks, and I have great respect for the 2- 4 and the 2- 0. But basically the answer is. I do not like the answer. The answer is, if you, as a police officer, are working with your fellow colleagues, you do not have to wear a mask. I do not understand that because we all see that and then we figure- oh they're, not wearing a mask. Why should I wear a mask? They should wear a mask all the time, but I do think they're getting mixed messages from the powers that be, and so that's what has to change, because if you're told when you're talking to your fellow officers, you do not have to wear. There's something weird about that. I want to thank Dick Godfrey for mentioning 50 West 66Th street, and what the who knows, what the future is. We like the current decision that has been made mostly about the mechanical voids, are illegal. It's also true that there's a BSA challenge in the works because there is a deadlocked tie as to what should happen with this building before the BSA, but we have not gotten any kind of a report. We need a decision what they actually decided in writing. That's the only way that an article 78 challenge in court can be brought is when there is a decision in writing. So we've written to the BSA asking for an official write- up of that decision. There was just a little win with the historic District Central Park Historic district. Today, a developer wanted to make some additions to a brownstone on my block actually on 95th street and the Landmarks Preservation Commission said uh- uh, you got to do it the right way. So thank you LPC for that. I worry about the seniors and food, it's more of a city- wide worldwide issue, but we all care about the seniors. The senior centers are not open all day long. I was at three precincts tonight because it's a night out and all the seniors want to know when is their senior center open, they're, not open and they're, really they're, just desperate for that collegiality, so in November, supposedly dipta is going to take over food for seniors, and I do not know how that's going to work. So we wrote a very long letter which we have shared with the Community Board and penny can say, send that out, but I think that's something that you may want to pay attention to. The issue of open data is something that you know we spend a lot of time on. There is a fy 20, open data, anal report. I think it might be something that you might want to look at to see if there's anything in community Board 7 that would be relevant. It does help say what is going on in your community, we're all waiting for February 2021. I do not know. What's going to be in the survey that is mandated, every owner needs to tell the public what is vacant in terms of the storefront on their property. You know, you know how challenging the storefronts and the small businesses are facing when we have the pandemic, so it will be a very different report, not a great report, but that's what it is it has to take place. I want to thank Mark Diller in particular for suggesting that we do the anti- bias trainings, the community Commission on Human rights did with us and we're going to be doing some more ongoing and so just stay tuned. For that information. I do think you should know that deputy borough president Alden Bonilla is going to go to a foundation, he's gotten a very wonderful job at a foundation and he will be leaving us and of course I can't imagine anybody who has taught me more than Alvin Bonilla and I know he's worked hard on behalf of the community course. I just want to let you know in terms of what can the community board do just to end mark? It's a very challenging question and a good one. I do think this issue of you know: 3- 1-, 1, quality of life NYPD. Where is the nexus that makes sense, because it's not clear- and I think that would be something that every community board should look at to see where what do you think as a community, the the guided riversides, the social workers, the caseworkers should be doing, what should nyp be doing, and how do we deal with individuals? Have this very major mental illness on the streets as Peter Arndt stated, it is not how it should be and we got ta deal with it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gail and my god we're losing Aldrin, that's huge, but godspeed keeping us moving. I have Linda Rosenthal and I've now seen Helen Rosenthal and congressman Jerry, Nadler and Robert Jackson are all in the queue. So I'm going to go in that order. Linda Rosenthal you have the floor. Welcome Community, Board, 7., all right. Thank you thanks for having me- and I too listened to a lot of the earlier public session. I would like to point out. There was an article in the New York Times, just the other day about how the bail reform has actually not affected the crime numbers, and you all can read it for yourselves, but bail reform. Bail was never meant to keep people behind bars because you're not guilty until you're proven guilty, and then your supposed innocent bail, so we removed that bail is not used that way. So I can talk a lot more about this offline, but a police NYPD report that was not distributed, but the New York Times got its hand on it. Hands on it said that bail reform did not cause this spike in crime, so just want to want to clarify that I had a bill which was ended up in the budget, which went into effect the other day, and that is the removal of the pink tax. The pink tax means that women's products or products that are marketed to women, maybe by being pink, not blue, often cost more and the same is for services. You know dry cleaning, a woman's coat, maybe more than a men's coat or a haircut, maybe more. That is now against the law, and so it's very proud to be part of that effort. The mechanical voids the. I hope. Any of any of you who are interested can read the decision by Justice Arthur Angoran, which so clearly states the absurdity of the mechanical void. That developers have used to go higher, and it's just so logical, and I hope, when they appeal that the judges on the next level will see the ridiculousness of the use of mechanical voids to get around zoning, which is meant to l. Zoning in those cases is supposed to control the height and the bulk of the building and mechanical voids just is are used to circumvent those very cool rules, and I have a bill in Albany with Senator Jackson. That would change the mechanical voids and make it make the terms stricter in the multiple dwelling law, and I think that needs to happen. Special music school and the rest of the schools in Mlk is very concerning. I know that in Mlk the HVAC system has not worked properly for years. School construction has spent millions of dollars over the years to try to fix it, and it has not been fixed. The special music schools in the basement with no windows and no circulation in the air, so I'm in touch with the city and DOE and various other stakeholders about that very issue. Okay, flu shot Day and I know some drug stores have run out of flu shots. I have my annual flu shot day on October 20th, the shots are supplied by Mount Sinai and we will be having it at goddard. Riverside Lincoln, Square, neighborhood center Tuesday, October 20th from 10 to 3.. We do not have the high dose senior shots, but we have the other. So if you're interested just email or call my office, I'm also having a Rat academy walking around the neighborhood and getting plenty of calls about rats. So we're having a rat academy that CB7 is co- sponsoring which is wonderful and that will be November 17th. I think the rats do not have as much to eat so they're foraging through the garbage that's put out there in Albany. We intend to go back. We have a lot of revenue, raisers to tax, multi- millionaires and billionaires. We were going to wait until the stimulus package, because then we could see what the shortfall was. You know, president on steroids and that's literally true now said, call off all the talks on stimulus which actually punishes the vulnerable people in America. So we'll see what happens, I believe we will go back and now it's probably after the election and do not forget to vote and you know, go to vote NYC. If you have questions on if you're, if you're registered you have till October 9th to register in person or via email, if you have a online, if you have a dmv license but go register and then go vote and that's it. Thank you. Thank you. That's Vote.Nyc! By the way, thank you assemblymember and we're going to go immediately to council member Helen Rosenthal, followed by our congressman, Jerry Nadler, followed by Senator Robert Jackson. That's the order which I saw you I apologize. If it's not the order in which you arrived so council member, please enuge and join us, and I've actually been multi- zooming for the last hour and a half. So I heard quite a few comments about the homeless shelters about the people's fear being on the streets and their questions to captain Zuber and his responses. Indeed, he and I speak quite frequently because I'm always trying to separate out rumor from reality, and I hope he was helpful with that tonight. I've also spent a lot of time on the phone. Speaking with many of you who spoke up tonight, happy to have another conversation with you. If you still are having questions you know, I just feel terrible that people are feel so afraid to come out of their home. It's really rough, it's really rough and I empathize with that. I'm not going to bring up some of the issues that my colleagues have already raised. Great news, I'm 55, West 66th street, fill out your census form you have to the end of October voting food distribution, mlk helicopters, flu, shots all very important, so here's new information we'll be having a shredding event on October 18th, which is a sunday from 12 to 3. we're co- hosting. This is in the northern part of my district, so we're co- hosting with assembly member O'donnell State Senator Jackson. It will be at the corner of 97th and Amsterdam Avenue. We are. My office is having a housing clinic tomorrow night from 6 to 7, for tenants with legal or housing court related questions. So you're welcome to join us there. Let's see composting. I do not think anyone mentioned composting yet and plastic bags. I was able to bring my composting over to the green market at 79Th Street on Sunday they're open again. The location is on 77th street, closer to Central Park West. They are there on sundays, from 9 to 3, and also at our green market on fridays, from 8 to 12:30, on 97th and Columbus 1997Th in Columbus, starting October, 19th New York state will begin enforcing the five cent fee charge to customers who use the store provided bags. So we've been handing out the orange go bags. We have a few more if you need them, let my office know but you're going to need to bring your own bag. Lastly, sadly we had to kick out a member of the New York City Council this week, which we did. His abuse of his staff became intolerable on both sexual harassment, as well as just personal interactions with his staff members. It was nothing we want to see in our elected officials and how they treat their staff, and so we went to the very extreme exam thing of expelling him. It was very painful to be to be a part of feel really bad for my colleague and for his constituents, and I just got off a panel discussion on maternal mortality and morbidity. If the health committee is interested in pursuing the work that we're doing in the council to address the you know ridiculously high rates of black maternal mortality and morbidity in this city, you know more than happy to chat with you about that. Thank you. If I could cavel for the on the Hhs committee, they've been doing an amazing amount of work about, among other things, the disparities in health outcomes, and I think you'll see that in our district needs statement. Thank you, Council member, I'm going to move us along. We have with us Senator, Robert, Jackson and Congressman Jerry Nadler. I think we saw Jerry Nadler first, so we're going to call on him first and then Robert Jackson, so Congressman the floor is yours. Welcome to Community Board seven! Well, thank you. I'm happy to be with you this evening. I want to start by saying I hope everyone is remaining safe and healthy and taking precautions to keep themselves that way. As you may know, last week the house passed an updated heroes act which was a modified bill from the legislation we passed back in may. The legislation once again provides economic relief for american families by providing stimulus, checks, restoring and expanding the weekly 600 federal unemployment payments through next January, bolstering housing assistance through direct rent relief and increasing snap benefits by 15. It supports small businesses by improving the paycheck protection program and providing the hardest hit small businesses, non- profits and entrepreneurs with second loans. It provides state and local governments with the funding they need to help weather this crisis. New York City under this bill will receive almost 21 billion dollars and New York state will receive almost 21 billion dollars in New York City 9 billion. It provides essential support for transit infrastructure, contains substantial assistance for the MTA, which will allow the MTA to continue operations into 2021.. It fully funds the postal service and provides states with new resources to safeguard the integrity and security of our elections and ensure the integrity of the night of the 2020 census. I'm incredibly proud that this package contains two pieces of legislation that I sponsored the restaurants Act and the save our stages act for New York City, to provide additional targeted assistance for independent restaurants and live entertainment, venues and theaters, many of which have been devastated by the economic impacts of the pandemic. We will continue fighting to ensure that Americans and our institutions get the relief and resources they need during this trying time. I do not want to take up too much of your time so I'll leave it there. Obviously, please do not hesitate to reach out to my staff if we can be of any assistance. Thank you congressman and we thank you for the sponsorship of your bill about helicopters. We heard earlier this evening that they are plaguing the upper West side as if we were a ballpark, and so anything that can be done to I know that's a federal issue, not a city or a state issue, we're grateful for that build of yours and congressman and whatever we can do to push that along our board, passed a resolution in support of that last winter and we'll send you another copy of it just in case a little extra nudge from the upper West side would be helpful. So thank you for that as well, and I'm going to go directly to Senator Robert Jackson. Thank you for joining us senator welcome to Community Board 7.. Well, thank you mark and members of CB7 and the public that is zooming in. I was listening to all of the conversations and your business meeting and everything. So it's a good opportunity to hear an entire board meeting, and obviously I have my community layers. Hope K is on also she's, my liaison to CB4 and CB7 here's the bottom line, as you know, all of the electives and gail and everyone else, we've been basically trying to up our census, count all over the 31st, senatorial district and obviously up in the northern part washingtonite and inward. It's pretty high compared to the southern part. We are so low in the southern part of my district, which is Midtown and the Chelsea area. I go down to 26Th, Street and Ninth Avenue that we really have to work on it, because that means money, and that means resources and legislation. We all know that and then everyone knows that Friday we hope they know is the last day to register to to vote. We we're surprised that so many people when we set up our tents to go all over the place that are not registered to vote or have not done their senses. It's just amazing to me that every day on TV on radio and everywhere else, you hear about censors and voter registration that so many people are not. But let me just talk about what's happening overall, and many of my colleagues talked about it. As you know, there was a zoom meeting with our U.S senator Chuck Schumer and basically talking about what Jerry Nadler talked about and in discussions that I've had at the state level. The state is not going to do anything as far as the budget director, basically April 30th and June 30th. He could have said that the state is so much in the red and give us ten days to either act or accept whatever recommendations he makes as far as cutting services. But I'm glad that the governor and him are not doing that. We're trying to wait to see what's happening at the federal level before anything and obviously we all of us are concerned about the budget and the impact that's going to have on our communities and, as you know, 20 percent of all education funding around the state has been held up. There's layoffs in rochester and yonkers, and what have you and obviously in New, York City Budget has the flexibility to absorb that and not really have a negative impact. But so that's what we're doing we're waiting for that, but obviously the most important thing right now is the federal government acting and if they do not act and we hope that they will, then the state of New York is going to have to act and obviously, about two months ago the majority leader and the akahisti, the speaker of the state assembly, came together and said that they are willing to consider attacks on wealthier new yorkers, so that that's a big thing to do so right now we're waiting. We can go back at any time, but no need to go back until we know what the financial situation is going to be, and I've said I talked to some people today about the climate, leadership and Community Protection Act, and they that's a major issue, but I told them the most major issue. Right now is the budgetary issue to make sure that people have food and people have shelter over their head and that their health they're surviving this pandemic. Those are the most important issues that we're addressing up in Albany and so we're waiting to go back in order to deal with that. But in the meantime, I'm just going out in the community trying to do what we can do to survive and obviously the homelessness situation. We have an obligation under our state constitution to take care of the poor. That's our obligation, that's our constitution, and so we have to come together and find a way to do that with dignity and respect for everyone and obviously by juggling people all over the place is not the way to do it and listen. One of the three hotels on the West side is in my district and I have many other homeless shelters up in northern Manhattan, so we have to accept it, but it has to be come with the services that are needed to protect everyone and as far as the community, everyone I say, the most important issue overall is the safety and security of the people that we represent. If you're not safe in your home in your community, then that's a problem that we collectively have to address. Thank you mark and thank members of Community Board. Seven. Thank you. Senator terrific way to end this hearing from our elected officials appreciate it very much I'm going to take a quick moment to give a brief chairs report, mostly because the elected officials have stolen all of my thunder and related all the important details. So I can make this relatively quick. I want to alert both my colleagues on the board and the and the folks in the audience that there are two changes to our usual schedule for the coming month. One is that the November full board is usually the first Tuesday of the month, I'm guessing that most of us will have something else on our minds that day. So our our full board meeting will be the next day. Wednesday November 4th and some of us will be popping champagne corks and some of us will be crying in our beer, but that will be the day. The also the October housing committee has been rescheduled from this coming Monday to October 26th, because the meeting would otherwise fall on well, depending on who you are and either fall on Columbus day or indigenous people's day. I want to renew my thanks before the results are announced. I want to renew my thanks to the election committee for charting this new territory for us and doing it so expertly. That's Josh, Cohen, Rich, robbins, Christian, Cordova, Barbara, Adler and Susan Schwartz. You have, I think, all of our thanks, I'm seeing clapping hands want to remind everybody that the steering committee- yes, police, cap or julian, of course, is snapping his fingers, as is the current phase, I'm showing my age and do not think we do not boast about you. When we talk about our community board. Julian Steering Committee is on the 20th, and that will be where we hash out a single set of budget priorities based on what the committee's come up with. There are a couple of things that we've heard tonight and couple of things that we've heard that do not fit squarely into any one committee, such as how the budget of the NYPD should figure into this, as well as the budget for the department of sanitation, and so we will work to make sure that we have all the information you need so that you can vote on priorities that make sense for our community we've been sending around to committee chairs the questions and answers filled in by the agencies that did participate in the Office of Management and budgets, consultations and we'll make sure that they are as available as we can we're going to look to put those all of them up on the website, so that anybody who wants to see them can see them. We've already mentioned the court decision already mentioned helicopters a shout out to both the one block Uws and the Broadway malls, both of whom have sponsored cleanups on a grassroots basis. They have done a wonderful job, it's actually a lot of fun to do it. I mean you know I get my hands a little dirty, but it's actually a great thing and I congratulate them for the for the for the for the initiative in a time of you know showing how we can come together at a time when services are down and I'll end with the 2020 Census.Gov as well. That's my chairs report. I think the only thing left to do is to call on the elections Committee and see if we have results and then to return to the public session, which will include reports by elected officials representatives when the elected is not with us, so Josh and or rich do. Are we ready to report or do you need more time go ahead? Josh. I was just going to raise that there are three people in who are attending the meeting who have not voted so it's Blanche, Richard Ashe and will ortiz okay. So let's give them five minutes more to do that. If they have any questions, please, I do not know why I can't be heard: hi Blanche hi, so are you able to vote? Did you get the email and are you able to vote? I have gotten the email I have been trying to vote. Obviously I can't be heard. I do not know why I'm not well. We can hear you now there's a link in the email you got from penny click on that link, vote for whoever you vote for and then there's a code at the bottom of the email. Please put that into the form and then so we'll give you a couple more minutes to do that and if you prefer we can. We can take your vote over the phone here, but why do not you take my vote over the phone? Okay? Why do not you tell us your vote then and rich? Can you record it please? Yes, I am voting acclamation for all the candidates, but you do have competition for the vice one and two. Is that correct? That's correct? Yes, if you'd, rather, you could put it in chat privately. If you do not want to publicly say who you're picking first and second tell me again, the two vice chairs, Andrew Richie and Doug Kliman and climbing richie in that order- great, very good. Thank you! Thank you, okay, and who are the other two that rich that have to still have to vote, Richard Ash and will ortiz very good. Oh, we have a late arrival, so we're going to stall for a couple of minutes to give them a chance to vote. Senator, Brad Hoyleman has joined us. I've just been told, and so Senator, please unmute, and you can chill for a couple of minutes for our voting process I'm kidding, but if you would join us and welcome to Community Board seven and then after that, we're going to call the election vote wherever we are at that point. If that's okay, with Josh and with rich hey mark, this is Mark. This is William. I've been having internet issues the whole day, I'm actually using this. On my ipad, I voted using voted via the email, but I vote for all standing all people. I voted for everyone. We do need you to express a preference for the first and second vice chair. Sorry, to put you on the spot, you can put it in chat. If you prefer. No, that's totally fine. I would I would for first chair. I would I select Andrew very good, so we have a tie on the over the phone votes, Richard, asher, you're, the last one to be heard and Senator Hoylman. Why do not you join us and give your report and then we will call the election senator. Do I need to do something? Let me see if I can, it might be, he might be in the I'm. Not seeing. Does anybody else see him? Oh, I got him hang on. You need to promote him. Well, I did so. Let's see what happens senator are you with us? I just promoted him, which might yes I'm here. Thank you all right, senator you're with us welcome to Community Board 7.. Thank you for the promotion. Thank you. Everyone good to see everyone good to see. My colleagues in particular my colleague. Yes, the councilmember Roosevelt we were out protesting today in our district. Our joint district, the fact that musicians who perform on late night television shows are not paid residuals for the fallon show or Jimmy Kimmel when those when those shows broedcast on youtube or other streaming. Nor are they paid health benefits. So thank you, Councilmember Rosenthal, for being there today with us. I wanted to make mention of the fact that my office, taking a page out of the council members, Book instituted something called Community board budgeting rather than participatory budgeting, which we know the council has used to great effect. We asked you how we should spend the capital dollars that were allotted to my office, your tax dollars, and you chose to have a quarter of a million dollars dedicated to little engine playground on Riverside, of course, between 67th and 68th. The Parks Department is going to replace and upgrade the safety surface and apply any potential excess of funds upgrading the play equipment at that playground. So thank you for the input we've put that in mark, and that is thanks to CB7 and we'll continue, hopefully in future years to to use community board budgeting as a way to allocate our our capital dollars that we get through the state, Senate and then finally I'll be very brief. A lot of my constituents. A lot of you have pointed out the fact that you often see police officers not wearing face masks. I sent a letter to the police commissioner, near the same time, governor Cuomo and mayor De Blasio also called on law enforcement to wear face masks as a way to model good behavior for the rest of us. We know that the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue does not do that, but we would like the NYPD to do that. There has been a directive sent by the police commissioner to his law enforcement. To do so, it's a little vague. It does not say what sanctions there will be if an officer does not follow the law which it is a law, it's an executive order as well as the fact that apparently no officer has been sighted. Yet that said, it's a good first step and I hope we see more officers wearing face masks to protect the public health and serve as an example. The other thing is, I'm very unlikely. I do not know about you to go up to an officer if I have a problem if he or she is not wearing a face mask so, hopefully we'll see a change in behavior, because you know the people who enforce the law should also follow the law thanks Mark. Thank you senator, and thank you for that report. The oh and thank you for the funding is what I meant to say. It turns out to be a tricky thing to find that I'm grateful to our parks and Environment Committee for finding a project that was worthy of the of the support that you're were able to offer us and that will make a meaningful difference in the safety of children. So thank you for that. I am now going to go back to the elections Committee and see. If we have a result, we do Mark Diller yeah, I will mark Diller is has been elected. The chair, Andrew Ridgie, is first Chair Doug Climb in his second chair and Beverly Donahue and julian giordano are secretary. Congratulations, everybody and again my thanks to the committee. Yeah well done! Okay, so we now are going to continue on with the public session. It is 9 30.. Let's keep going for a while and see how far we can get with the folks who want to be heard. I do see Liam Galligan, who represents assembly member, danny O'donnell with his hand up but clary before I get to Liam Clary. Did you have a question for somebody or because I see your hand up. I wanted to thank Brad Hoyleman and also you mark the project to in Riverside south to change the to redo the safety surface at little. Engine playground is going forward in all the just the morass of what's going on with capital projects and funding in the parks. Department thanks to Covid-19, good news that we got the other day in a in an exhibit from by the Parks Department. Is that project is one of very few that have now been completely cleared to get started and is getting started, and we're very grateful for that. Thank you, clary I'm going to go now to Liam Galligan and I do not know that there are any other if any other representatives of elected officials have a report, we're going to ask you to keep it quick, but but please go ahead Liam and meanwhile, if the others would raise their hands, so I can see who else might want to make such a report. That would be great, otherwise we're going to keep moving with our public session so Liam the floor is yours liam you do need to unmute and I'll mention again that you're representing assembly member danny O'donnell- yes, hello, sorry about that my laptop might just spaz out and is not working, so I'm using my cell phone. So I apologize for the poor video quality just a few things. One again just reiterate: council member Rosenz all said earlier. We are hosting a free shredding on October 18th, with Senator Jackson as well on 97th and Amsterdam avenue between 12 and three again. This will be, everyone will should be wearing masks, so it will be socially distance. So it's a great way of getting all the documents that have been stacked up over the six months and popular event. People seem to love it every time we host one second thing if anyone's still having trouble with their unemployment, insurance or Pua. Please reach out to us, even if you live in our district or the southern part of the upper West side, that is an artist or we're happy to help everyone just to get them through, because I know it's hard to get through the Department of Labor right now. Third thing: just to clarify some points on bail reform, with repeat offenders under the bail reform, the updates to the bail reform in this year's budget. If you actually read the criminal procedure law that the bail laws fall under, if you commit an offense, while you have been released, no matter what the offense is, if you commit a second offense and you will be subject potentially to bail- that's in the law, so I encourage people to read the relevant parts of the criminal procedure law, which is section 5:10. It's a pretty short section of the law, kind of explains how bill works, and I guess that's it again. If anyone has any quality of life issues with the city or state agency, please feel free to reach out to our office. Thank you so much Liam, first Assemblymember O'donnell and I see that Mike Stinson from Comptroller Stop Scott Stringer's office. It's getting late in my I'm getting a little tongue- tied here. Forgive me so Mike Stinson from Comptroller Scott Stringer's office. Please join us and welcome to Community Board. Seven thanks Mark and I hope everyone had a great holiday for those that celebrate great holidays for those that celebrate last month. Congressman, especially Controller Stringer sent a joint letter to the New York City Department of Sanitation, and the health and Mental Hygiene commissioner, calling on the city to take immediate steps to address the overflowing. Glitter baskets and increased rat sightings along the city's commercial corridors, citing dozens of complaints from business owners. Acrosss, the City, Congressman Espio and Control Stringer underscored that the mounds of garbage are both unsightly and unsanitary driving away customers at a time when struggling small businesses are relying on foot traffic for survival and attracting rats and Vermin which spread disease. While our city is in the midst of a deadly pandemic, Congressman Espeon Controller Stringer proposed recommendations to remedy the untenable piles of trash accumulating in our city, streets, sidewalks and public spaces, including working with business improvement districts. The upper West side has three great ones and business owners to provide flexibility to businesses that want to add street bins at their own expense and broadening the clean Curbs pilot program. And then, just today we sent a letter to Department of Education and the mayor to allow non- binary and gender non- conforming students, the ability to choose their own gender identity in the does administrative remote learning ecosystem controllers letter follows reports from concerned parents that their children are being forced to choose between only male or female, in the online portal for system for students to participate in school instruction, Controller Stringer emphasizes the largest school district in the nation, with 1.1 million children, New York City's public school system should be a leader in ensuring that every child, no matter their gender identity or expression, is treated equally with respect and can learn in a welcoming environment. So I'll leave it at that again, as every other elected and elected Rep said, fill out, your census form vote. Get a flu shot. My son, my nine month old, just got his flu shot yesterday. So please do it if you can and if you're healthy. Thank you and see you next month. Thank you Mike all right, so we're going to we're going to pivot back to our public session, and I'm going to take a moment here just to introduce the next speaker. We talked a lot in this space about the homeless. There's a brave homeless person who has joined us and will speak for himself, and so I am actually very honored that he has chosen to speak with us and am confident that we will receive him the way that we should and so with no further ado I'll use the name that I met him by, which is Cham's Da, homeless, hero shams. Would you please unmute and address us for about two minutes? Please, yes, can you hear me we sure can go ahead all right! First of all, you know thank you for allowing me to be here, it's great to be amongst this community. You know I lived here previously for three years, and this has always been a great community now being here at the Lucerne under project renewal. You know it's a different experience, but I'm still feeling so great about being in this community and I'm just honored to just be, amongst all of you to hopefully be able to approach the issue of homelessness in this community and the city of New York in a way that would allow for us to be creative in how we are able to deal with the homeless crisis as it is now and as it may get even worse, you know, as the months come, so one thing I want to say is I want to. I just want to say that a couple of days ago we did an event that was billed as a free story event and a ribbon of love to show the love that the community had for and the support that they had for those of us that are homeless, experiencing homelessness and in the loose stern. Unfortunately, for me, for the first time in my 51 years, I literally saw hate and racism up close and personal, I'm the descendant of slaves, I'm the product of over 400 years of overt and Covid-19 oppression, but I've never seen hate like that, and I was so moved. You know I was not angry. I was just. I really was confused because I never experienced it and I did not understand what was coming from the mouths of you know. Residents of the community- and I just wish I was able to talk to them and say to them that look. This is a miseducation thing. You really are not speaking on facts. You really do not know, and I wish that we were able to come together and clear up and clarify some of these things. So you could have a better understanding of what and those of us that experience in homelessness go through and we had some discourse, but it was not in the right form, and so I just want to say that you know. I believe that a lot of people have legitimate concerns and my objective as a homeless hero and as an advocate for myself or my fellow residents. I also am an advocate for any community that I'm in because I want to feel safe. I want to be around a place, that's serene, and you know that's devoid of crime and negative activity and stuff like that, and I fight from within and I fight from without so that we all can have a great experience. I do not like it in the shelters, and I do not like it in wherever we're at the thing is that, unfortunately, the city did us at the service where they did the community of the service when they moved us here so quickly, without establishing any rapport with the local community and all of the supportive services that are in the community. They just dropped us here and naturally there were going to be problems, so I was opposed to that. I do not. I do not support that and I, along with other people, have now. I do not want to say fought against that, but we try to combat that and find ways to creatively remedy that and that's what we did within well after the first three weeks of us being here, and I just wish that the community would give us that chance would you know, talk to us and let us know their concerns and see how we could come together and find a way that we could work things out. Most of the things that have been attributed to us are not even factual, are unwarranted and, unfortunately, are hate- filled and racist in some ways, and that does not mean that an individual because they want to see a good quality of life in their neighborhood is a racist. That's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is the negative portrayal by the media put us in a situation where we could be targeted in a hateful and racist manner, and I just wish that we could all come together so that we can eliminate that. So at this point you know, thankfully, to the open hearts initiative. Those of us who were traumatized by what was being depicted of us in the media we're able to transform that hate into us into love, something that many of us have been devoid of a lot of us that experienced substance, use disorder, experienced mental illness experiencing homelessness, we're in this position for a reason, and after a few years of this, we find ourselves in a situation where we forget what love is and thankfully- and this is the first time that many of us have experienced love from total strangers, and it's transformed us in so many ways, and so it turned me to where I said you know what there's no reason to be angry: it's not the fault of residents who would who disagree with something that the city did? It's not their fault, it's not our fault either. But what I want to put forth from here on is a message of hope and healing. I would like to see the community come together in a positive way, whether we're here or whether we go somewhere else. The fact I lived in this community. I know this is a good community. I know the people are good in this community. I would like to personally see us be able to come together and, despite our differences, be able to find ways that we can say look if this ever happens again or if this goes on like this. Let us do it in the right way. Let's make sure that we hold the city accountable. Let's make sure we hold the elected officials accountable. Let's make sure we hold the service providers accountable to ensure that when anybody comes into our community that they understand what this community represents and at the same time we are able to do things in the right way. Thank you very much for joining us and for your comments, and I think we all would want to take a pause for a second after that. The thank you so the there are, of course, a lot of different issues that are being conflated at once in this environment, and everyone's perspective is important in hearing this, so I thank you for sharing and sharing so directly we're going to continue with our with our public session. I did allow the one the only homeless person who was going to join us. I did allow him to speak a little longer than otherwise, but I hope I can be forgiven for that chair's privilege and I'm going to now turn to and I'm going to go back to the list of people who signed up to speak, and I see the name Sarah Mahmoud followed by Amanda and I always mispronounce this- is it fialk or fjalk, followed by Ryan stout. So in that order, now I see hands in the in the raised hands. I do not know how many more we can get to, but we were using the the sign up sheet that rich put into the chat rich. If you would put it in again, please that's what we're using to sign people up to speak Mark, I'm looking for the next person. Could you please sorry Sarah Mahmoud M- a-, H-, m-, O-, U-, D, 120 Riverside boulevard, followed by Amanda Fielk. If Amanda is ready, what is an amanda start and then Ryan stout hi? Can everybody hear me? Yes go ahead? Please thanks! First of all, shams! Thank you! So much for sharing that was really brave and really powerful and I'm sorry that happened on Sunday. You know, I think it's important, that we have open dialogue and that different opinions are heard, but there's a way to do that respectfully and some of the language that was used that day that you guys had to hear was, must have been extremely upsetting. I've heard a lot tonight about safety concerns in our community and heard a lot of calls for more security for Cameras. I heard Captain Zuber talk about us calling 9- 1- 1 when in doubt using it a lot. I did not really hear anything about the safety concerns for both black and brown people or for our mentally ill homeless individuals and how they are impacted by a heightened security or police presence. I live on the upper West side. My husband is black. My son is black and what I know is that black people, unfortunately are killed and have been killed at high rates by law enforcement. What we know is that one- fourth, a quarter of all police shootings, the victim has a mental illness diagnosis. So I do think it's important that we also address the safety concerns of those individuals when we're talking about safety in the community. I heard somebody mention that perception is reality and when talking about crimes and when talking about crimes in the neighborhood- and you know that statement also makes me a little bit uncomfortable, because I know that black people are often perceived as criminals, that mentally ill individuals are perceived as dangerous. A crime is not a crime, it's not a reality. Unless it's happened just because you perceive something to be a crime or perceive somebody to be dangerous, because they're mentally ill because of the color of their skin does not need you to wrap up please. So I would call on us to come together as a community to make sure that our black and brown population is protected as we're calling for more of the police presence. Thank you very much. We're going to go, I'm going to try to move us along now, so we're going to go to Ryan stout unless we found Sarah Mahmoud after Ryan stout, I have Sam Luber. There was a question in the chat from Melinda Thaler. I do have you on the list you're down a bit but we'll get to you or we'll. Try anyway, go ahead. Hi. Are you able to hear me? Yes, please yeah. So you know I think. What's going on recently, is you know culmination of a lot of factors the neighborhood's been in decline for a couple years, I've been on the upper West side for 15 years, it's gradually gotten. Worse and worse. I was almost mugged. Two years ago, a year ago, I started seeing people shooting up on the street. My most recent run- in with crime here was a man just trying to break into cars on 75th street between West Center Riverside in the middle of the day. So again calling 911,311 and calling the precinct doing all these things, they're telling us my question, I'm not sure if they answered or not when they were on the line is when does data turn into action, because there is something going on here. Thank you. We will relay that. I think what we heard is and what I can offer. I'm sorry to interrupt, but very quickly, data is how they allocate officers, so we can, for example, if we advocate for more officers, but the data says that they are needed in Brooklyn, then they're going to Brooklyn, even if it was the upper West side that championed the request. So it is the way in which they allocate their staff, both on a macro level city- wide and in a micro level. Here in the on the precincts, that's how the data gets turned into action, at least as far as I know, and then the officers may have said some more more things about that. Let me go to the next speaker, who is Sam Luber, followed by Nina Kelleher or if I mispronounce, I'm sorry, followed by Chris Caldwell, so Sam Luber on Mute. Please is Sam still with us, not seeing him. Okay, Nina Keller or Kelleher K- E- L-, l-, E-, H-, E- r, although I do not have an address for her, let's go to Chris Nope Chris Caldwell. That was the other guy's timer. No luck, Helene! Mandikkel! Mandelker! Excuse me for pronunciation. Helene hi! I'm here! Yes, welcome to Community Board 7.. Thank you. Thank you very much, my question and it's not really. I think it's a forefront, a global question, so I go into I live in the 24th precinct. I go into cvs and the toothpaste is locked up, ice cream, locked up for a long time, but everything's basically being locked up, and my understanding is that this is considered shoplifting and that these goods are being brought outside of the area to bodegas to other stores. And so my question is how, as a community, do we sort of cross the borders and go into and work with different areas and different communities to address? And this some may say this is a quality of life issue, but it has a negative impact. I think, on anyone who comes into our neighborhood and sees that everything is under lock and key. So how do we tran? How do we transport this? How do the community boards, how does the police department, how do the business districts work amongst us work together, because this is this is a global issue. It's not an upper West side issue, it's acrosss the city. It's started in the Bronx and it's worked its way down. Thank you for that testimony. Obviously we will consider all of these things when we're voting on budget priorities, as well as other actions that we hope to take. Thank you. We've heard from those two folks, Olivia Killingsworth, followed by John. Is it June Jun, followed by Melinda Thaler, so those are the next three hi thanks for allowing me to speak I'll, try to be brief. I just want to address some of what's been said earlier. Just try to throw some facts out there. Somebody mentioned that the upper West side for safer streets Facebook group has 15,000 members, but I just wanted to point out again that the upper West side has about 220,000 residents, so I may not necessarily be representative of you know I'm going to interrupt for just a second here. I would really like this not to be a dialogue of the two groups talking about each other, but about the issues that we're confronting as a community. So if you could pivot to your to your next point on that, I'm sorry to Interrupt, but I think that is something that we need to have to make sure that our dialogue is the kind of dialogue we need. Okay, thanks well, regardless. So regarding the the point about the upper West side, doing its fair share to accommodate the homeless. I just wanted to cite some statistics. These are pre- pandemic, but according to the stats, but just before the pandemic, we housed about 1.9 percent of the city's total shelter population. But in terms of our representative share of the total population of the city, we are about 2.2 of the city's total population. So to me, that actually seems like about right, perhaps even lower than perhaps our fair share if you're going based on the percentage of the total population- and I just wanted to echo what others have said- that not all of the clients at the temporary shelters are drug addicts. Many of them are dealing with other challenges along with homelessness, but that does not include substance abuse disorder and I would also say that folks who are in recovery need stability, and so if people want to support services and help these folks, even if they're going to be moved out of this neighborhood, one thing we could consider is encouraging our council member to support this legislation that was recently introduced in the City Council called Int 146.. This is, we need you to wrap up please. This would increase the value of city issued housing vouchers so that shelter residents can go, find their own housing and get up on their feet and go live on their own outside the shelter. Thank you so much. Thank you well done heard and answered signed on. Thank you. Okay, John June, to be followed by Melinda Thaler John June floor is yours. Do we have John June? Yes, yeah there you go ahead great, so recently DHS announced that they were planning a permanent shelter up in the upper West side. And so given the fact and again these are statistics, and I would like to see the CB7 board really dig in and find out what the true statistics are, because it seems, like different groups, are using different statistics, but I've read and I've seen where the upper West side is actually in the top 10 in shelter beds in New, York, City, and so, given that the upper West side is in the top ten and that there are other communities in New, York City like Upper, East, side and Soho that have less than 100 or zero beds. I wanted to know if the community board is going to be opposing this new permanent shelter, because we are already doing our fair share. Just as the last caller just mentioned, there is the fair share criteria in New York, and, if we're already in the top 10, it would seem to make sense that a permanent shelter should go into a community that has much fewer beds in the upper West side. So I just wanted to find out that CB7 is going to be investigating that and potentially opposing that, given those effects we certainly will be investigating it. I think it's important to know that the Department of Homeland services does not consult with community boards before making decisions like that, and that I think that's all I should say right now. Our elected officials also heard you, so we can. We can take that under advisement, but that's you know that that's as much as I know right now, let's go on to our next caller. One and it'll come in front of the community board, it'll be the 30-day review. So if it's permanent, it gets the review just. We have no idea when that's the piece that no one knows and by review it means it's really noticed yeah. They have a hearing on it, and I expect you well for sure yeah, but it's important to know that they've made all their decisions by the time they notify us yeah. Thank you, okay, so I think Melinda Thaler is next. Is that correct anybody paying attention to what I said because I'm not Melinda Thaler, followed by? Let me see who has not spoken, Oz Ben AMI, so Melinda Thaler. Are you with us? Yes, can you hear me, I sure, can okay, I wanted to talk about some of the issues regarding you know protecting our community. Some of these issues relate to the presence of the shelter that is in operation at the Lucerne, but whether or when that shelter might get relocated, we're going to have other shelters and these issues apply globally when some of the initial safety concerns arose. With the arrival of the new population, there was a significant alarm about housing of sex offenders in close proximity to playgrounds and schools, and we had a meeting of parents of Ps87 and Ps9, and we were told at the beginning of that meeting and I'm quoting here by our elected representative, Helen Rosenthal, that there are no level two or higher sex offenders in the shelters and she said she wishes. She could promise that there will be no new ones coming in, but she was there. She wanted to be very clear that she can not- and this is her language- can not guarantee that we won't get new sex offenders placed in as new residents in the shelter comparing and contrasting that there is now the proposal to transfer the clients of the Lucerne down to community Board one setting, and they have received a report from their community liaison officer, and they said that they want to assure the community that their safety is of the utmost protection and that the shelter will not accept any new residents. In addition to the 238 that are currently housed there and the community will not house any sex offenders in that shelter. So it presents to me a crisis and a failure in leadership when the leaders of Community Board one are able to protect their community adequately and then our elected representatives are telling us that they wish they could do that, but their hands are tied. It suggests to me that our leaders are either ignorant of how to secure that protection for us or simply unwilling to do it because it does not meet with you know their philosophy, but we need to make sure that our elected representatives have the same tools and resources to protect our community that the elected representatives in Community Board one have you know, I'm sorry. You know I have answered this question repeatedly, I'm going to try one more time. You hear the frustration in my voice, but project renewal, which is at the Lucerne. Now there are absolutely no to any to anyone's knowledge, no sex offenders that are located there, none so when they are getting moved, unfortunately, to community Board one their population will not change. You clearly just heard my question anyway, that I understand there are no sex offenders there, but I was focused on your guarantee that you could not guarantee that no new sex offenders would be brought in. He was saying that new ones would come in and then okay hold on hold on hold on hold on folks, no one gets anywhere by shouting over each other. I think the council member was trying to finish her answer. I will allow a brief follow- up just in case, but but then we got to move on so again. There never were any sex offenders at the Lucerne, and I assured everyone because DHS said to me definitively that there would be no sex offenders at the Lucerne okay, we're going to move on we're going to take a slight pivot. I jumped over somebody earlier on in the list because he was not applicable to the police and I apologize that zach Campbell from the museum of natural history has been with us all. This time wants to give an update, and I owe it to him to call on him so zach, sorry for the delay. Please welcome to Community Board 7 and please give your report hi good evening. Can you hear me you can excellent, so I'll, be very brief. Most of you know me by now my name's zach Campbell, I'm the community liaison at the American Museum of natural history. Just a brief update tonight on the gilder center project. At the last meeting in September, I noted that the excavation and foundation work on the project was ongoing, including some of the mechanical electrical plumbing work, as well as some of the under slab, conduit and infrastructure installation. As a quick update to where we are now, the concrete slab on grade in the north and southeast portions of the site are complete. Ninety percent of the excavation and foundation work is complete. Approximately 75 percent of the concrete portion of that the slab on grade is complete. The remaining excavation and foundation work includes finishing some of the foundation walls pouring the remainder of the slab on grade, which we anticipate completing in the middle of this month. We also anticipate that a tower crane will arrive on site later this month. This is to help us transition into the superstructure portion of the project. This will likely occur over a single saturday and as of right now, it's looking like that will be the 17th once that's finalized. Then we have the logistics of what that entails. We'll share it with the community board, as well as with some of the other folks that we communicate with in our task force for the immediate neighborhood as we transition into superstructure. We anticipate that there will be an increase in the number of concrete trucks, as well as some rebar formwork shoring deliveries, we'll continue to pro to provide updates as the project progresses and, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me or check our website at Amnh.Org and look for the gilder Center Link. Thank you. Thank you. Zach! I'm going to now call on Oz Benami O.Z Benami. Are you with us hi I'm here. Can you hear me sure, can welcome community board tonight all right yeah? So this is my first meeting. So thank you for picking my chat, so I just want to say you know, I'm really sort of disappointed to hear the discussion about. You know. Yeah. Let's push you know homeless, members of our community to other. You know places, let's push them. You know I mean these. Are people we're talking about not you know some kind of refuse that we want to get rid of, so you know just wanted to make that point and second of all you know, I do understand that there are real concerns about safety and security. So my real question is: what can we do constructively? You know and frankly, it does not really matter whether we do this. You know in community board, seven you know or whether people get moved elsewhere. I think you know what can we do constructively? You know to help those people who do have needs. You know whether it's you know rental vouchers or mental health support you know. So what can we do as individuals as well? As you know, through our various levels of government, you know and I'd just love to hear you know what I can do and what you know we can do as citizens and, as you know, organized government. Thank you. I'm happy for the electives to take that question or I can. There are organizations that are trying to meet the needs of the folks in those populations. The best thing to be to do is to be in touch with the service provider at each location, who will have the best idea about what is needed in each place, I'm looking at Helen and Linda, and one and Brad wondering if I did it right or is there more to say no, that's it and I think some of the groups, if they want, can put their contact information in the chat and by the way, there's a fly in my office. So apparently I've been criticized for waving my arms around there's, a very large fly that I'm trying to kill so very good. Thank you. Councilmember. We have time for just a couple more. I am, unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to call on anybody more than once so those who have been called upon that's going to be our opportunity for this meeting, but Linda Breskin and Merle Mceldowney have not been called upon, and so I will call upon them now and then we're going to wrap this up. Linda is unmuted. Thank you. Linda Breskin, are you? Are you with us? Can you hear me sure can get going? Okay, so my question is first of all I wanted to. I had put this in the chat I did not know. You were going to call on me that the homeless, I said that I was so sorry that he experienced that there are some bad apples in every group and get too passionate and go overboard. I do believe you deserve better services where you are. I hope you get better job training. I hope whoever has psychiatric challenges gets the help they need. I hope that somehow the city or the state provides that for you, wherever you go, because obviously we're not we're over challenged here, it's too dense and it's just sad. It's just really sad. I had a question is if the police can do anything about public lewdness. I wanted to know something about the turnaround that if someone does commit a crime, how quickly are they back on the street? And again I wish you luck and everybody else who's in Lucerne, wherever you do go and again, I'm on the upper West Side safer Street, because I've witnessed masturbation on my block. Urination I've been panhandled. I've been followed with my granddaughter while I walk on the streets, which is very upsetting because they're looking at her, not me, I'm a grandma. So this is a is a hard situation for all of us, and so again can the cops do anything about public lewdness. I think the I think you heard the the captain, zuber and inspector Yaguchi say call 3-, 1-, 1 call 9- 1- 1, that's they're, all the only chance you will have for them to both take action with respect to the that conduct and to make sure that conduct is recorded so that it counts against our statistics, for when we have allocations of staffing and resources, I'm not quite sure that they actually do something about it. So that's beyond my ability to answer. I handled and told that I that this person who was threatening me had a gun and I actually walked away, and I called up the cops and they said well, we they were just panhandling. We can't do anything about it, so I walked into the precinct, and I spoke to another officer and he apologized to me, but I will tell you that at the moment that occurred, nothing happened about it. But let's put that aside- and let's focus on the larger issue- that there are people who have seriously. You know emotional challenges, addiction, problems, homeless, problems, they're, trying to get back on the feet and somehow we as a city and as a state as a country have failed them. Thank you for that, and there have been some things in the chat that talk about. You know the experience at CB1. I will not compare myself to my colleague at CB1 she's doing a terrific job with her community. I will say this that a lot of the things that they are trying to plan out in advance. We had to try to backfill without notice, because the placement was made without advanced opportunity to create the things that some of the folks in our community have eventually come up with the Riverside programs, for example, which were which were directly relevant to the to the needs that some people saw. So but beyond that, that's probably all I should say about that, and instead I should stop talking and call on Merle Mceldowney. Who is going to be our last speaker with apologies to Peter. I see your hand, but we already gave you one. So I've got to let you got ta hold to that Ashley Gonzalez, I'm sorry, we're not going to be able to take you tonight, Merle Mceldowney! You were just here a second ago here, I'm trying to unmute him at this time. It's a herman thanks all right, cersei what's happening. I see I had to do that. No I'm watching! I thank you all for being here and conducting this meeting this way. Hey Merle go ahead! Oh can you hear me sure. Can oh okay, I have nothing to say. That's just fine! I was I'm just watching. Okay, well, I wanted everybody to be brief, but that was you know that that's a record, okay, well, I've said too much, so I'm going to stop talking rich, has his hand up. Shelly has his hand up I'm going to call on you in the in that order and then we're going to see about where we are rich. Go ahead, yeah. So it's not a discussion we should have now, but at some point we should have a discussion about what our policies should be for removing people from meetings. There were a few people, a few board members privately messaged me asking me to remove a few people from the meeting and it's not a question. It's not a decision. I feel I should make on my own, nor should any one or two other board members unless someone's being egregiously offensive- and I do not know what the answer is. I have a lot more sympathy for Mark Zuckerberg and I did a few hours ago. I still do not have much sympathy for him, but it is something we should think about and think about what our process should be. It's often a split- second decision and we do not have the luxury either of having the entire board vote or for the chair to be able to pay attention and see all the posts. So just something for the people to think about. Thank you, rich and let's put that on the agenda for steering. I know we got a full night that night, but let's spend some time talking about that. Unfortunately, when I'm trying to just not as an excuse but an explanation, I'm looking at the grady bunch here, I'm also looking at my email, because some people are trying to have trouble getting into the meeting and need to email. I'm also looking at my text when people tell me, for example, that this one or that one has joined our meeting, so I need to find them and so forth. So it's hard for me to see some of the aggressive things that have been said in chat, and so I think the answer is going to be that we should talk about it at steering and that we should and that we should deputize somebody to have that authority with. As you say, with guidelines, but able to act independently without me, or without so forth anyway, so, let's work on that together. I appreciate the comment I share it. I you heard me earlier this evening, try to say try to try to try to call us to a different level of civility. Obviously that did not work. Thank you and shelly. I think you may end up with the last word Shelley you do have to unmute. We would be remiss if we did not approve the minutes, go ahead and move to approve the minutes of board minutes of September. Thank you there's a second. Can we do this by acclimation? Is a voice photo sufficient aye? Anybody opposed aye, okay, so then the motions you have your hand up or are you voting on the minutes? Okay Madge has has a has a an eager hand- raising function on her computer okay motion. I think we're adjourned. Thank you all very much appreciate everybody's patience, good job. Thank you see you all there very good.
