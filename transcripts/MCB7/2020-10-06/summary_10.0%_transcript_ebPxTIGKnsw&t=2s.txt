But we wanted to do this as a way to accommodate the police officers and to make sure that there was an opportunity for some public comment.
We do not take donations, it's just something: I pay for my family pays for it, but if you'd like to help volunteer, let me know Jason if you would put your your email in the chat so that folks can find it, and I assume that's the way to get details as to where and when absolutely it'll be Tuesday the 24th all day it takes about six seven hours to give them out.
That's going to be living there, so it'll be an asset to the community and the block, And I, and we met the owners of the building and they seemed like mentioned kind of people.
These have great impact both on the row of houses, and this is looks on Google maps like a completely untouched row of houses, but also on If. You want a huge building, do not get a brownstone, do not taint with our neighborhood And I'm, sure they're, very nice people, but it just sets a really bad precedent.
Let's see I vote, yes, I do not know if you're getting this, but as people raise their hands.
, we'll call that the vote and lower hands 15 West End Avenue is a Morton Williams, and so they had a beer and wine license And they're going to expand it to a full liquor license because they feel that their shoppers can use that.
The street is like taking their lives in their hands, so I urge everybody to vote for this, and the board acrosss.
Letter, take a look at it and the city should look at Pl at intersections that have high pedestrian accidents and or fatalities, and put these things in themselves without waiting for a community board.
I would hope that we're going to vote close to unanimously, if not unanimously, for this, I think the resolution needs to be incredibly strongly worded, as does the letter, and I have a friendly amendment that I put in chat, recommending that we say curb extensions are proven to save lives.
I was just curious if you're going to change this in the by- laws, but the community still be able to in advance know who the people up for the the positions would be on the board.
That concludes the business session other than voting for our officers, a notice to the community, as well as to my colleagues.
That is the so and a personal word of great thanks to our election committee, who had to sort of invent this way of voting on the fly and then do it.
The first thing is that we just wanted to introduce, have each candidate introduce themselves and just give a quick short bio, because there are some new members of the board- Let's see, I've been on community board 7, since 2008 The term will end in November.
Team member, where I tried to lobby for funding for education and children issues, and one of the things that one learns in trying to advocate for children is that schools need support, and one of those supports, of course, is the budget.
And, I'm, proud to say most people stayed in their apartments, which was the goal, I'm, just very honored and privileged, I'm finishing my first term as second vice chair, And I'm, committed to listening to the entire neighborhood and every one of my fellow board members, and just to keep doing.
I care a great deal about this neighborhood and have focused in my time here on education and budget issues, and I look forward to continuing to do so.
And I'm really proud of the work that we've done as a board as a transportation committee and as co- secretaries to advertise our meetings on Link Nyc's on social media, There's anybody who has any questions or any comments for any of the people that are running for any of these offices, now is your time to speak.
My question is really just more about looking at issues related to gender and people of color and making sure that our board reflects what's happening not just in the country, but in our neighborhood and just by looking at the five members of the board by no So I'll jump in on that we've been doing some great work on expanding the reach of our board and the opportunity to be of service in a variety of capacities in a variety of neighborhoods.
A number of us have been putting our heads together both within our board and then me, with other chairs of other community boards, to try to pull together an inward- facing bit of work on issues of race, equity and and accountability and transparency, and we're working with the president's office to try to come up with something that would be tailored to what our board would want to see and use, but still be something that would be useful in the ways in which we move ourselves.
So we go to our managing partner, as you will the borough president's office who is interested in trying to work with the boards to come up with something that would be useful in that regard.
There are a couple of other things we could talk about in terms of the ways in which our budget resolutions, this past year, especially reflected the way in which we want to be of service to a broad swath of our community having to do with those who are the least able to enjoy the benefits.
That involves work before the session work during the session and then follow- up work thereafter, and so we need to be careful about what we're trying to build, and that's one of the things that I want to come to a group of our colleagues to work on to make sure that no one of us is calling the shots on this and that we get a good cross- section of what people will actually participate in So I'd like to just rich Richard, put a lot of work into setting this all up, and so he probably would be best to explain to everybody or take it from here.
Richard awesome job setting everything up, so please go ahead, We needed a secure way of knowing that people are voting for themselves, so everyone should have gotten the link.
We're noticing we're following trend lines when it comes to crime, where we're seeing slightly more property crime happening this time right now than we were a couple of months ago, but we're actually below a few numbers where we were this time last year.
I just want to again ask the community board to take our issues.
I know that when the announcement was made that people from Lucerne would be moving downtown community board, one stepped up and did quite a lot to you.
What they said in their statements is that it was based on the you know, significant deterioration of the upper West side and increasing crime and other issues that were.
You, know ribbon- cutting ceremony at the same time that these crimes are occurring and having our community board just not hear us or you know.
Someone panhandling approaching me that the platform acrosss the street from the train station on 72nd and broadway is littered it's for one, it's just filthy and For two there's people passed out everywhere, it's just In 25 years, I've, never seen the upper West side to this condition with the homeless and the crime going up.
And we've been working very hard to address those quality of life issues within the parameters that we can actually work, on, and one of those things that we've been putting out to as many people as we can talking to our neighborhood councils.
And I have to say that since we really started this outreach after the first reopening after the pandemic, when people were going back onto the streets and after the little bit of unrest that happened in June and July, we've seen a drastic improvement and the people are contacting us and all of these forums are talking about the improvements that they're, seeing that we are working in the right.
That has a lot to do with the officers on the street, but it has just as much to do with the community those who are working with us, those who are letting us know the eyes and ears out there.
My message to all of you is that the these kind of Forums Community Council meetings, 301, calls 911 calls they do help us move our personnel to give you a little bit more presence to the extent that we can, while you're out and about thank you, I'm, going to interrupt for just a second, and this won't count against anybody's time, but I'm noticing in the chat that there is an increasing amount of what I would consider to be disrespectful and troublesome ways of expressing ourselves.
And I want all of our meetings to be as respectful in virtual time as they would be in person, I'm, going to ask people to please use decorum and respect in all aspects with each other with the members of the board, and certainly with respect to our police officers, who are with us at now, eight o'clock at night to make sure that we get information directly from them, and so I'm.
We need to be speaking in a way that builds community, and I know that that's very difficult in these circumstances, but that's exactly where I'm coming from I promised we would get to the community first, And, so I am going to go to the community first Actually I was the eyewitness of that attack on Columbus and Around 2 P.M, a group of young men attempted to Rob the phone store on Columbus avenue between 70 and 71St street, and they actually proceeded to viciously beat one of the workers, and then they sped away in a waiting.
In the morning on 70Th in Central, Park West, multiple car, Break- ins, along Riverside, drive a robbery at gunpoint on CBS on 86th and Broadway, a woman had her chains stolen, basically just grabbed off her neck, so I do hear what you're saying if you're looking at just some raw data, but I, look at comstats too every week and these incidents- We need to find solutions, and is this going to be more patrols, more plain clothes, officers, more security, cameras.
So in the past, where we may have been able to use some overtime to put some extra officers on the street On top of that, where we used to use overtime to put officers into other parts of the city, we're having some issues with that, where we're taking people from working their normal tour officers working their normal tour and instead of them working here in the neighborhoods, where they're normally assigned they're going towards the mobile field forces or the responses for the protests, they're happy.
If I do not know if you spoke to the same employees, who were there at the time, or maybe they got the story second hand from the victim that we actually took the report, for, And I, just think that what you know whatever it is that you know we as a community can do You, know more security, cameras.
You know what is it that our community can do, because I know you know in speaking to our neighbors and our my friends and the stores I mean people do not feel safe, and that is what is going to help bring back our community in terms of how devastated kobed the devastation that Covid-19 happened.
We have points of contact with all the local businesses in all of the apartment buildings, and we know which cameras are pointing in what direction that allows us to follow perpetrators and victims, both during the crime and then before and after it allows us to do things like get the wanted posters out in almost real time, so that the police officers on the street, who are out canvassing within minutes of this crime, happening we're able to get to them.
Outside, do not leave them in lobbies where they're visible, if they're going to be left even up on the second or third floor, where they're not visible from the street, try to get them out of the hallways so that when people come into the buildings, they do not see them there and, most importantly, keep your buildings secure, keep the door locked.
You have to let your neighbors know that this is a real problem that is going on, and safety and security is really everybody's.
I'm going to move this on, but while I look for the next name, if the two commanding officers could expand on that answer, just briefly to say what the community board can be doing , I know we have a budget oversight, issue or responsibility, and I would be interested in your ideas on that If there's anything else, that the community board can do to support efforts to for safety.
Hi office, deputy Inspector, Yuguchi I have hopes for that, but in addition, I wanted to just bring up the with fewer people out on the street.
The residents and the restaurants have been appreciating that considerably, having the space for both walking and for seating, and that actually has changed some of the dynamics with the people that have mental health issues and they are not as likely to act out in some cases.
And I hope we can all apply the same accountability to show towards ourselves to show respect when speaking about homeless individuals and to follow on that What tools, they recommend their officers, use to support and provide services to street homeless that they come acrosss.
I think that most people in the community know about I was at 96Th, Street and Broadway had all his stuff all over the place right at the entrance of the subway.
I do not know where he went, but please do know that we understand that homelessness is not a crime and that we are trying to deal with it in different ways by trying to get them help or trying to talk to them, trying to find out what is going on in their lives.
So much and thank you to the NYPD If Helen Rosenthal has reached out to either of you directly to understand your resourcing needs, especially after the influx of 700 homeless, into the community within 10 blocks, and whether or not you've had any direct discussions with her.
Because from what everybody's saying on in our group, right, 15,000 people do not feel safe on the streets and we do not have enough officer.
And I'm, going to pivot to Erica Gerson, for what will be the last word, I think, on this round of our matters, because we still have to do our voting Then we need to hear from the rest of the public on this and other issues as well.
Every neighborhood should be doing its part, and the upper West side has done more than its fair share for long enough, and I hope that the Community board will continue to advocate for us.
That immediately takes the police officers who are responding to a level where this is an accurate, verified, caller who's calling about an actual crime, so that things like that to to make quite a bit of a difference.
You should also know that I've met with the district attorney's office multiple times throughout the summer, so we're working together to make sure that that the case that they're building and that we're building with them, our detective squad is going to be a strong one, and then it's going to be when they, when the cases do go to trial, that it's going to be a strong case.
And, then we're going to get back to our the rest of our agenda, with thanks to the commanding officers, Just, a quick question for inspector yaguchi on the open street between 87th and 95th street on West End Avenue, which is manned by police, officers.
I know, there's been a lot of complaints about cars going through west end.
Thank you for that and thank you for both of you joining us for a full hour now of what was going to be a half an hour of public comment, There are more folks wanting to speak than we can accommodate we'll do our best to reach as many of you in the next session, part of the public session, but we do have about a half an hour or 40 minutes worth of board business that we need to do right, now.
Two things I want to mention quickly, one, the terrific news we got from the courts a few days ago about the victory, at least at the state Supreme Court level, about the West 66Th Street.
The positive ruling on the on the so- called mechanical voids decision is really terrific and hopefully that will either convince the developer Last thing I want to say, is you know, there's been a lot of advocacy for people to vote by mail.
You know we're trying everything, because the people who left to be honest with you are killing the New York City numbers because they used to be in the 80 percentile in terms of filling out the census.
We wrote a long time ago saying: everybody's complaining about police officers not wearing masks, and I have great respect for the 2- 4 and the 2- 0.
I want to thank Dick Godfrey for mentioning 50, West, 66Th street, and what the who knows, what the future is.
Today, a developer wanted to make some additions to a brownstone on my block actually on 95th street and the Landmarks Preservation Commission said uh- I worry about the seniors and food, it's more of a city- wide worldwide issue, but we all care about the seniors.
We wrote a very long letter which we have shared with the Community Board and penny can say, send that out, but I think that's something that you may want to pay attention.
I just want to let you know in terms of what can the community board do just to end mark?
If you have a online, if you have a dmv license but go register and then go vote, And we're going to go immediately to council member Helen Rosenthal, followed by our congressman, Jerry Nadler, So I heard quite a few comments about the homeless shelters about the people's fear being on the streets and their questions to captain Zuber and his responses.
I think we saw Jerry Nadler first, so we're going to call on him first And I want to start by saying I hope everyone is remaining safe and healthy and taking precautions to keep themselves that way.
I, know: that's a federal issue, not a city or a state issue, we're grateful for that build of yours and congressman and whatever we can do to push that along our board, passed a resolution in support of that last winter and Thank you for joining us, senator welcome to Community Board 7.
We're trying to wait to see what's happening at the federal level before anything and obviously we all of us are concerned about the budget and the impact that's going to have on our communities and.
We can go back at any time, but no need to go back until we know what the financial situation is going to.
Those are the most important issues that we're addressing up in Albany But in the meantime, I'm just going out in the community trying to do what we can do to survive and obviously the homelessness situation.
And I have many other homeless shelters up in northern Manhattan, so we have to accept it, but it has to be come with the services that are needed to protect everyone and, as far as the community, everyone I say.
There are a couple of things that we've heard tonight and couple of things that we've heard that do not fit squarely into any one committee, such as how the budget of the NYPD should figure into this, as well as the budget for the department of sanitation, and so we will work to make sure that we have all the information you need so that you can vote on priorities that make sense for our community.
I wanted to make mention of the fact that my office, taking a page out of the council, members, Book instituted something called Community board budgeting rather than participatory budgeting, which we know the council has used to great effect.
Thank you for the input we've put that in mark, and that is thanks to CB7 And, we'll continue, hopefully in future years, to to use community board budgeting as a way to allocate our our capital dollars that we get through the state, Senate and A.
People seem to love it every time we host one second thing if anyone's still having trouble with their unemployment, insurance or Pua. That is an artist or we're happy to help everyone just to get them through, because I know it's hard to get through the Department of Labor right, now.
You know thank you for allowing me to be here, it's great to be amongst this community.
You know I lived here previously for three years, and this has always been a great community now being here at the Lucerne under project renewal.
That's what we did within well after the first three weeks of us being here, And I just wish that the community would give us that chance You know, talk to us and let us know their concerns and see how we could come together and find a way that we could work things.
I know the people are good in this community.
Let's, make sure we hold the service providers accountable to ensure that when anybody comes into our community that they understand what this community represents and at the same time we are able to do things in the right.
So, the there are, of course, a lot of different issues that are being conflated at once in this environment, and everyone's perspective is important in hearing this We're going to continue with our with our public session.
That's how the data gets turned into action, at least as far as I know, and then the officers may have said some more more things about that.
So Somebody mentioned that the upper West side for safer streets, Facebook group has 15,000 members, but I just wanted to point out again that the upper West side has about 220,000 residents, so I may not necessarily be representative of You know I'm going to interrupt for just a second here.
Abuse disorder and I would also say that folks who are in recovery need stability, and so if people want to support services and help these folks, even if they're going to be moved out of this neighborhood, one thing we could consider is encouraging our council member to support this legislation that was recently introduced in the City Council called Int. This would increase the value of city issued housing vouchers so that shelter residents can go, find their own housing and get up on their feet and go live on their own.
If the community board is going to be opposing this new permanent shelter, because we are already doing our fair share.
I think it's important to know that the Department of Homeland services does not consult with community boards before making decisions like that, and that I think.
Can, you hear me: sure, can welcome community board tonight This is my first meeting.
You know, homeless, members of our community to other.
Are people we're talking about not you know some kind of refuse that we want to get rid of.
You know in community board, seven You know or whether people get moved.
You know to help those people who do have needs.
Who will have the best idea about what is needed in each place, I'm, looking at Helen and Linda, and one and Brad wondering if I did it right or is there more to say, And I think some of the groups, if they want, can put their contact information in the chat and by the way, there's a fly in my office.
