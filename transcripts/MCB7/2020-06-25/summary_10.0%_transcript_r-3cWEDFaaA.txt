Our participants and speakers include members of the request: Prep Academy community, the New York City Alliance against sexual assaults, safe horizon The administration for Children Services, the Children's Aid Society, the community service Society of New York, along with champ, which is the community health access to Addiction and Mental Health Care, Project and councilmember.
Yet Was prepped, like the new Regis classes, that we offer now that we did not offer when I started working there Leave our middle school with Regents credit, whether it's in living, environment, algebra and or Spanish, and this year, thanks to Kovac all students, pass and receive credit.
What were the resources that they were like in for in order for this child to come to me and still, knowing that child lives in a home with a lot of different people?
There has an open ACS case and when you speak to the ACS work, if we're giving her information that she does not know, thinking about people falling through the cracks and people want to be quick to blame schools and say well.
We have a very caring and loving staff and if we can't provide them with enough after- school programming and enough parent outreach and phone calls and different supports, and they have an open, ACS case and they're still not able to maintain, then again, whose problem is that It gives off a negative reputation about other schools and also to charter schools, which also create more challenges for school like mine, when students are turned away or forced to leave charter schools, they come into our school.
You know if you have read stories about certain charter networks in the news lately and if they're having challenges or a bit, the way of life at that institution does not work for all children and the idea of creating more of those institutions just kind of contradicts the whole purpose of critical thinking and lifelong education, in my opinion, 'm, going to introduce them next that to speak about more programs for youth, especially summer youth programs options, so that students and children can understand that their education is going to lead to something productive for them in the future.
So much of what people were saying in papers: So then, now I graduated in June, from Hunter school social work with a master's in community organizing and when this opportunity presented itself to be the parent, coordinator, Westford, Academy Twice, because I understood that West Prep as a school community, one has been doing an amazing job with the students and their families, but I also understood from the Social Work perspective that they are where a lot of challenges that would be on the school's capacity.
As a parent and thinking about the challenges that our families are facing, you know one we have to Cove it, but then we have to also acknowledge that they are some family members and some students that are commenting with a lot of trauma, whether it's from the home, whether it's from their personal lives, whether it's from the community.
Someone does not know exactly what these students are dealing, with, just thinking about those challenges and thinking about what services or what support we as a school need, especially with me working with parents, hearing stories of mom moms that are working full time.
You, know all the other agencies that are providing resources for the families coming together to the table with the school and us having a conversation, of.
You, know, I, think that really would for us at the school level and our families, because I think when we talk about the children and the youth and yes definitely they need to be supported.
So, I, think I'm again, just going back to working together, Co, creating together with other agencies, what supports they do not look like for our families to support them, and the other piece is really what, because she said about the voices of the young, people.
Predictions that are seeing these children, whether it's a child advocacy center through which they're coming or whether it's for counseling and as We take a holistic approach, providing parenting support and family counseling.
There is definitely a higher correlation to sexual violence right now, they're, seeing a lot more cases than they usually do as well, because people are you, know, children living with the perpetrators and even though they're not going to school and ACS is not as involved for that reason.
What we are concerned about is that we are part of the sexual assault initiative, along with four other reprises programs in the city and that funds those funds help us conduct these forensic exams trainings, as well as other trainings, where we're trying to provide trauma- informed teaching to folks that come through the CAC that come to the IDI that come So. It is very critical for us to make sure that these children are not re- traumatized when they are coming in to these places, and we are concerned that, if these budgets.
Then we start talking about healthy relationships and the impact of harmful social norms, and It kind of you know, moves along it graduates, the conversation graduates until we come to a point where we they get an opportunity to do some peer engagement through well.
You know they bring in these people so that they could start having conversations about healthier relationships about teen, dating violence, prevention, And so they get to create these pieces of outreach of these pieces of community mobilization.
They get to stand up and speak about their truth, and the program has really changed my work because it reminds me that this certain time you know so many programs out there And if we're having a program for youth and we're not talking about sex, there's an issue, we're not talking about healthy relationships.
This program served 70, young women, acrosss, 25, council districts, and we also like I, said, have groups of young men and, amidst the Covid-19 we, you know, definitely had some fallout, because you know lots of these families were ill and had to move, and some of them.
We have one of a group of 14 young women graduating from the program this next week, You know we're all here concerned about the rise in sexual assault and violence amongst young women and the violence amongst our youth and all together, If we're asking what how you can support us, perhaps without reach to youth in your community, when we are offering these workshops to help us get the word out, but definitely to support us as an organization with City Council funding.
I. Think we're one of the you know: few agencies that are really doing this sexual assault, prevention, work with teens and young adults in this way, and so thank you.
And, also what's needed and Gina, it's so exciting to hear about the work that you're doing with youth and not only kind of giving them the tools to be leaders, but also to help other people be leaders in the community.
Carolyn will speak to this a little bit more, but I wanted to speak about the wide range of services that they prize and offers with youth and trauma on the runaway and homeless, their street work.
C word project supports runaway and homeless by providing concrete, services, medical, care, legal, sexual health, basically so Neil showers, wellness and mental health care to drop- in centers, contact, number, so just I think one of the things that want to highlight, As you heard, me, serve runaway and homeless, youth, which are, and particularly this time, the more most vulnerable, especially in covered, where our services have had to be limited, you're talking young people who basically sometimes sleep on the streets at night.
Is that one of the things that we really need in terms of sustaining young people is, you know our drop- in services could utilize some more support in terms of increase hours, because homelessness do not stop when we close at six o'clock.
We know this is times of cuts coming in, but to think about the homeless population on York city streets of your people.
It's really important that when they develop a relationship with a caretaker Ana mentor in that program, we're able to connect them to these different resources and again some of them are young people who have went through ACS not being able to make it through the system.
Young people do not house in Do. They need support while they get into the house and yes, and we should have more supportive case management or it's like programs.
We started off as a pilot program working with some NYPD precincts around the city, specifically partner with the domestic violence units and those precincts, so that we could engage with families right after a domestic incident before it is filed, so that we as clinicians could come in and engage with families where children have been a witness to domestic violence and provide trauma, focused therapy for the family, specifically around symptoms and reactions that might be coming up for kids.
We have programs right now in Manhattan and Queens and the Bronx, but we do work with families all over the city, and you know If I'm mispronouncing any names you have Sandra Graham community engagement, specialist Rachel Jensen, the director of intergovernmental affairs, Raymond singleton, the Assistant Commissioner of ACF, Division of Family pregnancy services and Elisabeth local mere associate, commissioner of the 80s division of prevention, services.
If, not partner programs are on the call tonight, safe, Verizon and Children's Aid Society, you know, ACS is concern, like All of the other organizations on the call is to ensure the safety and health and wellness and well- being of children and youth and, as everyone else has said, that there is no more critical time than what we're facing right now to ensure that happens, and especially because the families we serve like those touched by the other organizations on the call, are disproportionately families of color and so between the Covid-19 pandemic and the racial equity and anti- Action in the city.
Prevention services are really designed with the goal of ensuring that, whenever possible, wanted to say for a child that we keep that family together and whole and give them the supportive services that they need, and typically through our contracted network of providers.
Also, You know want to note that we are in prevention services at ace on the verge of recompete, or rather we have recomputed our system for the first time in ten years, which has meant really looking at how to take what has been a continuous process of improvement and growth that has affected a really sharp decrease over the last years in foster care and really kept more families together and supported, and really look acrosss the system and strengthen those services.
So on July 1st that new continuum goes live and I think probably not a moment too soon, because the major things that we are focused on with the new services acrosss, the city are to increase the number of slots that are therapeutic and treatment slots that provide therapeutic and clinical services to our families.
Some of the comments, and particularly MS Reyes spoke about, is really bringing in the voice of clients, so families, youth and children, and while our service providers do that on a regular basis, ACS is making a really concerted effort to partner with agencies to make sure that is happening both in service provision with families, but also at the organizational level to really ensure that services reflect what families want and need and that we continue to push towards making a service continuum that is responsive to family need.
You know, continue to try to develop programming work with partnerships around the city, really digging deep with our partner agencies like small business services, ISM at the OE to ensure that youth are thinking about career, his career pathways, opportunities.
It, essentially pairs up every foster care agency with the opportunity to develop a coaching team if they have not already done that and connect youth in foster care to a coach, and so most folks on this call will probably know that one of the most important things our population youth can connect to is a caring, adult right and somebody who's got their best interests at heart and somebody's going to guide them.
You know this process of life and help them connect to those next steps that are going to get them their best opportunity to be self sufficient to be successful, to be a good worker to be a business owner, whatever that youth decides to do, and so this futures program that was funded for this year gave us an opportunity to deliver services through coaching tutoring and also through a holistic approach that focused on permanency and connecting you to a caring, adult.
Prior to the pandemic, we had a big push in the City Council for universal some youth employment, because I feel- That the young person's willing to step up and say they want to do the right thing over the summer and actually do some work and get some experience and help out the community and make some money.
We had a hundred and fifteen thousand kids who apply so that's 40 thousand young people who stepped up and wanted to do the right thing.
In, a more public role, where we have a continuing need for social, distancing ambassadors to be out there, giving out information on Coronavirus and giving out masks and in a non aggressive enforcement way, informing people about the need for that and for folks, young people a little bit older, certainly I would say over 18 or 18 and over there's a role in our what I like to call our Public Health core, which is the people who are doing contact tracing right, now, which is a workforce of several thousand, which includes people who go Door, Door, people who help connect people to social services.
Is next year in the school year, and what school is going to look like for young people and the non school opportunities for them through after, school, etc, and there's just so much uncertainty about that Now, uncertainty about the extent to which school can be conducted in person or through some sort of hybrid, where only a portion of kids are in the building at any moment, and others are doing distance learning multiple shifts at different times of the day or different days of the week etc.
I'm concerned that we're not talking enough about after- school programs and the kind of things that are so important to social- Emotional development of young people to career development.
The council member said earlier last year, the city and the state provided 75,000 job opportunities to young people.
A lot of people know CSS mostly for our research work that have been focused around I, use, health, housing and labor related issues, and also.
So, with that I'm just going to lead to Alison to talk about mental health issues and the services that we provide for everyone, but I'm sure she has some work on young people in and working with, them.
Now I, talked to my team today about this presentation, and so what we did was we pulled together a few examples of what champ has done, particularly with youth and with families, to help support people's quest for certain types of services.
So we see this a lot and understandably that when there is an instance, a circumstance, a situation that involves the need for substance, use, disorder or mental health, services, the family, member or the parent, or the guidance counselor or the teacher.
Who can who are all working together to try to find a way to resolve this particular youth or families problem, and also try to pave a way for people who come after that individual to be able to access services.
You have any comments thanks so much given the hour, I'll try to focus in on a couple of really important things and try not to repeat my heart is full right now with the positive energy that surrounds so many needs and the conflicts that all of you who provide services to our youth can bring to it.
I want to just sort of touch briefly on the ideas that we've already been working on at CB7 we've been advocating for years for SYEP, including in our budget last year, and we've already actually written to the City Council to renew that support and others of our committees are focusing on different aspects of the programming.
Is that there's a special need for lbgtq children, and you may want to add that as a otherwise I think it's great The resolution, of course, is excellent and it outlined the comprehensive catalog services and agencies that are working to make this better.
Do you want to share what you've been working on A couple weeks , ago, I have started to see some news articles talking about how people who had coded 19 early on so early March things like that before what testing was widespread.
