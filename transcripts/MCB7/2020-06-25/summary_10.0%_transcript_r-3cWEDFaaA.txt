Shelley who's, the founder and co-director applied for a capacity fund grant from the City Parks Foundation in New York City, Parks Partnership, her car, which will support fees for developing a website, and he won not grant so that's great and that playground is connected to with Prep Academy and they're Most likely is the chair of community board 7 Here, because it was her idea to have this meeting with this topic, So I want to thank her and all the members of the community board and others Children and youths are valuable members of our community who deserve our unconditional protection, support and advocacy.
All the speakers have time to present and we're also going to make sure that community members also have fun at times Our participants and speakers include members of the request: prep academy community, the New York City Alliance against sexual assaults, safe horizon the administration for Children Services, the Children's Aid Society, the community service Society of New York, along with champ, which is the community health access to Addiction and Mental Health Care, Project and councilmember Is the parent coordinator and parent and Kashif Is the everyone here in cb7 and the Upper West Side of Manhattan and so I love, Manhattan, and so anything that I can do to be involved with supporting our scholars in our community.
We have a very caring and loving staff and if we can't provide them with enough after-school programming and enough parent outreach and phone calls and different supports, and they have an open ACS case Where you have a screening process where you're warehousing certain groups of students, it gives off a negative reputation about other schools and also to charter schools, which also create more challenges for school like mine, when students are turned away or forced to leave charter schools, they come into our school You know with the negative sense of Education as a whole, and we had to build that child What I'm asking you to do when I'm allowed mr Kashif to speak in a second and my parent coordinator, is to really think about using your resources and early childhood literacy Education like before they get to second grade making sure that children can read and write and can do simple, math, because I'm finding as a middle school principal and I get kids from 60th Street All. The way up to the Bronx that are the children still cannot read and write when they come to the state's great and so again as whose problem is that, and what do we do about that at this level?
You know if you have read stories about certain charter networks in the news lately and if they're having challenges or a bit, the way of life at that institution doesn't work for all children and the idea of creating more of those institutions just kind of contradicts the whole purpose of critical thinking and lifelong education.
So, as a parent I had a lot of trust in West prep even ten years ago, when everybody was saying how bad it was, There was something about the school staff that really allowed me to trust Not. So much of what people were saying in papers So then now I graduated in June, from Hunter school social work with a master's in community organizing and when this opportunity presented itself to be the parent coordinator, Westford Academy I didn't think about it twice, because I understood that West prep as a school community, one has been doing an amazing job with the students and their families, but I also understood from the Social Work perspective that they are where a lot of challenges that would be on the school's capacity The school cannot do because of funding because of lack of services.
We have some of the parents that are, you know they may need to be working at a hospital 3 to 4 days a week, 12 hour shifts and there's no one to really take care of their child We have many more but thinking about us and what we have been doing and how we need support is really co-creating with the agencies and our communities, such as ACS You, know all the other agencies that are providing resources for the families coming together to the table with the school and us having a conversation of Where.
and I think that getting more connected with the agencies in the community coming together having these conversations, seeing where the gaps aren't and then connecting them, You know, I, think that really would for us at the school level and our families, because I think when we talk about the children and the youth They are part of a family We can be doing a great job at West prep.
Don't look like for our families to support them, and the other piece is really what because she said about the voices of the young people and I think again, adding their voices to the planning asking for their voices in decision-making, because these decisions will impact them eventually and having them be part of the community, contribute to the community and also hearing directly from them.
At this point, I'm a physician by training So, it's child, psych , they're, private organizations, private foundations that will provide funds to children's programming there very few That will prefer that government funds- What we are trying to do is lift the voices off the minors and provide trauma-informed care from all levels, whether it's got from physicians, child abuse, predictions that are seeing these children, whether it's a child advocacy center through which they're coming or whether it's for counseling and as and we take a holistic approach, providing parenting support and family We are trying what we're seeing recently is, particularly with the covert pandemic, and the summer came The. Other thing that our child abuse, p traditions in the city have told us is that the children that were coming in for physical abuse cases.
There is definitely a higher correlation to sexual violence right now, they're, seeing a lot more cases than they usually do as well, because people are you, know, children living with the perpetrators and even though they're not going to school and ACS is not as involved for that reason.
We are worried that we will not be able to provide the counseling that we want to provide the crisis counseling, that we provide children as well as the trauma-informed trainings that we provide We would love for you to support any sexual assault initiative that you can to help us bring these services to the community We. Also, a set part of the City Council budget is also the young woman's initiative.
We, also support young men, and so we do We teach them leadership skills, for example, public speaking, how to outreach to your community and how to organize, and they learn to practice consent to talk about consent with their peers with adults in their lives We. They go through a special training where they learn how to how to implement safe bystander, engagement, behaviors and so project.
I think we're one of the you know few agencies that are really doing this sexual assault prevention, work with teens and young adults in this way, and so thank you and also what's needed and Gina, it's so exciting to hear about the work that you're doing with youth and not only kind of giving them the tools to be leaders, but also to help other people be.
C word project supports runaway and homeless by providing concrete services, medical care, legal, sexual health, basically so Neil showers, wellness and mental health care to drop-in, centers contact, number yeah, okay, so just I think one of the things that want to highlight, as you heard me, serve runaway and homeless, youth, which are, and particularly this time, the more most vulnerable, especially in covered where our services have had to be limited.
Many are for young people are having co-occurring disorders, which is mental health and substance, use Is that one of the things that we really need in terms of sustaining young people is, you know our drop-in services could utilize some more support in terms of increase hours, because homelessness don't stop when we close at six o'clock.
So I want to talk a little bit about our child trauma response team We started off as a pilot program working with some NYPD precincts around the city, specifically partner with the domestic violence units and those precincts, so that we could engage with families right after a domestic incident before it is filed so that we as clinicians could come in and engage with families where children have been a witness to domestic violence and provide trauma.
If, not partner programs are on the call tonight safe, Verizon and Children's Aid Society, you know, ACS is concern, like all of the other organizations on the call is to ensure the safety and health and wellness and well-being of children and youth and, as everyone else has said, that there is no more critical time than what we're facing right now to ensure that happens, and especially because the families we serve like those touched by the other organizations on the call are disproportionately families of color and so between the kovat pandemic and the racial equity and anti-racist action in the city.
The other thing that has been thematic across some of the comments and particularly MS Reyes spoke about, is really bringing in the voice of clients, so families, youth and children, and while our service providers do that on a regular basis, ACS is making a really concerted effort to partner with agencies to make sure that is happening both in service provision with families, but also at the organizational level to really ensure that services reflect what families want and need and that we continue to push towards making a service continuum that is responsive to family need, I, Think, finally, I'll say and the other place that we are really partnering with providers is to ensure that there are bodies within each organization and I think you know direct service organizations just like city government organizations, are in different places here that seek to disrupt racial bias.
In our systems, in our service to clients, So on behalf of our Commissioner David Hansell, our first Deputy Commissioner Eric Brettschneider, Julie, Farber who's, our deputy commissioner at fps and yuri pollock who's, my boss, I just want to thank you for having us and while they've Given me, the space I want to acknowledge the folks on the call, but then also especially Kashif I My soul I've been doing youth work for most of my life, but I've been really deep in to Workforce Development in three different states and when I hear youth like him talk, it really inspires me to You know continue to try to develop programming work with partnerships around the city, really digging deep with our partner agencies like small business services, ISM at the OE to ensure that youth are thinking about career, his career pathways opportunities, so the service delivery is reflective of who we're serving, and so I couldn't be more happy to be on this call with you all and thank you for listening to me.
With that programming, In addition to our futures programming, we have programs that focus on career readiness, programs for you and those career readiness programs are developed in partnership with Columbia University's of Columbia University puts together a why a work program which stands for young adult work, opportunities for rewarding careers, and it focuses on a vocational development that really, you know, takes a look at a career pathway approach to saying to youth You know career pathway, that you may decide that you want to do in New, York, City's, labor market and here's where you're at developmentally and the gap between where you are at and where you need to be We need to develop a plan, a career path that has an educational plan and a career plan that includes these successive steps that get you along the way to where you want to be, and so we start to teach that to you that middle school, high school and on their way out to college.
So to of that, and our partnership with New Yorkers for children also to help you get certified as parent peer educators This is just some of the things that ACS really works hard to provide to connect with philanthropy to partner up with academic institutions, community-based organizations to provide the career, readiness to education and the Employment Opportunity housing opportunities for you When the pandemic hit, we immediately sought out relationships with employers who were essential service employers, Now, it's Caritas, FedEx manpower who represented FedEx and an JPMorgan, Chase, Bank and also UPS, and we also partnered up with small business services and their Career Center in the Bronx, and we had over 300 folks, online coaches in our system used, and we connected about 35 youth to jobs.
Prior to the pandemic, we had a big push in the City Council for universal some youth employment, because I feel- that the young person's willing to step up and say they want to do the right thing over the summer and actually do some work and get some experience and help out the community and make some money and we had made progress in expanding the program, but not enough.
Last summer, We had a hundred and fifteen thousand kids who apply so that's 40 thousand young people who stepped up and wanted to do the right thing, and we were told and you know relative to the size of the city budget.
For someone who understands the community who has connections to the community who speaks the languages of the local, neighborhood, etc This is playing out now in the budget fight not in City Hall, which is in its final hours, is next year in the school year, and what school is going to look like for young people and the non school opportunities for them through after-school, etc, and there's just so much uncertainty about that.
I'm concerned that we're not talking enough about after-school programs and the kind of things that are so important to social-emotional development of young people to career development because you have generally , you don't have the whole school population there after school and you can be more mobile as well, and the groups tend to be smaller, so I feel like after school from a virus safety perspective.
Like the council member said earlier last year, the city and the state provided 75,000 job opportunities to young people.
The champ program helps anybody in New York State, regardless of the type of insurance they have and regardless of their age and regardless, if they're insured at all, with any sort of mental health or substance, use disorder, insurance issues, Now I, talked to my team today about this presentation, and so what we did was we pulled together a few examples of what champ has done, particularly with youth and with families, to help support people's quest for certain types of services.
So many other components of the logistics of trying to make sure that this individual, youth or child is safe, that it's, they don't necessarily have the time or the capacity at that moment, to do the research or to speak to the insurer about who actually is in network and who has openings It's really difficult and sometimes to be honest, those online directories are not accurate, and so, when time is of the essence, one of the things that chant can do is actually get on the phone and really try to find a provider for that individual or family They come to us with a myriad of ways that they could use support and at champ and at the community service.
