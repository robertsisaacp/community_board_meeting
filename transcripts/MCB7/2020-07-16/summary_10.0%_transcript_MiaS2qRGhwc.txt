But also that, hopefully we can pass something as a committee and maybe bring something back to the individual spaces we inhabit as students as parents, as teachers or as just members of the community I'm, currently, fortunately baju eight from Y RJ, but most high school graduate We are my RJ and we are youth for the presidency based in Brooklyn and then now facilitate to other people like we're doing If. We were in a virtual space and we able to circle up.
Aronson I run the local Business Improvement District north of 96th Street, which is the neighborhood of Manhattan Valley in Bloomingdale It's, where justice team, my pronouns, that she heard hers, I, guess I Also struggle with the word thing : I guess I just want to give you guys some background on what restorative justice and its practice are sort of justice is in essence, a way of being that gives people a space to be vulnerable and to flip that holistically, it gives people a chance to build relationships and repair relationships and hold the respectable on kind of bonds It, also at its best post people accountable for what their are in the space.
three basic tiers that restorative justice can be broken up, are done and often this work gets painted, where the Western filter We, like to honor that this work has deep roots and indigenous people in their traditions, and it doesn't come from us and we love to our lens of Technology every time we do this work, but it doesn't come from us, but just we're sort of does This has a great impact that anybody who's a part of it is not just for school, your family and it can be showing up in a lot of ways.
Wonderful in school were basis where people didn't really know me and didn't know that they kind of had a person like kind of had to be persistent to open me up, but also thinking back spaces, where teachers and administrators kind of put the pressure of me being a role model like hey I , couldn't say things because teachers were looking at me to be like, be a role model to their student to the room.
So there's a quick 25 minute circle, but I think having places like this is so important, especially in schools and while kids are going through growing pains and stuff at home and social unrest, It's so important to have these spaces present in schools, especially because students need to be heard and students need to be able to go into their school, not just to learn but to be able to be vulnerable and to be open and to be able to tell their stories and what they're going through, because students are not just students , they're human beings, You know, I, think a lot of educators and people who end up growing up and being policymakers forget what it feels like to be.
To, be exact, looks a variety of different ways: It's not really a program or something that's placed in a school In terms of interacting with one of the building community, having strong systems for addressing and repairing harm and welcoming folks back when reentry or reintegration is necessary, There are some schools, though, that are brand new to this and may just be hearing about it and are entering it as a way to kind of heal their school culture, but I think the most important thing is recognizing the work starts within, and so it's not necessarily a script or protocol to be followed, but really shifting the way we see and interact with each other day to day great I think you were the first one up.
Do they have assigned facilitator that close from school to school and set them up or do they on their own They are each assigned a point person a coordinator who reaches out to their school and supports them through a process of implementation and introduction to the work and then, as Tyler said, there's lots of folks that have been doing this authentically for years, and so often they have kind of found their own resources through a lots of great partner organizations and different opportunities that the department ed has offered through osek just kind of open to anybody.
So, that's how it was, and then we went into this space and you were greeted with pizza and smiles Like any said people implement our G when it's too late so like, for example, if there's a fight that happens within school you're trying to know sick kids that are already angry and full of rage in a circle with somebody that they'd even build community with in the first place , so I didn't know what boundaries to cross with you and now you're telling me to now address those problems when I didn't know them in the first place.
It's what happens in things other than school He carries on places like homes like if you don't set up a boundary and like have that base community It doesn't really work Stoli when it comes to like disciplining students in school with suspensions All. These things, if you're, not understanding why a student is the way they are, you can't actively try to change them or discipline them without understanding what got them to that point and I'm positive, and you can explain that a bit more things like Eddie said we came into the space, not really knowing what we were there for not really understanding what it would leave.
Our neighbor sports community and repairs harm There is a conversation within RJ where some people call a transformative justice, because some people like to believe that you can't restore something that was never there Some people do like to call it transformative, justice , I'm fancier, second question in terms of maybe community and feeling having a vulnerable space and people being able to be holistic and bond and needed you got it starts.
I- think you did a beautiful job of explaining like what builds up so conflict and how we, you know end up in a space where we need to heal harm It's just a reminder that restorative justice is for everyone, no matter the demographic, no matter who you're working with the age position, role or title, and it's really about how we establish in humanity For example, Emily and I have worked at a school together where we really worked really hard to implement restorative justice, and we realized a lot of the work needed to start on the adult level.
Having conversations so introductory conversations to first build a strong community and once that community is built and harm does take place similar to Addie said we have this this net to kind of fall back on, where we already trust each other to be vulnerable enough to come to the table, to figure out So, not just young people being accountable to adults, because we do n't We want to make sure we're not using restorative justice as a euphemism, for on punitive model discipline How also can adults be accountable to their young people to each other, to the families that we serve?
I think the worst thing you can do is for someone to be a part of something they don't want to be a part of, and it's just to have understanding conversation of a kid that's why it's really important, like you said, for this work to start organically, so kids don't feel like they're forced into yet another circle.
You need to slowly build your kids are able to feel comfortable in space and be like okay , maybe I do want to open up Let me not to have to students how about this process to make sure that do you know anything like how are you making sure that the kid that people come to the table since it sounds like the venom rita's back here, is to have people in the room before any before issues?
Past again, it will still be in the back of their mind that a space like that exists and that they're welcome to anytime, because, regardless of if you're, reentering or you're coming in for the first time or I , think Addie and Andy are really touching on some important points and I think that one of the ways that we try to get every voice at the table is by letting as many people as possible experience what this is and what it feels like.
So when you shift a school's culture in such a way that everyone knows that there is opportunity to be heard that there's opportunity to be seen that there's opportunity to be vulnerable when you provide constant spaces for people to participate in We, really advocate that this doesn't just happen during advisory or once a day in the morning or during lunch, but that when you start a science lesson you check in with people and see how they're doing and do a quick opportunity for people to just kind of like how am I showing up today, there's all different opportunities throughout the school day and outside of the school hours to really humanize one another By doing that, we give young people and adults in the building the opportunity to realize that they have voice and that they have a voice.
I know that the operating budget in terms of kind of purchasing power in per session, so OT PS in per session, was about three and a half million, but that does not include a staffing budget, and so we could get that it's public information very important, very important, no I am first of all So many thoughts and emotions in my own life experience to date, and so basically, I have some comments My observation here is just that the communication model and sharing is so fundamental to the human healing experience and in my life, having been through therapy group therapy and different support groups and being involved in different trainings with all different aspects of sharing I've found that when it's done right, it's some of the most healing experiences that I've ever had in my life and I know that that's true for so many people and I Just, remembering going through a doing a group experience to where we broke off into small groups.
Meeting with our young people The way they did was that they wanted to kind of have adults experience having to write off the back without having built any relationships have to talk about being vulnerable, because when this work isn't done well, this is what we ask students to do all the time without creating that safe community first and so as Andy kind of shared.
We have one high school up in our immediate neighborhood of let's say: 96 to 110th We, have lots of people coming from lots of different parts of the world and we'd love to see that up here we also have gangs, and recently, within the past two weeks, three weeks, we've had four killings, which we haven't had for years and I Don't know that people are gonna, be open to discussing I mean talking in situations where there may be gang members You know dealing with this on a community level dealing with this in a school we're in a Middle School, where gangs that may be recruiting people and beating each other up So to your point, I'm just a circle back that building a restorative culture takes time, and so we would certainly recommend that those trust that trust that relationship has already been built before we use restorative justice as a means to begin having a difficult conversation Assuming.
So speaking from personal experience, I was a Dean of discipline at a small school in Crown, Anyone knows around about that area near Kings, County, very creepy, right on the border of Latin, Kings, Bloods and Cripps and I was able to do pretty amazing work with all of those youth members and again it's about front-loading, seeing them as people First, right and people with needs and thinking through.
What we see in our schools is often we can think of schools as minors and windows, but they're often minors of societal ills, and so the black You know the black and brown students we serve are not broken Usually, what we see are symptoms of larger issues, I'm an American Society, and so my first own recommendation is to see these people as people with needs and maybe who have been underserved in some way, are and then building those meaningful relationships and so identifying key people in the both in the neighborhood and within the school community.
But Tyler That was a good start and I'll reach out to some people in the neighborhood and see where we can go with that A great place to start is: There's the Harlem youth court We find that there isn't capacity within the school building so, for example, if you're not able to identify folks who are either trained to do this work or have the right relationships to do this work, that's definitely a resource that you could reach out to help solve some of the community issues Maybe.
So, the normal data points that we might be looking for might be difficult to speak to, but, for example, to school that Emily and I worked really hard at two begin: establishing a restorative culture in one year, It was like a learning environment survey and in one year we saw a 42% increase in terms of feelings of safety This is a question that goes out to all community members about how deep, how safe do you feel within the school community and in just one year of implementing circles that increase by 42%?
I think it's the question that, like everyone, wants to know the answer to all the time from us, because a lot of people want a lot of schools and kind of policymakers.
We need to restore the community, and so that's where we'll start the work and then there's a lot of unlearning That needs to happen to kind of address what we talked about today, which is that that's not really going to be particularly effective if you haven't built community first and you haven't built these systems and structures that allow people to lean into the experience with Even when strong community does not exist.
In terms of approving then and not approving stuff funding is certainly a big aspect of it, but I think meetings like this are very important and it's one of the reasons why I really love yl committee, because it's not necessarily an incredibly tangible thing, but we're all gonna walk away from this meeting with an important understanding, restorative justice and we're all involved with school committees in some way, and so whether we're taking this back to our own communities or whether months from now we're having a and this comes up in our minds.
Are our youth under the age of 18 and they're not heavily represent on the community board, and they often don't attend meetings and so I think it's really important that we involve them, especially when we're you know trying to help them whether it's from the youth programs that we were discussing last month or in school We've got just probably about 15 minutes with the sort of committee meeting So it's not as exciting as this, but we will go on feel free to drop off, but we have some a little bit of business to close out with, but thanks again full experience thanks for having us we'll jump off, but thanks so much for your time.
I. Do worry about what this looks like in January, as opposed to September and for a school to sort of organize outdoor classes in a very changeable climate becomes really quite difficult, so I think there's a lot of work that would need to be done to figure out how to make this sort of feasible in New York, but it obviously is very compelling, as a way of beginning to find space for students to spread out.
This is the question of just what it is and how it works, and then there's also the question of timing for the community board to get involved, because, even if we're to pass a at a new business resolution right now, we wouldn't be able to vote on it as a full board until September Do. We pass a resolution that we would do as a full board in September just to get things rolling thinking more long-term about what this might be and word cannon?
Gonna have a lot of people coming in unless they're gonna stagger, I mean I would be reticent to do a resolution out of yl because of that I'm a as mark knows kind of a stickler for process and rich as well I like to get a lot of community feedback and I , don't know how to resolve that today, I wouldn't be comfortable doing a resolution today on it That would just be my quick thing if everyone in the on the committee over-over vote voted me and wanted to do this , I would I would be certainly open to it and we know there's a lot of people.
We got to give a little notice to people that would come, I'd be supportive that steering and be participating, and if somehow it came through I yelled, but I just feel like for the reasons I said from a notice perspective from I mean half the committee isn't even here at this point on the call So I am comfortable putting out a letter the letter, if the letters from Y yell there, the community board I'm fine with that as well, but I think that's how I would feel about it.
