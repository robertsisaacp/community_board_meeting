The students just to give you an introduction, we're very grateful to have two student members of Y RJ and Ian Addie, and we have their adult partners Emily and Michelle who work as directors of restorative practices, for the affinity, schools in the New, York, City, Department, occation office of Safety and youth development.
Hopefully we can pass something as a committee and maybe bring something back to the individual spaces we inhabit as students as parents, as teachers or as just members of the community.
Fortunately baju eight from Y RJ, but most high school graduate, We are my RJ and we are youth for the presidency, based in Brooklyn, We kind of take what we've learned from our adult facilitators and then now facilitate to other people like we're doing Right.
Now we take the work that has been here for centuries, such as sort of like restorative practices, and we implement it into our schools in our everyday lives in our communities, because it helps it flourish better and it brings a sense of comfort ability and vulnerability being able to share your fullest self and still combat issues like you face like inequitable stances and disproportionality.
Rep Also, a member of this, of CB7 and of this committee I'm, also having trouble coming up with a word that starts with R I know my mind is racing and running, but that's about my mind, because a lot of things went on today in at work and I.
So a restorative justice has three basic tiers that it can be open down to So tier one is the most important and what you people need to spend the most time on which is community building now.
So if disrespect happens or for slur is said in the classroom or in a room or in any other community that you're in that space, you can go in and now that you have mutual respect and vulnerability built into your community, it can actually address it because we're sort of justice Holds these people accountable.
Sort of this is one thing on there's a big umbrella for sort of practices, and it just gives you a space where you're able to be vulnerable, where you feel needed, where you look that as a person not just for what you bring, but for everything, you're, bringing everything you are, and it's just a really good place to be They were sort of dozens which are community norms.
So, as Andy said why we are here creating a space that is safe for people, so norms allow people to come into the space and not be them their real selves and complete selves, and this is not know like Kumbaya I, expect we're really trying to get down to the nitty- gritty, and even though we get down to the degree, and sometimes we try to touch the surface, we often step on each other's toes sometimes, and we want to create something that will allow people to put these things in place, which is like hey.
It can just be realize that people are allowed to be themselves and does not have to put like another face of when they're trying to be honest about the situation and respect respecting everybody's beliefs, ideologies, feelings, attitudes or something, and just having respect for wrong general, so So, if you're more comfortably, can definitely turn off your camera, but just close your eyes and take a deep breath.
So thinking about again, security needs so reflect on a time that you were not able to reach, but you really needed to be and what got in the way Now. My house I'm from conservative, like Nigerian hot, also speaking of things, olive worldly, coming from things like different political ideologies or anything.
Wonderful in school were basis where people did not really know me and did not know that they kind of had a person like kind of had to be persistent to open me up, but also thinking back spaces, where teachers and administrators kind of put the pressure of me being a role model like hey, Like you're, your president, you can be like actually honest Or, so I felt I so censored in a way that I knew I could not say things because teachers were looking at me to be like be a role model to their student to the room.
So there's a quick 25 minute circle, but I think having places like this is so important, especially in schools and while kids are going through growing pains and stuff at home and social unrest.
Think a lot of educators and people who end up growing up and being policymakers forget what it feels like to be a student.
So that's just something really important Why we think work Is just needs the every school in every community.
I'd be very curious, so me, and a do actually local part of the you for sort of justice team where students from I started off as 15 schools, So there's two kids from each school I mean used to we used to meet in person every to every two weeks on a Friday, So ease the meet and just really build our knowledge on what circles are wherever sort of this has come from ways we implement sort of justice into our school and then from what we learned in our larger school meetings.
Each student member would then take it back and build their own restorative justice, school- based team, so then kind of what we learned from our larger meetings.
There are schools where every single day, every single student and staff member participates in a circle like you just did in with the with the purpose of building community and building relationships.
I think the goal is to expand it to the entire city at some point, but there are lots of schools that were doing this work long before this expansion effort started and that was really driven by the school community.
To be exact, looks a variety of different ways: It's not really a program or something that's placed in a school, so we might have some schools that have been practicing this for 50 years, because the way that they interact and the way they engage and recognize one What we see in schools, is really borrowing and adapting from indigenous practices that have been going on for thousands of years right around the globe, and so some schools are just already founded and positioned in that way in terms of interacting with one of the building community, having strong systems for addressing and repairing harm, and welcoming folks back when reentry or reintegration is necessary.
There are some schools, though, that are brand new to this and may just be hearing about it and are entering it as a way to kind of heal their school culture, but I think the most important thing is recognizing the work starts within, and so it's not necessarily a script or protocol to be followed, but really shifting the way we see and interact with each other day to day great I think you were the first one up, so you have a question.
This is just like a like a little thing that help people They explain what was the situation, what made them feel uncomfortable Sorry, if you hear that if they can really delve in on what really happened, because the other day there is situation like this is like a community circle, I mean IAM and go into the other tier east.
We're trying to implement this work in school, but we're going to send you somewhere to train you first, so you can come back and bring it to us.
If there's a fight that happens within school you're trying to know sick kids that are already angry and full of rage in a circle with somebody that they'd even build community with in the first place.
We're, just kind of just building the relationship more and then gradually and slowly as months past, we saw those circles come from just getting to know each other's names and where we're from talking about family deaths and stuff, that's something that happens so naturally, as that community, like kind of gradually builds and-.
Transformative, justice,, I'm fancier, second question in terms of maybe community and feeling having a vulnerable space and people being able to be holistic and bond and needed.
I, think you did a beautiful job of explaining like what builds up so conflict and how we, you know, end up in a space where we need to heal harm.
So, for example, Emily and I have worked at a school together where we really worked really hard to implement restorative justice, and we realized a lot of the work needed to start on.
The worst thing you can do is for someone to be a part of something they do not want to be a part of, and it's just to have understanding conversation of a kid You know, like I, think that's why it's really important, like you said, for this work to start organically, so kids do not feel like they're forced into yet another circle.
Those important steps you need to slowly build your kids are able to feel comfortable in space and be like okay.
And I think that one of the ways that we try to get every voice at the table is by letting as many people as possible experience what this is and what it feels like.
So when you shift a school's culture in such a way that everyone knows that there is opportunity to be heard that there's opportunity to be seen that there's opportunity to be vulnerable when you provide constant spaces for people to participate.
Meeting with our young people The way, they did was that they wanted to kind of have adults experience having to write off the back without having built any relationships have to talk about being vulnerable, because when this work is not done well, this is what we ask students to do all the time without creating that safe community first and so as Andy kind of shared at the end, like you have to create that safe container before you start asking people to be super vulnerable.
It's not like it's just left out in the open when somebody just entrusted me with something that was that heat Thank you so much I did your explanation of how much groundwork and structure is involved is reassuring because when I first started listening, I kind of said, it seemed a little bit more ad hoc It's really reassuring to hear how much training people go.
You know dealing with this on a community level dealing with this in a school we're in a Middle School, where gangs that may be recruiting people and beating each other up So, to your point, I'm, just a circle back that building a restorative culture takes time, and so we would certainly recommend that those trust that trust that relationship has already been built before we use restorative justice as a means to begin having a difficult, conversation.
That work has been done and there's a you know and identified and trained individual who does have meaningful relationships both with those young people and around the community.
And I was able to do pretty amazing work with all of those youth members and again it's about front- loading, seeing them as people first right What we see in our schools is often we can think of schools as mirrors and windows, Right, so windows in terms of dreaming to the future of what we'd like to see our future to be, but they're, often mirrors of societal ills, and so the black.
You know the black and brown students we serve are not broken, but usually what we see are symptoms of larger issues, I'm, an American Society, and so my first own recommendation is to see these people as people with needs and maybe who have been underserved in some way, Are and then building those meaningful relationships and so identifying key people in the both in the neighborhood and within the school.
I was able to do pretty unremarkable work in terms of harm and healing in that space and also recognizing the capacity and not censoring myself in terms of what I think solutions or what I think resolution looks like, but really giving them voices to be a part of identifying what is the pathway towards repair and being able to listen critically to them in the recommendations that they're able to offer, and so again, so this work is done, I'm in layers, I, think, It is again about us, reflecting us unlearning, a lot of things that we believe about the communities that we serve believe about some of the young people that are struggling and once we're able to unlearn that and build meaningful relationships.
You, know we're normally used to seeing in schools, but if actually maybe live in the neighborhoods, and some of our young people have been in their shoes and can actually come in Thinking of our schools, like really how part of your sort of justice is.
So data is always a tough conversation, especially around restorative justice, because a lot of the work is so qualitative right, and so it's changing the way we feel about one another things of that nature.
But in ten years that young person might find us on LinkedIn and think about how the way the culture that we created in that school shifted their trajectory in terms of what they were able to do with their lives and how they saw.
There is conflict or between two people If there's either conflict that needs resolution in a school, let's say two kids that were not in a circle that are not on a day That, like everyone wants to know the answer to all the time from us, because a lot of people want a lot of schools and kind of policymakers.
You may get a call from Mark Killer to facilitate at a steering committee because it seemed like these practices may be best used for some sounds like we happen that big, Because, when you think of safe spaces, you think of the community, I, do not know I like a lot of a lot of the work that we do.
Think meetings like this are very important, and it's one of the reasons why I really love Yl committee, because it's not necessarily an incredibly tangible thing, but we're all going to walk away from this meeting with an important understanding, restorative justice and we're all involved with school committees in some way, and so whether we're taking this back to our own communities or whether months from now we're having a.
I. You, know, 20% of the people who live in our in our district are our youth under the age of 18 and So I think it's really important that we involve them, especially when we're you know trying to help them, whether it's from the youth programs that we were discussing last month or in school We've got just probably about 15 minutes with the sort of committee meeting.
Maybe this is the year with all of the other things going on with all the conversations that we may really wanna to take a you know, a strong look at what we put in we've got to start.
That became even more important after Covid-19, and that we want to a capture learning that Cogan taught us as it affects the work of each committee and whether that be the hard choices that had to be made when nine billion dollars worth of revenue disappeared from the from the budget and what choices we are going to have to make in order to close that gap or reassess that gap, and also when we talk about issues of equity and how it affects our community and ourselves.
O- T are talking about this, but I think you know we need to be pretty creative and flexible, and we have this amazing space around every single school.
But Europe Like in January, as opposed to September and for a school to sort of organize outdoor classes in a very changeable climate, becomes really quite difficult, so I think there's a lot of work.
This is the question of just what it is and how it works, and then there's also the question of timing for the community board to get involved, because, even if we're to pass a at a new business resolution right now, we would not be able to vote on it as a full board until September.
I mean I would be reticent to do a resolution out of yl because of that I'm, a as mark knows, kind of a stickler for process and rich As well , I like to get a lot of community feedback.
I think space is clearly the biggest issue facing our schools right now in terms of social distancing and creating a safe space for teachers and for students, as well as all the administrators and staff in these buildings.
But, it's really a hard thing for people for the schools to actually work.
We cook for kids coming and going through school, but I do not think in a lot of cases.
You probably picked up the threat, but we're talking about a new business item having to do with whether or not it would make sense And, if so, how to try to make streets and public way available to schools for their use in the coming year.
O- T should work together to make it an option when the school wants it to happen, but I do think that if we can pass a resolution, it just gives us that much more weight on the issue and it keeps it from passing by, as Kim mentioned, you know, conversations are happening.
We got to give a little notice to people that would come, I'd, be supportive that steering and be participating, and if somehow it came through, I yelled, Like for the reasons, I said from a notice perspective from I mean half, the committee is not even here at this point on the call, so I am comfortable putting out a letter, the letter, if the letters from Y yell there, the community board I'm fine with that as well, but I- think that's how I would feel about it.
