The students just to give you an introduction, we're very grateful to have two student members of Y RJ and Ian Addie, and we have their adult partners Emily and Michelle who work as directors of restorative practices, for the affinity, schools in the New, York, City, Department, occation, office of safety and youth development.
Hopefully we can pass something as a committee and maybe bring something back to the individual spaces we inhabit as students as parents, as teachers or as just members of the community.
Fortunately, baju eight from Y RJ, but most high school graduate, But. We are my RJ and we are youth for the presidency, based in Brooklyn, We kind of take what we've learned from our adult facilitators and then now facilitate to other people like we're doing Right.
Now we take the work that has been here for centuries, such as sort of like restorative practices, and we implement it into our schools in our everyday lives in our communities, because it helps it flourish better and it brings a sense of comfort ability and vulnerability being able to share your fullest self and still combat issues like you face like inequitable stances and disproportionality.
As a union, rep Also, a member of this of cb7 and of this committee I'm also having trouble coming up with a word that starts with R I know my mind is racing and running, but that's about my mind, because a lot of things went on today in at work and I.
So a restorative justice has three basic tiers that it can be open down to So tier one is the most important and what you people need to spend the most time on which is community building now.
Sort of this is one thing on there's a big umbrella for sort of practices, and it just gives you a space where you're able to be vulnerable, where you feel needed, where you look that as a person not just for what you bring, but for everything, you're, bringing everything you are, and it's just a really good place to be They were sort of dozens which are community norms.
So, as Andy said why we are here creating a space that is safe for people, so norms allow people to come into the space and not be them their real selves and complete selves, and this is not know like kumbaya We often step on each other's toes sometimes, and we want to create something that will allow people to put these things in place, which is like hey.
So thinking about again, security needs so reflect on a time that you were not able to reach, but you really needed to be and what got in the way Now. My house I'm from conservative like Nigerian hot, also speaking of things, olive worldly, coming from things like different political ideologies or anything.
Would be, wonderful in school were basis where people didn't really know me and didn't know that they kind of had a person like kind of had to be persistent to open me up, but also thinking back spaces, where teachers and administrators kind of put the pressure of me being a role model like hey , I, couldn't, say things because teachers were looking at me to be like be a role model to their student to the room, There's a quick 25 minute circle, but I think having places like this is so important, especially in schools and while kids are going through growing pains and stuff at home and social unrest.
Think a lot of educators and people who end up growing up and being policymakers forget what it feels like to be a student.
So that's just something really important Why we think work Is just needs the every school in every community.
If anybody figured out, my internet went down in the first five minutes, but I've secured it Our committee members and the non committee members for any QA I have actually has some questions and I'm gonna ask any of the committee members and non committee members, because I know they know to raise their hands How. Does this work in schools?
I'd be very curious, so me, and a do actually local part of the you for sort of justice team where students from I started off as 15 schools, So, there's two kids from each school So ease the meet and just really build our knowledge on what circles are wherever sort of this has come from ways we implement sort of justice into our school and then from what we learned in our larger school meetings.
There are schools where every single day, every single student and staff member participates in a circle like you just did in with the with the purpose of building community and building relationships.
I think the goal is to expand it to the entire city at some point, but there are lots of schools that were doing this work long before this expansion effort started and that was really driven by the school community.
What we see in schools, is really borrowing and adapting from indigenous practices that have been going on for thousands of years right around the globe, and so some schools are just already founded and positioned in that way in terms of interacting with one of the building community, having strong systems for addressing and repairing harm, and welcoming folks back when reentry or reintegration is necessary.
There are some schools, though, that are brand new to this and may just be hearing about it and are entering it as a way to kind of heal their school culture, but I think the most important thing is recognizing the work starts within, and so it's not necessarily a script or protocol to be followed, but really shifting the way we see and interact with each other day to day great I think you were the first one up, so you have a question.
This is just like a like a little thing that help people They explain what was the situation, what made them feel uncomfortable Sorry, if you hear that if they can really delve in on what really happened, because the other day there is situation like this is like a community circle, I mean IAM and go into the other tier east.
If I, don't know pack things as myself, which I really don't want to do to I'm older, but now that I'm in the space was just like I'm granted with opportunity to speak to people that are ready to listen and ready to take it in it's beside.
If there's a fight that happens within school you're trying to know sick kids that are already angry and full of rage in a circle with somebody that they'd even build community with in the first place, so I didn't know what boundaries to cross with you.
We're, just kind of just building the relationship more and then gradually and slowly as months past, we saw those circles come from just getting to know each other's names and where we're from talking about family deaths and stuff, that's something that happens so naturally, as that community, like kind of gradually builds and -.
Transformative, justice,, I'm, fancier, second question in terms of maybe community and feeling having a vulnerable space and people being able to be holistic and bond and needed.
I- think you did a beautiful job of explaining like what builds up so conflict and how we, you know, end up in a space where we need to heal harm.
So, for example, Emily and I have worked at a school together where we really worked really hard to implement restorative justice, and we realized a lot of the work needed to start on the adult.
I think the worst thing you can do is for someone to be a part of something they don't want to be a part of, and it's just to have understanding conversation of a kid You know, like I, think that's why it's really important, like you said, for this work to start organically, so kids don't feel like they're forced into yet another circle.
Those important steps you need to slowly build your kids are able to feel comfortable in space and be like okay.
And I think that one of the ways that we try to get every voice at the table is by letting as many people as possible experience what this is and what it feels like.
So when you shift a school's culture in such a way that everyone knows that there is opportunity to be heard that there's opportunity to be seen that there's opportunity to be vulnerable when you provide constant spaces for people to participate.
Meeting with our young people The way, they did was that they wanted to kind of have adults experience having to write off the back without having built any relationships have to talk about being vulnerable because when this work isn't done well.
This is what we ask students to do all the time without creating that safe community first and so as Andy kind of shared at the end, like you have to create that safe container before you start asking people to be super vulnerable.
You know dealing with this on a community level dealing with this in a school We're in a Middle School, where gangs that may be recruiting people and beating each other up So, to your point, I'm, just a circle back that building a restorative culture takes time, and so we would certainly recommend that those trust that trust that relationship has already been built before we use restorative justice as a means to begin having a difficult, conversation.
That work has been done and there's a you know and identified and trained individual who does have meaningful relationships both with those young people and around the community.
I was able to do pretty unremarkable work in terms of harm and healing in that space and also recognizing the capacity and not censoring myself in terms of what I think solutions or what I think resolution looks like, but really giving them voices to be a part of identifying what is the pathway towards repair and being able to listen critically to them in the recommendations that they're able to offer, and so again, so this work is done, I'm in layers, I, think, Some of the young people that are struggling and once we're able to unlearn that and build meaningful relationships.
We find that there isn't capacity within the school building, so, for example, if you're not able to identify folks who are either trained to do this work or have the right relationships to do this.
You, know we're normally used to seeing in schools, but if actually maybe live in the neighborhoods, and some of our young people have been in their shoes and can actually come in Thinking of our schools, like really how part of your sort of justice is.
So data is always a tough conversation, especially around restorative justice, because a lot of the work is so qualitative right, and so it's changing the way we feel about one another things of that nature.
That, like everyone wants to know the answer to all the time from us, because a lot of people want a lot of schools and kind of policymakers.
We need to restore the community, and so that's where we'll start the work and then there's a lot of unlearning.
It can only work when the people involve are willing to engage in the process in an authentic way, and so what we've often seen in schools is that, as you are growing tier one, which is that community building stage where you're teaching everyone, the practices, you're building those relationships, harm will happen.
We won't cause any harm for the next two years until we've built really strong systems and structures and community harm, Is gonna, happen simultaneously right, and so what we often see in schools is that there's kind of like a dual approach during those years, which is that for when there's moments of harm individuals that are prepared to kind of go through an authentic experience, where they're willing to take ownership, they're willing to acknowledge what has happened, what's gone, wrong, they're willing to take responsibility, they're invested in trying to repair it , We, will Willie support those schools in thinking about We 're still gonna understand why you may have done what you did.
You may get a call from mark killer to facilitate at a steering committee because it seemed like these practices may be best used for some sounds like we happen that big, Because, when you think of safe spaces, you think of the community, I, don't know I like a lot of a lot of the work that we do.
And it's one of the reasons why I really love yl committee, because it's not necessarily an incredibly tangible thing, but we're all gonna walk away from this meeting with an important understanding, restorative justice and we're all involved with school committees in some way, and , I.
They're, not heavily represent on the community board, and they often don't attend meetings And, so I think it's really important that we involve them, especially when we're you know trying to help them, whether it's from the youth programs that we were discussing last month or in school We've got just probably about 15 minutes with the sort of committee meeting.
Maybe this is the year with all of the other things going on with all the conversations that we may really wanna to take a you know, a strong look at what we put in we've got to start.
So I, don't know if the do-e and the D-O-T are talking about this, but I think you know we need to be pretty creative and flexible, and we have this amazing space around every single school.
I. Do worry about what this looks like in January, as opposed to September and for a school to sort of organize outdoor classes in a very changeable climate becomes really quite difficult, so I think there's a lot of work.
This is the question of just what it is and how it works, and then there's also the question of timing for the community board to get involved, because, even if we're to pass a at a new business resolution right now, we wouldn't be able to vote on it as a full board until September.
I mean I would be reticent to do a resolution out of yl because of that I'm a as mark knows, kind of a stickler for process and rich As, well, I like to get a lot of community feedback.
It's really a hard thing for people for the schools to actually work.
And it's at a time when one doesn't really know what school security is going to look like as it reforms itself and as budgets, get cut And I'm, going to jump back to another conversation where mark was talking about the city budget as what we were doing for the district needs.
We cook for kids coming and going through school, but I, don't think in a lot of cases.
You probably picked up the threat, but we're talking about a new business item having to do with whether or not it would make sense And, if so, how to try to make streets and public way available to schools for their use in the coming year.
Is, our community boards, talking about it You, know kind of where d3 sits within the construct of all of the moving parts and the risks associated with trying to open schools partially and what that really means.
You know, I think there is no there's minimum to if you're working if you're at the kids at school , you know he's gonna, have a minimum of three hours or to our online a live.
