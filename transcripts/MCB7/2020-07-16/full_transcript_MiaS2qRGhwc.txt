You hi Lachelle hi Mark nice to meet you if you're familiar with zoom. You know the upper right hand corner of your screen. You can rename yourself. I was going off of your email address, so I apologize I did not have the correct name. Let me it's okay, you got it right. Let me rename my I'll prefer my first name. That's right! I did not have that so I just used what I had yeah great. Thank you I think everyone else is heading and Julian. You want it to be here before I started. Great hi welcome. I. Had me one time you, hello, Emily, all right Christian. How are you right? I am a member of us, CB7, hey, so mark I've got some logistics things for you, so Lolita is sending me a couple of notes about either the phone call or a zoom I did not know. If can we share if I share the phone number? Is that a particular number to me otherwise, I'll give her the number you gave to me and I think she may be trying to call it if she's trying to phone in I'm trying to decipher what she says? Okay, let me just see if she has not reached out to me so I see siju and said you are the man behind that behind the curtain: nerdness yeah, okay, first, she said she wanted a link. Then she said she wanted a phone number yeah all right, I'll take care of that you can. Okay thanks! Well, we'll give a little time as we get together all right, we'll give it a little bit of time I'm getting some notes coming in. So everyone does not mind we'll give a few minutes. Thank you Courtney! You made, it sounds like you had a big day here: you're muted. Hopefully you had a nice birthday and I appreciate you. Thank you Julie and I. Think do we have all our presenters if you could help me out here, Julie and I think we're saying everyone's here: great okay. Well, let me give it a couple more minutes. I got some last- minute notes on some people that may be a little bit late in and Mark did we did we figure out something to help with the with the presentation or we do. We still have a challenge. Putting that up, I could put up the presentation I'm still trying to unlock Lolita here, I can put up the presentation. The numbering of the of the names in the and the actual participants is something we'll have to talk about. Okay. Well, we want to talk about that now or let me try to get a Lolita into the meeting first and then I'll be wear it with you. Okay, this is usually the technology part of the meeting where we try and get one or two loose ends involved, so bear with us. Mark Marginal are not you starting a podcast on how to give do meetings. Oh yeah, maybe looking forward to it you're all in deep trouble. If I am the, if I'm the expert I am spot that you're better than the average bear so well I'm going to wait on you mark. When you tell me, you think you got that ready, I'm ready to start so, okay, great I'm with you now, okay mark can I clean and Encima wants to be promoted from into the panelists, got it okay, great, okay! Well, thank you. Everyone to, or our July yal meeting was super excited about a couple reasons, a couple of just general announcements. First, unfortunately, my co- chair will not be here today due to some minor medical issues, so nothing major, but something that's going to keep her out so I'm a solo, but I will have a wingman Julian. Who will do some introductions because he was kind enough to help us out. We've got an incredibly interesting topic, a topic that I learned about a handful of years ago, called Reese sort of justice that piqued my interest and we've been sort of trying to play with the idea of getting it on board, and we have so I'm excited to learn something today, a goal now to mark for a moment and then what we're going to have is Julian I'm, going to let kind of introduce it and I'm going to have him sort of introduce our panelists, because he really did all the work. So you know let him get the credit and it's his background. So that's number one I also want to thank Courtney, as we always think our records takers so Courtney's taking the notes and she'll get the first question of the day. Yeah there you go so, let's kind of jump in and I'm Stephen Brown I'm the co- chair of I yell I'm, talking to Mark Diller, who is our CB7 chair and we had a little bit of logistics. We had a request to give our names numbers and wondering mark. Is that something we could do or it's something I could do I just want to make sure I'm doing whatever is appropriate, so whoever's. First of all, let me just do a very boring housekeeping thing. There's someone who's phoned in with a number that begins three four seven and ends three one. Six can that person please tell us who you were Lolita's, Aaron, hey I was hoping that was you very good, so welcome I'm not going to be able to make you a panelist, because bone phone callers can't be panelists. That's an issue between you and zoom, but I'm glad you're. Here we can hear you so please, oh and by the way, Star six is unmute yourself and Star. Not Star. Nine is raise your hand, so if yous ai, not where you want to be heard, that's how you do it leave you where you're at and so somebody asked that we that I put numbers in front of names and I'm happy to start doing. That is it just simply is so we have an ordinal number of panelists or is there some other way in which I should be facilitating? This so just a quick clarifying point: sorry this is Emily here, nice, too nice to be here with you all. Thank you for inviting us when we had planned. Our hope was to engage you all in a restorative experience, because we find that that's one of the best ways to be immersed in the topic Julien had thought there would be about eight to nine people on the call. So in the in the timeframe allotted we're prepared to be able to feel Susilo Tate and experienced for about eight to nine people. I see there's a lot more folks here, which is really exciting, but I wonder if maybe just for the sake of the time we can just kind of pick eight to nine people that will participate and everyone else will be able to watch. The experience does that feel: okay, I defer to the committee, but I, see Julian nodding his head and he's my expert on all these things, so that works for me. So here's how we'll do it for those who are panelists. There's a blue. If you click on in the bottom of your screen, there should be a participants. Button. Click on the participants button should open a panel on the right hand, side of your screen, those the first eight people who raise their little blue hands will be the eight people that we will identify, that's great yeah and then, if you would just number them two to nine and then you can make addy Bola number one and Antoinette number 10, so just a number right before their name, so we can see their name as well. That would be perfect. Thank you. So much feel like I'm in one of those calling competitions from a radio show. You know the first nine callers get the CD it's going to feel like an SEL worship. Okay I need two more I am going to Peters and I Justin. Just volunteered, you, okay, hope, that's! Okay, that's perfectly! Fine! I did not want to take a position that the panel's needed I do not have any other hands you Reina. Can I name you I would prefer not. Thank you. Okay, a smaller group is also fine. So if you've got seven, that's not that's, not a problem. We've got seven, let's go with that great and then you could just add. Ebola could be number one and then and when that could be number eight or number nine or whatever the last one. So the bola is one and I'm sorry who's number, two, whatever the last number and the seat. What are you up to? You have one through eight right now: I have two five three through what do I have do. Maybe three mark I have three through seven Martians. Never do. Okay, Antoinette would be number eight, very good. Okay, I think we're there. Thank you for indulging my con hunt- and- peck skills. Okay, all your aesthetic, hi, everybody, it's Julian, sorry yeah do I can add yeah I, think I do not know if Stevens here anymore, but I can I can give a quick introduction for my friends, yrj yeah, so I'll be really brief, so that we can get into the circle, but basically I think a lot of the as a committee. A lot of the issues that we've been dealing with for the past few months and that have been at the forefront of the news cycle up related to aspects of the education system. One being you know, equity and one being student voice. These are very broad categories and I think yrj sort of brings those two together. So since freshman year in high school had been a part of a sister organization to the organization that Addie and Andy are a part of, and the organization I was part of was examining. You know historical discrimination and distortion, allottee and system and youth was sort of justice. Who's here today is examining another sort of the solution to that in a way and I think as a committee we've had meetings where we talk about like the s tag report, URI talked about gifting, talented programs or underfunded. Youth programs- and these are all symptoms of problems within our system and so I think this will be a really good opportunity for us to hear from students and adults who are working together on restorative justice, which is sort of not a saline antidote. But it's a way of dismantling systems of disproportionality in schools, so the students just to give you an introduction, we're very grateful to have two student members of Y RJ and Ian Addie, and we have their adult partners Emily and Michelle who work as directors of restorative practices, for the affinity, schools in the New, York, City, Department, occation office of Safety and youth development. Oh Sid and the other adult partner is Tyler Brewster, who is the co- founder of Peer Connect she's, an educational consultant and a restorative justice practitioner and Trainer. So they let them take the presentation away, but they'll be leading us sort of into understanding what we're sort of justice is and I hope. What we can take away from this is one a greater personal understanding of how we can make our schools more restorative, more inclusive, more at around supportive environments and community, and especially in terms of dismantling. You know inequitable practices, but also that, hopefully we can pass something as a committee and maybe bring something back to the individual spaces we inhabit as students as parents, as teachers or as just members of the community. So if I do not pass it to Addie and thank you everyone for yrj for coming to present today. Thank you so much Julie and my name is adebola me. Peter, okay, Addie I'm part of my RJ I'm, currently, fortunately baju eight from Y RJ, but most high school graduate, so like I'm Julia introduce our partner, our sister team SC. But we are my RJ and we are youth for the presidency, based in Brooklyn, comprising of students from all five boroughs on that go to New, York City, Public Schools and we are authentic partnership, he's an adult partnership with our facilitators that are here and we kind of take what we've learned from our adult facilitators and then now facilitate to other people like we're doing right now we take the work that has been here for centuries, such as sort of like restorative practices, and we implement it into our schools in our everyday lives in our communities, because it helps it flourish better and it brings a sense of comfort ability and vulnerability being able to share your fullest self and still combat issues like you face like inequitable stances and disproportionality. So yeah I'm going to pass it off to my co-, facilitator and then my adult facilitators to introduce themselves as well. Let me be myself: hey guys, trying to get into our circle portion of our presentation. I just want explain on why we asked you guys the number you remember us and our numbering system, so typically we would have. If we were in a virtual space and we able to circle up, we would have a talking piece that is meaningful to one of our members and a talking pieces is something that once you have its invitation to speak and vulnerable, but when another person has, it helps also invitation to listen. So obviously, now things are very different: we're in a virtual space or a talking piece, actually, our number. So whenever a prompt is acts, one person would randomly be children. So, for example, if I randomly choose five, that person would then have the option to either pass up or down. So you guys can either pass up to six seven eight or pass down to four three two now does everyone kind understand the way that works, kind of thumbs, up suicide or down perfect? Thank you, so I'm just going to pass it off to my co-, facilitator or our chickens. I think we saw hand and thumb to the side and yeah I'm. Sorry, yes, y' all that's great yeah suicide, Kinda, Iffy I think you might be any questions. You can just get off me and ask me it's okay, no question! So again, if you just get chosen, you just have to have the option of either passing it up or down number eyes, and the next person would go. So if you're five you're passing me up to six or down to four so then they would have their turn to speak. Okay, now so tiffy, and so we do a quick thermometer check. Thumbs up means like I, completely get it thumbs to the side. It's like I'm, a bit iffy I, do not really understand and throw this down. Is that I do not know what you just said: Eddie yeah! This is Peter Anson, so how do I pass it I mean if I wanted to go up or down. Where do I do I hit? What do I do anything to say: okay, I'm, sorry I had to do something on the sunny is fine after it's after you share, you would just then say: I'll pass it up to and you or pass it down to or kin or whoever it is got it. Thank you no problem, any other questions so like Julian introduced them before we have our adult facilitators, who will not be participating in the circle, just so free time sake or whatever, but we have our wonderful partners, Emily, Michelle and Pilar, but sorry our check- in for today. Let me explain what check in first is what we have at the beginning of every circle. It kind of grounds the space since we're all in a virtual platform, but we're coming from all sectors of life right now. We do not know what each other is going through, but it gives a sensibility for other people to see where people are at what people should be aware of in the circle or most people should be aware of in the space and just something for me or something cool to get it off. So today's check- in is, you can say your name. Gender pronouns are optional and your role and whatever environment you are parent director, whatever the case may be, and then, if you were to describe your moon by selecting a word, first starts with the letter of your name. What would it be so I'm going to repeat that again? If you were to describe your moon by selecting a word? That's the first letter of yours. What would that be? And my adult facilitator Tyler is going to drop the pumps in the chat, so you guys can use a reference if you did not hear what I said so I'm going to start off first, my name is Adebola Addy Debra pronounced she/ her/ hers, I am yes youthful story of Justice, Facilitator and where's. The session, like my mood, I'm amazed to see this type of setup because I've never been in this type of space before but I'm ready to see what and I'm going to pass it up to Christian. Yes, my name is Christian Cordova I this for full disclosure right to work for OC and the capacity of suspension hearing office in the Brooklyn Canarsie one I'm. Also a member of CB7 I really can not think of a more worthless that we see I, feel I mean I, feel good. So I could say you know, I feel like Sony or I'm happy so I'm going to pass the talking piece to number three, which is corny I mean Rosa I. Thank you. My name is Rosa I work for a local 2110 as a union rep and I'm. Also a member of this of CB7 and of this committee I'm, also having trouble coming up with a word that starts with R I know my mind is racing and running, but that's about my mind, because a lot of things went on today in at work and I. Guess I'll pass it on to number four Courtney I work in the market research field, so I moderate groups a lot more than one line. So shout out for this because I know how hard it is, and also a member of CB7. Those committee and I had the benefit of having a heads of having a few minutes. Think of a word because my first reaction also was I have no idea where it starts to see, but I'm going to go with C is for curious, I'm feeling it feeling very curious. This process so happy to be here and I forgot the last one I'm going to pass it to number five on my screen, which is Beth's, hello, I'm, Beverly, Donahue, I'm retired, and a career in government and education. I was at the Do II for a number of years, and also at new visions for public schools. I guess my mood is a bit bashful right now, because I'm trying to understand what this experience will yield. So with that I pass it up to number six Kristen, you need to undo yourself well I'm, trying to unmute your mark. Maybe we should just keep going to set it Cordia Auto up Kristin, if you can unmute yourself down in the lower left corner, feel free to step. In any time my name is Peter. Aronson I run the local Business Improvement District north of 96th Street, which is the neighborhood of Manhattan Valley in Bloomingdale and oh, let's see what was I supposed to do. I know I'm supposed to do something with Pee and I guess she's perplexed about just there is so much going on and my own inability to make things happen as fast as I'd like them to and just that's where I'll leave it so I'll pass it along to number eight I think you, my name is Antoinette and I am a member leaf. It's where justice team, my pronouns, that she heard hers, I, guess I. Also struggle with the word thing: I guess amused: I, guess, just of us think the same I'll try to go back to the person who could not be muted, I'm. Sorry I can't remember your name but Kristin. Then you find a way to unmute yourself. There is a chance that they made kind of jump, kind of came in and left and coming back. I have no idea of knowing, but that does happen. Sometimes, okay, no that's fine and when they come in, which is giving you a chance to check in. But thank you guys so much for your answers so before we kind of go into our circle. I just want to give you guys some background on what restorative justice and its practice are so we're sort of justice is in essence, a way of being that gives people a space to be vulnerable and to flip that holistically, it gives people a chance to build relationships and repair relationships and hold the respectable on kind of bonds. It also at its best post people accountable for what their are in the space. So it's a really good space where you actually feel welcome and you feel warmed and you feel needed. So if you would just put up your slide one for me, please thank you so much yeah, that's perfect. So a restorative justice has three basic tiers that it can be open down to so tier one is the most important and what you people need to spend the most time on which is community building now, without this tier, the rest of the tiers do not work and will not work correctly. This is the tier where people are able to actually build relationships, build trust, be able to have conversations where they actually get to know each other and add people on a deeper emotional level. Without this, without this is very important, without this tier being truly built, the rest of them can not happen. This is the time where actually people care about being in community with each other people start to have mutual respect and mutual love for each other. Without this and the other tiers no one's going to care about, they harm your community. If that they do not really feel a part of it, which then takes us to tier 2, which is repairing harm. Now, once you have your typical circle, will your typical things built in your community? You can then lean on those same practices when harm is occurred, so if disrespect happens or for slur is said in the classroom or in a room or in any other community that you're in that space, you can go in and now that you have mutual respect and vulnerability built into your community, it can actually address it because we're sort of justice is that is less accountable, holds these people accountable. So that's what tier 2 does and then tier 3 is reentry. So it's someone outside your community leaves. This is really the place where you pull them back in and say: okay, there's always a space for you. What can I do to help you come into the space correctly? So that's just three basic thing: three basic tiers that restorative justice can be broken up, are done and often this work gets painted where the Western filter and it's looked at as a new way of doing things, and that's not true. We like to honor that this work has deep roots and indigenous people in their traditions, and it does not come from us and we love to our lens of Technology. Every time we do this work, but it does not come from us, but just we're sort of does. This has a great impact that anybody who's a part of it is not just for school. It's not just for students. You can't serve dozens I'm, your family and it can be showing up in a lot of ways. You're sort of this is one thing on there's a big umbrella for sort of practices, and it just gives you a space where you're able to be vulnerable, where you feel needed, where you look that as a person not just for what you bring, but for everything, you're bringing everything you are, and it's just a really good place to be I'll, pass it to my other partner who's, going to show us one of our really big things. They were sort of dozens which are community norms. Oh yeah community norms. So, as Andy said why we are here creating a space that is safe for people, so norms allow people to come into the space and not be them their real selves and complete selves, and this is not know like Kumbaya I, expect we're really trying to get down to the nitty- gritty and even though we get down to the degree, and sometimes we try to touch the surface, we often step on each other's toes sometimes, and we want to create something that will allow people to put these things in place, which is like hey, do not forget that I've kept this as norm, because I want to be able to feel comfortable and complete in this space. So the virtual circle community norms that we have for today are open mind, open heart, coming into a space and realizing that you're coming into new things and ideologies and be ready to take it in speak your truth. This is a safe space, not a sanitized space, as my Eider teller would say coming here as your full self also yep, safe space. Anything can be said, even though this is life thing. It can just be realize that people are allowed to be themselves and does not have to put like another face of when they're trying to be honest about the situation and respect respecting everybody's beliefs, ideologies, feelings, attitudes or something and just having respect for wrong general, so yeah opening Sim. Thank you. So right now, I'm going to lead us to a mindful moment. So, if you're more comfortable, you can turn off your cameras, but I, just wanna I just want you guys all to close your eyes and just take really just yes. So if you're more comfortably can definitely turn off your camera, but just close your eyes and take a deep breath. Take one big red one. Now let it go now going to took another really deep breath in through your nose, 1:2 3 out through your mouth and as you're. Taking these deep breaths I really want you to think back to your school experience. When you were a teenager and think of the space, the state spaces that you were able to have the spaces, were you able to be vulnerable and talk where you felt needed? Were you able to talk about your emotions, something back so one more last deep breath in through your nose, 1:2, 3,4 and really let me air that out through your mouth, nothing back! What do these spaces give you? Why were you able to be vulnerable? What do the people look like in that space? Thank you so much. Thank you guys. You can definitely turn your cameras back on and now thinking about space. I'll turn back to my co-, facilitator and she'll. Give us our props. Oh I was just dropped in chat, I! Think back to a time during this experience that you were able to or like your school leaders or whatever the case may be at that time, and what did you perceive from that community or it could be an individual person that allows you to be vulnerable to your true self and expression so, and Tyler will help recorders that help us record that in the chat, so one two three words that allowed you to be vulnerable, so I start us off to model definitely from a community in school. I realized that the best community that I had outside of school was with large. It's allowed me to be one of them was I had somebody to listen. Definitely somebody being able to listen without a judgement without judgement at all and communication is key for me. So you know you ever had a conversation with somebody and they're speaking to them and they'll speak back, but you know they're, not comprehending what you're saying or not even taking it in so just having that type of communication that it's open back and forth I'm going to pass it down to Internet. Thank you, I think three words they're embodied spaces I've been able to be vulnerable in is definitely reflective. As adebola said, I really need to hear back that you're kind of understanding what I'm saying what I'm being open about understanding where maybe, if I did something wrong or if you know I'm, not judgment and just fun where we were not just it did not feel so serious thing. We were to laugh off, but also have serious conversation at the same time. I think that's what gave me and I'll pass it down to seven hi I. Guess the place that I thought of was. Can you hear me? Yes, okay was sort of an in- between place. It was train tracks and walking along train tracks with people, and you were doing something with them, but you did not have to be paying too much attention to it other than avoiding trains, and you could talk, and so that was that was the space that came to mind and I guess I'll, pass it down to six Kristen. Are you there? Kristen I think is still have not challenges that she put in the chat. Can we unmute her, but I can not a mute. Her okay, I have asked to unmute. Sometimes I had that it's not it, but it's not working and I apologize, so I definitely acted in not access to microphone. You know, maybe to bed, then number five I thought of my experience working in high school on the school paper, where we had common goals, common effort to deadlines had to get stuff done had to do it. You know in a way that was in our view, as excellent as we could possibly do it and it created an enormous camaraderie I. Guess, that's it down to Courtney and I. Think there was that we shared common interests and the shared passion and sometimes passion when you are a teenager, is not something. That's always a widely accepted or a store, feel comfortable expressing, and it was a space where we could kind of all be together and share that and express it and feel comfortable being that showing that part of ourselves, so that would be a stage keep breathing to past it I'm. So sorry, okay, I'm going to pass it to three rows- hi I, remember my principal and my guidance counselor from high school and they were just extremely encouraging. Supportive and I mean I hesitate to use the word loving because you know I do not know I, think of loving in other terms, but I felt you know some care on their part for sure, and it just helped. Overall, with the experience I went to a CAF, all- girls, Catholic, school and I was tough and I'll pass that down to a Christian, but we'll think back to when I was in high school then, which was an environment, was very acceptable. Supportive, very encouraging of all of us- and we always was a good camera, come out already with them within the students, and there was a good time so I passed the talking piece back to one the bola. Thank you guys so much I'm going to take this until I'm, really sorry that Krishna can not participate right now, yeah, it happens so I'm going to take it since our second prompt that Tyler will drop again in the chat. So thinking about again, security needs so reflect on a time that you were not able to reach, but you really needed to be and what got in the way so I'm going to give like my story. For example, real quick when I go is like right, where I am right. Now my house I'm from conservative, like Nigerian hot, also speaking of things, olive worldly, coming from things like different political ideologies or anything. That's too touchy to anything LGBTQ anything doing thing. Anything like this is just like, but it's where I feel most comfortable and I'm able to express myself and speak about things. But you know it's kind of taboo as well as being in a school. Grooming is more performative than she's speaking on things, so it's like I was not really be able to be my complete self, and then it was not until I got to. My origin is just like if we do not make these spaces comfortable with being uncomfortable, then what's the point so yeah so I'm going to pass it up to Christian again I'm sorry we're going to pass on this one I'm going to pass it up to three I did not have too much time to think that I can only think about. Just my home I grew up in a single- parent home with an immigrant parent. My mom I'm also an immigrant we're from Panama, and we were the only people here from Panama. All our family is still in Anima and she worked a lot. She expect his tre days. I did the best I could I was a pretty good student, but there was not much space at home for any vulnerabilities I mean I had to just be into academics in the summers I worked, you know, and it was. There was a lot of I guess a lot of pressure to do well as an immigrant with no family. No, you know no history in America, and so there was no space to just kind of be a kid and have fun, and not that I did not. But you know it was like it was not as maybe as easy as I would have liked. I would have liked to have a little more space to just be a teenager and I felt a lot of pressure to be an adult and I will pass that up to Courtney, okay, I think again, I was almost I grew up in a place where it really was not okay to be different and there's a reason why I actually like ended up in New York City very quickly as quickly as I could and so I would say. Almost every other time just was not it's just being different was not accepted and I am going to remember to pass this time and I'm going to pass for going up now right so I'm going to five, which is that's so it cost a bit. I always felt there comfortable in at home and able to be myself. I've had much more difficulty as I recall, doing that in school, where the definition of popular back in my high school and then ancient past was not to be interested in academics or in excellence or scholarship. It was to be popular on other fronts and I did not fit into that atmosphere. Well and I. Do not remember it. It's a place where I was very comfortable. I will pass it up to number six Christian. Who can't be so then to number say: okay, again Christian, if you're able to figure it out, feel free to step in at any time. I guess: I moved from suburbs in the Midwest hypsi in New York, and it was right at high school, and that was just it was a huge culture change, and so there was very little that was comfortable. Just yeah I mean I. What was comfortable was getting out and walking and being outside with people, but school was not easy and I was not much interested in much of the sports, and so there was. There were a lot of things that were not good, but it worked out. Fine I guess, but it just. It was not very good at the time, in any case, sorry number, eight Eddie and the wet and Winnett. Thank you, I think spaces. Where warrants it would be. Wonderful in school were basis where people did not really know me and did not know that they kind of had a person like kind of had to be persistent to open me up, but also thinking back spaces, where teachers and administrators kind of put the pressure of me being a role model like hey, like you're, your president, you can be like actually honest or so I felt I so censored in a way that I knew I could not say things because teachers were looking at me to be like be a role model to their student to the room so like I knew. I could not say that I could not be honest, so I think in those kind of spaces I could not be me and I could not move honorable when I needed to be so yeah I'll fasted back to Miss, edible right back to you. Okay, all right! Thank you. Thank you guys so much for your vulnerability in your stories. They were so interesting to hear and just to kind of wrap up this circle experience. So there's a quick 25 minute circle, but I think having places like this is so important, especially in schools and while kids are going through growing pains and stuff at home and social unrest. Why? It's so important to have these spaces present in schools, especially because students need to be heard, and students need to be able to go into their school, not just to learn but to be able to be vulnerable and to be open and to be able to tell their stories and what they're going through, because students are not just students, they're human beings. You know, I, think a lot of educators and people who end up growing up and being policymakers forget what it feels like to be a student. It's not be heard and to not have spaces where they can really speak up and can't they forget what it feels like to be silenced in a way. So this is really in this spaces are really important, especially nowadays, when you see conversations being have, especially with the incident Jorge floor going into public press, you see conversations being rushed where students are not bond with each other. In conversations and the be more harmful than helpful, so that's just something really important and why we think work and we're sort of dust is just needs the every school in every community. That is possible. So thank you guys so much for joining. This is amazing experience. Thank you for doing for giving us this experience and thank you great well, I'm back. So if anybody figured out, my internet went down in the first five minutes, but I've secured it so I'm here. So what much it's I guess. It was much more interesting than a traditional PowerPoint, so I think anytime. You learn something by actually practicing Krabs. It's a it's much more interesting! So thanks, we generally can kind of go around. I did not get a chance to tell the process there would be, and the process is for you guys to make a general presentation and then we'll go around to there. Our committee members and the Non committee members for any QA I have actually has some questions and I would I'm going to ask any of the committee members and non committee members, because I know they know to raise their hands and then I'll kind of go around from there. If you can do it on our participants, thing I know we know how to pretty much do it and if at the end of it, if somebody raises their hand, I'll find them, but I'm going to kind of go around from that. So and excuse me, if you said this, but could you talk to me just a little bit about how I mean? How does this work in schools? Is it in every school? Is it sort of you know school to school, I'd like to I know? Could you kind of give us give me or the group some thoughts about how this is actually brought to life in a school, and maybe it's my first question? How does this happen and then how does it work? Is it a general you meet on Mondays it's every day. Whoever raises their hand, you know, can you just walk me through that process? I'd be very curious, so me, and a do actually local part of the you for sort of justice team where students from I started off as 15 schools, I'm pretty sure we've grown a little bit since last year, but it started off as with 15 partner schools. So there's two kids from each school I mean used to we used to meet in person every to every two weeks on a Friday, so ease the meet and just really build our knowledge on what circles are wherever sort of this has come from ways we implement sort of justice into our school and then from what we learned in our larger school meetings. Each student member would then take it back and build their own restorative justice, school- based team, so then kind of what we learned from our larger meetings. We would take back into each of our schools. Not every school has it which we was really disappointing, but the do is trying it starting a process where more schools are involved. That is a good question. I feel like I forgot like three. Well, so did you say? Is it 15 schools, or you said they were, seemed like there was a large group, but a smaller group when you take it back to the school, could you just clarify that and Andy can I add to that a little bit so Andy just did a really beautiful job of describing the structure of the team that she inaudible are part of, which is a really intentional selection of about 17 schools, acrosss New York City that we work really intensely with youth leaders to really lead the charge in their own schools. But there are about 500 schools, acrosss New, York City, that are involved in a expansion through the Office of Safety new development, where they are in some phase of implementation of beginning this work. So some of these schools are pretty far advanced in this work and have been doing it for years. Other schools are in the beginning phases, where they're just kind of learning, to understand that pyramid that Nancy and Addie's presented at the beginning, with really kind of understanding that foundational piece, so schools acrosss the city, are in very different spaces in terms of how they're implementing and it looks very different from school to school. So there are schools where every single day, every single student and staff member participates in a circle like you just did in with the with the purpose of building community and building relationships. There are schools where that happens once a week or twice a week. There are schools where it only happens with the ninth graders or the sixth graders. There are schools where it happens as a optional thing, where it's offered during lunch or after school and people can opt in. So there's not one model, that's going on acrosss the city right now, these days it organically started or resists by the principal or just curious, how you know 500 have it: how does it? How does it start at each school? The 500 schools that are in the expansion were identified through their super attendance. As schools, that would be good fits to kind of go in phase one of this expansion I think the goal is to expand it to the entire city at some point, but there are lots of schools that were doing this work long before this expansion effort started and that was really driven by the school community. So sometimes it's driven by a principal or another administrator saying I really want to buy into this work. Let's go out and catch up, and sometimes and very often it's driven by a teacher or a paraprofessional or a group of students who learn about the work and get kind of a small group, really excited and then grow it throughout the school. So it's if it's going, if there's a million different models for how schools get started, Mm- Hmm and happen. How long like? How long has it been practicing? Is it five years ten years just curious how long it's been in the in the school system? Tyler. Do you want to take a guess at that? To be exact, looks a variety of different ways: it's not really a program or something that's placed in a school, so we might have some schools that have been practicing this for 50 years, because the way that they interact and the way they engage and recognize one another's humanity is just a part of their foundational values as Antoinette's folks who, in the presentation what we see in schools, is really borrowing and adapting from indigenous practices that have been going on for thousands of years right around the globe, and so some schools are just already founded and positioned in that way in terms of interacting with one of the building community having strong systems for addressing and repairing harm, and welcoming folks back when reentry or reintegration is necessary. There are some schools, though, that are brand new to this and may just be hearing about it and are entering it as a way to kind of heal their school culture, but I think the most important thing is recognizing the work starts within, and so it's not necessarily a script or protocol to be followed, but really shifting the way we see and interact with each other day to day great okay. I see a couple hand raised, so I will stop asking all the questions and Christian I think you were the first one up, so you have a question. Yes, how are the? How are the school supported on these from all seeds? I mean: do they have assigned facilitator, that close from school to school and set them up or do they on their own are figured out and I did not figure? What to do one and pass it on to the other students. Yeah I think that's a great question so for the schools that are part of this explicit expansion that we're talking about those 500 schools. They are each assigned a point person, a coordinator who reaches out to their school and supports them through a process of implementation and introduction to the work and then, as Tyler said, there's lots of folks that have been doing this authentically for years, and so often they have kind of found their own resources through a lots of great partner organizations and different opportunities that the Department Ed has offered through osek just kind of open to anybody. And then the schools that are not currently part of the expansion that are looking for support will reach out you. That's the team that Michelle and I sit on we partner with Tyler in this, and the youth team is built out of it, so they will reach out to our team and we'll redirect them to any resources that are available citywide if they're not explicitly part of the funded expansion arena. I want to first say how impressed I was with the way in which Anna Bola and Antoinette and Julie Julian have presented this evening. It's very impressive. This kind of work is in so I'm really impressed with the way in which you moderated. It's almost what all of us on this call this evening. I guess, I. Think Tyler and Emily have answered a part of my question, but the other part is and I'm sorry I could not participate. I had something else to do, and I was trying to do that and do this meeting at the same time and I. But as I was listening to the questions and as I was answering the questions to myself. I wondered how whether there's any mental health clinicians that are part of this circle or part of this program, because it seems to me that some of these questions and I could be wrong will raise for some people. It might trigger all right and people and my trigger and for some people, memories or they might emotions might surface that they did not anticipate feelings. Some positive, some negative and I was just curious as to when that happens. Where can young people who were part of the circle take what's coming up for them like? What's that process like? Thank you so cancer? Well, when it comes to I love that question when it comes to situations like this one we're in circle, it's there's always something I mean I, think it. They know me. I got uncomfortable real, quick, like I can say, like I'll, be in a space, I'm, uncomfortable and they'll. Do that? Okay, it was a problem I like to implement this thing with on. There was a norm, that's usually on there, but I'm for the space that we're in it was not I learned it from my sister and when she was in school, it's called Alchun hoops. This is just like a like a little thing that help people but there's a whole other thing besides in it, but how she notes is basically like somebody feeling something within the circle that they're not okay, with it's not sitting right with them and they're, saying ouch and the person. That said, something is recognizing what they did ohh and made that person feel away and they say oops they have a caucus and they explain what was the situation, what made them feel uncomfortable and then they can really I'm. Sorry, if you hear that if they can really delve in on what really happened, because the other day there is situation like this is like a community circle, I mean IAM and go into the other tier east. These circles can go really deep, because we all need to unpack things, because we realize that we're not unpacking things with any within ourselves and even though we do not want to it now reflects in what we're doing so, whether it be policymaking, whether it be being a teacher, whether it be being a student, if I do not know pack things as myself, which I really do not want to do to I'm older, but now that I'm in the space was just like I'm granted with opportunity to speak to people that are ready to listen and ready to take it in it's beside. If something was to be brought up, that made me feel uncomfortable that I really need to speak about. We can talk to an adult facilitator. We can get extra resources. We can speak to people besides outside the circle, because there's some times that the circle does not need to hear all your all. What's going inside, you're still bringing your true self, but this does it need to hear all of you and somebody else can hear it privately and hear that you're still like hurting or whatever the case may be or whatever that so I do not want it to seem like if somebody felt like they could not say anything that when we got swept in the wrong, but just knowing that I the circle can evoke that type of emotion. Somebody is why we do so yeah also I think the circle does that for itself really kind of hold people safely and brings people back in if they are uncomfortable. If they are kind of triggered, however, we also do give up, there's always the chance to just skip, and here not come both answering a question. You always have the option to stay prompt but, like edible said, I like there's instance where, if there is extra support needed I've seen people get pulled out of their circle acts like hey. Do you want to talk in the hallway, and that does happen, so there are a lot of different ways that people are supported. Thank you anything else, right all right, Ken. Thank you for coming today, very nice to see you and the at the Yl meeting, and let's have you answer whatever questions you have yeah I'm actually here for something that a new business but I was very interested in this I'm, a member of Community, Board 7, also on the Transportation Committee and the parks and Environment Committee I get my question was this so far to me seems very abstract and I was wondering if you could give a couple of concrete examples as to why how one of these circles starts, what props it you know, I assume it has something to do with. If it's about restoration, something needs to be restored. What would that be big? If a couple, a couple of examples, I would be great but I feel like for like for one. We started. Why JAMA give that example? First, when we started yrj, we literally was we found out from our school people at school. They'll, be like oh, hey, we're trying to implement this work in school, but we're going to send you somewhere to train you first, so you can come back and bring it to us. So that's how it was, and then we went into this space and you were greeted with pizza and smiles, and then we try to see what we can do from there and we sat in a circle like why are we sitting in a circle, obviously like how you guys are new to this and citizen a circle and as we were going along, you were learning, but we were understanding that we needed this to help fix what was going on and most of the time. Like any said, people implement our G when it's too late so like, for example, if there's a fight that happens within school you're trying to know sick kids that are already angry and full of rage in a circle with somebody that they'd even build community with in the first place. So I did not know what boundaries to cross with you. I do not know boundaries that cause that made you angry and now you're telling me to now address those problems when I did not know them in the first place. It's like it, it's what happens in things other than school. This carries on into places like prisons. He carries on places like homes like if you do not set up a boundary and like have that base community. It does not really work Stoli when it comes to like disciplining students in school with suspensions. All these things, if you're, not understanding why a student is the way they are, you can't actively try to change them or discipline them without understanding what got them to that point and I'm positive, and you can explain that a bit more things like Eddie said we came into the space, not really knowing what we were there for not really understanding what it would leave-. So circles does not start off with this. Maybe community building games, you know learning each other's names and their name where we're from and the places would like to be in so there's getting to know new circles. You just pause and hear one we're just kind of just building the relationship more and then gradually and slowly as months past, we saw those circles come from just getting to know each other's names and where we're from talking about family deaths and stuff, that's something that happens so naturally, as that community, like kind of gradually builds and-. Your second question is that he explained the first one well what's being restored at its best, our neighbor sports community and repairs harm. If it's implemented too late. However, there are, there is a conversation within RJ, where some people call a transformative justice, because some people like to believe that you can't restore something that was never there. So some people do like to call it transformative, justice, I'm fancier, second question in terms of maybe community and feeling having a vulnerable space and people being able to be holistic and bond and needed. I hope. The answer, the question, so it did, starts with a an incident. Let's say, like somebody steals somebody's cellphone or they're in a fight or something like that, is that the kind of thing that would trigger it? That's usually worst part: now you knew go ahead. Eddie yeah, you got it starts, but what we're saying is that, like right here, I do not I do not know anybody, but I learned that Rosa went to all- girls classic school, like I learned that from being in circle with Rosa, but it's not like I, but up fighting Rosa and then she's, like the reason why I'm like this is because I was an all- girls. Catholic school I mean at first I knew that there was a boundary for her first. Instead of he's now pushing that boundary and trying to figure out why I always go in the first place. The whole point of this is that we should not have something like ignite the flame. Before we try to put it out. We should find the sticks, I'm, trying to make a reference that will make it make more sense, but like yeah we're trying to find things that I'll put it together. First, before we soften the fire, when it's already, the whole house is already engulfed in flames yeah trying to fire before it spreads. Yes, finally, and it's okay- and you just add, I- think you did a beautiful job of explaining like what builds up so conflict and how we, you know, end up in a space where we need to heal harm. But it's just a reminder that restorative justice is for everyone, no matter the demographic, no matter who you're working with the age position, role or title, and it's really about how we establish in humanity. So how are we getting to know one another? So, for example, Emily and I have worked at a school together where we really worked really hard to implement restorative justice, and we realized a lot of the work needed to start on the adult level. The adults did not know each other. We did not really understand each other's philosophies. We were making a lot of assumptions about one another and why and how we were coming to the work and so I get restorative. Justice is really the vehicle to begin. Having conversations so introductory conversations to first build a strong community and once that community is built and harm does take place similar to Addie said we have this. This net to kind of fall back on where we already trust each other to be vulnerable enough to come to the table, to figure out. How can we all be accountable? So not just young people being accountable to adults, because we do not. We want to make sure we're not using restorative justice as a euphemism for on punitive model discipline, but how also can adults be accountable to their young people to each other to the families that we serve? Thanks I will go to Cortney, who should have been first, but she did not ever hand raise. So I could not pick her first at the beginning. I do not think ya know that you were. Do you redo the first question, because you take the notes: I do not want to think I made a mistake. I'm not. It sounds like if I'm understanding correctly, the best practice here is really to have the system in place ahead of time ahead of the problem, so that it becomes the mechanism through which a problem is addressed. So I guess my question here is: how do you ensure that the people who should be at the table, the students who should be at the table, are at the table? How do you go about talking to kids and making sure that the kids, who could most benefit from being exposed to this are exposed and have access and come in? Does that mean yeah I? Think like Tyler said it's where every student is for everyone, so we really do not like to select kids like it is for everybody in the community. However, if you do want to select certain students, I think the best thing is an hour for students to come in I think the worst thing you can do is for someone to be a part of something they do not want to be a part of, and it's just to have understanding conversation of a kid just want some pizza just wants to talk. You know, like I, think that's why it's really important, like you said, for this work to start organically, so kids do not feel like they're forced into yet another circle, we're kids. They do not know, and it just starts it just starts talking organic. It just starts off, maybe talking to friends about where you guys want to travel to and where you guys want to go with friends and people. You know and then those conversations start to build up into something that those kids actually can benefit from, but you can't just skip steps. Those important steps you need to slowly build your kids are able to feel comfortable in space and be like okay, maybe I do want to open up. Maybe I do want to talk about. Why I act like that? Why I act out you understand unless Ad1 sat on dancing, okay, Kyle wanted Cortney to repeat your question, so I make sure I got it right. Are you acting like you? Do not you ask what you want to ask? Let me not to have to students how about this process to make sure that do you know anything like how are you making sure that the kid that people come to the table since it sounds like the Venom Rita's back here- is to have people in the room before any before issues? Even that do that? So how do you get people there? How do you tell them about this in a way that they wanna get all I can help I mean I'm, not going to say, like I, had the story of lack Bald as a student like I was labeled as the smart, probably child, but I had the brains together, but the way I behaved in classrooms was not sets of people so like when it came to like bringing me it. I was never involved in spaces like this. I was never came to learn, decision-, making or helping things we planned, but it's just allowing students to realize that opportunity is giving to them. If that makes sense, so you know adults, I'm, sorry, I'm, breathing, so I saw run to put on my life, but adults usually put some students at the forefront of the movement that they're trying to create, or whatever they're trying to like, lay down or whatever, and then you have students behind that be like hey I wanted to be a part of that. Why could not they? Let me be a part of that and it's just like they did not know that they were welcome, but as when it comes to like allowing students that, like from all like, if we're trying to build this from a base from all Walsall I, just let them know that the space is there. It's like seem like we're doing a circle. A room and somebody's looking past they'll be like what are they doing in there and they just keep walking or whatever the case may be. I think you walk past, keep walking past or they never walk past again, it will still be in the back of their mind that a space like that exists and that they're welcome to anytime, because, regardless of if you're, reentering or you're coming in for the first time or you've never heard of this before you're always welcome to learn, and even if you have different ideologies and you're not ready to do the whole getting to know each other. Do not forget. You're always welcome to now come and learn or to bring your different perspective, because all perspectives are needed. I did not answer your question. I am so sorry addy. If I can just add to that I think one of the I think Addie and Andy are really touching on some important points. There and I think that one of the ways that we try to get every voice at the table is by letting as many people as possible experience what this is and what it feels like and as they've all they've said, as Andy and Abby have said, and as Tyler said, this is really a way of life. It's a way of existing, and so when you shift a school's culture in such a way that everyone knows that there is opportunity to be heard that there's opportunity to be seen that there's opportunity to be vulnerable when you provide constant spaces for people to participate in. We really advocate that this does not just happen during advisory or once a day in the morning or during lunch, but that when you start a science lesson you check in with people and see how they're doing and do a quick opportunity for people to just kind of like how am I showing up today, there's all different opportunities throughout the school day and outside of the school hours to really humanize one another. And by doing that, we give young people and adults in the building the opportunity to realize that they have voice and that they have a voice. That's going to be heard, and then you start to engage more and more people, and so we often work. We when we support schools. We often support them through things like culture audits and going through a process of identifying who has decision- making power. Who has facilitation power? Who and who is just allowed to be a participant? Why is that? How do we shift that? So it's a it's a huge array of things that have to happen, but really it's shifting the entire culture in the school, so that people realize that if they want to have voice, there's an opportunity for it and then you start to get a lot of different voices so just in the same way that they passed a talking piece during circle. Everyone had a chance to make a decision about whether or not they wanted to share, and there was a moment where Christian decided he did not want to and he passed it along, but he had that chance to decide too often we do not give people that chance and then not everyone will raise their hands right. So if we just in the practice of using a talking piece, we give everyone voice instead of forcing people to try to offer themselves up which everyone won't do. It creates a dynamic that allows for more engagement that infuses a whole multiple experiences in a school day rather than in some isolated. We meet on Fridays at two o'clock in this room. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you that helps okay, Bibs yeah I had a couple of questions. One is this 500 school expansion that we heard about are these all high schools? Is it in middle schools as well? Have the department worked out how this might fit into an elementary school setting? Could you give some sense of how this spans acrosss age yeah that 500 school expansion was just this last year was the first year of that and that included middle and high schools so that 500 schools includes middle and high schools acrosss the city? This work is happening in elementary schools. They're, not currently part of this particular phase of this expansion. I think there is a desire to see that there's been more of a focus in the last year or two in supporting the elementary schools with what's called the Sanford harmony curriculum, which is a very social- emotional learning based support system, but there are definitely elementary schools that are doing this work and again that goes back to those schools. That kind of Thailand touched on that either just kind of authentically been founded in this work or staff, or students or families have really had a desire to see this work grow. But this is not something that is exclusive to a high school experience or middle school experience. It can happen at any grade level. It can happen in a community board. It can happen, as we see lots of outside community- based opportunities for this work and community, a community based restorative justice programming. So yeah, it's not it's not unique to middle school and high school in terms of the ability for it to be effective, but the current expansion of those 500 schools, for whatever the decision was I'm, not sure, was targeted in phase one to just middle in high school. Do you have information on what the budget was for this expansion that is now entering its second year? I, do not want to give you the wrong number. I know that the operating budget in terms of kind of purchasing power in per session, so OT PS in per session, was about three and a half million, but that does not include a staffing budget, and so we could get that it's public information I could get that and send it to Julian to share if you'd like, but I, do not know it offhand. Okay and I guess that's it Thanks great I'm going to pick Vice Chair Doug. As he says here, the Vice Chair sounds very official Doug. It's just v-, D- j, very important, very important, no I'm. Just me, I'm just done I am first of all I just wanted to thank you for doing this and I'm so impressed with what I've seen so far, and these smiling faces and really it conjures up. So many thoughts and emotions in my own life experience to date, and so basically, I have some comments and I'll finish off with a question. My observation here is just that the communication model and sharing is so fundamental to the human healing experience and in my life, having been through therapy group therapy and different support groups and being involved in different trainings with all different aspects of sharing I've found that when it's done right, it's some of the most healing experiences that I've ever had in my life and I know that that's true for so many people and I. Just remembering going through a doing a group experience to where we broke off into small groups and I remember without getting into too much detail. There was one person that was in my group, but I did not want to be in that group, because I did not think this person I thought this person was mean because of their face or their expression, and then, when this person shared in a very vulnerable way, their wounds in their life. This person became my favorite person and I heart opened and I'll. Never forget that experience, so I can see how this will work and works on so many levels in so many parts of life in every part of life so and I know that the general fundamental principles that are so important in any sharing is safety and boundaries, and you know- and of course that includes being in an environment. That's non- judgmental you know, and so I'm, adding a little bit to what Arena said and I was having some a similar thought that which is that, unfortunately, tragically there's so much abuse in the society of every kind, physical, verbal, emotional, sexual abuse that I have to imagine that much of this will be benign and will foster friendships or relationships. But I have to imagine that some people will be triggered and then I guess. The leads into the question is: if someone shares something that is very, concerning about possibly reporting that they've been abused. Where did what is the? What is the methodology? How did how is that person immediately cared for? How is this recorded, and possibly that may involve professional therapists I wish we did have a social worker in every school by the way. I know that is something that Gale Brewer, our beloved Madame borough, president, is you know four and I do not know, that's going to happen, I hope sure I hope it does, but anyway I'm sorry I'm really going off, but I'm so inspired by everybody. So is there a method if someone discovers or suspects that there is abuse? How is that reported? How is that cared for and done in a safe and respectful manner and by the way, if there are social workers to school, are the social workers by default, facilitators and I'll end it? There I'll take that question every school in the deal we is guided by Chancellor's regulations and in those chances regulations. If someone, whether staff a student, discloses some something that is harmful to themselves or to others, there is a protocol that must occur so when what better place to have restorative practices and a restorative circle, because there is a adult that is in that adult does not have to be a social worker or a guidance counselor in that space. But every adult is guided by those same Chancellor's regulations and when something like that occurs, they are to do that handoff to those professionals in that building. That can support that student or staff member who may need support, so that is already built into the sort of mechanism and I think that's best case scenario that you're having these type of circles or circumstances in a space where there are professionals who have those protocols in place. So that is definitely not a concern. Every school principal every school assistant, principal I'm, pretty sure, maybe not every school, has a guidance counselor. They may not have as many as they need, but every school has one. So all of those people are in place in a school building to support that effort. We also mandate- and this is one of the reasons that the expansion was funded as well as it was, and we're really grateful that there was a recognition for the need for this funding. We mandate that folks go through really extensive training around how to facilitate and how to hold this space before they begin doing this work and as Addy and Andy pointed out, one of the things that has driven home in that training is that you have to start this work at the foundational level of just that kind of, like very low stakes. Community building the session that we did with you all today is a higher stakes session. We would not do this as a first session with young people. We would build up to the point I think we I think we went through like till February of this year meeting with our young people all year before we even approached a topic like this, and one of the reasons that on Addie and Andy, and some of the other students that helped to develop this lesson developed it. The way they did was that they wanted to kind of have adults experience having to write off the back without having built any relationships have to talk about being vulnerable, because when this work is not done well, this is what we ask students to do all the time without creating that safe community first and so as Andy kind of shared at the end, like you have to create that safe container before you start asking people to be super vulnerable. So it's really driven home in the training modules that we go through. People go through a five- day, full five- day, 5 days of training and then there's an additional four days of another trait of a- you're- training that people go through before they can start working on repairing any harm. But in that training we drive home like how do you do this safely? How do you do it? Well? Why do you have to start at the most basic levels of like who are you? Who am I and let's get to know each other on a really surface level? Let's go a little deeper. Let's go a little deeper and through those trainings we also cover and remind folks, as Lachelle just said, of the Chancellor's protocols and of this kind of safety, Nats of it and I. Think and I apologize I did not catch the name of was it Doug who raised the question and I think Doug to your point. I think more often than not, people are triggered more often than not. Something gets shared through circle. More often than not thing is exposed and to Adi and Andy's point when the circle is really strong. The circle itself can process that and can hold that for people, but there are definitely moments where more support is needed and, as Lachelle said, that's when we rely on our protocols of bringing in professionals to provide that additional support to that individual. It's real, quick, sorry! This is beyond the professional point like even if we're having cookies after our yrg meetings, we have a little separate circle. So, if there's anything, that's alarming to you can have circles without, like some an adult president, there's anything alarming. We know as the way we are associated you need to bring it back to somebody if it's something that something that was shared. Obviously, everything should be sacred within youth or whatever, but there's some things that is just like I do not know. I know. You told me that, out of like you trusted me or whatever, but I'm really concerned for your safety, so we literally take it back facilitators. But somebody told me this in confidentiality. Note that what was said here will stay here always on here will be fair, so I'm bringing it to my adult facilitator and in not worrisome but like concern I'm concerned for that person's safety and I'm bringing it so they'll know what to do after that, but now that I brought it to their attention. It's not like it's just left out in the open when somebody just entrusted me with something that was that heat yeah. Thank you so much I did your explanation of how much groundwork and structure is involved is reassuring because when I first started listening, I kind of said, it seemed a little bit more ad hoc and it's really reassuring to hear how much training people go through. It's just I'm, it sounds wonderful, really does thank you great and we have Peter who was also known as number. Seven thanks, I've got lots of questions and I. Thank you for giving this presentation I'll start with just where do I start, we have three middle schools. We have one high school up in our immediate neighborhood of let's say 96 to 110th and there's do not know how whether you're involved in any of them, but there's certainly room for that. We have lots of people coming from lots of different parts of the world and we'd love to see that up here we also have gangs and recently, within the past two weeks three weeks, we've had four killings, which we have not had for years and I do not know that people are going to be open to discussing I mean talking in situations where there may be gang members and I'd love to hear your thoughts on. You know dealing with this on a community level dealing with this in a school we're in a Middle School, where gangs that may be recruiting people and beating each other up so I be curious to hear your thoughts on that thanks Peter. Thanks all for that question. So, to your point, I'm just a circle back that building a restorative culture takes time, and so we would certainly recommend that those trust that trust that relationship has already been built before we use restorative justice as a means to begin having a difficult conversation. Assuming that work has been done and there's a you know and identified and trained individual who does have meaningful relationships both with those young people and around the community, I would say that this is that, once the trust is there, we can have these difficult conversations. So, speaking from personal experience, I was a Dean of discipline at a small school in Crown Heights. If anyone knows around about that area, near Kings, County, very creepy, right on the border of Latin, Kings, Bloods and Cripps and I was able to do pretty amazing work with all of those youth members and again it's about front- loading, seeing them as people first right and people with needs and thinking through what we see in our schools is often we can think of schools as mirrors and windows right so windows in terms of dreaming to the future of what we'd like to see our future to be, but they're often mirrors of societal ills, and so the black. You know the black and brown students we serve are not broken, but usually what we see are symptoms of larger issues, I'm, an American Society, and so my first own recommendation is to see these people as people with needs and maybe who have been underserved in some way, are and then building those meaningful relationships and so identifying key people in the both in the neighborhood and within the school community. To begin having these conversations with, it's really about sharing and re- establishing humanity, and so I can speak firsthand. We've had very difficult situations at the school I worked in Crown Heights opposing gang members gang members on opposite sides of conflicts where people had lost their lives and they knew who was responsible for what, but by censoring their humanity first and letting them and leading my conversation, not from a place of fear. I was able to do pretty unremarkable work in terms of harm and healing in that space and also recognizing the capacity and not censoring myself in terms of what I think solutions or what I think resolution looks like, but really giving them voices to be a part of identifying what is the pathway towards repair and being able to listen critically to them in the recommendations that they're able to offer, and so again so this work is done, I'm in layers, I, think, and so it's a lot of. It is again about us, reflecting us unlearning, a lot of things that we believe about the communities that we serve believe about some of the young people that are struggling and once we're able to unlearn that and build meaningful relationships. I really believe anything is possible, but I would not start there. If you do not have that relationship with the young person, any other questions Peter, you said you have a bunch you're, muted, now, I'll, let other people ask I, mean I've, got a lot of questions about community and trying to do this, but Tyler. Thank you. That was a good start and I'll reach out to some people in the neighborhood and see where we can go with that. A great place to start is: there's the Harlem youth court that is also available to offer restorative practices. If we find that there is not capacity within the school building, so, for example, if you're not able to identify folks who are either trained to do this work or have the right relationships to do this work, that's definitely a resource that you could reach out to help solve some of the community issues. There also credible messengers and I believe. Maybe we can provide a resource list after this call, but that's turning to people in the community who maybe do not have the credentials or the titles that were north. You know we're normally used to seeing in schools, but if actually maybe live in the neighborhoods, and some of our young people have been in their shoes and can actually come in and I've worked with them, where they help do mediations in very difficult situations, and things like that, and so again thinking of our schools like really how part of your sort of justice is. How do we break down school walls? We've created barriers where school walls kind of create, you know almost, and we can't access the community, and so the school is sitting within the community, but we're not looking within that community as members of folks who can actually better our culture within school walls. So really thinking about where your position who's there and trying to do a community assessment for capacity in people- powered. We can also share a list of which schools are part of the expansion, so that you can see whether the schools that you're Peter that you're talking about specifically but or anybody is interested in. You can see whether they're part of the expansion, and, if not, we can provide some contact information of who they can reach out to so that we can get them hooked up with training and support, even if they're not directly part of the expansion, so that the school piece can be supported as you take advantage of community- based supports as well. Thank you, yeah Lolita put a question in the in the chat, so she said. Can you provide us or share, like any statistics, on the success of the program she says in her day as an affirmative action administrator, we called it conflict resolution. You know it really worked and I guess it was, or is there any sort of statistics or thoughts in sort of terms of success of the program or any metrics that are involved other than clearly getting positive feedback? So data is always a tough conversation, especially around restorative justice, because a lot of the work is so qualitative right, and so it's changing the way we feel about one another things of that nature. So the normal data points that we might be looking for might be difficult to speak to, but, for example, to school that Emily and I worked really hard at two begin: establishing a restorative culture in one year. So at one point for the Department of Education, it was like a learning environment survey and in one year we saw a 42% increase in terms of feelings of safety. So this is a question that goes out to all community members about how deep, how safe do you feel within the school community and in just one year of implementing circles that increase by 42%? We saw in attendance in some critical areas throughout the school schedule increase you saw a teacher, turnover decrease and so I really think it's about shifting which data points that we're looking at historically around restorative justice and I, guess which of those speaks to qualitative measures within the school community. Sometimes you do not we think of this as planting the seed, and so this might be a young person that we work consistently and persistently with to be restorative, and we may not see that seed blossom. But in ten years that young person might find us on LinkedIn and think about how the way the culture that we created in that school shifted their trajectory in terms of what they were able to do with their lives and how they saw themselves. It's kind of like a someone. One of my mentors in this work describes restorative justice in schools as when we think about dieting. Sometimes we buy maybe an outfit to wear somewhere, and it's just like oh I'm going to drink this cayenne, pepper of water I'm, not eating anything, because I want to fit into this dress, and so restorative justice does not operate in that way. It's a lifestyle change, and so it's this kind of idea that yes, I, could fit into this dress two weeks from now. If I do this, but if I change the way I eat I changed the way I exercise I changed the way, I practice my self- care, it's not just for one day. This is a lifestyle change, and so we really encourage folks to approach it in that way, because sometimes, when we're looking at those data points, they might spike in the first two years, if we're looking only at restorative justice as a means to decrease suspension or decrease arrests, and so thinking about that I think is really important, especially as we think about the Stamina to do this year after year after year, you know to see most changes. It takes about three years within a school community, so we really recommend three to five years for implementation. Great I have a last sort of question and then we'll wrap it up. So my question is and I think I know the answer is: can this be you strategically? What there is conflict or between two people but they're, not part of a circle or that part of the practice? Do you ever? Would you ever engage them, or that would not be you know, because they have not been involved, but I'm just curious. If this is used in any manner or more proactively, if there's either conflict that needs resolution in a school, let's say two kids that were not in a circle that are not on a day- to- day. Part of this process. Would you is your chair? Do you ever use to engage them? Yeah? That's it! That's a great question, I think it's the question that, like everyone wants to know the answer to all the time from us, because a lot of people want a lot of schools and kind of policymakers. Often think that, like that's the entry point, that conflict has happened, we need to resolve it. We need to restore the community, and so that's where we'll start the work and then there's a lot of unlearning. That needs to happen to kind of address what we talked about today, which is that that's not really going to be particularly effective if you have not built community first and you have not built these systems and structures that allow people to lean into the experience with that said, there are lots of examples of using these practices to help address harm on even when strong community does not exist. So, for example, I know Tyler just referenced the Harlem youth court, but the Harlem Youth Court does an amazing job of training. Young people in New York City to really be practitioners in this work and engage with young people who have been brought into the criminal justice system and support them through a process where they can have an alternative to incarceration and really do some important learning, work and self- reflection work around the harm that was caused. You know who it has impacted, how they can grow from it, how they can help to address that harm with the individuals that were impacted when it's happening at that type of level, and we see examples of this in schools as well. It can only work when the people involve are willing to engage in the process in an authentic way, and so what we've often seen in schools is that, as you are growing tier one, which is that community building stage where you're teaching everyone the practices, you're building those relationships, harm will happen simultaneously. People won't be like we won't cause any harm for the next two years until we've built really strong systems and structures and community harm is going to happen simultaneously right, and so what we often see in schools is that there's kind of like a dual approach during those years, which is that for when there's moments of harm individuals that are prepared to kind of go through an authentic experience, where they're willing to take ownership, they're willing to acknowledge what has happened, what's gone wrong, they're willing to take responsibility, they're invested in trying to repair it, we will Willie support those schools in thinking about like okay. How can we do this in a really restoring meaningful way and then those individuals that are not ready for that, because that foundation is not strong enough for them? That's where we tend to use some more of the traditional discipline experiences in line with a restorative response, so we're still going to talk to you. We're still going to hear your perspective. We're still going to understand why you may have done what you did, we're still going to love you and support you through a suspension or through you know some other kind of punitive measure. We're still going to talk to you about why a decision is being made the way that it is, but we may still rely on that kind of more punitive measure, because you as an individual are not yet ready to kind of own responsibility. So it's a it's a really delicate balance and a really delicate dance and people often really want to go straight to that repairing harm piece. But you can't repair a community that you do not feel invested in you're, not going to give back or care about harming someone that you have no relationship with. So, if you think about like the people in your life that are meaningful to you, there's something really challenging happens between you and one of those individuals. You're much more invested in repairing that relationship and making it right. Then you are with someone that you do not No, and so that does not mean you might not be willing to try to make right or wrong that you did to someone. You do not know, but it's going to be much less meaningful and much less likely, and so the two things I do not know. If that answers your question. Well, that answers the questions. It answered my question and it's what I kind of thought you would say, as I listened, but I wanted to make sure that I that I fully understand. Rosa I see that you're a lady and raiser, but you are in the nick of time, so write it up for a little while I do not think you noticed I guess: I missed it. My question is because we started with breathing I just wondered if there's an aspect of meditation or mindfulness to this, and also, if they're, like a Spanish language version of this I, just wonder about bilingual students or students who primarily speak Spanish at home and may not be native English speakers. So I added a second question: I was actually only going to ask about meditation but I thought about that. Sorry, Thanks! No, those are both great Addie or Andy. Do you want to answer either of those I'm going to ask the second question? First, because we have the first person that came to mind was on somebody who's associated just like these name's Kenny, Baez, sweetest boy I've ever met in my whole life like any time, I say his name. He makes me smile, but the funny part about it is that when he first came into our space we were in circle for about. We were starting to get to know each other for about like four months, and he still did not know any of our names because he's our own ESL student or student, like he's starting to learn English, because she came from the Dominican Republic. So he's like we're in a situation where we're opening up to ourselves and he's still not getting what we're saying, but he still felt the space to still need to be there. So I feel like when it comes to situations like this. We can offer like when it came to like Kenny, for example, Kenny's able to help people that come into the space. That does not really understand English when it was somebody else there they did not know. You're saying was when he started to grow better. He started to help other people, so it's kind of like a symbiotic relationship of sorts because, like once somebody starts advancing in the process. There won't always be somebody else to pick you up and help you, so you can with us and then, when it came to the mindfulness like what the check did, the chicken just you know, allows people to see where they out with something funny or whatever, but mindfulness actually allows people around people. It's like. Sometimes that, like you, can pull your eyes and you can actually feel what you're getting into not kind of I can't really explain that really well but like it, I do not know if it really helped, but it helps you get into the space that you're in it does not really help you cloud out everything, but it helps you center yourself into what you're doing and focus your mind on the trip: yeah I'm, Miss, Kenya, I'm. Sorry, if you I know, we agree. Oh I'm, sorry, someone else could say it. I definitely agree. I've been a part of circles and again circles can take circles going to be shown on a lot of different ways. I've been a part of circles where we've meditated together for ten minutes and like that, I definitely think that it benefits the circle when my fluence is a part of, but the circles can show up in a lot of different ways, but I'm- Sean- Eddie's thing I have seen the support of a lot of bilingual students with my circle, experiences and Kenny, being one of them, where maybe students who think both lambda transpose seen a lot of patience with the rest of the people in the circle, about I'm, really trying to listen and letting them just learn along the way. Also I've seen teachers be a part of who speaks both who kind of repeat the question as the English speaking person like Mum they're, both facilitators. So when we speak in English you almost within Spanish so again, just then this space shows up in a lot of different ways. We're also really fortunate, because in the in the expansion of the 500 high schools, almost all of the international schools are part of that expansion and they sit on the team that Lachelle and I work for, and so we've had the privilege of having a lot of their young people in training with us and then give feedback to how can the trainings be adapted and how can the materials be adapted to reach a bilingual audience so not just English and Spanish, but I think a lot of the materials the actually the young people in these trainings have helped us translate them into I. Think it's the top nine, the nine commonly spoken languages in New, York City in New, York, City, public schools, so yeah there's. There has been a really intentional effort to make to adapt the training and then the materials that teachers go back into the classroom to use to make it really accessible in bilingual classrooms and in classrooms, where there are students that are ELLs. And so we've been really fortunate to work with the international schools, because we've learned a time from them and they've been using. Really smart practices and so we're trying to really spread that acrosss the 500 schools, so that it's not just in the international schools but when you're in a school, where, even if there's just one student that speaks Bengali, that this is accessible to them great well as we wrap it up, always good to leave an affirmation. Paul Fisher, one of our committee members is very impressive young people. So, let's leave on a positive note unless I want to thank you, everyone very much. It was very interesting, very enlightening fun. I do not know if why is always fun, but today it was so I see a lot of smiling faces, so it was certainly a different meeting, but a very pleasurable meeting and I'm going to hand it to Julian- just close things out, because any last words did you like to give I come on the spot. We always feel polished, I'm, glad I caught you a little off the little beard. Maybe I will leave one thing. You may get a call from Mark Killer to facilitate at a steering committee because it seemed like these practices may be best used for some sounds like we happen that big, because, when you think of safe spaces, you think of the community, oh yeah, I, guess I used to close out well, I think yeah I do not know I like a lot of a lot of the work that we do on. The community board is centered around resolution passing and on specific action items. You know approving something disapproving something and there's certainly work to be done with this in terms of approving then and not approving stuff funding is certainly a big aspect of it, but I think meetings like this are very important, and it's one of the reasons why I really love Yl committee, because it's not necessarily an incredibly tangible thing, but we're all going to walk away from this meeting with an important understanding, restorative justice and we're all involved with school committees in some way, and so whether we're taking this back to our own communities or whether months from now we're having a. Why yell discussion about the budget- and this comes up in our minds, I think I, think I think this conversation will have been really meaningful, so I'm really grateful for oh and I. Also I'm really glad that were able to incorporate youth voice in this I. One of my big goals is to get more youth voice present at Community Board. You know, 20% of the people who live in our in our district are our youth under the age of 18 and they're, not heavily represent on the Community board, and they often do not attend meetings and so I think it's really important that we involve them, especially when we're you know trying to help them, whether it's from the youth programs that we were discussing last month or in school, so anyways I'm really grateful for everyone from Yrj who came and spoke. I think this was an excellent meeting and thank you. Everyone who participated in the circle and who you asked questions. Thank you. So we have, if you guys would like to you, have you're happy to stay. We've got just probably about 15 minutes with the sort of committee meeting. So it's not as exciting as this, but we will go on feel free to drop off, but we have some a little bit of business to close out with, but thanks again full experience thanks for having us we'll jump off, but thanks so much for your time. Thank you. Everyone! Thank you guys, good night. Thank you. So we just have a couple things today. One is his new business I wanted to start out with our district needs statement and I'll hand it over to the expert mark a bit but Kenya. You know any thoughts on where we're at I know. I know where we've been staying is that you know we've got to sort of start to coordinate that and think of what we want to put on I know. We want to challenge ourselves this year, not to say that we should have rubber stamping from what's the year before, but you know, maybe this is the year with all of the other things going on with all the conversations that we may really wanna to take a you know, a strong look at what we put in we've got to start the process. We've got to start the process, maybe we're late to the process. You tell me, but if you could sort of get keep us up to date and give us some action steps I'll, certainly facilitate it. As the co- chair, great so I'll jump in with just a few things one is. The budget committee was prepared a memo to the steering committee effectively to the chairs of all committees with a few ideas, the two themes that will be useful and, I think, important with respect to DNS. The two themes would be to make sure that we're talking to folks other than just each other, it's important to talk to each other and collect the wisdom around this virtual table to be sure. But this is a particular effort this year to make sure that we reach out to whoever it is in our network that we want to engage on with respect to how the budget affects all of us. That became even more important after Covid-19, and that we want to a capture learning that Cogan taught us as it affects the work of each committee and whether that be the hard choices that had to be made when nine billion dollars worth of revenue disappeared from the from the budget and what choices we are going to have to make in order to close that gap or reassess that gap, and also when we talk about issues of equity and how it affects our community and ourselves. Covid-19 brought some issues of equity into even starker relief, even bolder relief than it had been before, and so it would be useful and important for our DNS to capture what we've learned or experienced, or perhaps experience differently this year, keeping in mind that the budget that we're talking about when we were commenting on the district's needs and the budget priorities that correspond to it, the budget that starts in effect a year from now. So it would be the fiscal year 22 budget, which goes from July of 21 to June of 22. So it's a long way off, but it's here before you know it at the same time. So those are the two so in terms of practical steps, Steven we're a little late in the process, but there are good reasons why we are the smart way to do. This would be to as a committee, and it does not have to be online right now, but before by your September meeting, to have a list of bullet points of items that you want to cover, they can be items that have been covered in the past and they can I hope include items that have been either reimagined or created anew for this year's analysis and then at least two have begun, if not to have gone a long way toward identifying and reaching out to those people outside of our circle. If I could borrowed, this evenings word to get to inform whatever it is that we're going to say in the DNS with that? With that input with that content, I hope that's useful, and can you get give us give us? You know a timeline of. When? Can you remind me of the timeline of when, as a committee, we need to have a final DNS to you, so everyone know what a tea dance is. I know, there's some New Board committee members. It's our district need statement that we do want to be yearly on a yearly basis. We put together this document, each committee kind of puts what we want. We usually pick five to ten sort of things we highlight from some I think that's right. Numerically, it's one large document, that's put together and then within steering. You know, then you take the top ten from the entire community board, but then, as a committee won't have our ten as well or 15 and correct me if I'm wrong in that part. But could can you correct me from if I spoke incorrect, but could you also give us a timeline, so I can start to think through making sure all right so timeline is that ordinarily, we asked for folks to have that what I just asked you to prepare. We asked for that to be now so we're so, but we do not always get it the October so there if I could stevan correctly. So let me affirm, as Stevens correctly put it together. If I could distinguish two aspects of it just a little more, it might be useful. There is a narrative statement of district needs. The district needs statement, which is a document that Stephen described a part of that document, is budget priorities, ways in which we call on the city budget to respond to the needs that we're assessing so there's a narrative statement that says, for example, that every school needs a social worker which is a favorite of our borough president and many other folks in the community. So the narrative statement would be that we need a social worker in every school because there are needs that are not being met by students and perhaps there's a few words. You could say about what those needs are and how a social worker would be the right tool for the job to respond to them. Then, as a budget priority, the committee could say that one of the items that we favor prioritizing in the budget is the money needed to hire that person. That would be part of the expense budget. In fact, there are two statements of budget priorities, because there is a capital budget and a an expense budget. Capital budgets are what you think they are they're big- ticket items that are infrastructure, related and expense items are virtually everything else, including people and programs that to make the assets that are in the capital budget useful to actual people, so I hope that is a useful additional clarification so useful that it appears to a frozen Stephan in his tracks. I get that a lot Steven had some issues with his internet before I'm, going to assume that he's going to be able to rectify that in a second. The last year's district need statement is on our website and it's also on the Department of City Planning x' website and just to highlight how some of that can be useful. You may remember that earlier this year, at the request of the Yl Committee, we sent a letter asking that Summer Youth Employment be re reinstituted when it first was proposed to be cut. The reason we were able to do that is as a full board. We voted on budget priorities and one of the top 10 or 20, and certainly top 10 I believe, was the preservation, if not enhancement, of summer youth employment. So we did not have to take another vote. We did not have to pass another resolution. We had already voted for it, and so we were positioned to advocate for that right off the bat okay, I'm hoping Steven will be able to rejoin us, but with Blanche. Not here, perhaps I can move us along a little bit we'll come back to the DNS Oh Julian. Thank you put the link to the DNS right there, the so anyway. So that's all I can offer on the DNS I know. Are there questions about the DNS from anybody that okay? Why do not? We continue with new business and we'll catch Steven up when he joins us, which I hope will be momentarily, but I do not want to given the hour a 25 I do not want to wait too long to keep our keep this agenda moving. So, with apologies, because I'm, not a member of the committee I'll step in to try to move the discussion, so there was a conversation at transportation on Tuesday of this week. That I believe was intended to carry over to today, since the discussion had to do with streets but with schools. So is there somebody on the call who wants to kick this off I'm, not sure where we are with that I'm looking at can enrich, who were at that meeting and Doug yeah I'll cede to Ken I just want to raise. If we want to wait for Steven to have this conversation, I have a two minute fill item that I could raise, or we could jump right into this. Okay I just heard something from Steven, so maybe he was able to phone in. Let me see on the phone Steven. Are you with us I'm trying to amuse Steven rich? Why do not you want you to hit off your my film yeah? No I was probably apply to Steven. In the meantime, yeah just really quick I saw on the West Side rag that the Bank Street bookstore, which has been a community favorite for a long time, is closing and I've been in touch with someone who's potentially interested in trying to take it over and I actually realized. As I say, this I have not gotten his permission to talk publicly so I won't mention him, but I'm wondering I. You just want to tee up. That could be something I do not know what the community board might be able to do to help, if only to publicize the effort. I just want to mention that that's out there and I think if the Bank Street book story can be saved, I'd love to see the Community board support in any way. We can thanks for that, am I correct in remembering that the Bank Street bookstore is at about a hundred and twelfth Street and Broadway, or did it move one else. I know you know, you know a hundred seventh a few years ago was going to close, and then they found another spot and it moved within our district. So it's now I think I'm the same block as Garden of Eden and absolute bagels. Thank you and you correctly anticipated my concern, which is that I did not want to step on the toes of our colleagues to the north. So this is in our district and that's fine. We want to be careful, especially if there's a competitive bid out there not to be perceived as favoring a particular bidder, given that we do not have a full board meeting in August, and this may well be decided by September and that we want to be a little bit careful about commercial bidding processes. I would think that the most that we could do is to say that I'm sorry to be so basic, but bookstores are good, and this is a particularly venerable institution that defines a part of our community culture I'd be happy to say that in some way, but let's take this offline, if we can yeah, that's all I really have I want to be creative, but still somewhat respectful, because there's often more to a story like this, then we are aware of it in the first blush. That would be a very good thing. I think having one bidder would be a we'd be lucky if there's one person who's interesting, get involved in art auctions, where there was only one bidder in an auction. I can tell you that it's not an enviable position to be in if you're a seller anyway, Steven are you with us again, yeah and I? Think I'm about to get back in on the video, so I'm, going to mute myself on the phone, I think I'm going to join you right back I'm having obviously internet issues hold on one Sec take time. Thank you all for hanging in there now, no fair having cute kids join the party. Hey Stevens, back Steven I. Think you need to unmute yourself. I tried to unmute you Here I! Am there you go hey new business. Can do you want to hit this one? Okay, yeah, we're at transportation. Was that Tuesday we talked about a concept called school streets, which is a something that has been proposed by, among others, the National Association of City transportation officials, which is sort of the national body of Transportation officials, and the idea is to sort of in response to the pandemic sort of a corollary to open streets to expand the boundaries, the traditional boundaries of the school to the sidewalk and sometimes to the street, to both increase classroom space to include increased safe space for students, recreation opportunities that is, of course, all out of doors, which is kind of the idea these days so on. The call is Lisa Ormond with Street Opia, Upper, West, Side and there's a lot more about this than I do and may actually have a visual floors too great, hey, guys, I'm, not sure I, know much more than all of you know, but I did include the knack toe guide to this and there are a lot of other guides that are sort of emerging, along with articles etc. I think you know from the previous discussion with you know the fabulous teenagers on earlier. It just shows how much I think kids need to be together. Students need to be together and if we can provide more space for them to be together, more can be together at the same time, which is good for everyone. I think so, as Ken said, just with you know open streets for restaurants. This is this very similar concept. They can use open streets that are adjacent to the school, either the street or the sidewalk. They can use them for hand- washing for drop- off pickup. It sort of depends on what the school needs, but it is something that I wanted to just take the temperature of CB7 on, because I do not want to push it if you guys are not going to get behind it. So it's something I thought was worth discussing and you know: Gale Brewer is very interested in it as a concept. I'm, not sure how other you know, City Council members feel about it or how the do II feels about it and I know they are in just a logistics, probably a nightmare. At this point figuring out. You know when schools, how schools are going to start and requiring you know fit the various information that Julian told us about that. You know they need that in very short order. So I do not know if the do- e and the D- O- T are talking about this, but I think you know we need to be pretty creative and flexible, and we have this amazing space around every single school. So just thought that we could kick off a conversation on you know if this is something that people would be interested in. I do know that Saraland contacted some parents in district, 3 and I. Think Julian might have a statement from one of those groups in support of this, but there are a lot of groups emerging in support of this concept and sort of the outdoor classroom concept as well, so I'll leave it at that. Well, I can give my first thoughts and then I'm happy for anybody or the committee members, but I'm, certainly open to it. I mean I. Think it's a it's a it's a it's a challenge and you know I particularly know that some schools have spaces next to them, or sometimes there's an open area, but unfortunately I've seen some that have literally nothing. So you know the idea of how do you come out of school and maybe you know in a safe place coming in the fall, how do kids maybe spend a little time with other people? A lot of parents speak as well. I know I used to pick up my kid. You know my that's. How I met all the parents that hang outside too, like a half hour jet, so with just my first blushes as I'm, certainly open to, and it seems like something on paper. I do not know all the negatives I do not know all the positives, but I personally as an individual would be interested in me and continuing the conversation. Is there anybody on the committee who wants to speak? They could just raise her hand. I could see most of the people. Anybody else want to add any thoughts. Julian I do not have a particular thoughts at this moment. I. Just Sara reached out to me before the meeting because she knew she would not be able to make it and she shared a written comment that was submitted by the d3 Green Schools Committee, and it's fairly long. So I do not want to read it out because I'll take a bunch of time, but I think I'm going to send it to everyone's email and it basically talks about how they support, having the use of school streets of streets in front of schools for either classes or entering the school. So I'll send that deference email. Well, you just said something Julian that I would add, and that is if having classes outside helped. You know from my understanding what I saw of the schools. You know, there's they've assessed and have certain schools that can have 50% of the people either have 33%, but I also heard the Chancellor say that they're looking for spaces and if blocking of taking that space, helps the schools, particularly for kids, that want to go to school and I. Have a son and I want him to be able to go I'd be very I mean not that I would not be in favor the other, but that's actually a very interesting concept and one that I would be incredibly in favor of. If somehow it adds to the value of the education of the kids, particularly in terms of kids, that want to be able to go to school, but clearly in a safe way. So I like that idea as well Peter I, see your hand raised. Hi I was hoping that this might be expanded to the daycares. We have a number of daycares up here and they could definitely be improved by having access to larger spaces for their for their kids. So I was hoping that they would be able to be included. Also pretty good point. Anyone else want to jump in I will Babs got something to say. Then rich I saw you pop in which a wonderful picture I've seen for many years, I liked your Facebook one, better rich I've, seen that one but Europe yeah I, think it's a fascinating concept. I do worry about what this looks. Like in January, as opposed to September and for a school to sort of organize outdoor classes in a very changeable climate becomes really quite difficult, so I think there's a lot of work. That would need to be done to figure out how to make this sort of feasible in New York, but it obviously is very compelling, as a way of beginning to find space for students to spread out. That's all and I would agree to do be a lot of details and you know whether it be a nine-, to-, five thing or a couple hours at a clip. You know all things to be discussed and clearly January's much more problematic in September and agree rich yep and as far as my profile picture, it's funny because I never see it. You had quite a quaver hair and if you were, you know, you're nice energy to the pictures. So maybe I'll share it. You know so when we talked about this Tuesday I think two main areas of concern were raised and off the bat I think I was only raised and I love. The idea I think one is just what the logistics are and how it works, especially when schools need to have their plans together by August and I'm really unclear. Also, you know I mentioned that. Maybe they could do education outside since they're, going to be using gymnasiums for classrooms, but with the hybrid model and with students only going in part time, they're not going to have phys ed at all. I. Think, there's like with the rapidly evolving question of what school will look like this year, there's a question of how the open streets can be made use of and that's something we do not really know, because the actual status of schools is still somewhat up in the air. This is the question of just what it is and how it works, and then there's also the question of timing for the community board to get involved, because even if we're to pass a at a new business resolution right now, we would not be able to vote on it as a full board until September. So I think the questions are, what action might we take tonight? Do we pass a resolution that we would do as a full board in September just to get things rolling, thinking more long- term about what this might be and word cannon? Might we take some other action apart from a resolution that would not get voted on for another close to two months and also whether it is a resolution or whether it is just some other action? What might that be? And do we want to be just general saying that we support the idea or do we want to be really specific about what it is and what we want it to look like I, get to feedback first and then open it up and just specifically at one of the areas. I think it could be interesting is if you're still going to have a drop- off and a pickup, and the concern is you're going to have a lot of people coming in unless they're going to stagger. Oh, maybe there's a way to use that to create safe spots was the thing that jumped in my mind, right away, but again a lot of details and because there's a lot of details, I mean I would be reticent to do a resolution out of yl because of that I'm a as mark knows, kind of a stickler for process and rich mean you've talked a little bit as well I like to get a lot of community feedback. I understand we're in a time where we need to act quickly and sometimes and I do not know how to resolve that today. I would not be comfortable doing a resolution today on it if there was, if there's other ideas or another way, to get this forward or way to explore it. But that would just be my quick thing if everyone in the on the committee over- over vote voted me and wanted to do this. I would I would be certainly open to it. But I know that you know there's a lot of conversations and we know there's a lot of people. That'll have opinions above beyond what we're talking about. I'd be a little resin from that to do a resolution today, Seema I see your ring hand raised I, mean so I'm. A big fan of this idea. I think space is clearly the biggest issue facing our schools right now in terms of social distancing and creating a safe space for teachers and for students, as well as all the administrators and staff in these buildings. I guess. My question is: what are the downsides of this? Potentially, even if you know it's a different kind of learning that happens, five I can understand, there's some safety issues and obviously the weather but I'm curious about what people might have checked you about this I'm. Having worked fairly closely with a lot of our school administrations. One of the problems is, you need additional staff. You need additional security. These are issues that are difficult because you've got to be able to keep those areas control than when you have public running through a street. That's closed your ability to use it for that much is very difficult. Obviously, some schools, for example, like PS and 87, had some experience with this in recent years, where their playground was closed for period and they use the street. But as a play area- and it's I mean it's a great idea, but it's really a hard thing for people for the schools to actually work so I think we're present. We could present this to a school, but it may be a gift. That's not necessarily taken and I just want to point that out. Teachers may not want to be outside. Students may not want to be outside a lot of schools. The outside is just actually quite noisy, so I think we have to off. We can offer it as something, but do not be particularly surprised if it does not really do what for most schools what it what they needed to do, I mean if I were to be. If you're asking me to be Devil's advocate and again I like the idea. I'll give you an example: my son went to school on 49th Street middle school between 9th and 10th. It was a major through wait to get to the Lincoln Tunnel. So I can tell you that a ton of the community would have a huge problem now, whether that's right or wrong is another conversation. But I can tell you that was a major road that would cause particularly if it was closed up in the you know, nine hours a day or with school days it would be, it would be closed for a while. So again, I'm just you asked for some thoughts at all and I mean it's the historic PS nine, which is now Mickey Mantle for years used so I, remember 83Rd Street as their playground and it would get closed off every day and I. Remember as a kid, because it has a slope, the balls would run down the street towards West End, so they had a board acrosss it to catch the balls. It's an idea. You know we, when you sit through PTA meetings or PA means there's a huge conversation about school security, and this is a huge breach in school security, and it's at a time when one does not really know what school security is going to look like as it reforms itself and as budgets get cut and I'm going to jump back to another conversation where Mark was talking about the city budget as what we were doing for the district needs, we're going to have less money this year would have less money the year after that's just the way it goes so I I'm, not it's a great idea to close a block down, and that does not bother me. We cook for kids coming and going through school, but I do not think in a lot of cases. It actually provides any more space to the school and it and it strains the school's resources and if somebody wants to make use of it, for what they've got. That's great I see. We have Kim Watkins here, because I wanted to welcome management systems. I think this is your third or fourth meeting of the evening. So thank you for joining us at all and I thought, since you were foolish enough to reach out to me during this meeting to say, should I join, of course I'm going to say yes, but we're talking, you probably picked up the threat, but we're talking about a new business item having to do with whether or not it would make sense and if so, how to try to make streets and public way available to schools for their use in the coming year. Given all of the challenges that schools are facing, so just a welcome and when you're ready to jump in Steven is chairing this meeting. I just wanted to give my personal thanks for your for your joining us we're you do not need to hear anything from me Kim. How are you I love? Your hat, I'm not sure did have you heard? Have you heard the conversations that's been going on sorry, I did undid my video instead of my unmuting I was hearing a little bit of it. I was a texted mark because I remembered that this meeting was going on and someone in the other that I'm also on right now, which is the D3 Green Committee, and the sole purpose of that meeting tonight is to talk about outdoor space learning and in the chat someone mentioned that you know. Is our community boards talking about it and then I clicked that oh, my gosh there's another meeting I'm supposed to be in right now, so let me see if I can do both meetings at the same time, so I heard I'm talking about some of the historical which I think is really interesting precedent and certainly relevant to where we're going with all of these conversations right, so it earlier tonight at 6:30, the Chancellor had a town hall, and he was talking a little bit about. You know that sort of the moving target that we're all experiencing right now. It was, of course, we're having the district this EC meeting next week when we're going to be reviewing a lot of these reopening plans and talking from a district perspective district perspective. You know kind of where d3 sits within the construct of all of the moving parts and the risks associated with trying to open schools partially and what that really means in terms of the experience that our children will have in September with you know, with smaller rooms, which is a good thing from an educational perspective, but many restrictions on their experience on the day to day basis. You know no recess of any real sword or, if limited recess limited time together, and you know there won't be launched in a lunchroom. There won't be you know, kind of activities, sort of the fun parts of school will really be kind of limited, because the safety concerns will force a lot of unusual parameters for moving about a building, and you know what that all means in terms of the in person. Blended, learning relative to the you know the many variables of remote learning which we're all already relatively come from, not comfortable with, but we've all gotten a sense of, and certainly you're still not real happy with. So the district Tree Green Committee has been working with a number of different national groups that have been trying to tease out some ideas around structured learning. So, unlike what I think is maybe a little bit sort of scary, because it's unusual too many parents kind of the idea that we would do anything outside and that it would be anything more than just sort of kids running around in a playground. But there is a whole paradigm, a whole sort of pedagogy, really sort of circled around the idea of using nature as part of a classroom. Now that certainly really kind of gets more into younger grades, you know into our elementary school grades and not into middle and high school grades. So there is a lot to still discuss, but I think it was in district, one school district, one where the Assemblymember and a couple of principals and the superintendent are actively looking at street closures as part of their process. So I do think that it's worth you know having a conversation about what might be available, despite the fact that uptown Manhattan tends to probably be a little more car sort of friendly than that maybe downtown district. One also has a lot of schools that were built without any school yard. A lot of our schools have school yards that are actually within the perimeter of what the deal week, controls and so I think we can reprogram those and still have control of the school perimeter, which I think is you know there are some schools that we can't do that, for example, to 165 building as a very limited area, but 166,87 9a, four, so forth and so forth. Simply can we can really look at how we can program what we already control and that can make a big difference. There's some that there are some schools that Mickey Mantle obviously demands on its own problems and it's not a d3 school, so I think it's and then the other problem is we're going to have less staff. There's just no way about that. Okay, so Kim. If you could stay, I want to kind of close this up, but I've got a couple interesting questions for you, but check wrap. This up I mean ten Lisa in rich, again, I'm, somewhat supportive and open to the idea. If that was the original inclination, I am looking in the chat. I do not think that a resolution is something that we can do right now or particularly I have not spoken to my co-, chair and I. Do not even know we have or many more on here, but I will I know mark if there, if you have you know, you're the logistics guy. You know there's a way or you have something to think this through to make a statement, I'm, certainly open to say, we'd have to vote that were open to the idea, but I do not think a resolution would be the way to do it and I'll hand it to you for ideas. Why do not? Why do not we hear the final comments of your colleagues on the committee? First I've got a thought or two, but maybe they'll spark something else. So if that works for you just wrap this up with the final comments and then I'll try to put that together into some useful form. Any other committee members want to speak about this I'm looking in their hand, race or the physical rain. So unless I'm wrong, I think I, think that is it so we got Peter. You got Peter, oh I'm, sorry Peter! You, my little white thing was in front of your head, so I'm, not a committee member of Stephen, so I'm just wanted to say your shirt have said nine committees either way. I want to know your opinion anyway. That was so good D- O- T is in the credible flux. They are not functioning on all cylinders right now or something I they're dealing with a lot and I think that anything that came from you recommending that they look into. This could be useful they're. You know they're trying to make things work, but they are under challenging circumstances so that anything that could come from the community or the community board would be positive. Okay, so can I see your hand. Let you see if Mark has ideas and I'll, let you enrich speak before we wrap up the topic, ideas- great. So to answer Stevens point: generally speaking, we write advocacy letters. What based on resolutions that the full board has adopted. We do not have that here in a granular sense. There is a general sense that we've already adopted with respect to the restaurants using outdoor space creatively, and we could, in a very general sense, ask a question about whether or not there were ways in which schools could be given the option to request the use of outdoor space. We would not be in a position to say PS 163. It ought to use the parking lot and PS 166. It ought to be the playground next door and PS 87. It ought to be its playground, plus the street or whatever it might be. We're not we're nowhere near able to do that, but I think. Given our board's general position, it would be fair to say that we should not overlook any opportunity that a school thinks makes sense. One of the things that I learned from predecessors when I was a PTA president was that we do well as Outsiders to support initiatives that come from within a school and less well, when we try to tell the school how to create those initiatives so to the so I would not want to impose this on a school, but rather encourage others to ask schools. What do you think? What could you use? That's, what I think we could do and I'll be happy to try to help write a letter that made sense. We have to be quite sensitive because there is not a full board vote on anything granular here. That's the best. I can offer and I welcome with your thoughts. I mean I would be open to that just and support that I do not know and enrich that works for you. If there's other things you want to add, should I go yeah well, just in terms of the process. I think we have to recognize what an extraordinary times. So maybe some process would fall by the wayside just out of necessity, but I would love. I was hoping that this committee and we actually came close to this at transportation, but then decided this was more your committee's purview. Well, I would love to see this committee supportive resolution simply asking the city do e and do T to explore the concept of school streets or, however, we want to define it and I do not think that's really an endorsement of it and we're certainly not dictating particulars they're, saying you're going to have classrooms outside or, and we can even say we recognize security issues which have been brought up. Another option failing. That is that we have a steering committee meeting next week and the steering could pass a resolution. I think a resolution by either, and this is what we set at transportation. A resolution even by a committee, carries a fair amount of weight, even without the full board, and so a resolution from Ye health would carry a fair amount of weight, and certainly a resolution from steering would- and this would all come down before the beginning of August. So that's what I would suggest and proposed, which did you want to add something yeah see. Most of what Ken said, what I would add is I do agree with Mark I think sending out a letter that we could say loosely. We should do anyway, but I also think we should do a resolution as we can, which would be the September poll board, which would mean either doing it tonight or it's tearing. So the reason that I'd hate to let process keep us from having a voice in the issue and if we do not weigh in time will pass, and it means that we just won't be involved in the decision when I think that a lot of us feel pretty strongly that this is a good idea addressing IRAs concerns and Mark largely addressed it. I definitely do not think we should be prescriptive in any way. We should not be telling the school's what to do. There are any number of schools that have their own facilities or that do not have staff or I'm sure there are a million other things. We're not thinking about so I think we just want to make it a very general statement that do we and D- O- T should work together to make it an option when the school wants it to happen, but I do think that if we can pass a resolution, it just gives us that much more weight on the issue and it keeps it from passing by, as Kim mentioned, you know, conversations are happening. This is something that's happening in the community in the city. We should have a voice on it. A number of us do feel like it is something we do want to weigh in on and if we do not do it now, it means it's going to pass by without us having a voice or see me. Did you want an Icee your hands up. Do not answer. Yeah I completely agree with what rich said and a lot of what's been said. I think we have. You know all of these plans, be it for all of the public schools. The private schools in our neighborhood are all being drafted within the next two to four weeks. So I think it's a really crucial sort of moment that our input could actually come in handy I. Think weighing in September is it's. Obviously our word is still important, but I think it won't be as critical as it would be right now. Did you want to say something about this? Is this is related, although admittedly slightly off- topic, but today at Borough, Board and mark? Perhaps you can refresh my memory? Was it been Kayla? Someone was talking about? Perhaps it was Gail discussing the do- e taking over some of the vacant Archdiocese buildings, as well as a concept of taking over or repurposing vacant storefronts for the landlord's. That would be willing to do that etcetera. Did this may help to contribute to the solution here? Although I know this is not a do, T specific mark, do you remember it was been kalos. It was. This is not the time for me to offer an evaluation of that proposal, other than to say that it embraced none of the none of the specifics. That would come immediately after that sentence that IRA was categorizing about the availability of any kind of resource to make use of those additional spaces. It's one thing to talk about an existing faculty and an existing set of school aides to expand the ambit of their purview of their supervision. I'm. Sorry to include a space immediately adjacent to the school, it's quite another to staff, an entire new building and in an era in which funding is being cut, I do not know how you do that so anyway, it was been Kalos and not Gail. Who made that offer in that suggestion? Ira wait a Sec okay Ken did you want to add something? I was just going to offer one thing, two things actually, because I think that, with respect to storefronts and well, obviously they're the vacant actual school buildings right, which are already structured and set up as schools, which you guys just were talking about. The one thing that's kind of curious about how that would roll out really does center around the sources and the practicality of districts that have. You know the adapt this to sort of fan out into the community and figure out what those options are right. A mandate from the central DME and or the mayor's office to say every school go, find a an empty building is kind of ridiculous thing to say it is to a very practical thing for us, as a community, to tap into the available resources that we have on the ground and so I think it's still a really important conversation for the board for the district in terms of CEC, three and district three to continue to have, and then the other thing that I just wanted to mention as well is that I won't get into any of the stuff that you do in terms of your process. But the one thing that's also really interesting about this conversation is the long- term effect of talking about outdoor space in terms of learning, particularly for our young kids. We know that we keep our kids inside far too many hours during the day in the school year. So hopefully there will be long- term applications for all of the really crazy work that we're doing right now. Yeah I just want we're getting a little bit late here and I want to sort of close. This topic down and say again, I think I'm, very supportive of it, but I'm, but I would not be prepared to do a resolution for the points that I had said. I would be supportive if and B, if I could be part of the bringing it up at steering I'm comfortable with that I think it's really important that we notice this mark a little bit. This is a pretty. We got to give a little notice to people that would come, I'd be supportive that steering and be participating and if somehow it came through I yelled, a steering, I'm. Okay with that, but I just feel like for the reasons I said from a notice perspective from I mean half the committee is not even here at this point on the call, so I am comfortable putting out a letter the letter, if the letters from Y yell there, the community board I'm fine with that as well, but I think that's how I would feel about it, and you know if we can move on I mean that that's what I would that's, how I feel about very good. So let me do this. Let me let me suggest this I'm happy to make this an agenda item on steering next Tuesday I will publish that agenda tomorrow morning. I will look to both the Transportation Committee and the Yl Committee to be leaders of that discussion. It will not necessarily, even though, on theoretically the chair of the steering committee, it will not necessarily be my initiative so and I think that what should come out of that is a one of three things: either a letter or a resolution for September, perhaps both or that we decide that this issue is not ours to handle in an effective way. But that's what I would propose be the options considered and I would ask Ken enrich and I'll loop back to Andrew and Howard I all undertake to do that tonight about this and then Stephen, if you would coordinate with Blanche just to catch her up, so that those two committees will have that opportunity to revisit this. A letter to a letter tomorrow versus a letter. Next Wednesday is not that big, a difference in terms of the timing year if it ends up being a letter and if it's a resolution plus a letter, we will have time to do that too. That's the best I can think of right now. Okay! Well, hopefully, then that's a sort of a compromise that works for everyone yeah. It sounds good Frank, Kim I had a question for you and I see your hands up. I read, but my internet keeps going down so I want to get my I'll make sure you wanted is to get your thoughts, particularly it one of the topics that the night that I have been trying to sort of get some feedback on, but I feel strongly bound and I did not know. If there's any developments, then we belong. Hence it's my understanding that there's conversations that must give us some talking points online, Ken, you're, still online buddy, so there thank you mandated online teaching. You know where do we stand with that topic? I know that my son, you know, is moving into a traditional public school. He was out of charter. He was online 9:00 to 4:00, I mean they were mandated and it was very high. Quality I actually was able to sit on it. When I asked my son, are you learning? He said? I really am learning. So where were we at with that and I hear the Union saying quote: unquote, you know it's not it's not needed, or none of them have to do that. So can just give me some thoughts on that and walk me off the ledger. If you can do that, I can't walk. You keep walking just keep walking you're on the ledge. Just continue on your ledge, because that'd be oh I just and I took off yeah the there has been no standards set for the specifics of platforms to you to be used and, or you know, mandated synchronous learning relative to you know. Unsynchronized I think what the DoD is still trying to ascertain is what the breakdown is between parents, who have already expressed interest in full- time, remote learning versus parents that are, they have a survey going right now right where you can sort of express your interest sort of very unscientific. It seems to me that it's going in this- and this is the way they're conducting this survey, but it's would you be interested in you know a blended learning, you know scenario or IRA. Let Kim speak please. So that's kind of the science that they're using so far to I think try to calculate which, how many teachers are going to be. You know needed for four buildings relative to two teachers. Obviously, that will be needed to specifically focus on remote learning, but I'm with you, Steven I do not know, but to clarify, in other words, hypothetically there's. There does not have to be any live. You know remote learning I mean all can be here's some work and go. Do it? Is that correct? Or am I incorrect in saying that was what was correct in the spring? There was so much upheaval over the cut. You know that the variations on remote learning that took place in you know within the structure of the deal week. One would hope this will be a question for us. Our CEC meeting is next Thursday, so it will be a topic, a hot topic for our group as well, that there will be a standard, for you know individual at least individual grades, and some sort of you know, parameters that can help. Parents understand what it is that their children need to be doing, and when it's ridiculous that we did not have that. Oh I'm, sorry, Thursday I thought was Wednesday. I thought it was there I'm sorry hold on I'm famous for not knowing what I'm doing until literally right and right on top of when I actually get there. So let me just confirm in a second I: do not want to show up the wrong night yeah right now, they're sort of say you know it's part of their main, their making sure that there is some live learning in the summer school, but there's still no guarantee or any direct feedback that a high school or anyone has to do might learn. There was actually no summer school, except for special ed, but that's another story, and that was yeah. Okay, yeah! No, that's correct! Even as soon as we have, we will get it to you, I, you know, I think there is no there's minimum to if you're working if you're at the kids at school, you know he's going to have a minimum of three hours or to our online a live instruction. There is nothing that is not being confirmed yet correct. That's right, IRA, two things, two things just so everybody appreciates I have a book. Next to me, I was watching the other meeting. On that meantime, I got three kids I'm, having conversations with my wife as to what our options are and I'm in this meeting this evening. Okay, so if people wondered why my eyes were going to the ceiling, all the time is I was moving between us. I just want to go back and talk about our City Council's members not are, but one of the City Council members of judges in this district. We actually do have two archdiocese schools that are closely contiguous to schools that we have. We have one in 163 and we have it once one at 166. So that's a possibility. Both of them have been used as schools within the last few years, so that is a realistic possibility. The idea of retail space Peter being turned into schools is, and trust me I've, been designing. Schools and education to sell is for most last 40 years in the in the quantities that it exists in district 3 or in CB7. It is a fiction. The Department of Education has created new schools from scratch in other parts of the city in a three to six month: construction period in commercial spaces, but that's those are big spaces they're, not 5,000 or 10,000 square feet that they're working with, and that goes back to my comment and Mark's comment. Is you have to staff these critters, and that does not happen so quickly, particularly when you have no money for the staff you've got so I just want to make sure we do not spend a lot of time pushing that one down the road. There was another member of the CEC on a meeting that I was on a few weeks ago that propose getting temporary classrooms into schools and I had to explain that the idea of getting a half- million seats in three months is not practical. It's not possible. There is not the there is not a space. We're kind of in a in a tough situation and I just want to make sure that we do not spend too much time talking about the idea of Turgut. Turning to Duane Reade into a classroom, it does not. It is not big enough. It does not provide lot life safety in the public welfare, it's actually dangerous to the students. Okay, they can I just want to get that author to have this conversation in steering next week. So you can sort of add that as well, meaning that we'll have more dialogue about this topic and okay, but I, just I just want to make sure that people understand same thing for like yeah I get. Why do not I go to half- a- million temporary seats, understood well, I want to be respectful. The time we've had a lengthy one, but a good one. If anybody has anything else to say I'm going to thank Kim for coming and please keep me abreast, I'm very concerned about what's going to happen. I want to then thank Julien as well for putting this together in Courtney for creaking copious notes and I would encourage, particularly all the committee members you know, show up to steering. Sometimes we do sometimes we do not I. Think we'll have this conversation. You know what I meant to say to every and if I did not mean to speak to people I'm open to this conversation, I'm not necessarily sold on it or not sold on it, I'm open to it so I'm going to educate myself, but it would not be great. I'll send something out to all the committee members, but if it's coming as a yl conversation, I would love the committee members to be there facilitate I, know: IRA will cuz he's, got three phones and he'll be able to get it. Sorry only two yeah well I'll mail, you, the third, but the thank you mark is a way to compute at two computers all right. Well, then, you all had Isaac all like this and Peter. Thank you for coming you're, going to be number seven for the rest of my life. It's going to be the Seinfeld number, seven baby. All right, I'll see you! Thank you. Everybody Tuesday.
