There are in order to meet our responsibilities to city agencies and various other things that community boards are required to do.
We are aware that folks are here in part because they are concerned about things that are happening in our community and there is a public session at the end of this meeting.
The role of the community board is one of an advisory body that weighs in on a variety of matters ranging from applications to city government, to issues of concern with respect to I know.
There were 1389 people at the highest point on zoom We gave that precisely to we gave over an entire evening to that one issue in recognition of how important it is to so many members of the community.
The focus needs to be on representatives at this point, and I know that there are a lot of well-formed groups, and so we will do our best to continue to reach out to them and to hear from them a last thing that I want to make sure that I mentioned before.
I start turning it over to the business session and potentially to captain zuber if he is with us, because I know that the NYPD has limited time to speak with us, given all that's going, on.
If I could ask christian and rich to look for captains, uber While there's a lot of discussion about homelessness, both street homeless and shelter.
Everybody seems to be talking about the homeless issue, specifically about the shelters going back a couple weeks: now.
How have the people who have recently been placed into Lucerne the belclair, the beltnord, been affecting the quality of life and there's a perception that there is an increase in drug use, increase in public lewdness, a lot of issues that were not present.
The people who are out buying drugs are most likely committing other crimes throughout the day, they're going into the store, they're, stealing a couple of things, so they can sell it for a few dollars on the street so that they can get enough money to buy their drugs throughout the day.
So we have was it 42 to 0 to 1-0 on both thank you, bci we're moving on to the preservation committee The attention that I counted was andrew, who correctly said he was actually voting in favor.
So they've come, like I said: they've, come several times to the community board since 2000 for a separate, app window, applications.
And, then richard ash wanted to say something just quickly to follow up on jay's comment: Nobody living on central park west would voluntarily install a 16 window, and what that will mean is that nobody will change their windows.
I, don't like to think of it as solely a bike lane resolution 72nd, street.
There are very good and plentiful north-south bike lanes central park west now columbus amsterdam, but there really isn't a good east west route and we thought 72nd street, given its width and given how underutilized it is, would be a perfect place to put in something different.
And then my second question: is: I know that you want D.O.T to use their engineering and creativity, but are you thinking like what was The committee thinking in terms of where the bike lane would go when there's bus, stops?
You so much, I'm glad to hear that what I want to focus on just for a moment as we continue as we will over some months, probably to see what comes out of this is the issue of how you get to the greenway, because, unlike other dedicated cycle lanes, this one to get from central park to get to the greenway in riverside park, one way or another has to get through riverside park, which is, as we know, a very heavily used park by many pedestrians and others.
How do you is a safe way for everybody to get to the greenway But I just want to explain something: the phase 5 of riverside park, which is supposedly opening imminently, but still waiting for some con ed work, we'll have a fabulous feature at 66th street, which is a dedicated bike ramp from riverside boulevard that will go down to the greenway.
Saying this now, because I think when people think about a bike lane that terminates at riverside park, they have to have at least some understanding about what happens.
That's the background that I wanted people to understand, even though I I'm glad that you've confirmed we're not asking for the bike lane Thanks for letting me speak, howard, I'm, going to speak for 30, seconds, and I think it may save time in the long run.
So I'm concerned that what seemed like- maybe a good investment of 1.7 billion dollars to provide 250 miles of protected bike lanes before the pandemic and before the city's tax base fell.
The bus pulls over directly to the curb and the bicyclists are in danger on central park west, because the bus is pulling into the curb- And I, don't know where they're supposed to go so to have that same model used on 72nd, street.
A, complete street approach, looks at the best way for the bus to move whether it's bus lanes bike, lanes, pedestrians, vehicles, parking.
Think susan's comment made a lot of sense, as is this the priority right now, and it may be because there's so many people who are trying to walk now to work or trying to take the bus or trying to take them a bike instead of the subway.
I. Just have an observation with respect in response to clary's question and you've said it a couple of times that this is not a resolution for a physically protected crosstown bike.
So I would not expect people going the wrong way to be an issue or what we're asking for is a proposal for a two-way bike lane and the D.O.T is not going to spend money that they don't have, but we are living in a time when bicycling is exploding.
So howard louisa had her hand up and then clary already spoke, but you may want to call on her again: It's your call whether community board members get to speak twice or how to go from there?
I would earnestly suggest that the resolution be simplified or that we vote on it with the following addition, whether we say proposal or not, but say that we asked D.O.T to launch a proposal to investigate the need and the design of a bike lane add to it.
So we wanted to ask for something that was deemed important and was very specific, all right, guys understood, but I think that we can Steve people know I, have concerns about over enforcement of bikes, but two essential areas that need to be enforced are cycling, the wrong way and cycling on streets.
This is a more important issue because of Covid-19, as ken says, there are many more people biking, including school children.
I, don't think cost should be as much of a concern as just making sure that these agenda items are like actually capitalized upon in our on people's minds.
Yet the buses do not ride efficiently across town, and then you assume that they're going to spend money intelligently, And. Yet we don't see that so it's actually this committee's responsibility to come up with a resolution that works not to defer to say we want an opinion, but at the end of the day we want a protected bike lane so give it to us And we're going to excuse how you spend your money, how the buses run and the safety issues involved.
It's been a shame that it's been slow, but if community groups like this can make the point, the city, I think, will hear them.
District fully supports this resolution, asking for a plan for a protected bike playing along 72nd street and an overall safe for 72nd street.
I'm lisa orman, director of streettopia upper west side, as people have said, we're in the midst of a bike boom, bike stores have sold out even with no school in session, and many people working from home city bike rides are at all.
Kids are learning to bike, and I know of many who have purchased bikes in the hopes of riding to school, including my 12 year old And, there's, currently not one way to safely cross the upper west side in a protected.
72Nd street was the most popular crosstown street where people wanted a protected bike.
Lane returns 24 in healthcare savings pollution and traffic bike, lanes, bring business as nicole, just said, tourists and a neighborhood want where people want to live.
It may not be perfect, but I think it is shameful that on the upper west side we do not have a protected crosstown bike lane.
Is gail brewer when she was a member of the city council, did us park users and were all park users an enormous service back about 10 years ago, by getting an amendment of the city council to the new york city, clean air act that prohibited smoking in parks in order to get the votes of some of her co-council members.
Please just get to your resolution What the resolution does is it asks the city council to pass to pass an amendment to the clean air act that would eliminate the exceptions to the no smoking law in parks , I'd like to call on janus, horowitz and and two other members of the of the vaginas first to other members of the public and then, of course, we'll hear from the from board members dennis.
Anybody who wants to enjoy that part of the park is being exposed for long stretches of time to people without masked masks.
Okay is posing a greater risk to the neighborhood, and I really want to make an important point and has become a kind of de facto designated smoking area.
I'm, going to just turn to other people who want to speak.
I, just want to say one thing: We know that mark levine, council member mark levine who's, had, I, believe, head of the health committee and in the council, is already interested in introducing legislation that we've of the type that we've asked for.
One is increased sort of conflict between you know local residents, people telling people they're not allowed to smoke, you know, arguments etc, and the second thing is a reluctance to send you know people into contact with the police in ways that could be detrimental to them in their lives depending on who they are and what their situation is.
We talked about at the committee meeting enforcement is always an issue but having a uniform rule of no smoking in parks period, as combined with another thing, we're asking for which is better signage.
Yes, we did have a separate vote because a couple of committee members did not want the part of the resolution that asked to have- It's not regarded in the park not with regard to marijuana, use or brownies or anywhere else or in your house, or on the streets.
But the majority of committee members wanted that in So it is part of the proposed resolution which makes it very simple.
Also, I kind of wonder if this resolution is meant to you know, point to the homeless men smoking in the medium that everyone, like hate, that that's happening right now, and it makes me a little suspicious of the timing of this resolution.
And, you know I think we don't need more enforcement by the police on the marijuana piece and just in general, I won't be voting for those.
Think a resolution that impacts so many residential buildings on the west side of central park.
Think what may happen is the people who currently sit on the perimeter to have a smoke may go across the street in front of the buildings on central park west to have their cigarette They're not going to not smoke on central park west, because you've decided that they can't smoke on the perimeter.
It concerns me that a resolution that's going to impact both the residential and park side of the street is not getting a proper airing.
She told us that when she proposed this legislation to amend the clean air act to include not smoking and prophetic, prohibiting smoking in parks that, in order to get it passed back, 10 years, ago, or so with some of her other colleagues, she needed to make some compromises at that time, based upon what people were thinking at that time.
We don't want our kids walking around watching people smoke marijuana in our parks and well.
Let me just leave it at that very strongly as as written in the committee, and so I urge people to vote against ken's amendment.
My, my apologies for moving everybody fast tonight, but we've got a lot of people in our in our waiting room who want to speak for themselves and I promise them at least an hour Oh hey, senator jackson!
We have and sent and asked for absentee ballots, 35 000 from the borough of Manhattan, and each one of them is going to get a letter in their temporary residence, reminding them that they live in new york city in Manhattan, and they need to use that address.
I've been following your community board from the beginning, and obviously you have a lot going on, but I wanted to say that I stood with brad holman yesterday and activists about the u.s postal service in respect to the lock boxes that we're trying to get all over the state.
Hopefully it'll pass, and then we will and the resolution calls for an electronic means using something called a google form, and I will promise to learn more about it between now and then use a google form that will allow you to vote in real time, because the open meetings law still applies to us.
I will do so again, but let's just remind people that if you want to speak in the public session which is coming up now, you need to fill out the form you need to go to chat and click on the link which is bit DOT.
So I'm, going to start with a couple of folks that I know that most folks here are here to talk about safety, street homelessness, the shelter homeless and a few other things.
We set the time that everybody is allowed to speak, and I will respectfully remind them same as when we were doing public speakers where it's a minute, 30, please, If you're in the middle of a sentence, we'll let you finish it, but we really do need to make sure that, with all these people in the room, I feel a great responsibility to make sure that we get to as many of you as possible.
Please make the best of it that you can and please do, fill it out so that we can get it get it moving, get keep moving with more people to speak, so ashley gonzalez, who I believe is from libraries And then I'm just happy to announce that as of next monday, there are going to be 50 locations open for non-contact grab and go setting on the upper west.
My name is william thomas, I'm here as a member of open new york, we're an all volunteer, independent pro housing, organization, and I just wanted to speak in favor of the continued use of hotels as emergency shelter.
It's important that wealthy neighborhoods, like the upper west side, accept their fair share of shelters.
In fact, I'd say that high-income neighborhoods, like the upper west side, are ideal for people to get back on their feet because they're so close to job centers and really engines of opportunity in their own right, 30 seconds, and then finally, I'd like to address some of the scaremongering, we're likely to hear tonight and emphasize that most homeless people are not troubled, are working and just don't make enough money to afford somewhere to live, but that shouldn't matter because homeless people are human beings and shelter is a human right.
Since there have already been long-term residents in some of the sro hotels in the upper west side before the pandemic under a supportive housing program, that's been dwindling as a lack of funding and incentives for owners, And. So I'm wondering is helping cb7 work to support getting people into housing and out of hotels and temporary housing.
I want to speak in favor of using hotels in the neighborhood for supportive housing.
And I want it to be open to as many people who can live.
This is ann smithy, I'm, a resident of the upper west side and like a few people, who've spoken before me.
Everybody in new york city, not just the people who are living in the hotels.
And I haven't seen anything like the kind of disorder people are describing And, then, finally, just I think it's really important that we all our community we're all part of the same city We all have an obligation to help people who are down on their luck and going through a tough time, and that includes sheltering them in hotels during a unprecedented pandemic and economic crisis, and thank you for your time.
Thanks very much, I'm, sorry, rich and christian I live at 76th street and I've lived on the upper west side for the last seven years.
Also, a volunteer, I'm working with the group of thirteen 000 residents of the upper west, side, who've banded, together as neighbors to talk about and discuss the issue of how hotels, good hotels in our community that have been supporting local businesses and helping our neighborhood really be.
You know the important you know goal of helping people who are homeless, but there is a detriment to the neighborhood, and we need to be realistic about this.
Second, I am a volunteer, and many of the groups that have spoken on behalf of this issue have highly paid executives and media people who are influencing this, whereas we're just a bunch of neighborhood volunteers with little or no experience in the sophisticated ways of communicating third, most important of all.
So I just want to make sure that when you have people speaking on behalf of organizations that are making a lot of money, housing, the homeless and providing services to the homeless, that those people are giving accurate information to the neighbors who and I've been living in the neighborhood for 40 years, I'm, a lifelong resident of new york, city.
The folks, who slept on the street homelessness is a real crisis in our city, and every neighborhood in new york really needs to do its part to improve the lives of struggling new yorkers.
And I think we have to prioritize the lives and health of the very vulnerable homeless population and all the people in the city over.
Think the upper west side should also share in this communal responsibility.
If it wasn't project remote was another one of the really good non-profit, shelter providers that operate in the city, and I never had any issue like the kind that is being described by some of the media reports and some of the people who have spoken tonight describing kind of chaotic scenes and dystopian scenes, and so I am just in kind of utter.
're right by the Lucerne , the men stand in front and don't wear, masks and smoke and don't Social distance, especially since the pandemic gets concerning with what's going on, it seems like it's just adding you know more danger to our neighborhood and for those I'm, sorry Eighteen, a thousand eight hundred thirty seven individuals as compared to three or five that this district could contribute to this shelter.
Then you should call on more people that you know have things to say and not just supporters of the shelters that don't live in the neighborhood.
Second point I want to make is that a large portion of the men who were moved to the Lucerne were from the washington jefferson hotel in corey johnson's district, where the same problem that everyone in our community has witnessed increased crime, prostitution, open and illicit drug use, random acts of violence, and it was those community members in hell's kitchen who reached out to corey johnson, and he had them relocated to the Lucerne on July.
But I will tell you that community board 7 Can I just wanted to add my voice to the folks who spoke out in support of the shelter residents.
Thank you for the service that you do and I am concerned about recommendations for the public to be taking pictures of either perceived crimes or things that they see going on in the neighborhood.
These men were moved from another shelter in hell's kitchen, where the same problems existed and that community board acted and they moved them right out of their neighborhood.
So I urge the community board to do the right, thing, and I urge the other speakers on this call to think a little bit before you point that racism finger.
I think the first is an important point that people want to keep glossing over, but there were multiple hotels in hell's kitchen, where these men were housed.
The second thing I want to note is when you have 13 000 people.
Think the third you know Point I wanted to make Is a lot of people.
If you, what people want to talk about shelter, bed, density, that's a very different thing in the upper west side, Has always been a leader, on, and I.
If the first thing you think of when you hear homelessness, is race- Or you hear crime in its race, I'd actually say to you- might need to check your implicit bias because for a vast majority of upper west siders, including lots of people, we know who are people of color.
You, know they're offended when people say that, And I think the issue needs to be.
All of us want that, but the way you do, that is by housing them in facilities that can provide them the services that they need, and there is nobody who realistically thinks that hotels can act, do that, except for people who are really just lost their job down on their luck because of Covid-19 and need the help, but for micah homeless.
Questions are asked over and over and in many ways the same responses are given and I'm trying to figure out where's the disconnect, and I am really wanting to be constructive in helping to make the connection for people.
They know if there are going to be new people, if you want to send them a photo, because you see something, of course, that can be helpful.
You know was presented to our community with without any notice, and that's just a fact, and I appreciate everything that she's been doing to provide those answers, and it's so important that people continue to speak up in forms like this, And, I, don't think being compassionate about homeless, especially doing a clovid.
