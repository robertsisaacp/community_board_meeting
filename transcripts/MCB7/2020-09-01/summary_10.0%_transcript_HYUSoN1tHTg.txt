We are aware that folks are here in part because they are concerned about things that are happening in our community and there is a public session at the end of this meeting.
The role of the Community board is one of an advisory body that weighs in on a variety of matters ranging from applications to city government, to issues of concern with respect to I know.
A lot of folks are here because they're concerned about the overlapping, issues, homelessness and the presence of shelter, clients that are being housed in some of our hotels.
There were 1389 people at the highest point on zoom We gave that precisely to we gave over an entire evening to that one issue in recognition of how important it is to so many members of the community.
The focus needs to be on representatives at this point, and I know that there are a lot of well- formed groups, and so we will do our best to continue to reach out to them and to hear from them a last thing that I want to make sure that I mentioned before.
I start turning it over to the business session and potentially to captain Zuber if he is with us, because I know that the NYPD has limited time to speak with us, given all that's going.
Everybody seems to be talking about the homeless issue, specifically about the shelters going back a couple weeks: now.
How have the people who have recently been placed into Lucerne the Belclair, the Beltnord, been affecting the quality of life and there's a perception that there is an increase in drug use, increase in public lewdness, a lot of issues that were not present.
The people who are out buying drugs are most likely committing other crimes throughout the day, they're going into the store, they're, stealing a couple of things, so they can sell it for a few dollars on the street so that they can get enough money to buy their drugs throughout the day.
So they've come, like I said: they've, come several times to the community board since 2000 for a separate, app window, applications.
And, then Richard Ash, wanted to say something just quickly to follow up on Jay's comment: Nobody living on central park West would voluntarily install a 16 window, and what that will mean is that nobody will change their windows.
I do not like to think of it as solely a bike: Lane Resolution, 72Nd, Street.
South Bike Lanes, Central, Park West, now Columbus Amsterdam, but there really is not a good East, West, Route and We thought 72nd street, given its width and given how underutilized it is, would be a perfect place to put in something different.
And then my second question: is: I know that you want D.O.T to use their engineering and creativity, but are you thinking like what was The committee thinking in terms of where the bike lane would go when there's bus, stops?
But if everybody could take a second to gather their thoughts and be ready to speak when it's your turn, that'll move us along faster, too, okay, and I, also see we have a lot of comments from the community.
I have personally always supported dedicated bike lanes, and the concept on its face sounds like a good idea to ask for a proposal, my understanding and how it tell me if I'm wrong.
How do you is a safe way for everybody to get to the greenway But I just want to explain something: the phase 5 of Riverside park, which is supposedly opening imminently, but still waiting for some Con Edison work, we'll have a fabulous feature at 66th street, which is a dedicated bike ramp from Riverside boulevard that will go down to the greenway.
Saying this now, because I think when people think about a bike lane that terminates at Riverside park, they have to have at least some understanding about what happens.
That's the background that I wanted people to understand, even though I I'm glad that you've confirmed we're not asking for the bike lane Thanks for letting me speak, Howard, I'm, going to speak for 30, seconds, and I.
So I'm concerned that what seemed like- maybe a good investment of 1.7 billion dollars to provide 250 miles of protected bike lanes before the pandemic and before the city's tax base fell.
A, complete street approach, looks at the best way for the bus to move whether it's bus, Lanes Bike, lanes, pedestrians, vehicles, parking.
The priority right now, and it may be because there's so many people who are trying to walk now to work or trying to take the bus or trying to take them a bike instead of the subway.
I. Just have an observation with respect in response to Clary's question and you've said it a couple of times that this is not a resolution for a physically protected crosstown bike.
I just wanted to use this as a as a few minutes just to make or less than a minute to make a quick point of something that I was about to write an email to, and that is, as we make more bike lanes and as we do this and again, I'm in favor of this.
So I, would not expect people going the wrong way to be an issue or what we're asking for is a proposal for a two- way bike lane and the D.O.T is not going to spend money that they do not have, but we are living in a time when bicycling is exploding.
I would earnestly suggest that the resolution be simplified or that we vote on it with the following addition, whether we say proposal or not, but say that we asked D.O.T to launch a proposal to investigate the need and the design of a bike lane add to it.
That's, the conclusion of the committee and that's what's reflected in the resolution: louisa you're up, We are in a very difficult financial situation and we should be very careful about what we're asking for what we need and what we want.
So we wanted to ask for something that was deemed important and was very specific, all right, guys understood, but I think that we can Steve people know I, have concerns about over enforcement of bikes, but two essential areas that need to be enforced are cycling, the wrong way and cycling on streets.
I. Do not think cost should be as much of a concern as just making sure that these agenda items are like actually capitalized upon in our on people's minds.
It's actually this committee's responsibility to come up with a resolution that works not to defer to say we want an opinion, but at the end of the day we want a protected bike lane so give it to us And we're going to excuse how you spend your money, how the buses run and the safety issues involved.
When I, hear people say we do not have the money for a simple bike: lane that can save lives.
These are people who are eager to do it and to do it for the purpose of commuting, not just as recreation, a two- way bike lane for reasons that many have already pointed out.
It's been a shame that it's been slow, but if community groups like this can make the point the city, I think, will hear them.
District fully supports this resolution, asking for a plan for a protected bike playing along 72nd street and an overall safe for 72nd street.
A protective bike lane on 72nd street will strengthen the web tying Central park, the Hudson river greenway and the east side to Columbus avenue, stores, restaurants and museums.
Bike stores have sold out even with no school in session, and many people working from home, CitiBike rides are at all time.
Kids are learning to bike, and I know of many who have purchased bikes in the hopes of riding to school, including my 12 year old There's currently not one way to safely cross the upper West side in a protected lane.
This excludes many people from using a bike to get around town to drop kids at school or bike to work in May our campaign surveyed upper West siders and asked about their commuting patterns and habits.
72Nd street was the most popular crosstown street, where people wanted a protected bike.
There's a lot of talk all the time when we talk about bike lanes and people about pedestrians, almost getting hit or even getting hit.
Seeing, no more public hands, Oh the question: Unless there's a change to the resolution, let's go this one , I'm going to take a roll call, vote.
Did us park users and were all park users an enormous service back about 10 years ago, by getting an amendment of the City Council to the New York City Clean Air Act that prohibited smoking in parks in order to get the votes of some of her co- council members, as she very kindly came to our committee meeting and explained to us she needed to build, in some exceptions that have remained in the law ever since.
Okay, is posing a greater risk to the neighborhood, and I really want to make an important point and has become a kind of de facto designated smoking area.
I'm, going to just turn to other people who want to speak.
One is increased sort of conflict between you know local residents, people telling people they're not allowed to smoke, you know, arguments etc, and the second thing is a reluctance to send you know people into contact with the police in ways that could be detrimental to them in their lives depending on who they are and what their situation is.
We talked about at the committee meeting enforcement is always an issue but having a uniform rule of no smoking in parks period, as combined with another thing, we're asking for which is better signage.
Yes, we did have a separate vote because a couple of committee members did not want the part of the resolution that asked to have- It's not regarded in the park, not with regard to Marijuana use or brownies or anywhere else or in your house, or on the streets.
But the majority of committee members wanted that in So it is part of the proposed resolution which makes it very simple.
I kind of wonder if this resolution is meant to you know, point to the homeless men smoking in the medium that everyone, like hate, that that's happening right now, and it makes me a little suspicious of the timing of this resolution.
And, you know I think we do not need more enforcement by the police on the Marijuana piece and just in general, I won't be voting for those.
Think a resolution that impacts so many residential buildings on the west side of Central, Park, West, and We should table this, because what I suspect will happen is that people who currently smoke on the perimeter of central Park and unlike Riverside, there's a buffer There's the perimeter, wall, , there's a buffer between the perimeter of the park and a playground or seating inside the park.
Think what may happen is the people who currently sit on the perimeter to have a smoke may go acrosss the street in front of the buildings on Central Park West to have their cigarette they're not going to not smoke on Central Park West, because you've decided that they can't smoke on the perimeter.
It concerns me that a resolution that's going to impact both the residential and park side of the street is not getting a proper airing.
She told us that when she proposed this legislation to amend the Clean Air Act to include not smoking and prophetic prohibiting smoking in parks that, in order to get it passed back, 10 years, ago, or so with some of her other colleagues, she needed to make some compromises at that time, based upon what people were thinking at that time.
We do not want our kids walking around watching people smoke Marijuana in our parks and well.
Let me just leave it at that very strongly as as written in the committee, and so I urge people to vote against Ken's amendment.
My, my apologies for moving everybody fast tonight, but we've got a lot of people in our in our waiting room who want to speak for themselves and I promise them at least an hour Gail Brewer, Helen, Rosenthal and Brad Hoyleman, and In your report, you talked about a series of small meetings with stakeholders on the homeless.
One of them is going to get a letter in their temporary residence, reminding them that they live in New York city in Manhattan, and they need to use that address.
I've been following your community board from the beginning, and obviously you have a lot going on, but I wanted to say that I stood with Brad Holman yesterday and activists about the U.S postal service in respect to the lock boxes that we're trying to get all over the state.
We can't get that to work, then the only other option will be to do a roll call vote where you announce your votes for each of the things we just said that is always available to us, but please take a look at the the resolution and proposed amendment, which would only take Pl should only be in effect for actually 13 months.
The proposal proposed Bylaw amendment tonight and we need a second okay, And, so it'll be on the agenda for our October meeting, given the hour How many people are waiting.
I will do so again, but let's just remind people that if you want to speak in the public session which is coming up now, you need to fill out the form you need to go to chat and click on the link which is bit DOT.
So I'm, going to start with a couple of folks that I know that most folks here are here to talk about Safety, Street, homelessness, the shelter homeless and a few other things.
We set the time that everybody is allowed to speak, and I will respectfully remind them same as when we were doing public speakers where it's a minute, 30, please, If you're in the middle of a sentence, we'll let you finish it, but we really do need to make sure that, with all these people in the room, I feel a great responsibility to make sure that we get to as many of you as possible.
Peter arson with Columbus Amsterdam bid, wanted to alert you all to our open streets for restaurants, starting at 97th street and going up to 110Th street is on both saturdays and sundays, and the streets are open for people to walk or ride on from noon.
There were two other non- hotel, speakers, Martha Dwyer, who should go next , I think we should all share the burden, but my concern is wearing a mask and that's going to end social distancing, And, that's going to be particularly important when parents and kids are going back and forth to school when that happens, and I'm down the street from Lucerne.
Moving, get keep moving with more people to speak, so Ashley Gonzalez, who I believe is from libraries And then I'm just happy to announce that as of next Monday, there are going to be 50 locations open for non- contact grab and go setting on the upper west.
My name is William Thomas, I'm here as a member of open, New York We're, an all volunteer, independent, Pro, housing, organization, and I just wanted to speak in favor of the continued use of hotels as emergency shelter.
It's important that wealthy neighborhoods, like the upper West side, accept their fair share of shelters.
Income neighborhoods, like the upper West side, are ideal for people to get back on their feet because they're so close to job centers and really engines of opportunity in their own right, 30 seconds, and then finally, I'd like to address some of the scaremongering, we're likely to hear tonight and emphasize that most homeless people are not troubled, are working and just do not make enough money to afford somewhere to live.
Since there have already been long- term residents in some of the SRO hotels in the upper West side before the pandemic under a supportive housing program, that's been dwindling as a lack of funding and incentives for owners, and so I'm wondering is helping CB7 work to support getting people into housing and out of hotels and temporary housing.
I want to speak in favor of using hotels in the neighborhood for supportive housing.
And I want it to be open to as many people who can live.
People in the temporary shelters at the hotels, like people have said, allowing people to social distance benefits, everybody in New, York City, not just the people who are living in the hotels.
And, then, finally, just I think it's really important that we all our community we're all part of the same city We all have an obligation to help people who are down on their luck and going through a tough time, and that includes sheltering them in hotels during a unprecedented pandemic and economic crisis, and thank you for your time.
I'm, also a volunteer , I'm working with the group of thirteen 000 residents of the upper West side, who've banded, together as neighbors to talk about and discuss the issue of how hotels, good hotels in our community that have been supporting local businesses and helping our neighborhood really be.
For you know the important you know goal of helping people who are homeless, but there is a detriment to the neighborhood, and we need to be realistic about this.
Second, I am a volunteer, and many of the groups that have spoken on behalf of this issue have highly paid executives and media people who are influencing this, whereas we're just a bunch of neighborhood volunteers with little or no experience in the sophisticated ways of communicating third, most important of all.
So I just want to make sure that when you have people speaking on behalf of organizations that are making a lot of money, housing, the homeless and providing services to the homeless, that those people are giving accurate information to the neighbors who and I've been living in the neighborhood for 40 years, I'm, a lifelong resident of New York City We want to see the homeless problems solved once and for all.
The folks who slept on the street homelessness is a real crisis in our city and every neighborhood in New. I urge every one of you to think of your neighbors, who won't receive help without the use of hotels as emergency.
As a whole, and I believe that you know there has been no evidence that this temporary solution has caused any meaningful, problems, And I think we have to prioritize the lives and health of the very vulnerable homeless population and all the people in the city over might the minor inconveniences.
I believe it was open by project renewal if it was not project Remote Was, another one of the really good non- profit, shelter providers that operate in the city, And I never had any issue like the kind that is being described by some of the media reports and some of the people who have spoken tonight describing kind of chaotic scenes and dystopian scenes, and so I am just in kind of utter.
The men stand in front and do not wear masks and smoke and do not social distance, especially since the pandemic gets concerning with what's going on, it seems like it's just adding you know more danger to our neighborhood and for those I'm, And I also just want to say the district shelters.
Then you should call on more people that you know have things to say and not just supporters of the shelters that do not live in the neighborhood.
Second point I want to make is that a large portion of the men who were moved to the Lucerne were from the Washington Jefferson Hotel in Corey Johnson's district, where the same problem that everyone in our community has witnessed increased crime, prostitution, open and illicit drug use, random acts of violence, and it was those community members in Hell's kitchen who reached out to Corey Johnson, and he had them relocated to the Lucerne on July.
But I will tell you that community board 7 Can I just wanted to add my voice to the folks who spoke out in support of the shelter residents.
Thank you for the service that you do and I am concerned about recommendations for the public to be taking pictures of either perceived crimes or things that they see going on in the neighborhood.
You know there is a long history of white people, acrosss, all income brackets using their fears and concerns about safety as justifications to exclude affordable housing and homeless shelters from their neighborhoods in effect, keeping their neighborhoods majority white.
So I urge the community Board to do the right, thing, and I urge the other speakers on this call to think a little bit before you point that racism finger.
So I want to just make four points that I think is getting lost in this debate as an upper West side, resident.
I think the first is an important point that people want to keep glossing over, but there were multiple hotels in Hell's kitchen, where these men were housed.
The second thing I want to note is when you have 13,000 people.
I. Think the third you know Is a lot of people.
If you, what people want to talk about shelter, bed, density, that's a very different thing in the upper West side, Has always been a leader, on, and I.
Would say this is a safety and security issue, but at the same time, if the first thing you think of when you hear homelessness is race or you hear crime in its race, I'd actually say to you might need to check your implicit bias because for a vast majority of upper West siders, including lots of people, we know who are people of color.
You, know they're offended when people say that, And I think the issue needs to be.
All of us want that, but the way you do, that is by housing them in facilities that can provide them the services that they need, and there is nobody who realistically thinks that hotels can act, do that, except for people who are really just lost their job down on their luck because of Covid-19 and need the help, but for Micah homeless.
Questions are asked over and over and in many ways the same responses are given and I'm, trying to figure out where's the disconnect, and I am really wanting to be constructive in helping to make the connection for people.
They know if there are going to be new people, if you want to send them a photo, because you see something, of course, that can be helpful.
You know was presented to our community with without any notice, and that's just a fact, and I appreciate everything that she's been doing to provide those answers, and it's so important that people continue to speak up in forms like this, so Mark.
