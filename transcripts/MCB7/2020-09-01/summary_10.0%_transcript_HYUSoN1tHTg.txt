So, please bear with us as we're trying to invent this as we fly, but it is our rough attempt to try to make sure that we get a representative sample of all the things that you are here to talk about, so we will do our very best to get as much of those in that said, there were at last count something like 390 people signed up for this meeting It is you want to say about any resolution or any or any matter at the end of the meeting for the public, for the public.
Wick of that committee to discuss As I said the focus needs to be on representatives at this point and I know that there are a lot of well-formed groups, and so we will do our best to continue to reach out to them and to hear from them a last thing that I want to make sure that I mentioned before I start turning it over to the business session and potentially to captain zuber.
Instead of calling 9-1-1 28 full days, we had five 911 calls about drug use out in the open So. We have no doubt that the people on the street, the people in the community are seeing a lot more of this than was being reported, and it worked yesterday I'm happy to say that, based on the increased reporting and our initial investigation, we were able to bring Manhattan north narcotics detectives into the 20th precinct in a two-hour period.
In fact: that's something that we're going to reroute to sanitation If you're, not certain call, if it's a something, that's very simple, like a noise complaint, you're in your apartment and you hear banging on the walls or loud music next door , that's a noise complaint, that's something that can go to 3-1-1 if you're, not sure of what you're seeing on the street If there's a couple of people hiding in a doorway and you think they may be using illicit drugs.
We have six resolutions we met in july and august because, as you know, lpc doesn't wait for us, but the first one It concerns the building at 305 west end avenue between 74 and 75th streets We, the application was to install rooftop hvac units, an equipment screen, canopy restoration and a second floor equipment screen.
This is the backyard 75th street minimally observable from the street There's a small cut out there that air conditioning units were installed and they have to put a they want to put a wall with a little bit of fencing on top to separate the air conditioning units from the terrace that the tenants would use the residents would use and the third part of this, as jay pointed out, we're not there to tell people to knock things down and not approve and we approved these changes by a vote of six to zero to zero to zero non-committee board members.
They just wanted to show us that this would be a retail space All those in favor of this application raise your hand either virtually or physically Next application is 262 central park west between 86th and 87th street there's 796 windows on the primary facade Next one mark they've come to this committee from time to time with applications for window replacements, but this time they want a master plan.
You know a lot of people tend to think of aluminum as cheap or aluminum siding individually, when they came individually to the community?, and then richard ash wanted to say something just quickly to follow up on jay's comment: Nobody living on central park west would voluntarily install a 16 window, and what that will mean is that nobody will change their windows.
Next- is the crosstown bike lane on 72nd street transportation committee I'm, not sure if it's howard, andrew and I have only one resolution this evening and it's the 72nd street I , don't like to think of it as solely a bike lane resolution 72nd street There are a lot of restaurants there and a lot of restaurants that are suffering so what we discussed at the transportation committee was there are very good and plentiful north-south bike lanes central park west now columbus amsterdam, but there really isn't a good east west route and we thought 72nd street, given its width and given how underutilized it is, would be a perfect place to put in something different The resolution calls for a plan.
It calls for a plan to calls for them to use their imagination, to come up with a plan to improve the street and, of course, connect these northwest bike lanes also connecting central park, which has the loop and riverside drive, which has the hudson river bikeway This would be an important connector and It passed in the committee eleven to zero to one abstention.
There's There are a few cars in the moving lane, but there are always cars in the the lane to the left, in other words, the lane beside the parking lane and then my second question is: the committee thinking in terms of where the bike lane would go when there's bus , Okay I'm, calling on people who have a lot more expertise than I do to figure it out.
I just think the street can be improved, I had my hand up first but not at the expense of not having a full discussion But if everybody could take a second to gather their thoughts and be ready to speak when it's your turn, that'll move us along faster, and I, also see we have a lot of comments from the community.
You so much I'm glad to hear that what I want to focus on just for a moment as we continue as we will over some months, probably to see what comes out of this is the issue of how you get to the greenway, because, unlike other dedicated cycle lanes, this one to get from central park to get to the greenway in riverside park, one way or another has to get through riverside park, which is, as we know, a very heavily used park by many pedestrians and others.
Think as people are thinking about this howard, it's important to understand, because the issue is, how do you is a safe way for everybody to get to the greenway, but I just want to explain something: the phase 5 of riverside park, which is supposedly opening imminently, but still waiting for some con ed work, we'll have a fabulous feature at 66th street, which is a dedicated bike ramp from riverside boulevard that will go down to the greenway.
The second way is to go north and go on the currently dead, currently designated bike route across 79th street North and riverside drive I'll be finished in a moment, however, to go north on riverside drive across the currently designated route onto the greenway, particularly for people going north That's, the other half of the perfect solution, but when the rotunda is under renovation, which we're told will start sometime soon and last for several years, that will be unavailable and I'm saying this now, because I think when people think about a bike lane that terminates at riverside park, they have to have at least some understanding about what happens next, to get those cyclists safely down to the greenway That's the background that I wanted people to understand, even though I I'm glad that you've confirmed we're not asking for the bike lane and I think it may save time in the long run.
I live at 71st street, as we all know, and I'm on 72nd street, almost as much as arena, perhaps, and that street is not, as it says, in a rebel resolution here, a low traffic street with six lanes consisting of curbside parking blah right now , It's got restaurants burgeoning out the bus goes back and forth and frankly, I think the way the bus is being handled in central park.
The bus pulls over directly to the curb and the bicyclists are in danger on central park west, because the bus is pulling into the curb- and I, don't know where they're supposed to go so to have that same model used on 72nd street So my recommendation is to not vote on this right now and to just set it aside and say: Listen in a year from now, we can come back and talk about it, but right now this should not be our priority when the mta is in such freefall.
and I am way up there with concerns with the budget, but I think that this is a very small actual expenditure My feeling and the committee's feeling is, let's see what they come up with jeanette wraps Lane What, we really need to ask for is for DOT to do a complete streets, analysis of 72nd street and, frankly, also other crosstown streets.
A, complete street approach looks at the best way for the bus to move whether it's bus lanes bike lanes, pedestrians vehicles, parking, it looks at all the modes of moving them east to west on the street, and so I'd really recommend that, if we're asking DOT to address resources in this, we have them do it comprehensibly, rather than just looking at one mode of traffic transportation to move this length because it's as the comments you've heard, it gets very complicated when you get to the details.
Just have an observation with respect in response to clary's question and you've said it a couple of times that this is not a resolution for a physically protected crosstown bike lane The resolution says that community board 7 is seeking a proposal for quote a physically protected two-way bike.
Bike lane link we're asking for a proposal that would come back to us that we could look, give input and see what works for the community and once they do that, it's conceivable that we can ask DOT to look into all of the things that all of you have raised this evening, and hopefully it won't be so much such a big process, because people like clary will have input, and hopefully you will too jay and make it a proposal that the board can go for who's , you know: I'm gonna, support this measure and I support most of the bike lanes or all the bike lanes.
All right, guys understood but I think that we can steve people know I, have concerns about over enforcement of bikes, but two essential areas that need to be enforced are cycling, the wrong way and cycling on streets A separate issue from this resolution, Apart from that having viable two-way bike lanes, should allow cyclists to ride legally.
When I hear people say we don't have the money for a simple bike: lane that can save lives, I, think oh no central park, west madison lied in all over again.
and I know of many who have purchased bikes in the hopes of riding to school, including my 12 year old and there's currently not one way to safely cross the upper west side in a protected lane.
One is bike lanes mean fewer pedestrian injuries , There's a lot of talk all the time when we talk about bike lanes and people about pedestrians, almost getting hit or even getting hit If you look at the data, pedestrians are safer when there's a bike lane one two I personally collected hundreds and hundreds of signatures on petitions in support of a west 72nd street bike lane There is a tremendous amount of community support for this Please vote yes on this resolution and I live on west 79th street and I'm a cyclist and I support.
The one point that hasn't been made about 72nd street is that the cyclists who are coming out of the park at 72nd street add to bike traffic on 72nd street and they need someplace to go Seeing, no more public hands, Oh the question: Unless there's a change to the resolution.
When she was a member of the city council did us park users and were all park users an enormous service back about 10 years ago, by getting an amendment of the city council to the new york city, clean air act that prohibited smoking in parks in order to get the votes of some of her co-council members As. She very kindly came to our committee meeting and explained to us she needed to build, in some exceptions that have remained in the law ever since Although.
Please just get to your resolution What the resolution does is it asks the city council to pass to pass an amendment to the clean air act that would eliminate the exceptions to the no smoking law in parks , I'd like to call on janus horowitz and and two other members of the of the vaginas first to other members of the public and then, of course, we'll hear from the from board members dennis, but I'll just start with.
The parkland, that's in the park moms with strollers who sit on those benches, a kid anybody who wants to enjoy that part of the park is being exposed for long stretches of time to people without masked masks, As a result, this area, which is supposed to be risky respite, please wrap up Okay, is posing a greater risk to the neighborhood and I really want to make an important point and has become a kind of de facto designated smoking area Smoke poses health problems, as we all know, but there's one other problem , that's paramount in the time of Covid-19, and that is secondhand smoke, makes the non-smoker more vulnerable to viral infections.
My hope is that you pass a swift resolution to support the ban on smoking in public perimeters of the parks Thank you so much community board, seven I'm going to just turn to other people who want to speak : We know that mark levine, council, member mark levine who's had I, believe head of the health committee and in the council, is already interested in introducing legislation that we've of the type that we've asked for.
We held two votes during our committee meeting, one for the basic resolution and another specific to the callout for marijuana and, if I, if I recall correctly, I voted I personally voted no on the marijuana, I'm wondering if that's your recollection of the vote, and if there is an opportunity to pull that marijuana inclusion out of the resolution as part of a friendly amendment Yes, we did have a separate vote because a couple of committee members did not want the part of the resolution that asked to have- it's not regarded in the park, not with regard to marijuana, use or brownies or anywhere else or in your house, or on the streets.
Also I kind of wonder if this resolution is meant to you know, point to the homeless men smoking in the medium that everyone like hate, that that's happening right now, and it makes me a little suspicious of the timing of this resolution and you know I think we don't need more enforcement by the police on the marijuana piece and just in general, I won't be voting for those and it's about second-hand smoke of any kind in all of our parks.
From the second hand, smoke for everybody, we don't want our kids walking around watching people smoke marijuana in our parks and well Let me just leave it at that very strongly as as written in the committee and so I urge people to vote against ken's amendment Does.
I think it was a really productive conversation and there will be another stakeholder meeting as mark is going to talk about offline before school starts, so they are in touch You, know the narcotics drug bust that you facilitated As. You know I called shay, and let him know that I think that and lastly, we'll be sending out an email tomorrow about how parents who want to donate their pandemic ebt cards, how they can do that if they want to donate to families in need again sign up for my emails, you can go to helenrosenthalcom So. Around area schools, I'm gonna go next to senator robert jackson, I've been following your community board from the beginning, and obviously you have a lot going on, but I wanted to say that I stood with brad holman yesterday and activists about the us postal service in respect to the lock boxes that we're trying to get all over the state and I said this is about democracy, making sure that everyone has the opportunity to vote with respect to absentee ballots and what have you?
33 states across this nation, plus the district of columbia, have the opportunity for voters to go to these secure ballot drop boxes to vote rather than going to the us postal service, which we know, is being underfunded and undermined by the trump administration or having to wait in line or go to a polling site which will endanger their health So I'm hopeful that with senator jackson's support and the borough president who was with us, we can get that done and then finally, I want to say I strongly support our teachers union in delaying the opening of schools.
I want to thank mark and say that many of us respect you support you and appreciate you for the work that you do on behalf of our community It's important that we listen to and see the best in each other and recognize that, as we work together to address contentious issues and sometimes painful personal circumstances, we each approach situations differently, and that is a strength which will help us arrive at better understandings on the board.
So I'm, going to start with a couple of folks that I know that most folks here are here to talk about safety, street homelessness, the shelter homeless and a few other things Can. We set the time that everybody is allowed to speak and I will respectfully remind them same as when we were doing public speakers where it's a minute.
and then just want to mention that there are really great green markets that have social distancing at 97th street 114th street and at 110th and Manhattan avenues Let's see, there were two other non-hotel speakers, martha dwyer, who should go next, okay, and then we have one person, ashley gonzalez, who can go after martha I think we should all share the burden, but my concern is wearing a mask and that's going to end social distancing and that's going to be particularly important when parents and kids are going back and forth to school when that happens and I'm down the street from lucerne, So I've continually contacted project renewal and sent some pictures because I see guards outside with no masks of mask down project renewal staff outside with no master mask down and many of the clients without masks.
I'd say that high-income neighborhoods, like the upper west side, are ideal for people to get back on their feet because they're so close to job centers and really engines of opportunity in their own right, 30 seconds, and then finally, I'd like to address some of the scaremongering, we're likely to hear tonight and emphasize that most homeless people are not troubled, are working and just don't make enough money to afford somewhere to live, but that shouldn't matter because homeless people are human beings and shelter is a human right.
I am a resident of the upper west side for the last seven years, and currently a homeowner on 90th street I want to speak in favor of using hotels in the neighborhood for supportive housing.
Supportive housing This has been a wonderful community and I'm honored to live on the upper west side and I want it to be open to as many people who can live here.
Definitely in favor of housing, People in the temporary shelters at the hotels, like people have said, allowing people to social distance benefits everybody in new york city, not just the people who are living in the hotels and I haven't seen anything like the kind of disorder people are describing and then finally, just I think it's really important that we all our community we're all part of the same city and we all have an obligation to help people who are down on their luck and going through a tough time, and that includes sheltering them in hotels during a unprecedented pandemic and economic crisis.
Our neighborhood has not done its fair share to grow housing in this city and I think this is the inevitable consequence of that I'd like to just say a second to thank all the volunteers, I'm also a volunteer I'm working with the group of thirteen 000 residents of the upper west side, who've banded, together as neighbors to talk about and discuss the issue of how hotels, good hotels in our community that have been supporting local businesses and helping our neighborhood really be A.
One sex offenders are not required to register, so I just want to make sure that when you have people speaking on behalf of organizations that are making a lot of money, housing, the homeless and providing services to the homeless, that those people are giving accurate information to the neighbors who and I've been living in the neighborhood for 40 years I'm, a lifelong resident of new york city We want to see the homeless problems solved once and for all.
Shelters are major spreading grounds for kova 19 because you cancelled lead distance, and this endangers the lives of homeless residents and everyone in the city as a whole and I think we have to prioritize the lives and health of the very vulnerable homeless population and all the people in the city over might the minor inconveniences Ultimately, you know every neighborhood in the city is sharing in the responsibility of halting the spread of kova 19, which has already devastated our city, and The upper west side should also share in this communal responsibility.
If it wasn't project remote was another one of the really good non-profit shelter providers that operate in the city and I never had any issue like the kind that is being described by some of the media reports and some of the people who have spoken tonight describing kind of chaotic scenes and dystopian scenes, and I would like to say that I support using the hotels you know , I think that there should be if there aren't hotels in my neighborhood that are being used for this purpose.
I think that there should be because it's definitely better in terms of public health and in terms of our social obligations and I'm, really kind of surprised to see so many people talking about crime and things like that, because that was never my experience.
I will not stand for that, because I'm actually surprised that we that I'm surprised that the way in which the conversation is going- then you should call on more people that you know have things to say and not just supporters of the shelters that don't live in the neighborhood Let me be abundantly clear, miss diamond because I really think that you're hitting something important we're calling on people, because these are the people who signed up that's, and there was only one person who signed up in the the category.
First of all, thank you for the service that you do and I am concerned about recommendations for the public to be taking pictures of either perceived crimes or things that they see going on in the neighborhood What we know right now is that we are in the middle of a mental health crisis and that one in five people in our country are struggling with mental illness and addiction and that these illnesses do not discriminate.
Public defecation, open drug use going on in the street I live on west 87th street There are people hanging out on the stoop and around the corner.
Soho has no shelter beds If you what people want to talk about shelter, bed density, that's a very different thing in the upper west side has always been a leader on The last point is the racial issue, which is you know.
The first thing I would say this is a safety and security issue, but at the same time, if the first thing you think of when you hear homelessness is race- or you hear crime in its race, I'd actually say to you might need to check your implicit bias because for a vast majority of upper west siders, including lots of people, we know who are people of color When people say that Are these men getting the services they need?
The disconnect and I am really wanting to be constructive in helping to make the connection for people Let me start by saying there's absolutely a problem on the upper west side for those of you who were on the call with ps879 and other school parents.
I believe that senator hoyleman wanted to say a somewhat quicker final word You know was presented to our community with without any notice, and that's just a fact and I appreciate everything that she's been doing to provide those answers, and it's so important that people continue to speak up in forms like this, so mark and I, don't think being compassionate about homeless, especially doing a clovid With.
