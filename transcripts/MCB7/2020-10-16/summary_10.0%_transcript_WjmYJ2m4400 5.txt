You can speak whatever you like, but I thought people might be interested in terms of you know the challenges that you got, that you felt in terms of opening the school Do you feel now and then one of the things also is what are the concerns in the future, because those are the things hopefully that we can support.
You know we had to make a lot of decisions without really knowing what things would look like very difficult for me as an elementary school principal, especially inviting in kindergartners and pre- k, students, and trying to get parents to make decisions about whether they'd want their children to be learning in the school building or at home, with having no experience in the school at all was very difficult.
I'm, a principal who likes to you: We use a lot of our resources to do a lot of summer, planning, And, so we always hold a teacher academy every prior to Covid-19 to get ready for the students in our school.
We can't wait around for the two days after labor day to get ready for school, So we always that has always been a part of our culture, and You know at the end of June, when the mayor came up with a plan for hybrid learning.
I was very skeptical that this hybrid plan would work, and so you know thinking about what remote learning looked like since March- You know we were on this CB7 meeting back in June when I invited some students and we had a conversation.
You know we went ahead and planned a week- long teacher academy, the week of August 24th through the 28th to plan out some type of school year, because at the end of the day, September 10th was always going to come.
So I'm, not sure what the mayor and Chancellor were thinking with this late planning, and so that Wednesday, I believe, was when they issued the guidance around having three teachers, essentially for per class you're.
You, know two extra teachers for every content, specialist that I have, and so you know, I'm a practical, person, And, so I can't think beyond things that do not make a lot of sense to me, and so it's already hard to staff my school in the first place on a regular school year, let alone a pandemic.
That was just something that I could not think about, and it was something that my school community also I rejected, initially, and So, in speaking with my teachers, you know we decided outright to reject the memorandum that the deal we came up with And we decided as a school.
What would work best for our children is for us to be fully remote, and if children choose to come to school, then we would support local child care.
But in terms of giving children an education, we would need to do things fully remote so that they can have access to the teachers that I hired for them at all.
You know we have not experienced some of the challenges that the other schools had in terms of trying to hire and waiting to last minute and playing around with the DOE about sending central staff members and hiring CUNY professors and all the other things that were taking place.
What was frustrating for me as a principal is being the messenger and having to go to my community every week and say: Here's You know with all the misinformation and going back and forth between the mayor and the Chancellor and the governor, and whoever else I was making decisions and not asking principals, again.
You know they're not going to learn anywhere else with school, and If we do not have this together, whether it's remote, whether it's blended, whether it's fully in person or not, you know in the middle of October something seriously wrong with that picture.
Go school go to school, but you know there was no planning around making sure that these children, who would have to be at home at least two or three days a week and looking at high schools four days a week, They were going to need technology They were going to need Wi- fi access at home, And While we spent all this time thinking about PPE and all these different things and going back and forth with all the unions, you know the deal we and all the money that we have might have could have potentially do not have.
We have 70 of our students who chose remote, and so only 30 percent of our students are coming to the building and every day that number gets smaller and smaller, because parents are realizing that you're doing the same thing at school, that you're doing at home, and so that's one thing, but also it's just not the same.
At one point you said that your teaching is a hundred percent remote, Does that mean that you're sort of teaching online And when the kids come like all the teaching and it's assuming my son's going to high school hmsc All the teachings online in the morning And then when they do have him, do have in person?
Everybody is sitting in a classroom with a laptop with earbuds, and then they have access to their teachers whenever they show up whether they're physically there that you know you've worked it out, where they're being Have, some teachers teach in school.
We kind of made assumptions in June that this many people probably won't come to school, because in order for this to work, you're making assumptions that people are going to opt out because with social distancing, you can not have a whole full program and with nine kids in the classroom, when most class sizes are 30 plus in the middle and high school, You know you're, assuming that two- thirds of the school won't come to school, at least a third, so that you can put them on a rotating schedule.
I have to say you know at the computer school again, I feel blessed to have the community, the staff that I do You know they've been in the business of making me look good for a long time and The person I probably bore the brunt of the constant fluctuation in the plans was my assistant principal who was in charge of programming, and we had a zoom call in fact where she was trying to explain the latest version.
Think I'm fortunate in that I have a relatively no low number of teachers who applied for accommodations to work, 100 remotely, and my colleagues know that that's varied from school to school.
You know I'm also fortunate that while we have been getting that drip of students going from blended to full remote, which has created some strain, we still have a preponderance of students that are staying with blended and we actually had two or three students in the last few days that have come back to blended after choosing full remote and one issue that had come up, Is that some of the students who chose 100 remote right from the get- In the in the full, remote format.
We do not have that third teacher further, which is which has been tough for us, and I, would say that you know a part of it was that we needed more of those teachers to teach in the remote settings, because we had a large number of kids who chose remote early on before the school year started like by the deadline, and so we needed like for in fifth grade.
There was a lot of movement in the beginning when there were so many changes for the start of the school year And So, we had a number of people who moved from wanting to be in the blended program to wanting to go fully remote and We have not started we're actually going with the enrollment periods for moving from remote to blended, and so in the end of October.
I truly believe it ironically seem to have the least amount of say in what is going on, which I find just incredible, and I know that in my own school my principal presented three different models over a three week, period.
We hear lots of things about people with options to go, elsewhere, taking them and thinking back to five and seven and ten years ago, when there were overcrowding, questions, and there was an issue about whether there was certainty or uncertainty that your zoned school would actually be available to you or whether the school that you were most interested in on a choice system was going to be available to you that parents were taking other options that were certain even if they were not ideal.
You know it's tough, because you have a certain segment of your population who just have so much dysfunction going on that they're not going to be able to perform on it on a good day, anyway, When you have a school with a lot of those people, then it's a struggle because you can't go inside someone's home and fix what's happening.
You know Columbia two people who worked at Columbia University and people with advanced graduate degrees trying to persuade people to go back to school, and the conversation started to go around lower income students and what about poor children And they have to go to school.
You know for other states because there was a job loss, but you know I would consider ours ourselves fortunate that it was limited to that number Yeah 20 students, but that may not sound like a big number, but that's almost a whole teacher You know all of the years that we fought to open for more schools to keep Ps87 from being overcrowded, there's space for you, now.
If they're going to ask me for the money that we owe and what's going to happen next year, when we have to say how many children we think we will have and will I have to go through the appeals process with the department of education which takes a while and by that time it's like.
Think you know, that's been my biggest concern as a principal in New York City for the past seven years Is that you know there's so many people in between me and the chancellor, which means there's so many rules, and so many expectations, So and so many other people that I have to deal with and speak to.
This is what this looks like in my school, and when parents hear you know, I'm promising you full instruction.
They can't go that over to their friend's house and work on something which I do not know what that impact is, and I Anybody wants to address that of the students who are in remote learning but are actually physically remote from New York, and is that having any impact or even aware that of how many people are in that setting?
I do not want a child up in the middle of the night, going to school, you know, And, so I will say that they've been really great about that, but it does still concern us as educators here in the building, because they we still have very young kids.
We have materials for kids who are working fully remote You know in figuring out how to how are we going to get things to people and all of that, and I also would say that a big challenge.
You know one of the things that I would say just community, wise or culturally here at Ps87 We are a school, that's known for our community, and we spend a lot of time together and bonding, and all of that How are we engaging the families who are working, remotely?
It's, something we think about all the time like we'll start to make plans, and it's like right that works really well for the people who come in to the building.
Wide, I'm on the district equity team along with principal Washington, and you know that lack of access and talking about the the disparities with who has and who does not, who can connect and who can't So , I think that we're all as a district worried about that as well, because as all of you who are familiar with district three, this is not a new issue when it comes to equity, and so this is definitely something that is on our minds and The fact that folks are told to reach out to the department of education for a device and the department of education that says, reach out to the schools is an issue we gave out every divide like Carl, so there's a number of kids out there who do not have devices to even connect.
If you had to just estimate, I recently saw online that it was about roughly 200 000 students who are lacking proper technology to engage in remote learning and just how about at your schools as well just on a local at my school, I would say probably four or five, because we deliberately made sure that all of our students got our computers and I was able to get a few more at the beginning of the year.
Think a lot of parents opted in for blended learning, with the idea that we will provide child care, And so the question becomes what to do with my child in the other two or three days that they're not in school, and so the doa came up with this idea of Learning Bridges over the summer.
I think that that's really important for them still to be able to see other children in the school so that they can know someone else and actually.
We have to really work to make sure that they're, the kids, who are learning fully remotely, have an opportunity to see other kids there's a whole other group of kids who are in you Know as a part of the school we had when we first started.
I'm going to read it for the kids this time and send out the video you know so different things that we've always had we're trying to figure out.
But it's definitely work But we're going to try and our best to do to do that, because we do not want people to feel like they're outside of the community.
And I were literally just on a call with a parent in Harlem who was raising money, Has raised like thirteen thousand dollars, because kids in district five in district four do not have technology, so I think they they, where we need support, really.
Besides the connectivity in the devices that principal Washington made the strong case for and also was, the actual tech support and that's people, and so I think, that's the third leg of the stool that we need to ask for.
But I think we need to reach parents because they're having so much more responsibility for their children's education, because the kids are learning from home.
