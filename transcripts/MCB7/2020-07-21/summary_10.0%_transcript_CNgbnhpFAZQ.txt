The Community Education Council tomorrow night will be taking up a resolution that also calls for the creative use of outdoor space and has additional facts and thoughts.
It seems to me that a letter would be possible leveraging those of statements of our board to then go the next mile and say to the extent that there are plans for in- person, education, that they should include the ability to use outdoor spaces, whether they be parks or curbside or plazas, or whatever it is.
Mainly in the public schools and having been chair of the Community Board in District, 3., I, think it's treacherous.
This would just, I think, exacerbate that need that need for creating legal, legalistic documents, but I hate to you know, but I think things that we have talked about and had resolutions support, outdoor learning, so rooftops yards playgrounds, but not streets or parks.
Yeah this you know we were able to to build a hospital in central park, pretty much overnight in tents and there's no reason why we can't cordon off streets and sidewalks in front of schools to expand their footprint.
Then we can cut the occupancy of the actual physical rooms in the school in half, and that means more people, more parents who do not have to stay home, which also is a big way.
Some odd children with language- based learning disabilities, so they all have ieps We've, been I've, served on the task force about reopening and one of the things that school wanted to inquire of the Community Board and the council.
I know that safety is a very valid concern, but I do not feel that the community board should substitute our judgment for that of the administ school administrators as to what's safe and what's not safe, and what can and can not be done.
The creative solutions that I've heard spoken about in the past few weeks, as[ _ _] surrounding reopening, so I would, I, would definitely endorse sending some kind of letter giving schools as much space, especially outdoor space, which everybody knows is much safer and less likely to help spread.
I think all of our efforts are have married, there's an architect in my office who's working with his kids school in Queens, and there are a lot of other factors.
I mean I'm, surprised that you know the Department of education is really looking hard at temporary facilities, but with children and not to mention the issue with ADA.
Think what we want to do is just a blanket, a statement that the DOE should be exploring all options, and that includes working with other agencies, especially the DOT and also parks and any other agency, to explore any possible space that could expand the amount of space.
On, a bigger point to how Mark started this conversation about how we do not know if schools are going to open.
Extremely quickly, Because parents have just the next few weeks before we have to tell the doa whether we're sending our students to school in September If we're going, 100 remote and there's a lot of information that we're lacking.
We did remote schooling from you, know, Mid- march, until the end of the year, and while we had a decent experience, it is far short of an in- person, experience, and so I do think that anything that we could do to give our schools and the district a chance at getting more kids, giving more kids an in- person school experience would be sort of the best thing that we can do.
I think what we're talking about is offering schools the greatest possible latitude to provide an education which is more difficult than ever So to the extent we can give them another tool, a closed, street.
So, like Cindy and rich and Fema I'd support a general statement that encourages schools and officials to really think creatively, while addressing both the opportunities and constraints that are specific to them, whatever those may be, because we do not have the expertise to do that.
We're talking about a blended model where families that again need to go to work and do not have reliable child care are struggling to think about how they're going to manage their children.
It's going to continue to be difficult, the more children we can get into schools in a safe, way, the more equitable our city will be so that I think, is a top priority and you know we need to have space.
I. Think several board members expressed what I believe, which is that focusing on outdoor space, misses a much larger point, Is that the city should be scrounging around for every available.
It includes churches after school centers and the focus solely on outdoor space really does not it's a small percentage of what might be available in the city, so I would favor if we're going to write a letter.
Thank you for contributing to our conversation, I think, given the hour and the fact that our council member is patiently waiting for us that it's time to wrap this up, We all agree that a resolution voted on September-- and this is almost the entirety of the point-- is that I will draft something in the way of a letter that takes in and is, I was about to say, school.
The agenda item that we want to welcome you to discuss is in part relating to our district needs statement and our work for that, but in turn there is a And I'm, going to turn the ball over to Cindy Cardinal, who is the chair of our of our budget and strategy committee, but to sort of tee it up.
That's on this tax and if you're interested, I can talk more about it in terms of the Community Board's district You know, I would urge you to focus on basic government.
I. Do not schools just do not know whether or not they will need more space.
One of the things that our budget committee was actually talking about was how the list of most pressing issues overall, that New York City planning, puts out and as far as I know, it's What, we're using still this year does not have some of the issues I mean you can check other and write in, but affordable, housing, yes, You know.
You know beyond obviously, nurses and social workers and All the schools, affordable, housing, I think, was our number one priority.
You know that are doing phenomenal work in terms of getting food out to people and west side campaign against hunger, the other staple, and they will all tell you they need more funding, right, And so I have not come through the budget, and I do not even know that I'd be able to read between the lines, because I know how sometimes budgets are written.
By the same token, you know, I think, there's an element to which one could say: Commissioner Garcia was a really good soldier in terms of being a commissioner and took many more cuts than other agencies did right or wrong, but The main point is, to the extent the community board could be supportive of the city borrowing and contemplate even a resolution about it and then send it to your state, elected officials.
The next part of our conversation, And I'm, going to look again at our budget, We're going to talk about next is the nitty gritty of getting a district needs statement in order and in place and how we want to go about doing that in timing and so forth.
What needs to be advocated for what is being cut beyond fat, although I know most of them would not think there was any fat already, and then we were talking today that we had a committee meeting in terms of preservation.
Incredible, that incredible resource that you're going to provide to the community and tomorrow at noon and by the way kudos for both of your meetings being at during the day when business people can actually focus in on them and join and make use of them.
I tried that this past month, our business agenda kind of went past that time, but it did seem to work a little better and I was just wondering if anybody had any comments or alternatives that they would like us to consider with respect to the full board.
If you think one is going to have a bigger block of people that want to speak, then you, then you allow, you know, let's say half an hour or 40 minutes.
Although I think we only have three items on the agenda, I do not know who's actually going to be back from Albany and wanting to show up.
I just have to say, mark that, even when you say that we're doing the business session first, we have interrupted our meetings numerous times for public figures to come in You know, I think it's important for you to either.
You know set it that the business agenda is always going to come.
Just think it's been a real disservice to a lot of board members who give up their volunteer time when we have people talking about the same things sometimes do not even know what they're talking about when they get on a call, and What I tried to do last.
We know that when Paul like, when elected officials and candidates and people show up at meetings, they're going to want to talk, But the September full board meeting is still six weeks away from now.
Given the crisis that we're in that we're going to want to discuss and likely vote on at the full board, meeting, and I'm wondering if it makes sense to have some kind of ad hoc meeting in advance of it or some way of bringing up new business and voting on it on whatever the crisis might be.
We could consider that I do not think it's important this year, because we're going to be doing it by zoom from wherever we are anyway, but I just would like to know.
Okay, I think this brings up the urgent idea of appointing a committee to work with Josh yep The only other thing is the review of the Full board agenda, which was circulated and essentially has three items on it right: now.
I know that the office that you're limited in terms of administrative support, but do you have any ideas to when we may get a new board, list.
