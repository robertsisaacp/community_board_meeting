The community education council tomorrow night will be taking up a resolution that also calls for the creative use of outdoor space and has additional facts and thoughts.
It seems to me that a letter would be possible leveraging those of statements of our board to then go the next mile and say to the extent that there are plans for in-person education, that they should include the ability to use outdoor spaces, whether they be parks or curbside or plazas, or whatever it is.
But given the fact that there is no control once you're outside of those areas in terms and sometimes even in those areas of outsiders who will say, I like this- The last person who complains about people on the street, I think, and certainly in the park.
This would just, I think, exacerbate that need that need for creating legal, legalistic documents, but I hate to you know, but I think things that we have talked about and had resolutions support, outdoor learning, so rooftops yards playgrounds, but not streets or parks.
Yeah this you know we were able to to build a hospital in central park, pretty much overnight in tents and there's no reason why we can't cordon off streets and sidewalks in front of schools to expand their footprint.
I've, served on the task force about reopening and one of the things that school wanted to inquire of the community board and the council member about Was potential use of the street as a type of a play.
So, I, would, I would definitely endorse sending some kind of letter giving schools as much space, especially outdoor space, which everybody knows is much safer and less likely to help spread.
I. Think it's great to write a letter in support and that we would give assistance when called for the specific sites, but I'm kind of with shelly that we're opening up a can of worms here, The class size, the kids capacity We- don't need to go school by school and I.
Think what we want to do is just a blanket, a statement that the DOE should be exploring all options, and that includes working with other agencies, especially the DOT and also parks and any other agency, to explore any possible space that could expand the amount of space that's available for schools, and I.
On, a bigger point to how mark started this conversation about how we don't know if schools are going to open.
If we're going, 100 remote and there's a lot of information that we're lacking, that we need to have to be able to make that decision and that's something I think And I know it's we're getting into august, but we might consider having a town hall just to hear from parents in the next week or so to hear what are those questions and put that out for elected officials and for the doa to hear you know.
One size does not fit all in terms of solution, but giving schools an opportunity to use outdoor space vacant, storefronts, The school, both in conjunction with DOE any school administrators individually, decide, I think, is something that we could support and especially if it means that more kids could have an in-person experience rather than remote.
They would take the space and because you're not going to have lots of them, even if you have any in our parks, and it would lead to inequities that I think would be a bad thing.
I think what we're talking about is offering schools the greatest possible latitude to provide an education which is more difficult than ever So to the extent we can give them another tool, a closed, street.
So like cindy and rich and fema I'd support a general statement that encourages schools and officials to really think creatively.
And I can tell you this we're in a time of crisis and the idea that we wouldn't explore something because of things that could happen, but we don't know, seems counterproductive to the way I would think about.
We're talking about a blended model where families that again need to go to work and don't have reliable child care are struggling to think about how they're going to manage their children.
It's going to continue to be difficult, the more children we can get into schools in a safe, way, the more equitable our city will be so that I think, is a top priority and you know we need to have space.
The agenda item that we want to welcome you to discuss is in part relating to our district needs statement and our work for that, but in turn there is a Who is the chair of our of our budget and strategy committee, but to sort of tee it up.
Think the department of education feels confident that principals are going to work out a nine to one nine students to one teacher ratio in all the buildings, but so I'm a little less worried about space.
You know beyond obviously, nurses and social workers and All the schools, affordable, housing, I think, was our number one priority.
You know that are doing phenomenal work in terms of getting food out to people and west side campaign against hunger, the other staple, and they will all tell you they need more funding, right, And so I haven't come through the budget, and I.
I mean, I think the main point is to the extent the community board could be supportive of the city borrowing and contemplate even a resolution about it and then send it to your state, elected officials.
But if we're, if we're just cutting programs and services, why would people come back to new york city in order to get a jump start our commute our economy after you know , there's a vaccine, so obviously borrowing is something that I am very familiar.
We're going to talk about next is the nitty gritty of getting a district needs statement in order and in place and how we want to go about doing that in timing and so forth.
I tried that this past month, our business agenda kind of went past that time, but it did seem to work a little better and I was just wondering if anybody had any comments or alternatives that they would like us to consider with respect to the full board.
If you think one is going to have a bigger block of people that want to speak, then you, then you allow, you know, let's say half an hour or 40 minutes.
I just have to say, mark that, even when you say that we're doing the business session first, we have interrupted our meetings numerous times for public figures to come in Do that, and you know, I think it's important for you to Either.
You know set it that the business agenda is always going to come.
Just think it's been a real disservice to a lot of board members who give up their volunteer time when we have people talking about the same things.
We know that when paul like, when elected officials and candidates and people show up at meetings, they're going to want to talk- And I'm sure that there are going to be issues before the community.
Just, given the crisis that we're in that we're going to want to discuss and likely vote on at the full board, meeting, and I'm wondering if it makes sense to have some kind of ad hoc meeting in advance of it or some way of bringing up new business and voting on it on whatever the crisis might be.
Don't think it's important this year because we're going to be doing it by zoom from wherever we are anyway, but I just would like to know.
Okay, I think this brings up the urgent idea of appointing a committee to work with josh yep The only other thing is the review of the full board agenda, which was circulated and essentially has three items on it right: now.
Lane got it okay, so those are the five items for committees that will be the full board agenda for september 1st I'm just wondering if we need to switch the agenda order at all, between, I, don't think transfer the 72nd street is going to be overly controversial, but there are no.
Thanks, I know that the office that you're limited in terms of administrative support, but do you have any ideas to when we may get a new board, list?
