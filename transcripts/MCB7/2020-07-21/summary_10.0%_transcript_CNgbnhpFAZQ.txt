It was that team of folks that was you rich robbins doug bob wyman from the community, a bunch of other folks The first order of business is the thank you for having a quorum of steering at 6, 32 pm, It's, really terrific, when people show up on time and helps to make meeting management that much better you'll see on our agenda that the first topic was the budget.
It seems to me that a letter would be possible leveraging those of statements of our board to then go the next mile and say to the extent that there are plans for in-person education, that they should include the ability to use outdoor spaces, whether they be parks or curbside or plazas or whatever it is that might be available to each particular school Going to call on you first but I'd be curious to see, first of all, to hear your thoughts about whether that is a fair leveraging of prior community board statements and, secondly, whether you think that is an appropriate thing for our board to be doing regardless.
I think it's treacherous the idea of curbside or park classes I would support rooftop on schools that have rooftops that are safe using outdoor yards and those type of spaces, but given the fact that there is no control once you're outside of those areas in terms and sometimes even in those areas of outsiders who will say, I like this- The last person who complains about people on the street, I think and certainly in the park I think that it's a great idea to have open-air classes, but within the confines of school, just a little side.
To begin with this would just I think exacerbate that need that need for creating legal, legalistic documents, but I hate to you know, but I think things that we have talked about and had resolutions support, outdoor learning, so rooftops yards playgrounds, but not streets or parks.
I would also add that any outdoor space used for learning can only be temporary, because, eventually you have rain, you have high winds, it would get cold and those places would no longer be viable for destruction, so they would have to have a permanent place inside whether they will meet you know we were able to to build a hospital in central park, pretty much overnight in tents and there's no reason why we can't cordon off streets and sidewalks in front of schools to expand their footprint.
Saying that you know we support any other options that may be available so that the students aren't standing outside for two hours, just waiting to get into a building and then having to exit You said that you agreed with shelley, but shelley was pretty clear that he thought that it should only be spaces that are already pertinent to a school.
We've been I've, served on the task force about reopening and one of the things that school wanted to inquire of the community board and the council member about was potential use of the street as a type of a play.
Okay, I I'm sure all of us have seen the curbside dining facilities, and somebody else mentioned that Use I just don't know what people are suggesting when they say herbicide and I think that no I think we will be exposing our students, our faculty parents, who might be waiting to order emission students would be cheat to joe with traffic Not sure why I would just say for the upper west side here where I am There is a mammoth playground that runs from 100th street in amsterdam to 102nd from amsterdam over to columbus, where one could set up multiple classrooms, that's under the ages of the parks department, but just to cut it short I just would say that we should look into park, spaces that are available and usable and should not rule out the possibility of getting trailers, because at 163, which is next door to me, have been held in trailers for years now.
I mean I'm, surprised that you know the department of education is really looking hard at temporary facilities, but with children and not to mention the issue with ada I think it's great to write a letter in support and that we would give assistance when called for the specific sites, but I'm kind of with shelly that we're opening up a can of worms here, the class size, the kids capacity We, don't need to go school by school and I.
Think what we want to do is just a blanket, a statement that the DOE should be exploring all options, and that includes working with other agencies, especially the DOT and also parks and any other agency, to explore any possible space that could expand the amount of space that's available for schools and I.
But there are a number of members of our community who are extremely concerned about a number of big questions that haven't been answered, and one thing we might do is just try to raise a list of the most important questions that should be answered extremely quickly, because parents have just the next few weeks before we have to tell the doa whether we're sending our students to school in september or, if we're going, 100 remote and there's a lot of information that we're lacking.
These are some questions that you need to be answering so that parents can make the right decisions and that reflect some of the concerns that the community has and we did remote schooling from you know mid-march until the end of the year, and while we had a decent experience, it is far short of an in-person experience and so I do think that anything that we could do to give our schools and the district a chance at getting more kids.
What I, believe we began talking about was the fact that we as a board do best when we support the decision-making processes and the decisions made by those with the greatest most specific expertise for coming out and making some very specific recommendations so like cindy and rich and fema I'd support a general statement that encourages schools and officials to really think creatively, While addressing both the opportunities and constraints that are specific to them, whatever those may be, because we don't have the expertise to do that.
I know we can't necessarily do a resolution because we don't have full board in august, so I just wanted to clarify the logistics of how we move forward, but I'm in support We were talking about one or one or the other of those two things I'll interrupt for just a second, the In order to be timely.
What I propose to do since I think we all agree that a resolution voted on september- is that I will draft something in the way of a letter that takes in and is I was about to say, school Forgive me that is informed by all the comments, including those from those who have expressed significant concerns about particular uses of outside space and informed by the call for a much more general letter.
The much more general call for creative space The agenda item that we want to welcome you to discuss is in part relating to our district and I'm going to turn the ball over to cindy cardinal, who is the chair of our of our budget and strategy committee, but to sort of tee it up.
One of the things that our budget committee was actually talking about was how the list of most pressing issues overall, that new york city planning puts out and as far as I know it's what we're using still this year doesn't have some of the issues I mean you can check other and write in but affordable housing.
You know that are doing phenomenal work in terms of getting food out to people and west side campaign against hunger, the other staple, and they will all tell you they need more funding right and so I haven't come through the budget and I.
Think the main point is to the extent the community board could be supportive of the city borrowing and contemplate even a resolution about it and then send it to your state elected officials That's where that has to go and just wanted to highlight that our june 2nd resolution on education funding did include an endorsement of borrowing in order to fund some of the of the putbacks of education.
Economists are saying: I mean economists have been saying: The city will come back in 2024, you know, but if we're, if we're just cutting programs and services, why would people come back to new york city in order to get a jump start our commute our economy after you know , there's a vaccine, so obviously borrowing is something that I am very familiar with, and I've done a lot of research on this people, I mean mta, is screwed, yep, sorry, nothing, personal Despite, your best efforts, andrew very good I'm, going to open up to for a few questions for the council member I think in terms of education.
Information about you know, helping small business owners find funding where to find it now why they didn't get it, how they can better get it You want to add something, and only that the part of the discussion will be also what they need to do to get that funding, Incredible, that incredible resource that you're gonna provide to the community and tomorrow at noon and by the way kudos for both of your meetings being at during the day when business people can actually focus in on them and join and make use of them.
It may be that we have to We have to do a roll call vote right, which you know, votes are always available to be reviewed at the board office, but but not announced person by person If. Okay, and that I think concludes our agenda unless there's new business that anybody wants to raise Mr friedman, I'm going to encourage you to use the chat.
