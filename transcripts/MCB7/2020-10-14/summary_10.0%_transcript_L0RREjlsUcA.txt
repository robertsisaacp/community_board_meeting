No we're just chatting great, because I know there are a lot of people who want to talk about Revel and about the helicopters.
You said in the meeting, because I was looking at the video from last just to see that my memory was serving me that we wanted to talk to the commanding officers, possibly about what they can do, even though, because they understand it's, a policy city- wide not to pursue, but maybe there are other ways to to stop they're not scheduled to attend.
One is discussion of a resolution supporting a bill in the New York Legislature S07876, which would assign pedestrian safety rating for every motor vehicle.
I. Think it's all worthwhile, but ken one thing you did not mention: Does it rate safety on accidents versus other vehicles or just pedestrians and bicyclists?
There is a a significant safety advantage When people in the crosswalk have a better view of the cars coming and cars and cars have a better view of the people on the crosswalk when cars park close to the crosswalk, there's a blind spot that clearly results in injuries and unsafe conditions, and so what this resolution proposes is to daylight, the those intersections that where people with particular vulnerabilities, namely children and seniors, are present and to try to make those inter increase.
I'm, not a committee member, obviously, but the one thing that I would want to make sure that we've leave room for is a follow- up to the discussion we had last month and in July about the request by people with disabilities to change certain parking regulations so that their placard would allow them to park a vehicle that allows handicap.
It's a white sign with red letters, then the placard can probably be used and if it's a red sign with white letters I know I'm oversimplifying, but I would like to leave just enough room so that some of these accommodations might also be made, because it's kind of in the same spirit as the day lighting that you're talking about Mark You're, talking about parking adjacent to intersections, not in intersections.
You should say that, because in some areas where there is a bid that can help with the maintenance, when we do daylight and intersection like that, we would probably have a planter and a quick curb so that no one can you know pretty much be in that space.
I know just like the ideal situation is where you can ultimately bump out the the sidewalk in the crosswalk, making a shorter crossing distance and a more attractive intersection for pedestrians, but that's down the road , it's capital, money, Now, we're talking about all schools right and senior centers, but I would not us.
That is very depressing, as he and I think six other Congress members had put forth that legislation, the improving Safety Helicopter Act of 2019 in October, As well, we'd have to get Schumer, but at least it was a federal ask by Congressman Nadler for the first time, given that he and others have been fighting this issue for over 20 years.
You know, we've been Andrew, Rosenthal and I have been reaching out to people throughout the city, different boroughs as well, and we're going to reach out to New Jersey.
You know, Brewer has been asking for a long time to have numbers and identifying words on the bellies of the helicopters, and you know we're open to other ideas, because right, now, they're, not they're, not a party to the 2016 agreement with the city in the lower Manhattan heliport, because these are all flying from New. Jersey people have the Flightradar24 Flight Tracker app, which I recommend everyone download the free one on your iphone.
There are a lot of folks who do not join these types of community meetings, who are flying privately into and out of Manhattan, and that needs to be regulated in a responsible, way, and That's come to me over the past few months as something that, especially in the Covid-19 era, people won't get on the subway, but they'll get in their private helicopter to drive.
A lot, and I look forward to speaking with the team and remaining on the transportation committee on CB7 to try to address it and really prioritize it in a way that we need to get.
We have some decently reliable statistics, because my thought would be certainly for the activists on this issue, the focus and perhaps put pressure on the organizations that are operating these helicopters, and I think we should know if there are pressure points by who's operating them.
Who is doing research on this, so you could use you know you could easily go online and search helicopter tours New Jersey over New, York, City and you're, going to pull up a lot of these companies like liberty, For, us, I think that the industry is supposed to be self- reporting, and so it would be in just interesting if we could get the information directly from the industry as well, and I do not know if that would require some kind of a foia FOIL request.
Somebody else knows, but I also believe that Gail Brewer's office was supposed to be compiling, updated information on this like way back when we all met in cb7's offices before the federal legislation was proposed by Nadler.
There was an awful lot of helicopters going to and from Teterboro airport for people who had private planes and then were coming back either from the hamptons or wherever other points in the northeast.
I do not know if the community is going to speak up, but if they are not all right from the community, maybe committee questions first, I think that we serve the community, so I think it would be great to hear from the community first.
We sit in New York City under Class B airspace as class A b and C air space, which is restrictive, airspace, limited to IFR, instrument, rated pilots Then there's a VFR visual flight rules corridor over the Hudson, which is a north to southbound kind of like a highway and those that's only used in visual flight, rules, weather and under certain altitude and so in.
There's ways to do that where you can have these noise abatement proceedings effective, again, it's a federal policy, but you could ask for it for certain days of the week, They know what they can do, what they can't do, and the noise abatement procedures actually even limit the amount of power that an aircraft can use in throttling up in a certain area.
Obviously, New York Metro is an incredibly busy area with you, know, with three major airports: they're having problems handling well with Covid-19, A helicopter has been flying around for about the last 10 minutes.
I want to ask Melissa, given that what were mainly what you're, mainly complaining about, which is, are the tour helicopters that, for instance, I understand, go to central Park and fly around Central park and show people what it looks like from 5,000 feet or whatever, given about fifteen hundred feet, What is the utility or the purpose of the Rosenthal and Chen bills?
That would be local laws that, given that we can't control, apparently, who comes into our airspace from New Jersey We wanted to get a sense of what their reasoning was, and if there was something that we could do, we're, also reaching out to people that we know in New Jersey some electives.
You know maybe combined with our local New, York, City, regs or laws, and then people who are very frustrated along the New Jersey path.
We understand they're people in Jersey City, like I, said, hoboken, Almost, a coordinated, if possible, multi, state effort and by the way you know this issue is not unique to the New York Metropolitan area.
If people know of her, we should try to get in touch with her and just see if there's a way that she might be involved.
Yes, main thing I wanted to talk about is the issue of traffic helicopters, and I know Andrew, you mentioned at the beginning.
There was an issue on the West side highway and there were potentially four traffic helicopters hovering overhead just to get a 10 second shot that they could use on their news of a traffic backup, and for me you know having them that early in the morning is just egregious.
They'd want to be good neighbors, especially ABC TV is in our district, a lot of journalists and reporters live on the upper West side, And They're, really creating a huge nuisance for the people, they're supposed to be serving.
And I see Melissa wrote that there's a first amendment issue and I'm not talking about banning free speech here, I'm talking about working with them to try to find creative solutions so that they're not antagonizing the neighborhoods that they're supposed to be serving and which they do their business in and which many of them live, and just to make them realize that the neighborhood really is offended that they would create such a nuisance right But you can, of course see that one channel does not want to be outdone by the other, so they're all going to have helicopters pretty obviously, but yes, I think we can.
If April joins us, after being with community board nine, we will ask her that Jay has his hand up and then mark, I think, wants to speak just a quick, suggestion.
So I actually will listen and you can hear you know ABC and CBS and NBC helicopters, and then you have a real problem, because I've actually heard this in real time where the NYPD has to ask the news copters to clear out, because they're involved in an active, scene.
Last week there of the you know, That, of course, I sent you those stats, so we know that you know the flights have decreased out of the heliports, but EDC stance at the moment is that they think that a there's a lot more tourist flights coming out of New Jersey, that's causing this traffic, which has always been the issue, but then b.
They have it and they're looking into it great, because we raised issues with access to the curb and the West 72nd street Howard, I.
You know he really meant kind of open- ended until the virus issues, hopefully God willing, are resolved or literally permanent, Jay. Jay, I, mean, I think, we're still working logistically with city Hall, and you know fine- tuning.
If we're talking about permanent or even long, term, I mean we have processes for things like sidewalk, cafes, etc, and if these things are going to be even semi, Permanent, I think that we need to have some process of evaluation for each one.
I think it just adds just a great new dimension to New York, City, obviously much more so in the nice weather, but it just you know, really enlivens the streets.
Having said that, I think there are ways that in making it permanent, it could be There's potential room for improvement, and, in my mind, that really gets back to sidewalk use and the need for.
I. Think we've benefited not just from having additional recreation space during a pandemic, but we've the streets that are open streets are undeniably safer , they're much easier for delivery vehicles to park and unload They're, quieter and more pleasant streets, and they also reduce overall traffic in the neighborhood by implicitly discouraging driving.
The, West, End Avenue open street was there's a great deal of confusion on my mind about exactly how that's being monitored and administered and to the extent that we talk about extending this, I, think we need to be a lot clearer than we are right.
I think it's a little bit like we were talking about the open, seating, restaurant issue, where a great idea was pulled together at the drop of a hat to to address a need.
I want to echo what another person said to people before me about the safety issues, which I think we all are aware.
I. Think signage is a huge issue, because a lot of people who turn on these streets have no idea that they're closed And You can't read: them: Maybe people would see it better.
I know it involves community and involves time, but I think there's a way to make the open street on West end and elsewhere, really a fun space.
This is Jesse, I'm living in upper west side near Riverside, drive and My question is simple: regarding street parking, and recently I saw a lot of off- state license plate vehicle parking upper West side for a whole week because of the pandemic, season, city, changer, parking, regulation, and I believe we have both already submitted requests to study this situation in the in April 2020.
It was to figure out what was going on with the curb and find out, and you know find the best use for this space is a concern we hear in almost every meeting And so that I, the sooner we hear about it, the better and obviously the pandemic, makes everything.
But right now, that's the situation and again we want it looked at to see if there's a way that the situation can be improved, one more hand, I live at 96th and west end.
I felt, like I, had to yell at people to get off the street, because there were cars going back and forth all over the place between 95th and 96th.
Basically, every night I think if there are people who have a real need to be able to park near their homes, I wonder if we should have something more permanent and more legal than this illegal, but you know potentially necessary parking.
We convert regular spots to accessible spots, but I think we do not want to encourage people to or even allow people to park on a narrow street either on the street, blocking traffic or or on the sidewalk, and the precinct does not do anything about it.
As Ken mentioned, more people are riding than ever: And I'd hate for it to just lose momentum, not get it the attention it needs and for there to be another fatality- As we talked about in that meeting, there is no safe legal way for bicycles to cross the park, except at 72nd street.
You know during rush hour as people are coming back and using public transportation.
Yes, I do I'd like to go back to the bicycles for a moment, and I know: you're looking for new business for next for the agenda for next month, and this probably, I suspect, is not new business, but I appreciate the concern for bicyclists, but there's also a big concern, obviously for pedestrians, particularly on Columbus and Amsterdam avenue.
