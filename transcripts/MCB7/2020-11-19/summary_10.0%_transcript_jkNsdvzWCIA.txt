And, of course, our own Bloomingdale neighborhood history group, which is very happy to present this program in conjunction with community Board 7 and Borough President Gail Brewer.
Ethel lived through and was a leader in Community, Board, 7's response to various proposals leading to the development of Riverside, South and Riverside center.
She worked tirelessly and with single-minded devotion to the difficult task of examining the pros and cons of project, developing detailed responses and negotiating as best we could as an advisory board with the developers with civic groups and with the city.
Mr Trump's plans for Riverside South had to go through Community board advisory review.
And also I just want to thank Richard, because we know each other a long time and Richard had a great deal to do with all of these negotiations and discussions.
Then as I track some of that over the years I, and it includes Lincoln West, which I will spend more time on, because that was very important as the first proposal that went through Euler but then spend more time on the Riverside sales development, the process, the approvals and the details of the completed project along the way.
You know that you will have questions and the negotiations, the approvals and a little bit, maybe beginning to think about planning and then get to the the last segment of Riverside, South and Riverside center.
So here we are with yet another the same photo on the right, but the wonderful photo of the rail yards and and as many of you, especially the historians, but others of you, know, and I'm, going to take a little time, because it's not uninteresting in our community that this development land was a rail freight yard.
And, it's 59 to 72nd street and by 18 in the 1850s on an embankment near West, End Avenue, which I'm going to show you a map, an old map and with a span over a tidal lagoon, carried the Hudson river railroad, which became part of New York Central and the current site that we think of as Riverside staff was still underwater.
Next, please, okay, I'm, going to get to the bridge a minute, but I want to tell you quickly a little more history.
Just to show you how many development proposals were made in the 1960s and 70s until the 1970s, as I said, the rail yard was generally industrial, but as time went on, the railroad began to be in financial trouble.
There was again a friend not for many, but he did accomplish a great deal and that was Robert Moses, who did in the 30s and later really developed a park plan similar to what was to be Riverside south based on moving the highway east and down to grade and creating hundreds and even thousands of units.
I'm going to spend time, because here we move to Lincoln West, which in a moment the next slide I will spend some time with, because that's when the community board and the planning and Euler function, occurs.
So, the first proposed the Lincoln West people put forward, a proposal of which you see a model on the right of about a little less than 5,000 units spread across eight towers and then a number of other small, smaller buildings.
Certainly the board of estimate, which was much later declared unconstitutional was composed of the mayor, the president of the City Council, the controller and the five borough presidents, not a big organism, not a big entity, but with enormous power, believe it or not, and I mean for those in the know.
Think I was involved with all sorts of SRO matters and community matters, but not necessarily land use, but okay, I became chair and learned a great deal about land use.
We only knew about the power, but also the approval occurred at 2 a.m, and we were in city hall at 2 a.m, though the board of estimate had clearly indicated that it was going to pass this project.
However afterwards, after the approval occurred, a variety of community groups, many of whom I think may even still be represented or have the history on the community board.
The borough president helped with for the community board to do to get what guess, what planning and legal consultants to help in reviewing the this the site and just go back.
Seven had engaged through the help of public money had engaged legal and technical consultants, and they were then a name whom I think many of you are very familiar with because he went on and is very well known as a design planner, namely Michael Kortler, and then Bob Davis, Robert Davis, who had been counsel to the Department of City planning and became a partner at the revered and so wonderful extraordinary law firm, which did public interest.
It had no legal standing, but we wrote it and city planning looked at it and the developers were amazed that they were going to have to somehow deal with this city planning disliked most of the planning guidelines that Michael Cordler encouraged us to engage in, and we did have then that memorandum of understanding, okay, Community Board 7, however, disapproved the original proposal.
Writing of a memorandum of understanding on design process continues so that for those of you years later and with other chair people into the 80s, contribute to the eq very remarkable achievement of community board 7 in 1987.
They still want to unload it for a hundred million, and then two proposals which are I will go over quickly because it's worth just taking the few minutes in order to set the stage for, for then the Riverside south that we will spend time on.
They would move from Rockefeller Center, and the plan involves 15.5 million square feet of residential retail office and studio construction, including 7,600 residential units, a large, the largest shopping mall on the East coast, and the centerpiece of the project designed by Helmut Yan, was to be the world's tallest building.
The world's tallest building and other towers would be 76, stories, high, built, north and south and so on, and he wanted to develop it immediately and break ground.
We have learned that didn't have to do with Trump the developer, but he said this proposal had no relation to the street and saw the city as an abstraction and, as Goldberger said, a game board on which you move buildings at will, and so other architects agreed about these isolated towers and planet said this is something really nasty to live.
If we could just move this slightly to the right, wait just the community opposition and the six groups here, we are formed what they call the Riverside, South planning corporation, to develop criteria for the site and a most remarkable political phenomenon.
Finally trump, recognizing that he wasn't going to get the very big projects that the opposition was too great in effect transformed the opponents into allies and what occurred was an acceptance of a new plan.
They are concerned that this proposal, which appear, which was we were told, was going to be seven or eight million square feet, at least by Trump, that it was still bigger than Lincoln West.
This is planning for a new city, but not only private development but essential services, and they said this is going to need a public school and a variety of other concerns about infrastructure and impacts, and they did recommend support for the relocation.
The major point was that a general large-scale district was included with approximately 15 development parcels and what that meant, with a maximum of a little less than eight million, and that it was seven more than CB7 wanted and a mixture of residential and community facilities and left everyone which we all lived to fight another day in 2010, the last sites of Lmnn, which were going to be television studios and said.
The developers over time did only 12 percent and the developer was to construct Riverside boulevard to create a, and this is a private, a park with private funds, from the developer and from the residents of 21 acres and then over at a variety of other alternative, and the big thing was to bring the highway down.
Here we are recognizably and I move as quickly as possible through the long development story, and you recognize here the buildings that have been built and if you look carefully, please, you will see in gold lettering the trump place, which was a fixed and great big goal.
The goal was, as you can see, on the left, as the rendering was that Riverside south should look as much as possible, like the Upper West side, that it would evoke central Park, West.
During these many years, the great wonderful addiction, was, of course, the building of Riverside South park, and this occurs.
Turned and it turned into rules and the restrictive declarations and a corporation was established called the Riverside South planning corporation in agreement with the New York City Parks Department, who are in charge of designing the park, and it was Ballsley and associates six phases, and here we are the big thing about this park, among others.
Here is another example, which was of the rendering of developed by Ballsley of the buildings the park the highway and the big pier going out into the water at 70th street, which is a considerable amenity in the distance.
It was one of the I think a huge outreach and wonderful work, and this gives you just an idea of the site plan and then the community board modifications of more open, space, fewer buildings, more openness and improvement in circulation.
I'm, not going, but community board 7 disapproved this new Euler with the many conditions.
We go on next, please and the city Council does approve the project and read brings and construction of a new school Gail who is here does and I will let her speak about it, but she very much focuses on affordable housing and the need for it to be on site, and.
And I took this quote simply from James Lindsey Leslie, the President of Gid, who I think may live in a water line square and who says there at last, the new Far West side, neighborhood will now be cohesive and Thou has come to fruition.
To give you a sense of the variety and the other issues, Ron Schiffman, who was involved with Riverside south and is a very important planner and a great advocate for diversity, affordability and equity said this.
And I'm, just summarizing that community board 7 in the many years since began to welcome development on this site to strike a balance between private and public needs, local concerns and city growth, short-term advantage and learned.
I have a list here of where some of the other money, the 60 million, which was the total amount based on the collegiate school deal, and that you know you negotiated as a member of the board.
We had to focus on whether at one point I knew that whether it was excel or Rli wanted to make a big wall to make sure that Riverside center looked like a walled city, and we had to make sure that it was a flat entrance.
And I think those of you on the board know, but it is mostly from the development they do have to put a lot of money in and between the conservancy, the Parks Department and the money that goes in there and the building that continues.
Well, we I know, what's going on, God of Riverside could use it for a building, but they have no freaking ways, use, my friends and HPD of releasing the money.
We had learned that the project that doesn't have through access and inviting public spaces to get from West End Avenue to the park was a big mistake and if you look at the plans for waterfront what a lot square.
The idea that Charette was probably the first time anyone had seen in New York had seen such a process and then later you know later on, coming back to it with Riverside center.
And I think this is one area where the community board gets deeply involved, but the follow up.
What's the amount has a change and who does that money go to New York City Parks, the conservancy or somewhere else.
It I think it would be another good thing for us all to do to see how the park is being funded now, because the the construction costs were way more than ever anticipated millions and millions more.
You know my son does go to the new school in Riverside south.
Of course, don't like this, but I think that all of us have to do that and in some ways the city is inadequately.
You know the charrette, which was a wonderful piece of work spearheaded by Ethel, did not have a great immediate effect right, but I think in the building of the subsequent buildings.
One thing, I think that we, the community board, could do is make sure that Riverside boulevard is an operating street.
As far as the including the railroad yards and the dock work, and the docks that were there, I was wondering if you know of any effort to to do, this, I think would increase the appreciation of the park of the area.
