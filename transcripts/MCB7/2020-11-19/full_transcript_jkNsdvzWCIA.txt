Just want to make sure the live stream works, so it's 6:26 we're going live stream how's my resolution much better than mine, uh-huh, okay, because I have a cable that I can attach to my modem, but I. Don't have it on right now, because now you're, fine, it's there I keep forgetting it and trip over it all right, I'm going to start the webinar that will start letting people in as attendees okay. There were over 300 people that were signed up for this wow, although it is not atypical for more people to sign up than actually attend yeah, that's usually the case yeah. A lot of people who didn't sign up may attend so well. Can they get in? They have to register to get in. Oh, okay, that's our firewall defense against zoom bombing. As best we can knock on wood, major phenomenon for a while I, don't know. If it still is, we got zoom bombed at I think it was yell. Why would someone do that? The same reason that people write graffiti I think yeah that's right looks like you got 52 participants. So far, oh, it's gone up. 53 56. see the number. Yes, how do? How are you saying it? If you look under at the bottom there's something says: participants yeah! Well, I'm not I. Don't have don't distract yourself. I thought we now have seven thousand four hundred and twenty participants. Oh good. What now you're talking nice to hear that I see the list? Yeah they're, all community board members, no, there's a lot of there's a lot of a lot of good folks from the neighborhood too, and remember that we're live streaming and we are hey Peter and we are. We are recording. Oh wait, a minute, we're not recording! Why aren't we recording? Do you have to press the record button? I yeah I thought that came with the template, but apparently it didn't I, don't know yeah. But now we are thank God some, you know so we're all set okay, yeah and it says: recording live on YouTube at the top of my screen correct. That's the live stream. So if we got above 500 participants, the rest of the community would not be left out in the cold. They would be able to watch on our our YouTube screen. I'm now having trouble I see only you and I. Don't know what happened here. Ethel. What you have to do is manipulate your computer or move yourself, because only half your face is visible. Oh god help me well, actually I see all of Bethel. It's a better half, but you know yeah I, don't see anything Ethel. Are you using a laptop? Are you using Ethel I can see your whole face. Yep I can see you you're fine right now, I, don't I. Okay, so I said when you'll. Let me know I, don't know why I see you on this side and all that there is. It says zoom and I want to get back to view. So I'm not quite sure what's happened. I! I'm sorry! I can't help you there, but oh I, better sign in again. I think well go ahead and do it, but do it quickly because it's now 6:30. okay, oh god, I- may have to start again. You can leave the meeting and start again it's not a problem. We can all see you perfectly well. We can I know what you're saying and I thank you, but I'm going to start again. Okay go ahead, but do it now? Okay, I'm doing it right now, very good, we'll wait for you. Of course. It's a little like the bride at the wedding. We can't go anywhere without you, I wanna, and this is terrible because I don't even know it you're already in another meeting. Do you want to leave and join this meeting? Yes right, yeah you have to sign out of this one before you try to log back in she's, going all right: Ethel, okay, she's gone nice to see everybody. Okay, all right! Let's see we have 106 participants. Oh my heavens, want wanna, wait, one more minute and then we'll get started very good while we're waiting, I'm just going to mention to folks that we are live streaming. This on our YouTube channel and I will put in the chat the name of our YouTube channel, which is Manhattan, spelled out CB and then, and the number seven spelled out so Manhattan CB the word seven and it will be saved for future viewing. If anybody cares to do that and with that, I will put it in the chat and leave it to Richard to start the meeting when he thinks we're ready as soon as the number of participants doesn't grow, all right, well, I, think we'll start and hopefully, by the time Ethel talks there'll be more defense right now we have 121. Evans, that's more than enough, but I welcome. All just welcome to everybody good evening. My name is Richard Ashe, I'm the chair of the land, Use Committee of Community Board. Seven is proud to be co-sponsoring. This talk by Ethel Sheffer on the development of Riverside, South and Riverside center. Our co-sponsors this evening are the Bloomingdale Neighborhoods history group and everyone's favorite borough president, the honorable guild. We are grateful to Gail and to the Bloomingdale Group for helping us make this event possible and I would like to introduce Gilbert Tauber, who will say a few words on behalf of Bloomingdale. Thank you hi. Well, my name is Gil Tauber and I'm a member of the Bloomingdale Neighborhood history group we're a local historical organization devoted to the history of Manhattan's Upper West side. We do research, we collect source material and we present public programs such as this one. You can find out more about us on our website. That's upperwestsidehistory.org. Many people ask us about the name Bloomingdale, like many of our old place names. It comes from a dutch word: blomendal, meaning veil of flowers. In colonial times it referred to a large area on the west side of our island, including all of what's now community board, 7 plus parts of boards, 4 and 9. In the early 19 1700s. When the British built a road up the West side, it was called the Bloomingdale road. It was the ancestor of our present broadway. Before there was a central Park, Bloomingdale Square ran from 53rd to 57th streets between 8th and 9th Avenue. The Bloomingdale Dutch reform church was at 68th street and the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum was at 116Th Street in the early 1800s. As the West side became, more populated, distinct villages appeared among the farms and countries states of Bloomingdale Carsonville in the West 70S Seneca Village in the West 80S Bloomingdale Village in the West 90s and hundreds Manhattanville in the west, 120S and 30s. With the urbanization of the west side in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some of these names, faded and others appeared, but the name Bloomingdale is still very current in the blocks between 96th and 110th streets, where we have a Bloomingdale Public School, the Bloomingdale Branch Library, the Bloomingdale School of music, the Bloomingdale playground and thriving local organizations such as Bloomingdale aging in place and, of course, our own Bloomingdale neighborhood history group, which is very happy to present this program in conjunction with community Board 7 and Borough President Gail Brewer. Thank you back to you Richard. Thank you very much, I'm pleased now to introduce my friend and colleague of many decades Ethel Sheffer, who I suspect, needs no introduction. Ethel lived through and was a leader in Community, Board, 7's response to various proposals leading to the development of Riverside, South and Riverside center. She worked tirelessly and with single-minded devotion to the difficult task of examining the pros and cons of project, developing detailed responses and negotiating as best we could as an advisory board with the developers with civic groups and with the city. Lest anyone doubt the centrality of Ethel's role in the development of the project. I am pleased to share with you a kind of backhand endorsement by none other than president of the United States Donald Trump Mr Trump's plans for Riverside South had to go through Community board advisory review and, as a matter of course, the board chair and I went to see Mr Trump in his office on Fifth Avenue. We requested, as we frequently did, that Mr Trump make a contribution to enable the board to hire experts to assist in our review without hesitation, Mr Trump agreed to our request, but he had one condition. He said he would give us the money only if that woman, Ethel Sheffer took no part in our review. Since Ethel was central to the board's investigation and review, we told Mr Trump that we could not comply and we never got the money. It would take too long to describe and detail Ethel's central role in the development of Riverside, South and Riverside center. Suffice to say no one I know is better qualified to provide detailed insight into the development of these projects than Ethel. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the intricacies of land use rules, politics, architecture and finances. This will provide an invaluable opportunity at the conclusion of Ethel's talk. We hope to have Gail Brewer, say a few words and following that we will open the floor for questions and discussion Ethel the floor is yours. Well, thank you very much. I am overwhelmed by that and I just will tell you all that anecdote that Richard just recounted. He told me in 2016. In all the years, I had never heard that anecdote and after Trump became President. Richard told me that that's what had occurred I will say to you that after he mentioned it to me, that was hard for me to believe I inwardly, wore it like a badge of honor that he really did not want me back, because he knew too much already so. Okay and also I just want to thank Richard, because we know each other a long time and Richard had a great deal to do with all of these negotiations and discussions. So with that the way I'm going to do this, you know I, said 40 years. It's almost I think more than that, I'm going to track it a little bit more. Just with a little bit of history and honor of the fact that the urban history, the neighborhood history group is with us and and Mark, is helping in terms of moving the slides. So we can begin mark okay, Ethel, I'm just going to make a one quick announcement folks, while we're going to share our screen, so you can see the slide presentation. While we do that, we will not be able to see the chat or the Q&A. So I would ask you please to hold any comments between now and then until as Richard said, we finished the presentation because we won't be able to see them anyway. So without any further ado, I'm going to pull up the presentation and Ethel I think you are set to go right. Okay, so here is clearly the cover slide and I was fortunate. I chose these two photos on the left is the of the form of rail yards, but it's a terrific photo also because we can see Lincoln towers so important in our neighborhood, but so there it is, and there are many photos of the yard, but I thought that this was something that should go on me on the cover and, of course, this extraordinary photo of the borough and the completed at least Riverside south next, please mark okay, so I'm just I just want to tell you just a moment: I'll try to keep to this, but the what I'm going to try to do it. It's a lot to do is just I'm going to give an overview and, in some cases, more details with a special emphasis on the role of the community in the community board and I'll. Do a description, analysis of various development proposals, failures, issues and some politics and then as I track some of that over the years I, and it includes Lincoln West, which I will spend more time on, because that was very important as the first proposal that went through Euler but then spend more time on the Riverside sales development, the process, the approvals and the details of the completed project along the way I will try to emphasize some of the community concerns and of the community around on the Upper West side, and often opposition I, probably won't do it justice, but I'm prepared. You know that you will have questions and the negotiations, the approvals and a little bit, maybe beginning to think about planning and then get to the the last segment of Riverside, South and Riverside center so and then in a not in a somewhat unsystematic way and very quickly. I will try to just describe maybe some issues, some lessons who knows but and then leave it open for questions and comments from all of you. Next, please, okay, so here we are with yet another the same photo on the right, but the wonderful photo of the rail yards and and as many of you, especially the historians, but others of you know, and I'm going to take a little time, because it's not uninteresting in our community that this development land was a rail freight yard and it's 59 to 72nd street and by 18 in the 1850s on an embankment near West, End Avenue, which I'm going to show you a map, an old map and with a span over a tidal lagoon, carried the Hudson river railroad, which became part of New York Central and the current site that we think of as Riverside staff was still underwater then, but by 1880. What was river was transformed into landfill into the New York, central railroad and its vast 60th street yards next. Please now I found this map and it's such a beautiful one, I thought divine and it is a a map of 1916, but that blue line shows I just wanted to illustrate to you the example at the railroad in the early 20th century was rather close. Indeed, to West end Avenue, okay. Next, please, okay, I'm going to get to the bridge a minute, but I want to tell you quickly a little more history and then I'll come back in the night I just in the 1930s, the Then Parks Commissioner Robert Moses covered the rail track north of 72nd street, in what he dubbed the West side improvement project which also moved the rail lines below grade south of 60th street and that it was a huge project and that's what. Of course, he created what we know as a Henry, Hudson, Parkway and also our beloved Riverside park, was expanded to the Hudson river in such a way that the park and the road look as if they it was head on the Nash on a natural slope. Okay, until the 1970s, the rail yard was generally industrial and it was home to a printing print, a plant for the New, York Times and then eventually ABC studios, and we know that public housing was nearby and Lincoln towers was adjacent to the boundary along freedom place and there were and then I'll come back. I want to come back to this. In one now, this, of course, for many of you who are in the park, know that this is a current example. We all walk past it and you can see the two people who are really upper West Siders. Now we are walking past a the former railroad gantry. There are a couple of other relics, including some stone embankments of the original railroad, and this has now become a it's on the now, the national on the the site on the national historic places and the parks Department is hoping to make it a place for visitors and to preserve it. Okay. So now I'm going to I'm going to move, I'm going to give you an overview very quickly and then come back to a couple of the projects, just to show you how many development proposals were made in the 1960s and 70s until the 1970s, as I said, the rail yard was generally industrial, but as time went on, the railroad began to be in financial trouble. There had also been mergers between the pen, railroad and New York Central, and then it became pen, central, okay, so now I just so that merger occurred after financial difficulties and that it all finally contributed the financial problems to the demise of both rail yards, and it was, as I said, known as 10 yards, even though Penn Central owned it for only a brief time, and then they all went back. It all went bankrupt in 1971 and the rail yards were abandoned and the railroad was looking for developments. Okay, I'm going to do a quick review because it's of two or three of these and then as I say zero in on a couple of the proposals that were so important in our history in the community. I wanted to tell you first that and Peter Sampton was called me many times to make sure that I did not neglect. This first proposal, designed by that partnership and of Litho City a a proposal by the International Lithographers Union, and it was a plan for 15,000 residents, but it also was a remarkable master plan for the West side, including a pier, a heliport. A dock and a 21 acre park over the rail yards, which was still in use, then a little bit later and I have to move this a little bit. Let's see mark if you can just move the slide, get my slide. Overs wait a minute. I'm going to go back just like go back to the okay good, thanks, okay and then later on. There was again a friend not for many, but he did accomplish a great deal and that was Robert Moses, who did in the 30s and later really developed a park plan similar to what was to be Riverside south based on moving the highway east and down to grade and creating hundreds and even thousands of units at the time the New York State Department of transportation. This becomes very familiar in our own period, rejected that plan because of the cost and for those in the know, the Blumenthal amendment that for bad that a buried highway might alter a park. Many of you older, remember, Assemblyman Al Blumenthal, who was a respected legislator, and that amendment was very important in the development of parks. Okay, then, there were a couple of proposals from Grueson and partners early on housing development again based on moving the highway down East and down east of the highway and another, and yet another proposal that did not was proposed but did not go anyplace with the same program, but with a change in where this this highway would go. But now we move to and that's what I'm going to be coming now, I'm going to spend time, because here we move to Lincoln West, which in a moment the next slide I will spend some time with, because that's when the community board and the planning and Euler function occurs, I list also just to give you the overview that after Lincoln was thank you so much. That's so much better for me into the 80s that after I take a few minutes but very important time talking with you about Lincoln West, we will then go on to two other proposals by that became synonymous with Donald Trump and we'll come to that in a minute. I'll come back to this. Can you please go to the next slide and we will deal with Lincoln West now this proposal, colloquially in the press and I'm afraid by others, coal was proposed by the Macri Group otherwise known as in the common pollen. So those in the know, as the Argentinians, a group who bought the property which, from the Pan yards in partnership with the well-known at the time, investor Abe Hirschfeld in 1979 in Hirschfeld, has already been given a purchase option by Penn Central. Please note everybody that as to keep in mind that as Penn Central and the railroads are changing and going defunct and going bankrupt notice that the railroads are seeking to sell at all their property off to whatever developer would come around I telegraphed to you and it seems to me an important point: the city. The government was not seeking to purchase that huge, attractive land. Instead, everybody was looking for private Development. Lincoln West was new, of course, to New. York did hire an Argentinian who has since become one of the considered one of the most renowned architects in the country and in New York, namely Rafael Viñoly and I met him, and so did some of us when he was rather young from Argentina and one and was trying to learn how to deal with a with this strange political process in New, York City. So the first proposed the Lincoln West people put forward, a proposal of which you see a model on the right of about a little less than 5,000 units spread across eight towers and then a number of other small, smaller buildings. You can see that in the model it included a 500 room hotel and a million square feet of commercial and an office space. I'm getting to the I'm, go the next a couple of points here and then in the next slide. Yes, just go to this one, please and then come back to the other. Well, let's first, let's go to the overview. Go back, please mark! Thank you and then we'll get to this. Okay, this and so Lincoln West went through what the not the kind of Euler after the charter- rev change in 1989, but a public review and, of course, it's very important politically guess what was the entity for the final approval, and that was what the board of estimate and for those in the know, if I could ask anybody- and you could shout but I can tell you. Certainly the board of estimate which was much later declared unconstitutional was composed of the mayor, the president of the City Council, the controller and the five borough presidents, not a big organism, not a big entity, but with enormous power, believe it or not, and I mean for those in the know, but I, don't always say this somehow or other I hadn't. I've been on the community board only two or three years and somehow I became chair of the community board during this Lincoln West I was not particularly well versed in land use. In fact, just on a personal note, I've been doing other things. I was teaching political science at Barnard and at Brooklyn college and then and I. Think I was involved with all sorts of SRO matters and community matters, but not necessarily land use, but okay, I became chair and learned a great deal about land use, so the chair, the community board job, was to weigh in on this proposal, which essentially was- and this is the key thing to actually to finally change this zoning on this site from industrial rail uses to the more profitable and more likely to gain success, namely residential, and so there we were, and it was an exception. It was a complex process in which the Argentinians, though very genial, very careful, but indeed rather stunned by the fact that they were going through this process. The in 1982 after their proposal came board in 1980. The board of Estimate approved the sites for from the zoning from industrial manufacturing to commercial unit uses I want to tell you if I may, that it was an ex an extraordinary. A performance. I had never been through. Anything like that. I knew we all of us who were. There knew very little about the board of estimate. We only knew about the power, but also the approval occurred at 2 a.m, and we were in city hall at 2 a.m, though the board of estimate had clearly indicated that it was going to pass this project. The only dissenter was the borough president, who was then Andrew Stein. The final approval, then was for a little over seven million square feet. They got rid of the hotel and and and reduce the number of towers. Okay. Now what was now I'm go and then I'm going to I'll. I'm going to mention this, because this extraordinary this wonderful New, York Times article comes again by David Dunlop, who probably has the Ford almost the 40 here. History is one of the great journalists on the New York Times, but the board of estimate did pass the the proposal as modified and, however afterwards, after the approval occurred, a variety of community groups, many of whom I think may even still be represented or have the history on the community board. I'm not sure if Roberta was involved then or later, but they brought a suit against the approval on the grounds of density, on the grounds of an inadequate treatment of environmental alternatives. A whole variety of procedural criticisms about process and their litigation and their lawsuits resulted in a delay in the implementation of the project on for the people, the developers for at least 18 months and was in all that time they were began to be in financial trouble because of the delays. Another critical issue which continued to be raised was by our assemblyman, then Gerald Zadler, who was always and had been then and continued to be. The great advocate always and was that's for the from the promotion and the retention of industrial uses on that site at least partially and the word the acronym topsy. If you could guess what that is, for those of you, what it meant was trailer on flat car, and that was literally the way. The transfer points between trucks and trailers and railroad cars. And then those trucks would go on the highway to to deliver the goods. What his unrelenting and really quite wonderful and documented advocacy and the support for it, resulted, however, in the lawsuit and the delay, but an even a separate Euler to deal with autopsy, but in any case it was eliminated and a very critical. Just a statement was made by the city of New York for its development, which was manufacturing, is not the wave of the future and that it declared incompatible with housing and what we need. What New York needs is new private investment and- and that was the the important statement on the part of the city now a very and you go back just for one, because I want to just tell you one two other very quick points unique in the work of community boards in the experience of community boards and in fact, for those who were onlookers in that night, at the board of estimate and subsequently what happened that night I still find it remarkable. First of all, somehow, on the part of as part of the community board, we managed to get for the first time and it's the first time for a community board to get it. Some money from that the borough president helped with for the community board to do to get what guess, what planning and legal consultants to help in reviewing the this the site and just go back one please mark and I'll, just for just one second yeah there at the last bullet was that both at 2 am then and subsequently community board. Seven had engaged through the help of public money had engaged legal and technical consultants, and they were then a name whom I think many of you are very familiar with because he went on and is very well known as a design planner, namely Michael Kortler and then Bob Davis, Robert Davis, who had been counsel to the Department of City planning and became a partner at the revered and so wonderful extraordinary law firm, which did public interest work. Burley casted case remarkably that night, even though the approval was going to occur, we on the community board Nego that night negotiated wrote a memorandum of understanding. It had no legal standing, but we wrote it and city planning looked at it and the developers were amazed that they were going to have to somehow deal with this city planning disliked most of the planning guidelines that Michael Cordler encouraged us to engage in, and we did have then that memorandum of understanding, okay, Community Board 7, however, disapproved the original proposal. But what then, what I will only mention this to you, because the experience then continues in a remarkable way. The writing of a memorandum of understanding on design process continues so that for those of you years later and with other chair people into the 80s contribute to the eq very remarkable achievement of community board 7 in 1987. For those of you and all of us remember and I think we had reason to talk about it again and that was planning the West Side futures, which was a way of planning for all of the Upper West Side, okay. But guess what the Lincoln West people go bankrupt and the whole thing falls away and they sadly perhaps leave. Although Rafael Viñoly continues so then we go to I, there's more to say, but I will I had I will give you the best that I can for the, and since we are living in such strange times of, let us hope very soon. The ending of the Trump Administration but Trump had great interest well before Lincoln West for many years, even when he was a very young. A young man I think that a former well-known chair, Sally Goodgold, who had been around years before once related that she saw him many years before this standing and looking at the site and examining it as if he was going to be I, don't know something from the fountainhead or something looking at. What how what could he do with that site? And she thought there would be proposals from him, and so he gains ownership of the rail yard, not much money, but the pen, the they still want to unload it for a hundred million, and then two proposals which are I will go over quickly because it's worth just taking the few minutes in order to set the stage for, for then the Riverside south that we will spend time on. As you will see, Trump develops proposals for first for television city and it involved it would it. The intention here was to develop new headquarters for NBC and new television studios. They would move from Rockefeller Center, and the plan involves 15.5 million square feet of residential retail office and studio construction, including 7,600 residential units, a large, the largest shopping mall on the East coast, and the centerpiece of the project designed by Helmut Yan, was to be the world's tallest building. You see that everyone in this model and and it was to be 150 stories in the middle of the complex and he called it. The world's tallest building and other towers would be 76 stories, high built, north and south and so on, and he wanted to develop it immediately and break ground. The architecture critics like Paul, Goldberger and others said this was woefully inadequate. Just go back to that for one more and then we'll get to what's woefully inadequate to put these towers in open space, with no connection to the streets, to the community, to smaller spaces he's looking at it and for everyone essential in planet and as we go forward and perhaps of other lessons, we have learned that didn't have to do with Trump the developer, but he said this proposal had no relation to the street and saw the city as an abstraction and, as Goldberger said, a game board on which you move buildings at will, and so other architects agreed about these isolated towers and planet said this is something really nasty to live with? Okay. So, since this plan was more than twice the size of Lincoln West, there was fierce opposition from within the community and fierce opposition growing from a variety of community groups. Among them, one group formed itself and called itself West pride and that West pride then joined with some other civic groups. To, and here we see the beginning as when Trump City and TV city were stopped by opponents from the community. Also, the mayor Koch said publicly. He and Trump detested each other and Koch actually worked to oppose the trump proposals and, furthermore, he refused public funding and tax abatements for trump and for television city and instead gave the tax abatements to NBC to stay in Rockefeller, Center, okay, but who? But here, is an example of photos of the beginnings of the civic groups, which I will detail on in the next slide, but I simply want to show you we're going to. Let me just take the photos for a moment. A variety of groups came together, six groups and many celebrities, and among them you see here Betty Friedan, Christopher Reeve. We also, of course see Robert carrow, the great biographer of Moses David Halberstam and, of course, there was David Dinkins and Ruth Messenger, and there we see Koch with Trump much as they disliked each other. But, however, if we could just move this slightly to the right, wait just the community opposition and the six groups here, we are formed what they call the Riverside South planning corporation, to develop criteria for the site and a most remarkable political phenomenon occurred. These groups were composed of very respected organizations, civic organizations who had vehemently opposed the previous proposals of Donald Trump. You see the list here and they did everything possible to oppose trump and finally trump recognizing that he wasn't going to get the very big projects that the opposition was too great in effect transformed the opponents into allies and what occurred was an acceptance of a new plan. This plan that you see below, prepared by Dan Guttmann, an environmental planner and a wonderful architect, Paul Willand, who continued to do extraordinary work and is still here to do what and here is the sketch and that's what it was to begin with in the sketch. Do you see this clearly here literally a sketch, but what it was. The great innovation and the great public good that was developed in this scheme was to extend Riverside park. Remove the West side, Highway, relocating it east to grade and burying it, and this civic alternative was one that actually Invo evoked great support. Actually within the city as well, journalists, others looked at it and it seemed to be something that was civilized was possible related to the Upper West side, and so remarkably, this new collaboration occurred. Next, please, okay. The proposal receives great support and begins to go through the public approval process. In fact, as I will show you on the next at the conclusion that in fact, city planning supports it, and it is already in Euler, however, before and just take a look at this photo please and then we'll look at the next one as you Euler is going forward and it and the proposal is going to be approved. There continue to be many within the community, the coalition for a livable West side, others are still against it. They are concerned that this proposal, which appear, which was we were told, was going to be seven or eight million square feet, at least by Trump, that it was still bigger than Lincoln West and they it was not necessarily approved by some, but on the other hand it was supported by so many I will tell you quickly that as it moves through Euler and never to be forgotten. If I may tell this one anecdote and the great move of Ruth, Messenger and others who I can remember the phone call from Ruth Messenger's director of land use, namely Marla Simpson. We were all going through Euler and she said the following to me: I could I couldn't even I thought. I was hearing things and she said Ethel. The borough president has 25,000 before the end of the budget year and it has to be spent come up with an idea that seemed hard to believe I called Lance, J Brown, who taught at city college and was an excellent planner and architect. I had no idea what he was saying and he said you'll do an architectural charette, I didn't know what that was, but Lance took over. The borough president gave the board through, and then it was funneled through a non-profit twenty five thousand dollars to organize the following, and here here's the on the left is the cover of this incredibly wonderful, extraordinary report, and there here again, I found this photograph in the back of a drawer in the back of a drawer in my house in 2016, I didn't even know it was there and there Heaven help us. You see Donald Trump, the right me with a lot of hair, Ruth, Messenger and then John, Kohl and Architects, and what happened was Lance Brown with the money recruited, architects, seven or eight architects and planners from all over the city, because what he said was no. We can't have architects in New, York, they'll all be politically connected and in an intense three days in which we got hotel rooms. We got the ginger van to give them food and we got John Jay to host it at everyone from around in the community came, and we had a public hearing on the weekend and the architects worked day and night to study this plan and to make recommendations. One quick side note: the Office of Donald Trump got wind of this and Donald Trump the only time he ever called and said. What do you think you're doing? What is this we're getting this approved? He said he was coming and I. Knowing nothing said you can't come and he said what and I said, because if you come, you create a disturbance and these people have to work on Saturday morning. He arrived, hence the photo next. What this charrette stru was a remarkable contribution and, among other things, that wonderful sketch that you saw was the basis for their initial analysis and for me and others. The most remarkable example of expertise and teamwork occurred. They looked at that at sketch. Would you go back just one second to the sketch and they looked at it, and these planners and architects said wait a minute. This sketch it's the buildings, are lower than what is being what we've seen and what they all said, they're going to build and what this looks like five million square feet and they said they're going to be doing seven and a half or eight. It was a stunning shocker revelation, okay, let's get to what that that's what was happening, and so this is what they suggested. You see how much if you just move it a little to the right. Please there's the the slides mark. If you can okay, yeah okay just a little bit and you can see that what they recommended was about six or seven square feet for the entire site for the first time, and they immediately did this, they included of a percentage of affordable housing, a they developed details for mapped public park with active recreation areas and passive. They recommended a developer funding, partial for the 72Nd Street and 66Th Street subway stations as mitigation, and then this and said that a superblock or any possibility of some other use on a super block in the southern part of the site needs to be questioned and needs further consideration. Sorry, they also disapproved of a proposed TV studio and any large-scale retail mall. They sought, they recommended reducing parking spaces and they for the first time too, as a community board and the whole community began to see. This is planning for a new city, but not only private development but essential services, and they said this is going to need a public school and a variety of other concerns about infrastructure and impacts, and they did recommend support for the relocation, but only if the funding can occur. Next. The city Council ultimately approves Riverside south and included changed the zoning to an approximate 10. But the major point was that a general large-scale district was included with approximately 15 development parcels and what that meant, with a maximum of a little less than eight million, and that it was seven more than CB7 wanted and a mixture of residential and community facilities and left everyone which we all lived to fight another day in 2010, the last sites of Lmnn, which were going to be television studios and said. No, that shouldn't that's going to need a new Euler, okay and but here's another important point which I'll get on affordable housing. What was approved in this for the first time and in the restrictive declaration memorialized in it a minimum of 12 of the number of housing units to be affordable and the maximum 20 percent, preferably 20 as it turned out. Of course, the developers over time did only 12 percent and the developer was to construct Riverside boulevard to create a, and this is a private, a park with private funds, from the developer and from the residents of 21 acres and then over at a variety of other alternative, and the big thing was to bring the highway down. But a plan to continue the park, even if the highway is not there, okay. So next here we are recognizably and I move as quickly as possible through the long development story, and you recognize here the buildings that have been built and if you look carefully, please, you will see in gold lettering the trump place, which was a fixed and great big goal lettering. What then happened after this great approval of Riverside south in the early 90s and more litigation? There was more litigation which, based on community opposition and a depressed, New York state real estate market that went on for years, delayed the start of construction in the meantime, however, Trump initially unknown to us, and then it becomes plain trump sold. He was bankrupt and sold the controlling interest of the project to a consortium of Hong Kong investors called Waterfront Associates, and this joint venture finally put in motion what was the largest private development project in New York's city history? At that point, in the succeeding months, Trump was the public face, but he is not. He was not in control. He places and insists that Trump place be put on the the buildings and name that we are very aware that the residents of those buildings took the name all the names off in 2016. then in the next years later, Chase Bank then sells its own interest. I'm giving you the big overview in the next 10 years, the remaining parcels then to Extel and the Carlisle Group, which at that consortium developed several condo buildings on the site, the Avery, the Rushmore and also begin to develop rental buildings, but they sell them to equity residential by the a group. You know that's managing that during this period of time and I'll get in a moment to the difficulty with affordable housing, most of the buildings that were built housed, beginning to be higher-end apartments and higher-end residents, and for many years until really only the last five or six, the retail spaces were not developed and remained empty. Now. Keep this last point in mind: I think, there's a typo about the problem of affordable housing. Let's move to that because in the long development story, yes about 18 or 19 apartment buildings get built up until about 2010, the area begins to be called Riverside boulevard after its main street and the long narrow shape of it the and then, and I'm going to go to the next. Please to the mat note, after that, the map, please just I, want to skip it. We'll come back yes, okay. This map is a site plan of all of the sites and what was built on it as of 2009 2008. I am just it may be hard to see, but it is also a plan of how many affordable how much affordable housing was built. You see at the bottom that L M and N L, M and N are reserved because they come from a new Euler K becomes later the purchased by collegiate school and the Que, and then and no housing is built there and instead the school is there and then there's a question of well. What's the requirement, how do you get 55 units of affordable housing that was supposed to be there and eventually collegiate pays a fund to create housing elsewhere now, which is still open to discussion? So what occurred as of 2009? If we total up here by according to this map, as of 2009, approximately 500 and 583 affordable units were built within Riverside south, approximately 13 percent and okay, the other you have, but along with that, these are huge topics of their own, but the terrible complexity and really lack of equity and difficulty in the requirements for affordable housing. Because we came to learn in these last years that taking a percentage of units is not necessarily going to give enough provide enough, affordable housing and if, in a restrictive declaration it is stated a minimum and a maximum. The developer is going to build the minimum. So it's twelve percent of the units and of course twenty percent was not real. The other thing which I can only mention, but you all many of you- we've lived through it and it's a terrible another example. Forty Riverside boulevard, which is excuse me 40 Riverside, is becomes bill's, two entrances separate entrances below income and hence the so-called corridor. Controversy occurs, okay go back on and then we will go on. I want to make this point essentially to everyone. There were design guidelines that were formulated when Riverside south was approved, Skidmore Owings Merrill developed them. The goal was, as you can see, on the left as the rendering was that Riverside south should look as much as possible, like the Upper West side, that it would evoke central Park West. You see. The variety of that was never realized and in fact we all were there and I can remember barrel and Jordan Taylor. The great master architect of Som took one look at what was being built and indiscreetly. She said it's terrible I never want to see. This is not what we planned on the right. You see a bottle of from Custer Skandilus who, which was who became the master architect for the completed buildings and that's more of what it looks like okay onward, okay I just want to now. During these many years, the great wonderful addiction was, of course, the building of Riverside South park, and this occurs. Okay, somebody Ethel did you I, didn't do anything, but okay I think I'm being heard now right, yeah you're a little better. Now you were breaking up for a minute there, I'm so sorry but okay. Thank you because the park is so important. This park, which is built in sequence over the next 16 to 18 years and in fact the last segment was, is not quite completed and built only two years ago it was one of the most significant public parks developed in previous decades and in terms of greenery, it was considered to be and hoped to be a significant addition to central park. This model I'll just go back one more I, don't know why I mean I, think the speaker, I'm unmuted, I, think I, just don't know what's happening. I can hear you just fine. So thank you because, like you're fine now part good. Okay, thank you. So it's the it's on private land paid for by the developers turned and it turned into rules and the restrictive declarations and a corporation was established called the Riverside South planning corporation in agreement with the New York City Parks Department, who are in charge of designing the park, and it was Ballsley and associates six phases, and here we are the big thing about this park, among others in its aspiration and in fact, in what it achieved over a long time. It was one of the few parks at that time whose intention was to develop the park and connect it to the Manhattan grid, go back to the streets and in fact, just go back one or go back and pass this. Thank you and and go and connect, and in fact imperfectly, but it does. You can get into the park from a variety of streets adjacent and finally, the park were built on a variety of levels. Next and we'll go through this quickly. Here are the examples of the park in some of it. We built now the trails. The buildings in the distance here is one of the excellent, a wonderful playgrounds. You see the buildings and the much use one of the playgrounds of many another please. This is a set of examples of walking you of along near the water, and so- and this is very important more recently- you see because the highway of course was never taken down, and here is a reason rather recently developed, going through staircases. The park is built from one level to the next and going down and under the highway, with all these steps and approaching the water and along the way, are also bike paths as well, another one I think and there's another example of the highway in the distance. The grass and the buildings next- and here is another example, which was of the rendering of developed by Ballsley of the buildings the park the highway and the big pier going out into the water at 70th street, which is a considerable amenity in the distance. The southern buildings are built next, please next, but what did not happen? Yes, is the highway being relocated and that never did happen. If you will, please examine this particular photo and where my arrow is pointing right here, if you can see that a mark. Thank you yeah. We can't see your arrow, but I'm trying I think you're. Looking at the yeah go ahead. Yes there, ladies and gentlemen, that's wonderful! Right! There, it's a great photo! There is the entrance to the partially buried highway that extel built, but the highway has never been completed. That is a tunnel underneath now, if you don't mind, can you just get I think there's just a little bit of bullets before okay, here's an example of from the highway. You see the pier out there underneath it's darker a little hard, but many levels. The highway is still in place and I think there's one more to show with the highway. Yes, I think there's one more yeah and then this is an example of showing an old. You know an example of a railroad car and the highway and a brother and children playing there. The one thing I only want to just I. Will I'm going to just go back to the very first Miller Highway and just quickly go here? We go here's one. No, that's it! No just get there. Okay, it was the agreement that Riverside South corporation and the developer bill. It was never legally enforceable. It was the Federal Highway Administration approves the plan for relocating the highway to grade and there's the tunnel that I showed you through a new Riverside boulevard, no monies for the relocation ever materialized and Extel began the construction of the tunnel Ballsley redesigns the park into three distinct experiences that I've just begun to show you and neither the state nor the highway ever allocates the money go on. Please go past this. Thank you. Okay! Now we are close to ending, but we are the great years indeed fast and at and finally in the recent past Excel anchor, which has obtained Lm and then proposes a new Euler in 2009, Community, Board, 7 I. Believe, then, if I'm not mistaken, that it was the great chair of Mel Wymore at that time and and began to respond to this new proposal, so many years later and Excel's application, you see the there, the three the you could read that how many at the parking spaces- and here I only want to highlight for you lesson learned imperfectly and that is the 20, affordable, housing, first of all, nailed it as 20 percent, but not of uterus of far and for it to be permanent housing and then also the community board and then actually the Euler and the proposal included. Finally, after 20 years, the building of a pub an elementary school and no television studio. Next, okay, I'm showing this very quickly a very extensive review by the community board. It was one of the I think a huge outreach and wonderful work, and this gives you just an idea of the site plan and then the community board modifications of more open space, fewer buildings, more openness and improvement in circulation. Next, please, this is surgery, but it's important, because the work was extraordinary on the part of so many and the reports are well worth reading and they are superior as work by volunteers. There was limited funds for some consultants, I believe Buckhurst fish and others, but it was extremely good. Okay. Next, please, okay! This is an example. The architect was Christian, a Frenchman who was exceptionally charming and wonderful, and the landscape architect was Sidney Nielsen. You can see on the left what that original proposal was and from the community board to remove at least one building and making it more open than the one on the left, or at least those are the criteria. Next I won't go, I'm not going, but community board 7 disapproved this new Euler with the many conditions. The Manhattan borough president also disapprove with conditions. The city Planning Commission approved, with some objections to the density and the size of the school, incorporated as recommendations and to some degree as guidelines, many of the CB7 and Biopresent recommendations. Finally, and then just lastly, just go back one, and then we get to what very important they, the city planning reduces. The parking community board was against so much parking. We go on next, please and the city Council does approve the project and read brings and construction of a new school Gail who is here does and I will let her speak about it, but she very much focuses on affordable housing and the need for it to be on site, and that is I actually consulted again with her staff, because as I remembered and it's it still is not clear that it's meant it was mandatory to have all the affordable housing on site and controversies. Continue about that too Excel did we increase the school and the school has been built and it was approved. Now let us look at the last. It's remarkably different excellent Carlisle sells the parcels to Gid Development group Gid buys that site take check the money and dubs it waterline square here is I. Take this to you, I'm doing it just so that tug and cheek and I took this quote simply from James Lindsey Leslie, the President of Gid, who I think may live in a water line square and who says there at last, the new Far West side, neighborhood will now be cohesive and Thou has come to fruition and he happened to have started his career working at Trump place and he thinks it's wonderful. Not everybody may feel that way. This is the difference. Water line square in architecture is completely different. I am combining here renderings of the buildings and some of the actual buildings. Warlords square is almost completely built. Take go to the next please, and what we have here- and some of these are actual photos there. Well, the buildings are very different and each building of three very big ones. Each one is built by Star, Architects, Richard, Meyer, Raphael, Vignoli now and Conan Pedersen Fox here are examples. Continue please here, those are back. That's a real photo, the one just go back on! No after that, there's one more of the last yeah here we go. This is a photo of greenery and the interior landscaping within water line square. This is a photo as well. That of the way it looks continue on, and here quite wonderfully is a photo of, in fact, the school, the wonderful school that was in fact built, and is there next well I just put this in at the and I'm giving you a few different quotes from different people. Just to give you a sense of the variety and the other issues, Ron Schiffman, who was involved with Riverside south and is a very important planner and a great advocate for diversity, affordability and equity said this at the end of Riverside south. This is in New York. There's a planning vacuum. The civic organizations had accomplished what this[ _ _], what the city should have done years ago, plan in the public interest, Linda Davidoff, the great who, unfortunately, the great parks advocate and and the wife of Paul Davidoff said: Riverside South is a partial glimpse of a public world. At a time when there isn't a public world, they were all terribly disappointed and at the fact that the highway never came down and that great motivate motivator did not come to fruition and then Madeleine police, who was such an important community advocate and a leader in the coalition for Livable West side. Another quote that I took from her somewhat later. She said this is years later she said: Riverside South should never have been approved. Trump is building a city within a city and it's out of scale with the rest of the neighborhood. Our position isn't anti-development, but you don't have to oppose things that are don't relate to the current area and then Charles Murray lied just brothers and he was a developer. He wasn't involved with Riverside south, but I just wanted to take. This I have no intention of community opposition. Let's meet and cooperate, but give me one a fair return over the years and I took this an anonymous CB7 task force member and I'm just summarizing that community board 7 in the many years since began to welcome development on this site to strike a balance between private and public needs, local concerns and city growth, short-term advantage and learned. Maybe that negotiation is maybe the only thing open and really last I. Just put this in just for you all to think about I. Put all of this in what's planning about what about profits and public benefits, neighborhood versus city growth and, of course, I ended with the biggest questions of all now planning diversity, equity for the Upper West side in this city in these challenging times. Thank you Ethel. Thank you. So much I know a lot of work went into this and I know it was nothing right. It was all in the memory yeah right. It brought back memories for me and I'm sure for you and for many others who are on this call. I expect that is Gail Brewer on the call I'm looking for her name now. I'm here there she is great okay, Gail comments, questions observations. First of all, absolutely phenomenal. I can't hear you sorry, here's my book, that's right! Great Riverside center. Does you know Jesus God, that's another thing for the files: I don't want to even look at it anyway. I want to say thank you there's an amazing presentation that should go down into the archives and I hope it will be archived. Congratulations! A lot of hard work, I mean just you know. The park is great, and that is the best part I. Think of getting something out of this and the school is an excellent school and I often laugh because we had to make the school larger and deal. We said at the time. Ah, we'll never need a larger school and, of course we did need the larger school and it is a larger school. The affordable, housing and 421a are very challenging. I even had to bring the 14 million dollars. That's remaining to the attention of HPD, because I didn't know it was even there and they have no idea how to spend it. So that's another big project for the community board to work on and I think that there have been developments. I have a list here of where some of the other money, the 60 million, which was the total amount based on the collegiate school deal, and that you know you negotiated as a member of the board. So it's challenging and of course, I mean I feel guilty because some of those 421 a from Riverside south, not Riverside center. Only those in the know the difference between the two, because it is so nuanced, but the Riverside south, 421a I, don't know and I should know and HPD has no clue exactly who's there from those units who's not there. What's on market, what hasn't it's a big mess to be honest with you and I have to I feel very guilty, because people have called me over time. So we need to atta figure that out and of course, figure out who didn't get housing offside on site from Riverside center. Those are huge issues to be really investigated because there is no institutional memory or knowledge at HPD, so we're going to have to do it ourselves, I, I'm so frustrated by this. I'm just going to leave it at that. I think you know. I want people to ask questions. I, think that it is I, certainly learned a lot. You know everything from you know. We had to focus on whether at one point I knew that whether it was excel or Rli wanted to make a big wall to make sure that Riverside center looked like a walled city, and we had to make sure that it was a flat entrance. Of course, I walk around there, showing with my little tape measure making sure that there is no wall there. It is flat and there may be other things at least I do want to thank, as you did Linda David off for her. May she rest in peace for all that she did, because in those early 90s you and she were very instrumental and I mean I- think Lincoln towers has not never forgotten. This I saw that many people I know didn't organize. Ruth I think they still hate in some cases because of all of the memories of all of it and of course, there's the issue of Riverside boulevard, which is one of course, is whether there should be an entrance closed off and where the exit to the highway should exist, and there were two lawsuits or different perspectives on that, and then there was a whole issue of Riverside boulevard was originally a private road. Nobody understood this now. I pay a lot of attention to developments and then, in order for D.O.T to take it and make it a city road. There were lots of things at that point. The Trump organization had to do to make sure that they were. You know the stop sign was in the right place and this and that and the other. So you know we learned a lot I. Think all of us learned a lot. I will remember many hours with Ed Wallace on one side and Richard and Ethel, and me on the other, at 2:50 broadway till midnight trying to get the laughs. Yes, in a windowless room, so you know we did all that, and you know it's a big I hope it's you know successful for what it is. I do know a lot of people live there. I know, Barbara lived at one point: there was nobody on her floor, she was miserable and she moved out because so I hope there are people actually living there and that's not a pity tear and it is a place you know where families enjoy the park is stupendous. Yes between the sparks department and I. Think people in the chat are asking how it gets paid for and I think those of you on the board know, but it is mostly from the development they do have to put a lot of money in and between the conservancy, the Parks Department and the money that goes in there and the building that continues. It's a it's an amazing part, and so, if we get, you know it's not all we got out of it, but that and the school and a little bit of affordable housing. Although none of this affordable housing is permanent and that sucks, it's not a good way to go about building, affordable housing, do you sport, 421a? So those are my comments. It certainly has an indelible ink every aspect of Riverside center, which I was involved in I, remember and learned from probably made some mistakes along the way, because we were not exactly sure this large project, but you already have Riverside south that you had learned from, and so we did the best we could. This is a phenomenal discussion for me and I am deeply appreciative of it, and all I can say. Is I've done a lot of Euler's and rezoning since? But this one I learned the most from and thank you Gail before you were involved with Riverside center I was very involved in Riverside, south and I organized all of the towers and 20 other buildings in the area about Riverside south, and we were the opposition and we fought for everything, and we were very disappointed. Of course, when we didn't get everything and Ruth Messenger appointed me to the borough, to the community board in I. Think 1992 or 1993. lots of lessons and stories that well, you know a part of this history. Thank you Gail. If you need some help, manpower or anything else to track down where that extra 14 million dollars is going right and also there's been compliance on the existing buildings, let's get together and I would very much like to do that. I think we have some information more recent I think! Well, we I know, what's going on, God of Riverside could use it for a building, but they have no freaking ways, use my friends and HPD of releasing the money. They don't have a process. So that's what we need to work on it's my motivation, two comments before we open the floor for discussion number one, just an anecdote. The civic groups premised their agreement with Trump on the construction of Riverside south, on the assumption that the highway would be moved. However, the week before the agreement was struck between the civic groups and trump, the governor of New York allocated millions and millions of dollar like 30 million dollars to repair the highway in its then current and now current location. So the highway was never going to be moved right. It was a non-starter. The second thing I want to just commend to everybody is that if you walk or drive or ride a bike up a down Riverside boulevard from the trump buildings to the extel buildings, to the current waterfront square, you'll notice, remarkable changes in architecture brought about in part by development, in construction material and by the time Waterfront Square was built. We had learned that the project that doesn't have through access and inviting public spaces to get from West End Avenue to the park was a big mistake and if you look at the plans for waterfront what a lot square- yes, where you'll see that they went to great lengths to create a public space, that's inviting and that that gets you from West End Avenue to the park yeah. So all right now Richard what we have, which we advocated for that. Yes, that was that was our yeah. That was our contribution as a board. Okay, Shelley, fine I, see you did you have a question? I can't hear you have to unmute yeah, okay, first I think we all want to give a huge round of applause to Ethel, for this presentation, that's okay and having been on the board from way back when and seen all this go on at different times. The amount of work that was put in by volunteers, going back to Riverside. South trump was just incredible. The idea that Charette was probably the first time anyone had seen in New York had seen such a process and then later you know later on, coming back to it with Riverside center. We have learned a lot of lessons and I think the biggest lesson was about affordable housing that it wasn't units it should be square feet and I think we now have to I think develop a process in which we can check on how everything got carried out the school we can see. Where are the affordable units? Are they what they were supposed to be and I think we have a right to follow up with the management and to ask these questions and I think this is one area where the community board gets deeply involved, but the follow up it's like it's over and then we have to deal with what's there, except that there are some obvious violations. I think we ought to have a working group or task force to review what was intended, what was agreed to what was approved and what exists particularly around the affordable housing. Thank you mark. Do you see any other hands? Yeah I do Richard and I wanted to I wanted to. There are folks who are putting questions in the Q&A, but we're going to take questions from raised hands so from the community. I have Peter Boyson and Ping Quan and from the board we have our colleague Ken Coughlin, so in whatever order you want to take them Richard. Why don't we take him in the order that you mentioned very good, so Peter Boyson? You should be able to unmute right now. Please welcome to community board seven and please state your question. Yeah. Can you hear me all right sure can go ahead? Okay, here's my question. Now this is from the viewpoint of a long time: Riverside Park, Conservancy, Park, Tender, I, 10, gardens up in the hundreds. So as I recall, the Riverside south was obligated to make a sizable annual cash contribution to keep up the parks that they developed one. What's the amount has a change and who does that money go to New York City Parks, the conservancy or somewhere else. I only know a little bit I that the conservancy has been involved with the upkeep of Riverside park and the but I don't know that any of us here at least know the exact amounts and how it works. It I think it would be another good thing for us all to do to see how the park is being funded now, because the the construction costs were way more than ever anticipated millions and millions more. It is still supposed to be funded by the private developers and the people living there, but there there probably is other money that, because it all costs much more and the maintenance. That sounds like a good task for all of us to get a sense of that. I'm asking for maintenance costs of the government. Yes, I, understand. Well, the parks Department has that I'm sure of that, because they are doing the maintenance. Yeah well I had a number like 750,000 a year in my mind and that okay, well maybe you're totally wrong I, don't know we could find out. It's parks, department, money. They are doing it well, I, don't know if you know that okay next is Ping Kwon hi. Can you hear me yesterday? Okay, I'm the youngest one here and I, don't know how to work the technology anyway. It's really nice see everyone again Ethel. Thank you. So much for the presentation and Richard it was just so great to hear it and just a quick comment before my question. You know my son does go to the new school in Riverside south and it's a great school, but it's very under enrolled, because you know the really great planning can't can't help with systemic bias. So I think a lot of the newer residents are, you know, just frankly afraid of having their kids go to school, with brown, kids or low-income kids, so I think over time. That's going to change because it's a really great school and they're doing a lot of outreach, but you know that's an issue anyway. The question was: if you were to review Riverside south again today, would you still recommend the extension of West, 60Th, Street and the elimination of building four, because the you know with all the pedestrian developments in the last 10 years, the car free superblock has really been revalidated. So I was just curious if you were to take a fresh look at that. If that would be your recommendation. Well, if you're addressing it to me, I, see I, think that all of us are taking a fresh look at cars and pedestrian streets and car owners. Of course, don't like this, but I think that all of us have to do that and in some ways the city is inadequately. So you're, probably raising an important point to consider I think they're, two separate issues, the super block is one issue and the other issue is creating a car free area. That's true and they present maybe complementary, but different issues. Yeah thanks, Ben Ken, I think you're unmuted yeah. Thank you. Ethel I came to the board in 2009 and was immediately thrust into this controversy at Riverside center and I got involved in the parking issue and trying to reduce the amount of parking and you and Dan Gutman were so helpful. We didn't get all that. We wanted I, think our what we wanted was 7.50 and we didn't quite get that little, but we brought it down anyway. My question was: we've recently learned that in both phase five and phase six, they were supposed to have comfort stations in the park and I guess because of money, we're not getting either of them at least for now. So the question is: if the developer and the residents are supposed to be paying for that, how come we're not getting the comfort stations and may we get them in the future? Well, I. Don't know the exact answer to that, but what I do know wearing a different hat, if I may that, just this week, I was at the Public Design Commission and the parks department is, has now developed a prototype for a comfort station, a modular one and they've developed it first to save money because it's much less expensive than building. You know a complete one and two because it's transportable and they are hoping that they can, you know, bring them to various locations. So I don't know the details of other things, but I just happened to see and saw that and found it, and it was at the Public Design Commission and it's actually quite wonderfully designed in its own right if they can get it to be sent around in the correct way. Can your if I can suggest that you ask Clary to get the information from the parks department? I just spoke to John Harold, just because I like to quickly find out and you should follow up, but right now the bill goes to the condo associations or I think to the Trump organization for the rental buildings, because I believe they still have some management, it's a pass-through, and so whatever the bill is they I? Guess they pay it. Five is done, six is underway, and maybe we should work on a conversation for six, but it is paid for by the condo owners individually, obviously through the management company and the rental, obviously through the management company. But you need to get more specifics and amounts. Thank you thanks. We have one other question: yeah. We have one more hand from Thomas Caffrey from the community Thomas Mr Caffrey. You should be able to unmute. Okay, can you hear me mark? We got you? Okay, that's all I have a question between the attractive product in the charrette that you showed us put together in those days by the architects and what we finally got by way of architecture and size and bulk, and so on. What happened when I thought the deal was that everybody signed off on the suret. Basically, it's about the same number of square feet and so on, but what happened to that attractive picture? I missed the bridge from today right. First of all, you know the idea and the mechanism of a charese really is a way of you know, providing the work and the solutions, and ideally a charette takes place at the beginning of a project. In other words, it just starts from the ground up and everybody comes together and develops the best ideas. It was a miracle that Lance, you know explained it to me, and the bar and Bruce Messenger gave us money and don't ask how we organized all this, but it was in the middle. You know when the Euler was already underway, but it was a great undertaking. I, don't know that I have the answer, but I will say to you: I repeat that I she will deny it no doubt, but I really did hear and that Marilyn Taylor the great architect who is, of course so practicing. She actually said and never these buildings. This is not the way we wanted them to. Look. We didn't think so, and I just I just read some other something: a critic, an architect who said at that time. This looks like a stage set. These aren't interesting buildings. Those are the first so, but you see at waterline Square, you see quite a diametric difference. Yeah I think you know the charrette, which was a wonderful piece of work spearheaded by Ethel, did not have a great immediate effect right, but I think in the building of the subsequent buildings. Kl m n yeah the lessons that we got from the charette I think the developers also recognized and- and you see it, I- think a tremendous improvement not only in the architecture but in the use of the land. So Richard we have three more hands raised, and maybe we should call it a day after that we have Deborah Brown Olive, Freud and Joel Fram. So should we take that order yeah in that order? Deborah Brown, please go ahead, hi I wanna! Can you hear me, okay sure, can okay Ethel thank you for your lovely powerpoint I would love to get or know how to get a copy of this point, so I'll depend on that. If I may it's been submitted to the department of Information technology and telecommunications and sometime within our lifetime, it will be up on our website. Okay, wonderful! Actually, what I'd like to ask about is I believe that this whole development is tied into the North River sewage plant. Is that correct? Yes, it is. There is no other sewage plant and I know that, because I lived through this with the coalition for a livable west side that there was at one point, 24 million gallons of raw sewage, which disappeared and I know that there were lawsuits in federal court that were filed under the Clean Water Act. So this sewage plant has notoriously I guess, had problems with it. What is going on now that all the buildings are are built and thousands of new people are living there. Does anybody know? Oh I? Actually don't I remember from reading the environmental impact statement that there was a metric and that they met it. It was as close a razor thin margin, as one could ask for, but they did meet it and therefore it was permitted without any mitigation required. I think we all know that those metrics are subject of controversy, because if you get more than an inch of rain in the New York City combined sewer system, then the sewage treatment plants have a nasty tendency to overflow, but whatever metric the metrics that were used for that environmental impact statement were satisfied without mitigation. So that's the answer that would be forthcoming from that yeah mark is correct. I, remember that and I think also I know. All of this was a big concern of hers and Madeline, but I also think that we're constantly told whether it's right or wrong I don't know that the 135th street plant is not at full capacity, so we were also stuck with that as a challenge. Thank you, Oliver. If anyone doesn't know she is the conscience of the Upper West Side Land Use Ethel. Thank you for. Can you? Can anybody hear me yeah? Okay, again, thank you. There was a lot there, but you know the project. It hasn't got anything to do with the rest of the West side. It sticks out by itself and it's too big and the park serves the people who live in that and those houses. The other thing that I wanted to bring. Of course, I have my doubts about what's going on with the sewage plant. One thing I think that we, the community board, could do is make sure that Riverside boulevard is an operating street. It's supposed to be connected at 72Nd Street and it's supposed to be connected at 59th street, and it isn't and there's no reason for that. It would take a lot of traffic off West end if we could get this as a functioning road parallel to West, End Avenue, you thank you thanks, Oliver Joel Fram is the next and last speaker. Okay, I'm here, can you hear me? Yes, indeed, I think it would be a great thing if interpretive signs were put up in the area depicting the history of the area in terms of the its industrial past. As far as the including the railroad yards and the dock work and the docks that were there, I was wondering if you know of any effort to to do this, I think would increase the appreciation of the park of the area. Yeah. Does anybody know anything being done in this way? Those things often require funding. It I think we've done fairly cheaply. You know a good plaque with some historical pictures and some description. There are interpretive signs for the transfer station. I haven't seen them, there's just a label for the transfer station. I think that really begs for an interpretation, because people don't know what it is. They just see this big rusty hulk and they don't know you know what am I looking at I think something describing it maybe showing some pictures of what it is to be like. We can work on it's a good idea. There is the one thing of course, of freedom place, which was supposed to have much more of a memorial monument. You know to the slain civil rights workers and that hasn't happened. The same way. The plaque once got swam away, I think and when there was a storm and I, we knew Andrew Goodman's, mother, Carolyn Goodman and when she found when someone found the plaque and she learned that trump might be involved, she said no I, don't want anything there. If it's trump and I remembered she was so adamant that I remember taking her to the hostel and to do, and she took the plaque about the workers to the hostel, but there's nothing on freedom place for its extraordinary history. There are others even earlier history, too, there's a plaque there. It's on the ground. Yes, I know that I know it's a smaller one. Yes I understood that there was supposed to be something more. But yes, thank you. I want to thank everybody. The we had at the peak I think 156 viewers. We still have 82 on the call, which is a tribute I, think to Ethel and her all the planning. So thanks very much and thank you for everybody for listening and contributing, and we look forward to continued work on the community board and in the community on land use and if I could just jump in with a final thought thanks to Gil Talber and to the borough president for co-sponsoring Us, terrific partnership. Thank you and thank you Gail, and with that we'll say, good night Chet Good night.
