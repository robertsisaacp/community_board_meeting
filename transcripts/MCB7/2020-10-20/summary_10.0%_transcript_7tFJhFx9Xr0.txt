Teams, yeah we've changed teams right of all in some way, the same team That runs Riverside park,, hey guys how you doing hey good to see you am I late, no exact, okay, although, as committee members we're still looking for Doug and Natasha and Elizabeth We got Natasha, so we shot.
And I, do not think there's anybody who's with us who does not know this, but this is the October meeting of the CB7 parks and Environment Committee Tonight and relatively few attendees, except for some really welcome loyal members of the community because we do not have a.
The first most important thing tonight is that tomorrow is the steering committee meeting at which the steering committee ranks overall for CB7 our budget priorities both on the capital side and the expense site.
Zoom it'll, probably be more difficult, as all of our meetings are probably more difficult to unzoom, as has been the case in past years because of the very large number of capital projects and even expense items that we have in our committee and because we are lucky enough to be able to get input back and forth with the Parks Department, which happened very recently, and the timing issue and all sorts of stuff.
It was a very big deal to update the district needs statement that we talked about last month to reflect all of the issues and concerns and changes and problems we have from from Covid-19 that are still ongoing, and some of them are getting better we're getting some composting back We're getting some other stuff back, but the focus of the DNS itself.
We also learned just the end of last week that the Parks Department has handed us some new capital priorities that we did not realize that we were going to have to deal with and just to be really brief about that, specifically two comfort stations in Riverside park, south that were always since the beginning in the early 1990s, when the plans in general for the park were approved, comfort station down at 62nd, street.
That had been our committee's judgment and rankings in prior years to the extent, which is mostly that they have not already been funded and graduated from our list and finally, in light of Covid-19 and in light of the use of our parks and primarily Riverside parks that we now see to try to rank them in a way that takes into account the needs and concerns of the greatest number of parks.
It's really important that all of our members attend the steering committee meeting and help me and Elizabeth Advocate for the parks items, because what happens is- and some of you have been at that meeting in the past and Ken certainly is familiar with it.
So you know I do not think we need to have a very long discussion on our first item, which is, I think , it's written generally as committee operations and plans or something I did want to remember, to say one thing that I said only at the end of last week's last month's meeting, which is our thanks to both Matt Genrich, who normally joins our our committee, meetings, Matt, being the manager for Dpr of District 7 and everything in our district other than them, and in another district as well.
No, so I just wanted to start out on our first more general item by saying that One is trying to increase our committee's environmental activities, focus on environmental issues.
This has been following issues of trash: collection, garbage, And I'm, not sure, natasha, whether you're now our compost person as well, but that you know We started that a few months ago, because Natasha expressed an interest and having somebody who's specifically charged with and has undertaken to kind, of, follow an issue and perhaps expand or contract the scope of the issue.
, see your hand, but let me start off with a couple Natasha first, I want to say that, when, following up on our discussion last month, when we talked about the DNS and the impacts of Mr new statement, impacts of Covid-19, we did include some.
The other thing, I wondered if, in the conference you attended, if they, if anything was said about the big bellies and how helpful they have been, is the solar recycling and how they hold seven times as much as a city trash basket.
But may I just say one other thing I and it has to do with last month when I made a little presentation about Theodore Roosevelt park and and the planting that we want to do in conjunction with the noise from the foreground.
We've also been trying to, and I think somewhat successful in getting such issues brought to our attention by members of the committee, so And, you could probably do a good job of it yourself.
I assume it's probably done in Riverside park as well, but certainly in central park might be an interesting thing to weave into this kind of like water management and preventing flooding, especially in the pond in the southern part of the park.
You would propose boxwood for the latter area and Daniel Atha who's a horticulturist, I believe, with the botanical garden, talked about that plant We decided to go with presuming this moves forward because we're looking into some other ideas now that might be more effective or a combination of a few together, but the wax can't think of what they're called right now, but the those evergreen Wax berry bushes, whatever they're called, which make a dense edge and are easy to care, for we are definitely going with those instead of what we had proposed in the which was boxwood for the front fence and whereas you know we're still looking at the arborvitae for the back wall.
But I know that the people on 81St street have been trying to get some kind of soundproofing.
Do hospitals just throw them out or they have to put them in a medical waste container Jeff, I'm in rivers, as you know, in Riverside park, very frequently, The mask issue than discarded masks.
I mean I've, seen it people shopping once they get out of the store they throw it on the sidewalk and keep going so You know my concern.
Guess that's a little bit beyond the purview of this committee, but it's yeah, It sounds like it's pretty believable for the whole city, which is you're lucky, if somebody puts picks them up off the street and puts them in the trash.
I, think Jeff Hannah's talking about a different area, we're not I, mean the stuff at 59th street and that detour that put the pedestrians in The That's been way before October.
It's really clear what the decision point is, and maybe just even a greenway north sign to the right, because that's essentially, unless you're going to 72nd street, which very few people are.
You know pals right at 74th street, on Riverside and at the same time.
I would just interject personally that I think that having our people, our city workers, paid to stand there, some of them not wearing masks themselves, but handing out masks is, in my view, as a taxpayer, a waste of my money, because if people are down there without masks, it's not because they do not know they're supposed to wear, masks And, it's not because they can't get a mask, but We were walking acrosss the park and in central park at the turtle pond, just north of turtle pond below the great lawn was a rave of like a hundred young people who could not possibly have been related more than 100, perhaps, and they were dancing around no one wearing masks, alcohol everywhere and plumes of pot smoke.
But to your other point about the e- bike on the grass just this evening, during a walk between 5 and 6 P.M in Central park, our regular route down to the pond and back passed, I, think five people, smoking pot and then saw three or four bikes on the grass and then counted.
And I, should know this really, but are bikes allowed in the area of Riverside park.
I mean we put up signs, recently, no motorized, bikes or scooters periodically through the park along the bike path and then inside in certain areas where bikes maybe come into where we think they've come into along the promenades.
If you see someone with a rebel scooter in the park, if you get the license plate number and report it to Revel They'll, at least they say they they're going to block that person from renting their scooters for some period of time or something like that.
Sorry, I, just want to say I, have also noticed a lot of bad behavior by cyclists and motorized vehicle riders in central park and they're, maybe four or four times a week, and I do not think I've seen anybody on grass, but I've definitely seen a lot more people recently on pathways, going every which way on CitiBikes or other their own vehicles, and it's really out of control, and so I just wanted to echo Susan on that And also I would say that I would really advocate for more signage in all our parks, specifically about trash, saying that this is a carry and carryout area.
It might go some way in preventing people from dumping a lot of their picnic crash into you know the limited trash bins that the parks have all parks around the city.
You know: Jeff, Richard and I were in Riverside park this morning, and did I dream this Had some new signs on carrier trash, out.
A lot of people feel like the more the more signage you have better, but sometimes other people point to a city street, where you're trying to drive- No parking here do not look, no left turn here, no, whatever And it's hard for people to get a sense of all this information, all at once, and so suddenly you have people making There's sort of a philosophy that maybe too much signage is you.
What's the point of trying to hand out masks to people who are in the park and know perfectly well, they should be wearing masks and may or may not have one in their pocket.
But, it's been under construction by New York City for complicated reasons, make it different from the other phases of the park of Riverside South.
