Thank you very much I'll shut up now by the way Matt has joined us since she did a yeoman's job of focusing on food insecurity for our research, for our district needs statement and before catherine, because I want to say, she's done an amazing job, pulling it all together and working with everybody all along and bringing this together tonight on our number one priority.
The goal is for us to kind of identify where we can assist or support their efforts in reducing food insecurity, and then we'll hear questions from the community.
Our organization has been around for over 40 years on the upper West side, we're in the basement of the Saint Paul and St Andrew Church on the corner of West, 86Th and Broadway, and that has been our historical home for the last 40 years and within that space we've served thousands of households of new yorkers from all five boroughs, and in that space was developed, our supermarket style customer choice model for of what a food pantry looks: like.
We saw Anita in the community, but what they then started seeing was folks trading items out on the sidewalk, so I actually do not like tuna, but I love, peanut butter and in seeing that exchange, recognize that how can we bring more dignity to the experience of accessing a food pantry and incorporate choice in that in the experience?
What we are really proud of is showing up during one of the most challenging times in all of our in of all new Yorkers lives and making sure that they had access to healthy, fresh food for to feed their families.
But when things shut, down, people were shut off from the food that we provide through our through our stake of centers, our senior centers, our after-school programs, and there were sudden with the cleaning out of the shelves in many stores.
People had a demonstration at the precinct, not long ago, but just as an example in Amsterdam houses, which is a public housing development at the kind of southern end of the Community Board western beef no longer does deliveries, and so for some of our older adults who can't drag a heavy cart back from the store or families who are that are you know that may have a large household.
I. Think the issue with all public benefits has been trying to access in a pandemic when even public servants are working remotely has made things a little bit more difficult and even in if a case is cut off , it's just harder to get benefits because of the the fact that everything is being done virtually and not everybody has internet access to be able to to do.
Lincoln's center did a couple of food distribution, days, and Is really helpful, and you never know where the word is going to land when you send it.
So we were able to with the 12 food schemes that we had already prepared and with a lot of work, create 59, neighborhood food resource guides and with the help of places like hunger, free America, share, meals.
All of these groups come together and contribute their data in including on city harvest, which was incredibly helpful and instrumental and the founder of share meals who basically provided all the back-end technology.
So we operated all this data And then we updated every single day We created an army of volunteers that are going out, they're staying at home and and using the telephone to call all these facilities, and we update this every single day It's also updated from data that comes in from the city, from city harvest and from a variety of other sources, and especially the soup, the food Pantry data.
So, that's kind of some of the things we've been working on Then we were fortunate to be contacted by Dr, Pam Cook and who was on this call and her organization, and the objective was to do research and look at the impact of cobra 19 on the food system in New, York, City and regional food system from an institutional perspective and a community perspective.
We were discussing this that when a food pantry closes, even if it's in the basement of a church and may not serve thousands of people, it's still incredibly relevant because an undocumented person might be going to that and feel most comfortable.
We people were not wearing masks and infection rates were incredibly high in New York City, that people can go to a resource or make a phone call and be able to determine if a food pantry was open or closed or if they're, a senior and very vulnerable, and not wanting to leave at all where they can get home delivered and so part of our research has shown that information is critical and there was there's really a lack of it in the city of New, York.
That, that's long-term and sustainable and that you know, food pantry closings were primarily in underserved communities, ironically right, which was something that we showed in our research Lastly.
It's city state , it's a national, the federal city and state that needs to really focus on solving and working on poverty and food and security issues that it's really hard for charity to make a huge debt-You know from hunger for America Was a leader in the underspace, and he said you know that, for instance, the the Ebt cards that were given to every New York City student, those ebt cards.
That said, hey, I, think the three of you should work together to actually evaluate this, because so much money is being put into by government and by foundations to basically get food out to people and if we do not really try to capture what's working and what's not It's a completely lost opportunity, because we can't grow and learn from this experience to be better prepared for the future when we're not in a crisis mode and also for future crises.
Food policy office: We need a much stronger food policy office that can oversee helping with food security, helping with diet, quality, helping food, retail and restaurants to be able to stay in business and keep the heart of what our city has and helping to understand food workers and making sure that they are cared for.
At a time when we really needed it, it's actually now been approved for another year, so How it's going to roll out in New York City is not quite clear with what's going on now, but this is a program that we want to support.
It could then buy food with it, the way that they were supposed to and then make a donation to something like the West side campaign against hunger or another group in their community.
I-want to end with saying what we normally do when it is not Covid-19 and that is working with all of the organizations that work with school children around food and nutrition and supporting school meals and there's.
I know a lot of the organizations are working with the schools that are in your account, your district, your community board, sorry, So we want to keep that happening, and a lot of those organizations are continuing to do education, whether it's remotely.
We combined with other churches and synagogues in the neighborhood and eventually created a super, a supermarket style pantry, as you can see where people could come and receive healthy food and receive it with dignity and be treated with dignity and also receive help in other areas of their lives.
Again, even if we have to mortgage the church, which we actually did at one point, so that that has led to a dependability where people know If, they come here, they will find not only an abundance of food, but fresh food and a good attitude towards them, We also did not want to just supply.
We wanted to make it so people did not need to come to a food pantry for food, and so we started a couple of different job training programs, including the culinary training program, which you see here.
Here, But throughout the city gives you an idea of what things look like currently And, then the last thing, as I'm sure Stephanie, told you we're serving people, not only we already had about 20 satellite sites throughout the Bronx upper Manhattan, but since Covid-19 we've that has grown exponentially And we've taken on partners like New York, Presbyterian Hospital make the road New York and quite a number of other sites where we've been able to sort pack and deliver food to those sites, and that's that's kind of the snapshot of what I got.
Let me start by just suggesting to the committee that-And. Maybe Shelley can build on this and the committee members too, in terms of ideas that we write a resolution in support of what's needed and also the recommendations that are outlined in the New York Food 2020 report, which was produced by Hunter College New, York, City, Food policy center, where Charles is from in the Lori Tish Center for food education and policy where pam is from and the CUNY urban Food Policy institute.
The second was for users create and man maintain a public data set of all food, pantries soup kitchens and other emergency food resources, and also for the city to provide simple technologies for emergency food providers to easily update their status, to expand economic stimulus, support, focusing on small and independent food businesses that women people of color and immigrants own, and operate to monitor, retail, institutional food and emergency food, programs, impact on diet, quality and address nutrition.
But I just wanted to throw out that the possibility of writing a resolution in support and I'm going to hand it over to shelly, Then I'm going to call on the committee members in alphabetical, order, And, I'm, sure everyone hearing it appreciated the terrific work that's been done by each group to provide food and to analyze the situation, to enable better things to happen.
I have two questions which do not have to be elaborated on too much, but I want to focus on your experience in terms of seniors and their particular needs during this time and how they've been addressed.
I think there were quite a few people of great goodwill trying to do the best they could, but without the organizational capacity you know.
The first set of deliverers were sent out without routing sheets and I think that some of the solutions have been as frustrating to seniors as the as the bottom line issue and many seniors have tried to just make their own arrangements, where they're able to so I'd like to share some information, because I was deeply involved with this, because we found that the city insisted that senior centers were going to handle the senior meals and you had to be a part of the senior center.
I think some of the grocery shopping services require that people have a credit card and many of the older adults particularly do not and just wanted to add one quick, thing.
I think that all the things you're saying you know we found in other communities as well in our report and our research, and you know what concerns me is that these are ad hoc, measures, meaning if the city does not come up.
I, think that's incredibly helpful and and that it's that there's not just a system in place, but that it actually works and people are able to open their food and access.
We always knew that there could be a pandemic that would allow have everyone stay in, and so that is again why we need a really strong office of Food Policy , mayor's Office of food policy to have plans in place for that, so that it is about the quality of the food, and you know, especially when so many of these programs end up being long-term, If you're getting food to people for a week after a storm, it just get people food, so they can eat.
It would work with difta and the senior meals and the Department of Education's office of food and nutrition, services.
Do not think everyone necessarily relies on what the city agency is going to do, because you do it yourself and just not to take up too much time, but in my building, where we were struggling on the community board with expanding the nork program.
So I just want to provide a quick fact because there's been questions about this, which has to do with numbers of people who are food insecure on the upper West side in our district.
I have some personal experience, having helped some seniors with the get food and white program and by the way, I do, I did see first hand.
I, think one of the problems is information and education and everyone who can help them that way, including Community Board, is substantial because most people I speak to, I did not know- It has been very confusing and just to clarify home, delivered Meals is an ongoing program.
Think it just points to the fact that I know people say we have to stay on topic, but I believe it is on top to talk about budgeting because it starts with street safety.
There are people above the official poverty line who are still facing food insecurity, so that number, I'm sure, is greater, and we have to think about the realities that our budget is not growing.
If a food pantry has to close and can't serve that last person, that's a big problem and we can't fail to deliver on things that we've already promised to our community.
If you can talk about what that gap is going to mean and what it's going to look like, if we can't allocate a larger percent of whatever pot we have next year to food, insecurity, I just wanted to say one quick thing before you started, sorry that on the numbers that were given from this food stamp, of course, they're pre-code numbers, we do not have the customers.
I think that one of the things that you know becomes so important is who your local politicians are and how they're going to be voting in the City Council.
I think that the city council really recognized the importance of food and try not to completely wipe out some of the budgets this year.
What, the federal government does what government como does and who we elect as our next mayor and do they understand the importance of food in our community and in our communities, and also you know the City Council members, I think , there's a huge amount of city council change coming up.
You know as food advocates all the time, but I'm not so sure that everybody kind of hears this language.
I have a bunch of questions that I guess I'll dig into the data later it looks like John is a part of the community who's, a data driven person, but my question is really around: How are we working or are we working together with the department of information, technology, communications in the city and all of their smart city, Initiatives to tie the people that need food to the systems, to the restaurants and to potentially public and private partnerships?
We have people that are, you know able to deliver the food.
I know they did that with caterings city put out an RFP and a lot of caterers Were providing meals for seniors and delivery programs and have they been successes for the restaurants?
You, know programs and actually giving people the opportunity to donate money when they order food and to me that would be.
Do you coordinate to make sure that folks who are being discharged have access to food they may be, And I know the homebound have to go through an assessment by case managers to get home delivered meals?
I said: can I speak to your CEO and they transfer me to Oklahoma The, while you're setting that person up for permanent, secure food, delivery, look talk to your providers, your hospital social worker and see if the people that you're concerned with, if they're going to be or if they get offered.
Charles, talked about food being a human right and that we need systemic change and then the idea from I think courtney about restaurants and how you can make coordination and how you can make sure you have discharge plans.
Try to solve hunger solve poverty with the people that are hungry, starving and food, insecure, and I think that in the beginning of his administration, he kind of gave a lot less power to the food policy office and did not expand it and did not act in a very progressive way.
And, then I think there is a lot of great ideas that I'm I need to process when we read over the minutes around how to serve and meet the needs of particular populations so that they have access, for instance, making sure That people with disabilities.
I think we can get into more specifics, but the report that was published that was put together by people on the on the call their organizations provides the frameworks and like where we can start and also recent data, because the data that we have that's accessible is pre-covered and then also.
Other service providers in the community are being funded that that's also in terms of food insecurity that is also getting to the front of the line.
