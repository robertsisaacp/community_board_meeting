I want to first talk about how, during this time, many organizations, including you know, for example, not only your organization, but we saw organizations like bravo great community organizations that have stepped up, and I want to thank all of them for what they've, done.
Unfortunately, sadly, my office has had to help hundreds of people in our district apply for unemployment.
Some people are afraid about their business with the future when the state has set up a mental health line which I'd like for all of you to share in your social media, networks.
You know in the vicinity in the area, and we want to prevent that from happening and get this information out to as many people as possible, and that number is 844.
I've been working with the governor's office to get down state to get the whole state really reopened in that sense, but as of right now, it's 49 out of the 62 counties, so we're still pushing for down state, If anyone has a story to share with me that I can then give to the governor about how this is impacting real people.
You know looking for ways that we can reopen our economy and get people back to work.
So I just want to start off by expressing my condolences to anyone here tonight who may have lost a family member, a loved one, a close friend, and I definitely want to take a moment just to remember all of the people here in bay ridge and southern Brooklyn, who we lost, especially during the height of the pandemic.
A lot of our seniors have not had access to food, so I just wanted people to know that we have been pretty busy signing up.
Up, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office, and I know: In addition to signing up seniors for food, you may have seen whether in the papers or in the social media, that I was also out there delivering PPE door to door.
If you don't know, consider yourself notified and informed when I get off this zoom, I will make sure that josephine has the flyer and will ask if maybe the community board can share it on their page.
There's a lot of still a lot of grim news out there, but we do look like we're coming down the other side of the mountain and doing what we can here passed a bunch of good legislation last week to help our local small businesses doing everything we can to try to support them to make it through this tough time.
They're, really trying to ramp up testing The only way we're going to get ourselves out of this doing the best we can thinking forward about the summer figuring out, beaches and street fairs, and that kind of stuff doesn't look like much of that is going to be happening, but we do need to think creatively, And you'll see more and more people out and about on the streets who are just fed up with this We are demanding some new guidance, so we can move forward safely, but we can have some semblance of the summer.
So I, know that we're all working really hard to try to increase access to food in a bunch of different ways, but it really tells us it reminds us just how lucky a lot of us are that we can put food on the table for ourselves and our families, and so many of our neighbors can't the emails that I get at two or three o'clock in the morning from people who are still, you know dealing with frustrations with the unemployment system, and you don't know what they're gonna do.
This is what does it look like when our businesses reopen what creative steps we have to take to support our local businesses on our avenues, whether they are bars, restaurants, shops stores , I, think we have to come together and really think outside the box about ways to create sustainable economic models for them to be able to reopen and stay open once we're out of the other side of this.
Senator I'd like to now move over to the public hearing portion, and I invite doris cruz, the chair of our zoning and land use committee to present on the BSA special application, doris dorsey, might still be muted.
The committee met to discuss the BSA board of standard and appeals, application, 2019 275 b7 for a building proposed at 9201 fifth avenue more easily recognized to us as the kentucky fried chicken site, and the application is for a special permit.
Isn't working Zoning issues can be confusing arcane and if anyone has any questions, confused want more information feel free to reach out to me or to the district office, because it really helps to get the confusion.
The district office continues to work remotely on day-to-day issues, as well as preparing for committee meetings.
The communications committee will be meeting and reporting to you next month, but in the interim, please make sure you, like our pages.
We welcomed, michael madden, rachel cramer chris yadoli, terry naruho, and chris cyret from the new york city, parks, department and also present at the meeting was liam giordano from senator andrew gnardis's office.
There are few parks within this area that also prov dedicated space for a dog run.
Following the board meeting a few questions from board members and the public were that were forwarded to the new york parks and we received the responses, and I will go through those now.
Justin hyatt made a motion to write a letter to the new york city parks department in support of the design as presented.
With you know, the park and walking a dog there at night, and I was very happy to hear that it will be well lit, because the area right now is very dark.
No, I just wanted to add that the parks department is requesting just an endorsement of the design, as it was presented.
I think a lot of the questions about hours of operation and all can be addressed when the parks committee joins with the councilman's office to work on forming a friends group, as we have with other dog, runs in the district, and I think it is important.
I just wanted to give a final comment of like I'm, really excited to see so much attention being paid to the southern part of shore road park lately, especially with the new ramp just north of this, and now a dog run.
I. Think that being indicated that that's something that would be worked out with the friends committee and with the parks department, So right, now, the only thing they're asking us about is the design you know as to the hours of operation.
So I'd, like to thank all the members of the nominating committee for serving and I believe and therefore we will be able to all vote next at the next June meeting.
We could ask him if he's had these types of issues, how he's handled and how he will continue to handle as we approach the summer months, yeah, especially like this coming weekend and the weather gets warmer in Manhattan All day long that people, you know they came in parties.
We've always had a situation by the park on 67th street between third and fourth avenue has had really a growing homeless encampment, especially during these difficult times, and so I just wanted to raise that issue once again, as that, it being an issue of concern for our community and I will tell you that I did speak to captain conwell and he did raise that issue with me today about homeless in the northern section of the district, and they are working with DHS and outreach, and I will relay that specific location to him as well.
So I, don't think, there's been any proposal in our district or having you know the open streets, but that doesn't mean that they're there aren't considerations for that.
People from other neighborhoods are going to start coming to our area.
They said it's wonderful, but as the city reopens, it would be very helpful to have streets in their clothes for additional pedestrian and bicycle traffic, so that people feel safer traveling once the city is open for business.
