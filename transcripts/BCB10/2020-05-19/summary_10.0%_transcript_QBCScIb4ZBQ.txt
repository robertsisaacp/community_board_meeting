Most of you know he owns bay ridge, bakery which donates cookies to just about anyone who might want a cookie I learned a lot about my community and the body about everyone here and is it was really a pleasure and just my business Now I would like to call for an adoption of the agenda Second, thank you now to move on to the public session we're going to try going to attempt to limit each speaker to two minutes.
Sadly, my office has had to help hundreds of people in our district apply for unemployment The first thing I wanted to say tonight was you know if you or if someone within your company or neighbor or friend, is still having trouble weeks later getting through to the dol system?
In your social media networks, You know in the vicinity in the area, and we want to prevent that from happening and get this information out to as many people as possible, and that number is 844 863 three one, four, eight four, eight six, three a it was a hold on all of that, and there are a lot of people who are suffering people waiting for hip replacement, knee replacement, glaucoma surgery , I've been working with the governor's office to get down state to get the whole state really reopened.
I wanted to give people a really quick update, because I know that there are a lot of speakers tonight, but my office actually has been pretty busy from day one when everything was going on It's, not that we were being hard-headed when the governor was telling people to stay home, but the fact of the matter is we find ourselves just really not having a choice and just putting our boots on the ground going out every day to see what people needed.
We just got another 2 000 from the mayor, we're giving those out right now, as we speak in a couple of days, I'll be tabling out in bay ridge Look for that information on my social media pages, I'll probably be in front of one of the supermarkets that has a lot of foot traffic and If people want to sort of make a change and keep their phones term free, gmailcom help ad46 gmailcom people love to use it They contact us for anything that they need, whether they want meals from the city, whether they want boxes of groceries, delivered to them, whether they need PPE.
As always, there's a lot of still a lot of grim news out there, but we do look like we're coming down the other side of the mountain and doing what we can here passed a bunch of good legislation last week to help our local small businesses doing everything we can to try to support them to make it through this tough time You need me we're doing lots of mass giveaways in addition to whatever city hall is doing we're doing mass giveaways, wherever we can making sure our folks on the front line, still have masks and also we're getting our own public testing site starting the week of may 25th, which is next week, it's going to be at 85th and and fifth, which is the first, the ground floor of the municipal parking lot and it's going to be Covid-19 testing.
They're, really trying to ramp up testing, is really going to be The only way we're going to get ourselves out of this doing the best we can thinking forward about the summer figuring out beaches and street fairs, and that kind of stuff doesn't look like and you'll see more and more people out and about on the streets who are just fed up with this We are demanding some new guidance, so we can move forward safely, but we can have some semblance of the summer Senator andrew gonardis, senator You know in some ways there's not much new to report.
So I share that with you all, just to kind of put in perspective, the type of pain that people out there are still feeling and still dealing with, even if they are otherwise healthy and okay My office is here to help with whatever you guys need We've been processed we've processed a couple hundred unemployment cases, thus far people still waiting for their checks from late march middle of march, which is crazy, but we're still trying to help people So. and I know what have a lot more conversation around This is what does it look like when our businesses reopen what creative steps we have to take to support our local businesses on our avenues, whether they are bars?
Restaurants, shops stores, I think we have to come together and really think outside the box about ways to create sustainable economic models for them to be able to reopen and stay open once we're out of the other side of this Senator I'd like to now move over to the public hearing portion The chair of our zoning and land use committee to present on the bsa special application, doris dorsey, might still be muted.
The committee met in quorum via zoom on thursday may, 14th The committee met to discuss the bsa board of standard and appeals application, 2019 275 b7 for a building proposed at 9201 fifth avenue more easily recognized to us as the kentucky fried chicken site, and the application is for a special permit, Pursuant to section 73-44 of the new york city zoning resolution to permit the reduction of necessary parking spaces for the proposed building with uses in parking requirement, b1 at 92, 101, 5th avenue, basically they're asking for a change in the permit in for parking The proposal.
I'd like to now move on to the district manager's report , josephine The district office continues to work remotely on day-to-day issues as well as preparing for committee meetings, you may have noticed our social media pages on facebook and instagram were launched this month.
The communications committee will be meeting and reporting to you next month, but in the interim, please make sure you, like our pages, The cb10, email newsletter distribution list, has grown and become a great resource in getting our day-to-day important Covid-19 19 update I too, want to shout out to all the community groups who have rolled up their sleeves to help others in the community At this unprecedented time.
For this follows the design phase is set to end on november Although it was noted that this particular project would probably be constructed in 12 months If. The project would be complete around february 2022 If, not an additional six months, would be added to the construction phase, bringing the new the project completion to august of 2022 following the board meeting a few questions from board members and the public were that were forwarded to the new york parks and we received the responses and I will go through those.
So I just want to clarify the only thing that they propose on putting in the area Is that the only thing that they are said that it would be putting in the area besides the benches ex been, and that would be the only structure, One of my questions to parks was whether the lighting would be sufficient to fill the entire space.
I think a lot of the questions about hours of operation and all can be addressed when the parks committee joins with the councilman's office to work on forming a friends group, as we have with other dog runs in the district and I think it is important to have a friend's group We have one at some of our others in the district at owls head and at daika beach park and I know for daika beach park.
I just wanted to give a final comment of like I'm, really excited to see so much attention being paid to the southern part of shore road park lately, especially with the new ramp just north of this, and now a dog run, it shouldn't increase and attract more people to use this part of the park.
We haven't received any complaints about that, but I certainly could reach out to the precinct commander absolutely and report back to the board We could ask him, if he's had these types of issues, how he's handled and how he will continue to handle as we approach the summer months, yeah, especially like this coming weekend and the weather gets warmer in Manhattan All day long that people you know they came in parties.
Brian hi, I know in some parts of the city, they've been doing open streets I was wondering if there's been any consideration about doing that in bay ridge, Since I know it's an area that you know we're used to having our street festivals and our walks and lots of block parties as the days get better The footprint of where people can go.
But unfortunately, marine avenue is a bus route and the cross streets that were on the application were non-existent and if there are any other open street applications, the department of transportation will notify the board and I will share that information with you all People from other neighborhoods are going to start coming to our area.
I know it's a bus route, but portions of sherrod could be open, and so the spillover from the park could extend out because it's going to spill over doris- and they said it's wonderful, but as the city reopens, it would be very helpful to have streets in their clothes for additional pedestrian and bicycle traffic, so that people feel safer traveling once the city is open for business That like it would be very sad to have a summer in bay ridge where there has not been a stroll of some kind, even though it would not be a organized stroll with actual people like we'd have to enforce social distance.
