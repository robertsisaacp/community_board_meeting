He owns Bay Ridge bakery, which donates cookies to just about anyone who might want a cookie I learned a lot about my community and the body about everyone, here, and It was really a pleasure and just my business, Now I would like to call for an adoption of the agenda.
I want to first talk about how, during this time, many organizations, including you know, for example, not only your organization, but we saw organizations like Bravo great community organizations that have stepped up, and I want to thank all of them for what they've, done.
I was happy to work with them very closely and trying to get them supplies, but from you know whether it was lutheran whether it was manatees whether it was the Va Over the last several weeks the priority was delivering supplies to these organizations, getting them whether it be face shields or masks or medical gowns.
Unfortunately, sadly, my office has had to help hundreds of people in our district apply for unemployment.
Some people are afraid about their business with the future when the state has set up a mental health line which I'd like for all of you to share in your social media, networks.
You know in the vicinity in the area, and we want to prevent that from happening and get this information out to as many people as possible, and that number is 844,863.
I've been working with the governor's office to get down state to get the whole state really reopened in that sense, but as of right now, it's 49 out of the 62 counties, so we're still pushing for down state, If anyone has a story to share with me that I can then give to the governor about how this is impacting real people.
You know looking for ways that we can reopen our economy and get people back to work.
So I just want to start off by expressing my condolences to anyone here tonight who may have lost a family member, a loved one, a close friend, and I definitely want to take a moment just to remember all of the people here in Bay Ridge and southern Brooklyn, who we lost, especially during the height of the pandemic.
I, wanted to give people a really quick update, because I know that there are a lot of speakers tonight.
A lot of our seniors have not had access to food, so I just wanted people to know that we have been pretty busy signing up.
Look for that information on my social media pages, I'll, probably be in front of one of the supermarkets that has a lot of foot traffic and We even got a really cool donation, of, like I think, 500 or a thousand cell phone cases.
That includes many of the seniors here in Bay Ridge we're going to have people from the the New York City Department for the aging, the New York City Food Czar program who's been coordinating all the meal.
There, but we do look like we're coming down the other side of the mountain and doing what we can here passed a bunch of good legislation last week to help our local small businesses doing everything we can to try to support them to make it through this tough time.
They're, really trying to ramp up testing The only way we're going to get ourselves out of this doing the best we can thinking forward about the summer figuring out beaches and street fairs, and that kind of stuff does not look like much of that is going to be happening, but we do need to think creatively, Even though restlessness is not a metric that the CDC follows, restlessness is a reality.
So I, know that we're all working really hard to try to increase access to food in a bunch of different ways, but it really tells us it reminds us just how lucky a lot of us are that we can put food on the table for ourselves and our families, and so many of our neighbors can't the emails that I get at two or three o'clock in the morning from people who are still, you know dealing with frustrations with the unemployment system, and you do not know what they're going to do.
Senator I'd like to now move over to the public hearing portion And I invite Doris cruz, the chair of our zoning and land Use Committee to present on the BSA special application.
The committee met to discuss the BSA board of Standard and appeals, application, 2019 275 b7 for a building proposed at 9201, Fifth Avenue, more easily recognized to us as the Kentucky Fried chicken site, and the application is for a special permit.
Pursuant to section 73- 44 of the New York City zoning resolution to permit the reduction of necessary parking spaces for the proposed building with uses in parking requirement, b1 at 92,101 5th avenue, basically they're asking for a change in the permit in for parking.
Zoning issues can be confusing arcane and if anyone has any questions, confused want more information feel free to reach out to me or to the district office, because it really helps to get the confusion.
The district office continues to work remotely on day- to- day issues as well as preparing for committee.
The communications committee will be meeting and reporting to you next month, but in the interim, please make sure you, like our pages.
We welcomed, Michael, Madden, Rachel, Cramer, Chris, Yadoli, Terry Naruho and Chris Cyret from the New York City, Parks Department, and also present at the meeting was Liam Giordano from Senator Andrew Gnardis's office.
This dog, run, is located by the area between third and fourth avenues and between shore, road and shore.
There are few parks within this area that also prov dedicated space for a dog run.
The board meeting a few questions from board members and the public were that were forwarded to the New York Parks, and we received the responses and I will go through those now.
Next question: Is there a friends group that will be maintaining the dog run or will New York City parks provide regular maintenance?
This pit would need complete reconstruction and conflicts with the open run dog space that we are proposing.
Justin Hyatt made a motion to write a letter to the New York City Parks Department, in support of the design as presented.
Okay, Madam, chair, may I say something Brannan's chief of staff, and I spoke to him about the issue of the friends group and he does have a list of interested dog goers who attended the scoping meeting, who were interested in forming that friends group and we both committed to working with the group and the parks Foundation to organize that friends.
They, said, I think the maintenance, the maintenance gates, were going to be locked and only opened, for you, know, parks, Department, crews, those big large gates and those were the double gates.
So I just want to clarify the only thing that they propose on putting in the area Is that the only thing that they are said that it would be putting in the area besides the benches Ex been, and that would be the only structure, yeah One of my questions to parks was whether the lighting would be sufficient to fill the entire space.
With you know, the park and walking a dog there at night, and I was very happy to hear that it will be well lit, because the area right now is very dark.
I think a lot of the questions about hours of operation and all can be addressed when the Parks Committee joins with the councilman's office to work on forming a friends group as we have with other dog, runs in the district, and I think it is important to have a friend's group.
I just wanted to give a final comment of like I'm, really excited to see so much attention being paid to the southern part of shore road park lately, especially with the new ramp just north of this, and now a dog run.
I. Think that being indicated that that's something that would be worked out with the friends committee and with the Parks Department so right now , The only thing they're asking us about is the design you know as to the hours of operation.
So I'd, like to thank all the members of the Nominating committee for serving and That the at the June meeting.
So I do not think there's been any proposal in our district or having you know the open streets, but that does not mean that they're there are not considerations for that.
They said it's wonderful, but as the city reopens, it would be very helpful to have streets in their clothes for additional pedestrian and bicycle traffic, so that people feel safer traveling.
