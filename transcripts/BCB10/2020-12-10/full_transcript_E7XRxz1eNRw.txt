And, thank goodness, we record these meetings so to go back and watch it probably several times to get the report accurate. That's, okay! Are we? Okay? We are live, so you may start all right guys. So welcome to a joint committee meeting between zoning and youth services. This is a big one and the last time we had a meeting in regard to this was actually March, 18th 2019. So that's a little while ago, but CB10, we supported the motion and we asked for the following and we wrote a letter to the SLA and we asked for this that a task force would be established to create a traffic plan focusing on traffic control, device, installation traffic violation enforcement and parking. Two, that the New York City Council changed the administrative code of the city of New York that allows school buses to park on the street near a school overnight, eliminating parking spaces on these already congested residential streets. The SCA will be requested to return to the community board every three months to discuss the design of the school, which of course, is where the Nathan's is. That's. Where we're talking about right. Now, on the corner of 86th and 7th Avenue, the SCA be requested to return to the community board every three months to meet, to discuss the design, brick style, appropriate facade and with respect to the needs and concerns of the surrounding neighbors, four, that a plan for refuse storage be created inside the building and, finally, that the SCA coordinate construction work hours with the other projects that will be in progress in the area and to restrict noise and other obtrusive work necessities stage lights to daytime hours. So this meeting in particular is to discuss the design. There will be presentations by the school construction authority and our review should focus specifically on design issues three and four yes, and we can review number four and I can go back whenever you guys need me to repeat what those are we I can go back and do that so I know we have some reps here and I would say again. Thank you, everybody I know we have a full crowd tonight and I'm sure we'll have lots to discuss, but I leave you in the capable hands right now of us of the Sea coordinator, Steve Gonzalez Steve. That's your cue okay! Thank you very much. First of all, again Anthony. Thank you good evening, everybody on behalf of the school construction authority. My name is Steve Gonzalez. I'm project support manager for the SCA for south Brooklyn and I want to thank again the joint committees of real estate youth services, education for sponsoring this meeting tonight, of course, we're talking about the former Nathan site design presentation by our architectural engineering team. As you mentioned, it referred to before Anthony. This address is 650 88 6th street on the corner of 7th Avenue and 86th. It's opposite the dork trails and the Dyker Beach golf course on the seventh Avenue side and on the battery a battery avenue side, the Battery, Street, Side, River, Avenue side, there's this residential. So having said that, I would like to introduce our SCA architectural Engineering team. Maria Gomez Ja, hey, Ku, Junson, Ginty, Lee and Ashley Reilly will be sharing the screen Josephine. So, yes, everyone has. She has permission. I've given permission to all I also have I hope he's still on it's Ramsay Narayan he's from our deputy chief for Brooklyn and Mike Mirasola from external affairs, he's director of external affairs for the SCA. So with that I'll turn it over to Jayaku Hey Phoebe. Can everyone hear me? Okay, yeah, yes, great good evening, everyone, my name is Jahiku, I'm a managing architect at New, York, City school construction authority. Thanks again for having us here tonight. The design team and I are here to present the intermediate school Is-332 here at Dyker heights in Brooklyn on 86th street between 7th Avenue and Battery Avenue. This school are we presenting. Is everyone seeing the screen? We are no we're not seeing the screen yet not yet no okay, yeah starting up there. We go yep there we go okay. Here we go so this school will be a standalone five stories high and will provide seating for 550 students from sixth to 8th grade. The building will consist of administrative classrooms specialized instruction spaces such as art, music, science, a library, a cafeteria and a kitchen gymnatorium, and an outdoor play yard. The entire school site is within a commercial district. Please. This is an area map showing our site in red DOT. Our school is located here in the red DOT close to the border of Bay Ridge, and here is the interstate 278 and the barys on the bridge, to the left and to the right is the open, Dyka, Dyker, Beach golf course, and as Steve mentioned, if you're a dog lover like me, there's a Dyker, Beach dog run right to the right side of our school site. So this is the photo of the existing site taken from the 86th street. The site currently has a one story: high fast food, restaurant Nathan's, hot dog. This is a photo taken from the corner of our site at 86th and 7th Avenue, and you can see at the back of our site is a four-story high apartment building which we'll talk more of in the future slides. This is a photo taken along the 7th Avenue looking down and to the right is our school site and to the left of the picture? Is the Dyker Beach Park and the dark run, and this is the site where parents will be typically dropping off their children in the morning and then picking up their children. This photo is taken looking back at 86th street from 7th Avenue, and you can see the gas station across this photo is taken at the corner of a site of our site and you can see the two-story high residential building and the four-story high apartment. Building that I spoke up be prior to this is a photo of the Duiker Beach Park on 7th Avenue across from the side. This is the photo taken from the seventh Avenue and closer to the 88th Street now south of that block, and you could see the three-story high residential buildings with the brick facades. This is the photo taken now on 88th street, and you can see a mixture of three stories and four story. High buildings here in the middle of the block of the 88th street, which is the back of our lot, is a four-story high building, and this is a shipper building and Tudor Revival style and on the later part of the presentation. Jimmy will talk more about this and how it became a source of inspiration for our building facade. This is now photo taken back on the 86th street and looking onward, and you can see the range of buildings from three stories to seven stories: high apartment buildings with the retails below at the street level, of another view on the 86th street, with the neighboring buildings of brick facade with the cornish treatment on the top of the building, that's continuous, with punched openings along the facades. This is the view along the battery Avenue with the gas station across the street and from here on, I'm going to pass it on to Jumi, where she's going to discuss more about the neighboring building and how it informed our own facade designs, hello. My name is Jimmy Song and one of the architects on the project team. So our design approach was to be mindful of the building's context looking at the surrounding buildings in the neighborhood as a source of inspiration to ensure that our building will be a respectful addition to the area. The four-story, Tudor, Revival style, residential building at the back of our school. That Jahi had mentioned, was built in 1929 and is recognized by the New York State historic preservation office. To be an example of pre-war apartment design. We took note of the brick articulation of the facade. The stone entrance arch, decorative cornice and parapet at the roofline, and the use of various materials to highlight different areas of the building looks like please. Here is a prospective view of our school from the corner of 86th street and 7th Avenue. The main entrance along 86th street is set back from the sidewalk, creating an open and welcome environment for students to congregate as they enter. The school is easily accessible via public transportation, with a city bus route along 86th street, as well as a subway entrance within walking distance students can also ride their bikes. As there is plentiful, indoor and outdoor bike storage, they can also be dropped off along 7th Avenue, as Jahi mentioned earlier, and enter through the play yard entrance. We believe that the school is a good fit within the context of the neighborhood. Its main facade along 86th street ties in well with the brick three and four story: buildings across the street, with a continuous band of punched openings, a blend of thin brick in various tones patterns and textures, complementing the neighborhood, pronounced window frames and a robust cornice Jin hee Lee will talk more in detail about the site plan and the four plans of the school good evening. This is Jinghili Orchestra 4k, 332 projects, intermediate school building volume is located near intersection of 86th street and Battery Avenue player is positioned close to the ground parks along 7th Avenue and school building has main entry on the 86th street and there is another entry to the building to the right side of the building facing play, yard and proposed parents drop off and pick up location will be along. 7, 70. and student can enter the building through the play. Er gate on the 7th Avenue and students using the public transportation can utilize the entry to the 86th street. Also, we have bike racks inside the vestibule. We also have outdoor bicycle reps next to the entry to the building and play yard. Intermediate school building is signed for the capacity of 550, and then we have 18 regular classroom from grade 6 to 8. Also we have a two special education classroom and one reading research forum and one with a specific research room. We also have specialized instruction spaces, such as art, classroom, music, classroom science lab with prep room. We also have physical education spaces such as regime. On the top floor. Also, we have outdoor play yard, that is approximately 8,700 square feet and exercise room is also located. On the second floor, we have large public assembly spaces such as cafeteria with the kitchen on the first floor and gym material. It is multi-purpose room with a stage on the top floor. Also, we have library, student support spaces such as guidance suite and medical suite and parents community room, and we also have Ottoman Suite office, including teachers, work, room and step launch room. Please we have partial cellar, close to 86th street away from the neighboring building on the south on the cellar we have electrical and plumbing equipment, spaces, custodian office and storage spaces and locker rooms. Also, we have by usual shower area with the lockers and the cellar or bike user. Please, on the first floor, building footprint is about approximately 12 feet, setback and the entryway, and then we have 20 feet wide sidewall on 86th street the whole building is accessible. An elevator is provided throughout the building for accessibility. Also, two sets of stairs are provided either side of the building for circulation and, as you can see, on the right side, you'll see main circulation, stairs near lobby and play yard. On the main floor, we have large public assembly space such as cafeteria with the kitchen on the south part of the building and admin office. Suite is provided on the left side facing 86th street. Also, we have parents community room next to the admin office with also. We have separate, refuse, recycle room, collecting, compacting and storing garbage for the building on the left side of building facing battery Avenue. So they have a separate entry at the exit door to the battery side. Also, kitchen has separate service entry from battery avenue from second third first words typical classroom. Layouts are very similar and four classrooms are located facing 86th street and we have one regular classroom on the left side and then one regular classroom on the right side facing player. Also, we have secondary corridor from main corridor leading to specialized spaces such as exercise room, music classroom. On the second floor also, we have waiting resource room off from the second year corridor for supervision of the floor. We have step lunch room and guidance office suite please on third floor. We have six regular classrooms similar to second floor. Also, we have one special ed classroom and one speech research room for specialized instruction space. We have library and art classroom at the end of the secondary quarter for supervision of the floor. We have supplies office next to stair a please. On the first floor, we have six regular classroom and one special ed classroom similar to lower floors. Also, we have a science lab and prop room located at the Andata Secondary Corridor for supervision of the of this floor. We have stepped workroom list. On the top floor. We have gymnasium with a stage for multi-function. Also we have supporting space related gym, such as locker storages and gym instructors. Office can accommodate 360 to persons. Also, we have dividing partition in the middle of the gym. So when dividing partition is closed, the half gym can handle 181 person each also. South half gym can be utilized as auditory function. With a stage the telescoping blitz reading can be pulled out close the stage and can not accommodate 190 persons, including virtual spaces, also stage can handle approximately 29 persons. Please, on birthday level, we have mechanical boiler, room, elevator, mushroom rooms, so this space can be only accessed from access for maintenance, personal and customization staff. So this level has access to raw roof. Also, please, on the main roof. We have mechanical equipment and photovoltaic panels to meet local low, and we also have access pathway for part permanent personal, and we have also access pathway for maintenance personnel as well. So these pp panels can generate approximately 3:32 kilowatts. They can support the power for the lighting during summer time. I believe this is the end of the slide. Thank you. Jinny we're very excited about the proposed 322 k at district 20, as the team illustrated the proposed building with a blend of thing thin brick with a gentle setback along 86th street, complements the neighborhood. We incorporated bicycle racks inside and outside the school to promote healthy initiatives to reduce demand for motor vehicles. The photovoltaic panels on the roof will provide renewable energy for the building, as Ginny has mentioned, and the open school yard on the east side blends well with the open, Dyker Beach park across the street. This concludes our architectural presentation. I'm going to hand this back to you, Steve all right, I now turn it over. As Jai mentioned. The fact that we took into account of we know that 86th street is a busy through affair. It was mentioned at the our last at the last community board meeting that we met about a year and a half ago. So that's why you have the parent drop off and pick up over on the seventh Avenue side, and we also have the setback of the main lobby on the 80S street side. I know another concern which, as it's been mentioned several times by the a e team, the fact of blending in the architecture of the new five-story building with the existing buildings in the neighborhood. So they took that very much into consideration. So with that I'll turn it to you Anthony. If there are any questions, oh yeah, so thank you so much for that presentation and we're going to open it up to committee members for questions. So if you could either I guess use the raise hands function on there. If you could or Josephina can see who has a hand up, you're, muted me, no just I, don't know so we have Doris Cruz and then Julie Thumb hi Doris hi for sixth grade. If there are enough students who live more than a mile away from the school, they are entitled to bus service, I, don't know what your catchment range will be, but where would you anticipate that and I'm assuming many, some of the special ed kids might need bus service? Would that be handled? Our understanding is that this special district is not a special education. District 75 is not assigned to this school. However, if we need to accommodate bus stops, I think we can look at, for instance, the seventh Avenue site. Where we had mentioned, we can have the bus stop there, where they can have an ease of entrance through the schoolyards. Thank you, okay, Julie thumb. That was actually one of my questions. Thank you Doris, but the other question I had was: when do you expect completion of the project number one and the number two, the parking that's going to be eliminated along seventh avenue and other places? What how what is going to be done to provide for residents or people in the area who are going to the shopping and the golf course etc for extra parking? I'll. Try to answer that. First of all, the occupancy anticipated occupancy date of this school is September 2024. the parking situation. The D.O.T will have the responsibility of determining in terms of parking restrictions around the perimeter of the building from the battery Avenue side, all the way around the 86 to the seventh Avenue side, and they won't determine in terms of the parking situation until later on and towards the end of the project right. So I just want to add to that Steve that you know that, following the last meeting, councilman Brennan did reach out to the department of transportation. I know that you know the concern right now is that because the building is not yet constructed, they are going to, you know, determine bus based, you know, bus allocations and other you know, transportation needs as we get closer. Typically, if there is school bus, you know need for drop-off spaces. It's usually you know. A set time is no standing. 7 a.m to 4 p.m. That that's typical, that has you know that has varied from school to school, so that comes closer Julie to you know, as the school gets ready to open. That is correct. Thank you, Josephine, and so next we have Steve Harrison and then Anne Faludigo, hi Steve, I'm Steve Harrison you've met before how you doing Steve very good. Thank you. Two questions both having to do with sound the battery Avenue side is that does that have homes near it yeah? Yes, there are homes, there's homes directly behind the building and I believe there's. Yes, there are one or two homes opposite the building on battery. Of course, I think you have that closed down, I think a gas station or so yeah right. The reason I'm asking is because I see that the music room was going to be on that side. Having lived next to a place, a school that had a band I will tell you that they're not exactly the Boston pops. You know what I mean and I was wondering. If there's any way, you could maybe move it to the seventh Avenue side. On that particular floor, if you could redesign that way, there would not be any kind of a disturbance whatsoever. Okay I, just perhaps this is Mike Mirasol from the SCA. Perhaps our architects can speak to the acoustics in our new schools. We don't build windows that open generally and the acoustics and are much different in an old building, as they are a new building. So perhaps our architects can discuss the acoustics and the and how we build our buildings. Yes, so we our the windows that we're specifying for this building is double glazed and it will accommodate the acoustic nature of it, as well as the thermal nature, to keep the sound insulated and also the there are lower buildings along the battery side that are close to our school site. So there isn't going to be a direct elevation relationship between the two, so the sounds, and especially the facade of the residential building that faces off our school site. There are no windows there, so I don't believe there will be any concern for transfer involving of sound. Do the music rooms also get built with like acoustic panels or any consideration to dampen out of the building nowadays as well? Our Sca's school design, guidelines? Okay, because we all are concerned with sound transferring between classrooms to classrooms. So the answer to that is yes, yeah, okay and the second question I had again relating to sound. This is Steve again that I noticed that the gymnasium is on top of classrooms, or at least a few there's. Is there a sound issue with respect to the classrooms, if they're playing basketball right above them? No, we actually have a special detail for our flooring, so that sound is not transferred to the classrooms below. Thank you very much, you're very welcome, I, think Dean Ann was next and then Dean and then Robert Oliva, I'm sorry to start with an unproductive comment, and that is that I continue to feel that this is a poor site for the school and I know. That is not something we're discussing tonight, but I. Don't wouldn't feel true to my thinking and my job on this committee. Not to reiterate that comment. It's congested. It is an arterial street from the BQE to the verrazano. It is crowded with the vacant lot. However, I won't dwell on that. I do want to mention some specific comments with respect to the building, with respect to the context and the respect for the Tudor apartment building, just to be clear. In my own mind, the mechanisms for this were the brick materials up to the fourth floor and then the change of material, so that you observe a datum. If you will against the brick buildings across the street, is that was that the context gesture architects is that correct was that the contact neighborhood context looking to consider the data line as the building material and the texture changes from the street level to the mid level and then to the coordinates with the big fans? Okay, we also took into consideration how the building facades all within the community have punched openings played with that, and also at the top panel you'll see the plunged openings for the gymatorium, where it's sculpted, so that we are playing with also the changes in the day the sun move across the facade so that you will experience a different light level and the shading throughout the day. Okay, with respect to the street streetscape, is there any possibility of setting back the upper level of the gymnasium at the penthouse level? I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? Yes? Is there any chance of your setting back the street wall at the penthouse level, which I believe is the upper level of the gymnasium? The building is set back from the property line as much as we can so, but only at the first. Only at the first floor are you talking about from the 86th street side. Yes, I'm talking about at the 86th street side. Would it be possible to pull the penthouse level the upper level of the gymnasium face back on 86th street right now? The lot is very tight in order to fulfill the program requirements that we have, we I believe we've used the site and the undulation of the building to our maximum capacity without sacrificing our program requirements. So I'm afraid that to answer your question out of the way if I was to set back the germatorium, we won't have enough, we won't be able to accommodate the square footage that we need for the students at 550. Okay, I have three more questions. Josephine is that okay go ahead, yeah? Okay, your three-dimensional, drawing the position from which it's drawn shows the open yard as pretty expansive. But when you look at the plan, what is actually the dimension of the open yard from 7th Avenue from the 7th Avenue side relative to the overall length of the building? So what is the distance from 7th Avenue to the side? Building face step back Ginny? Do you have those dimensions? I know you have the square footage, I'm wondering the dimension of the open yard along 86th street, so I'm opening the cash drawing right now to measure that distance I'll get back to you on that. Okay, next, is you have a school of 550 people and I think we have to accept the reality that the few cars that can be accommodated on seventh Avenue are not going to handle 550 students, so we must accept the reality that 86th street is going to be congested by cars, dropping off and picking up. That's just a fact and I think that needs to be acknowledged in this group and working down to the most specific of my questions, the entry to the school from the seventh Avenue side. Why did you leave? Why didn't you put the stair as discreet from the lobby? Like you did on stair B stair, a the entry is open to the stair. Would you talk a little bit about that from a design? Standpoint of the plan am I not clear. No, I'm not clear. Okay, stair a when you come in from the open yard side of the school you're actually coming into the stair hall. On the first floor. Yes, I'm wondering why or if that is why you made that choice versus making a discreet vestibule there, because it feel it does not fit. You presented it as a secondary entrance, but it doesn't feel like an entrance in the plan. It feels like you're coming into the stairwell. This is the side entrance from the school yard is to serve as a for operational needs. The main public entrance is along the 86th street side. That's the drop-off entrance is from the seventh Avenue side. I think you said, Martin I believe that you presented that the seventh Avenue entrance from this from the open yard was where you expect a good number of students to come in from the drop-off point. There really is no lobby there right. The there is one single main public entrance. Vegetable is from the 86th street side. Okay, thank you. Just before you go to Dean I just wanted to add and I know that you had shared prior and I know tonight in terms of this site of feasibility for the school I. Do want to stress. I do want to point out that, as you probably know and I think all the members of the community board know that district 20, unfortunately, is the highest need for seat need in the entire city. We have a real estate division, that's constantly looking for sites through district 20, whether it's in Dyker heights or in Bay, Ridge or Sunset, Park or borough parts of borough park or bath beach or parts of Bensonhurst, and it has been. You know. It's always constantly assured I've had these discussions with Josephine in the past to try to find you know suitable sites for and proper sites for a new school. So it's always a challenge for us. So whenever we can purchase a property for a need for a school, we make every attempt to do so. As I said, district 20 has the highest need for seats because of the population. Demographics are constantly evolving and changing, and unfortunately this, as I said, district 20 has the biggest need for seats in this in the entire city. It used to be it's district 20 and district 24 in Queens, but now it's district 20, so I just wanted to point that out. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Team yeah I have a few things. First, S B S t suite. What does that stand for? It is for school-based student support. Okay, thank you. So Steve your question about the gym. You must have been watching the commercial about the step dancers, those step dancing in this school. Don't worry, I, don't know Steve. If these two questions is appropriate for you, but two things for this school yard will that be available to the public after school hours? That will be the determination of the school itself. The school will make that the that call. Okay, the second one I think, is the same answer for the stage area. Our community would probably make very good use of that if it were available for rent, but I'm assuming that would depend on the administrator of the school. That's great we'll depend on the principle of the school. Yes, thank you you're very welcome. Thank you. Dean Robert Oliva thanks Josephine, and thank you all for that very thorough presentation as we're living in the new normal of Covid-19 I know that this plan was put forth in 2019 and moved forward. Since then, my question to you all is have adjustments been made based on the needs to operate in a school building in light of Covid-19 proper filtration things of that when we think about design and we think about infrastructure, I think those are important things in light of cobia 19 to think about. So I just want to ask what adjustments have been made in anticipation of changes in code to ensure that there won't be additional investments that need to go into changing what that infrastructure could potentially look like in light of the Corona virus. Let me take a quick stab at that Steve God, willing coronavirus and will all be immunized by then, and it will be in the rear view mirror, but our new buildings do meet the best and highest standards for fresh air and air, Exchange and I know our engineers on the on this presentation can elaborate, if necessary, but you're, in good shape with our new buildings. Thank you, Michael. Thank you! Rob Marissa Perez hi, I'm sorry! If this was already answered, but I had a question: are school buses just to clarify and parents dropping off on 7th avenue, or is it just? Parents and school buses are on 86th street dropping off for is I, don't think we have bus, drop-off, location designated for school site. Yet, okay, literally independent middle schools, don't have bus drop off occasionally if a child has a special need or something- and there is no district 75 program here. So you won't have that issue in general, there might be a bus or something as far as the all of this and all of these drop-off issues and concerns will be addressed as we get closer with the department of transportation there, as when things fall into place, they like to do a walk through and they like to establish what the parking issues will be, what the signage will be, what the drop off where the drop-offs will be. So in this case, we don't see a major impact with buses, and if there is some we'll work that out with the D.O.T as we get closer, they really they don't really like to get into it this early. It's there that's the way they operate. Okay, all right! Thank you, I guess, I'm still a little confused because of the two separate following up with what Marissa was saying: you've identified two separate entrances. You know drop-off points, one on 7th Avenue and one on 86th street being the main entrance. So when a student comes into school, typically, they you know they come in. They have to show you know I d they're greeted. Will that be available on both sides, or will children be dropped off at seven and have to walk up to 86th street to enter the building? I think I'm still confused by that. If someone could clarify that it really is going to come down to what the individual school wants to do and feels works for them that, as you said, the general procedure is children come in and everyone enters through the main build main entrance, because that's where security is, if, as I've seen a hundred times in the past, a school feels that they want to take say certain classrooms classes or let classes queue up in the yard beforehand. So the kids will hang out in the yard. Teachers will go out. There greet the kids, the teacher will be at the back door. Let the kids in that way and then that door will probably be closed. The rest of the day, if this and I'm not and I, can't really speak to how the this particular principal will run his or her school. But that's generally the way it works. If I can, if I may add to what Michael just stated, we've introduced a side entrance to address some of the concerns that was brought up in terms of the heavy traffic on along the 86th street. So at the end it will be dependent on the principle in terms of how they're going to operate the school, but we provided the flexibility in the design so that the security desk can monitor the entrances on the side street. Should there be a need to provide side entrances instead of the main entrance on 86th street sign I. Think the concern there to just drill the point home is the main entrance being on 86th street. Every parent is going to drop their kid off to the main entrance of the school. That's like the default I want to take my child to the main entrance and I think. Even though there's the entrance on 7th Avenue, you know, is there going to be a delineation to be like? No, this is the drop-off zone, not the main entrance, I think that's and I think Anne. You were trying to elude that a little bit too, because you know you were saying you know, there's it's just a stairway. There's no vestibule, there's no lobby. So what is there to entice a parent to drop them off on the seventh Avenue side, as opposed to the main entrance of the building? I? Think I'm trying to condense everyone's point into one single thing. You know what is that just school based how we're going to use that stairway entrance or is there a design thing that can happen school-based and I'm sure you, the community, will have some input there and parents will as well, but this you know we build the schools they use them. We wouldn't be I, wouldn't be so pretentious as to think that I would tell somebody an educator how to run their school I can make. We can make suggestions, we can make it easy, we can make it function, we can give them options, but at the end of the day it's going to be their call. Is there a? Is there ever a pretense, or is there a to have a secondary lobby like? Could that stairway entrance be turned into some a secondary lobby that no because then you would need a secondary security agent because they have to pass through a school safety agent and the schools in the school safety can not, and I've never seen them assign to a school of this size a secondary entrance, but again they I have seen many times very often that they will bring in some children from one side. Some children from the other they'll have a print that, depending on the grade level and what and how they run their school, it really is up to them and that's something when a principal is assigned you might want to have a conversation with them about I would agree with Mike that I had I also have seen that in many schools that they do have the drop-off they have the lineup and egress on the side of the school instead of through the main entrance happens all the time. It happens all the time I've seen it. I have a question. Yes, so you have an entrance on the 7th Avenue and 86th street. So will they have like a door at the back of the building for the kids if they walked in from 7th Avenue they go inside the building through the back of the building like my school, we have 88th street and 89th street, so 89th street there's a the main entrance, so there's students coming in from there, let's say fourth and fifth grade and then on 88th street. We have the kindergarten to third grade coming in and then there's a door on the back of the building for them to walk through exactly and that's what we have here. You talk about ps264, yes and that's what they've set up here, they've, giving them some flexibility and some options by putting a back door in yes, yeah, okay, that school opened a number of you a couple years ago and you're right there's an entrance in the back and there's one inside yes, so they probably have that too. Yes, they do yeah and one more thing about this same topic. The principal really is gonna have limitations about leeway about how to handle that Seventh Avenue entrance, because you're coming into the stair hall, when you enter that door you're in the stair hall that communicates throughout the whole building, so there's nothing of a vestibule on the seventh Avenue side. It's basically an egress. Yes, okay, I'd like to address that. Having spent time dropping grandchildren off at school, there's a main entrance which has a vestibule and there are many other entrances. The one squad thing one has four entrances: they use three in the morning and the only ones without the vestibule, it's where the kids line up and the teachers take them in so I think as a rule, there are not secondary vestibules and I want to reinforce for that. A previous CB10 administrator community school district, 20 administrator, said about concerns about drop-off middle school. Kids, don't want to go with their parents; they want their independence, they want to get there on their own they're, getting to be big. Kids they're. These are not toddlers. We have to remember that my daughter forced me to leave her a block from school over the last block anyway and if there are and they need in order to have bus service only for the sixth grade, they need to be able to fill the bus if they don't fill the bus. There is no bus service right. Okay, I have a question, just maybe on like a bit of a lighter note too, for the playground or the school yard is there. Are there plans, or this may be down the line to have an actual like playground park situation that could be used not only by the students during the day and I'm not sure if they do this for intermediate school I know like to put like a handball court, or things like that there is that part of the plan, or is it just gonna, be just like an open schoolyard? Is that something you guys you know take into consideration now or later on? We have something yet we generally work this out with the school community as we get closer, usually with middle schools. They like big, open spaces and maybe a basketball hoop and some lines, some track lines or things like that. The lower levels would go in for the equipment that would be an early childhood playground, so middle school kids really generally like to have just space. Okay, I believe I saw that the plan had baskets there's a good chance. The basketball hoops are generally added to these I mean. But again, when we get close, we work with the school to see what works best for them. Some communities, love, basketball, other communities that don't so it's I, don't know a question him. Are you planting street trees on the seventh Avenue side? In particular question? Can you commit to street trees on the seventh Avenue side yeah? We do have three street trees on South Avenue, two new street trees on the 86th and three new trees on. Thank you, okay, I'm just looking I, don't see anyone else's hand raised for questions, nothing Steve, Dean! No, actually, I do have a quick question. I'm sorry! So from a traffic and a safety standpoint, is there going? Do you know what percentage or will there be a? Do? You know people that are children that are physically challenged. My concern is with children that have those needs. That obviously, would come with a you know: bus maybe with a wheelchair, lift or something like that. You're speaking about then taking you know it takes time to the bus has to stop. They have to unload, they have to lower the wheelchair, lift and all that from a safety-ish. You know standpoint and time standpoint. If you have multiple buses like that or multiple children like that being dropped off. That would affect the whole traffic and safety pattern there. So that was a concern that I had and the question that I had again that will be handled by DOT as we get closer to the opening of where drop off will be yeah, but of course the school is fully accessible, so yeah we can bring them in from many different points. I'm sorry Anthony! We do have another question. Waging Leo you just have to unmute yourself. Wait! Sorry! Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, yeah tacking onto that safety issue, because I have a daughter, who's actually in middle school, and you know I agree totally agree. They want to be independent and I know you know. If it's going to be a public school, a lot of the kids you know will be coming from the train station and I noticed that you know. There's like a bagel store across the street like most of the shops that have food or snacks are across the street. So I'm just wondering: will there be any kind of safety measures put in place because crossing 86th street is a main thoroughfare going to the BQE from you know for morning, drivers who are trying to run the light or you know just be very hasty and you know God forbid, there's any accidents. So I was just wondering if there's any kind of safety measures put in place again that, as you get closer, DOT will walk through and adjust the lighting it'll adjust the lights, the timing and make whatever changes they feel are necessary to make the intersection safe. So that's a conversation for them down the road, but yes they're aware, and they will they have that's what they do: yeah there's a whole school safety division with the Department of Transportation way and also at the last meeting. We also spoke about the need for school crossing guards at this location. Okay, if I may also add, it was also brought to my attention by a local principal in the area. That D.O.T has already been made aware of the issues with the in terms of directional signals as such, so I know that they've been already been petitioned. Yeah Councilman Brandon has already met with them on the issue as well yeah can we talk about the refuse, storage and garbage and how I saw there was a plan there to keep it inside? What is that? Looking? Oh, like I know. That was something we had a concern about. Could we put that graphic up again just so everyone can see the floor plan in that area. That might be helpful there. It goes. Thank you, so it's the gray box that you see there along the battery Avenue side. So we have a direct access in and out and we actually met with the sanitary department in terms of coordinating with them so that we keep the refuge inside the building until there is a pickup available, and is that a compactor that's in there to or is it just I'm not sure how that works exactly or is it just a garbage room? We do have a compactor inside of the fuse, recycle. Okay, thank you. Lori did you have a question? You had your hand raised, you're, muted. No, that was actually my question. I just wanted. We were talking so much about that. First floor plan and I just wanted the visual on it. That's all. Thank you we're just I'm sorry. Another quick question was the buildings behind the proposed school where they taken into consideration. There were windows there like is this school going to be blocking anyone's current? You know gorgeous view of 86th street right now or anything like that. I mean I know you know, and you know, then I'm the person who lives in that apartment and all of a sudden I'm staring at the classrooms. I'm just wondering if you know there was consideration taken into the positioning of the actual building. Yes, so there are no when those on the residential buildings facing our property and it, with the exception of the shipper building and it's set back considerably, and we made a conscientious effort to set our building back as much as we can so that there isn't that kind of awkward relationship. Okay, thank you. Does anyone else have any questions regarding the design of the building or Doris I, see your hand is back up. I just wanted to say. The impact on the windows on the existing residential buildings would be an issue even for a straight commercial building allowed. So it's a standard issue that comes up all the time. Totally yeah. Absolutely one thing: I didn't introduce myself, I'm the chair of Community Board, 10 hi for those of you who introduced myself too no problem. So thank you. I'm have some noise going on in the house today. These are my son's headphones. There's video games they're great by the way, but I just wanted to say, having seen the floor plan and heard the concerns you know from Ann and some of the other members about that egress that there's a very similar layout. Actually at my sun school ps686, where they have, you know a vest, a doorway that goes into the common hallway and then they have one main entrance and what they do there is in the morning the children come in through the front entrance and at dismissal they go out through that side entrance into the side school yard, but they do come in the morning. They do come in at the front entrance because of the security, because you know they're only provided with a certain amount of security, but it is something that does work well, but as to traffic, that school does experience traffic on both sides of the building at the intersection. I just wanted to mention that, with the floor plan that I've seen that work before. Thank you way did you have another question or is your hand up from before? No I actually just noticed a quick minor detail in the kitchen with their that rough use area. I, don't know if you can put that plant back up on the screen, but I noticed that there's two doors, one from the main corridor outside of the kitchen and then one out to the street to battery place I think. Is there not a door from the actual kitchen to the refuse area? Will they be taking the garbage outside to the main corridor, where students and faculty are oh yeah? Look at that. It looks like you can get out through the first floor corridor, maybe and walk around, but is that ideal to bring garbage out that way to them? Where Everybo, where are the staff and students are going to be passing by or should I mean I should I would think that there's a door directly from the kitchen just to kind of minimize any you know drippings or you know just slapping the stuff, yeah good question: yeah the we coordinate very closely with the office of foods- and this is the kitchen layout- that's been approved with them and I will bring up your concerns in terms of direct access from the kitchen to the garbage area and we'll accordingly, questions I think we should look into that. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. Okay, no worries, that's good! Would you be able to bring up the excuse me? I'm sorry, would you be able to bring up the building again as it sits on the property? Okay, so, on the other on the far side of the building there's space there, where there's no space there far side that we're looking at, we need to bring up I think the site plan would be better you're talking about the battery Avenue side, the backs like as we were just looking at the picture. Now: okay, I'm just saying that: okay Battery Avenue! Yes, we lost it there. You go not much just not much. The reason why I asked was I just had this afterthought of you know, consider with the drop off of seeing. Was there any way to have some not to use that word? It's the improper term, I'm sure, but like a circular driveway or a place where the cars could come in and then go back out, but I can see that is not feasible yeah, it's also to go through the yard at the drop-off time and the pickup time that's garsdale! Well, it was just a thought. You know I thought. If there was space it'd be wonderful, it could be done. That's why I was asking okay. Thank you. That would be terrific anybody else. Josephine! No I don't see anyone I guess we could take down the oh. The shared screen share, screen, yeah I, just took it there. Let's see a chair Willis your hand is back up. Is that from before so I think we are going to open it up now, Josephine Wright to members of the public for questions yeah, so I there's one hand that's raised from I. Think it's the public, I'm not sure. If it's Muhammad from state Senator Grenada's office hold on okay, Muhammad I think you can speak now, yeah good evening, everyone good evening. Okay, am I, clear, yes, okay! First of all, I want to introduce myself. I am Mohammed Rawasdee, I'm a director of community affairs at state, Senator, Andrew Murdo's office, and this is my first meeting with the CB10 and it was great learning about this new project. I knew that I knew the place. I have been there, I ate many times at Mathens before I, yeah I know the area. So it's going to be a great project. My main concern is the safety of a student, especially it's. The area is very I, will see like it's. There's many streets and avenues and I think 86th street is it's heavy traffic and it's close to the exist to the BQE or so there is an exit and there is a heavy traffic street and this is I think. The main concern for me is how the department of transportation gonna implement safety measures to protect the students, especially they are in young age, again, Mohammed I think that's been mentioned by Josephine and my colleague Mr Mirasola, that Department of transportation, as we get closer towards the end of the project that they will be taking into all the factors, comments that you've made and the comments that have been made by the community board and that they'll come down to a decision in terms of traffic situation and safety there in the area, yeah I hope your office will be there with them to do that. Walkthrough. That would help yeah. Yes, and there definitely will be. You know, follow-up meetings as we get close closer with our elected officials. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. That looks like it. No other questions. Doris, look, no questions, so this was informational. There is no like we have nothing to vote on necessarily unless someone wants to make a motion to regard in regard of the design. So, if I look to you guys, does anybody have anything they would like to add or make a motion towards the design, nothing wow? It was informational. It was all yeah, it was informational, it's all informational. So thank you. Perhaps you should make a motion, though, about the door that way suggested go from the kitchen to the refuse area. I, don't know you can make that I would like to support that. Did you just I think Julie you just made that motion. Okay, I'm making a motion I never made a motion before in this meeting, I'm so excited. This is a good one. I make the motion five seconds, I. Second, our eye second discussion. Anybody, yeah I, think it's too specific emotion for a preliminary plan and would imply that we've reviewed the position of every door in the building. I mean okay, I. Take it back well, look you can rest assure that we are definitely going to look into it because it makes sense. Yes, it sounds like it was a good point that was brought up and our a e team will discuss this with the sanitation and we're also with food services right and then Steve you, let me know so: I can inform the board. Yes, I will yeah all right so with that I want to thank everybody for coming to the meeting Josephine. Thank you so much for all your help, organizing everything Steve. Thank you to your team, Michael, everyone. All the architects I, have to make a motion. Yes to end the meeting, so a motion to adjust to that before you take the motion. I I'd like to on behalf of the SCA I, want to thank them, our entire, a e team, our construction management and Mike, and everyone involved in the design and future implementation of this project, future school site and for a great presentation, and thank you all for giving us the opportunity to present this tonight. You brought some very good insight and some very good questions and comments, so we do appreciate your participation on this project and future ones going forward. Thank you thanks. Steve. Thank you. Everyone. Yes, good night, all right good night, every night Lori go play. Some video games.
