Dot. Our school is located here in the red DOT close to the border of Bay Ridge, and here is the interstate 278 and the barys on the bridge, to the left and to the right is the open, Dyka, Dyker, Beach golf course, and as Steve mentioned, if you're a dog lover like me, there's, a Dyker, Beach dog, run right to the right side of our school site.
This is a photo taken along the 7th Avenue looking down and to the right is our school site and to the left of the picture.
Looking back at 86th street from 7th Avenue, and you can see the gas station across this photo is taken at the corner of a site of our site and you can see the two-story high residential building and the four-story high apartment.
This is the photo taken from the seventh Avenue and closer to the 88th Street now south of that block, and you could see the three-story high residential buildings with the brick facades.
This is the view along the battery Avenue with the gas station across the street and from here on, I'm, going to pass it on to Jumi, where she's going to discuss more about the neighboring building and how it informed our own facade, designs, hello.
The main entrance along 86th street is set back from the sidewalk, creating an open and welcome environment for students to congregate as they enter.
The school is easily accessible via public transportation, with a city bus route along 86th street, as well as a subway entrance within walking distance students can also ride their bikes.
Jinghili Orchestra 4k, 332, projects, intermediate school building volume is located near intersection of 86th street and Battery Avenue player is positioned close to the ground parks along 7th Avenue and school building has main entry on the 86th street and there is another entry to the building to the right side of the building facing play, yard and proposed parents drop off and pick up location will be along.
We have partial cellar, close to 86th street away from the neighboring building on the south on the cellar we have electrical and plumbing equipment, spaces, custodian office and storage spaces and locker rooms.
On the main floor, We have large public assembly space such as cafeteria with the kitchen on the south part of the building and admin office.
We're very excited about the proposed 322 k at district 20, as the team illustrated the proposed building with a blend of thing thin brick with a gentle setback along 86th street, complements the neighborhood.
The photovoltaic panels on the roof will provide renewable energy for the building, as Ginny has mentioned, and the open school yard.
That's why you have the parent drop off and pick up over on the seventh Avenue side, and we also have the setback of the main lobby on the 80S street.
There are enough students who live more than a mile away from the school, They are entitled to bus, service, I, don't know what your catchment range will be, but where would you anticipate that.
However, If we need to accommodate bus, stops, I think we can look at, for instance, the seventh Avenue site.
Typically, If there is school bus, you know need for drop-off spaces.
Yes, So we, our the windows, that we're specifying for this building is double glazed and it will accommodate the acoustic nature of it, as well as the thermal nature, to keep the sound insulated and also the there are lower buildings along the battery side that are close to our school site.
There isn't going to be a direct elevation relationship between the two, so the sounds, and especially the facade of the residential building that faces off our school site.
I know you have the square footage, I'm wondering the dimension of the open yard along 86th street.
Think we have to accept the reality that the few cars that can be accommodated on seventh Avenue are not going to handle 550 students, So we must accept the reality that 86th street is going to be congested by cars, dropping off and picking up.
Think that needs to be acknowledged in this group and working down to the most specific of my questions, the entry to the school from the seventh Avenue side.
Martin I, believe that you presented that the seventh Avenue entrance from this from the open yard was where you expect a good number of students to come in from the drop-off point.
Since then, My question to you all is: have adjustments been made based on the needs to operate in a school building in light of Covid-19 proper filtration things of that when we think about design.
This was already answered, but I had a question: are school buses just to clarify and parents dropping off on 7th avenue, or is it just.
Parents and school buses are on 86th street, dropping off for.
Is I, don't think we have bus, drop-off, location designated for school, site.
Okay, literally independent middle schools, Don't have bus drop off occasionally if a child has a special need or something.
You won't have that issue in general, There might be a bus or something as far as the all of this and all of these drop-off issues and concerns will be addressed as we get closer with the department of transportation there, as when things fall into place, they like to do a walk, through.
You know drop-off points, one on 7th Avenue and one on 86th street being the main entrance.
That, As you said, the general procedure is children come in and everyone enters through the main build main entrance, because that's where security is, if, as I've seen a hundred times in the past, a school feels that they want to take, say certain classrooms classes or let classes queue up in the yard.
Every parent is going to drop their kid off to the main entrance of the school.
Even, though there's the entrance on 7th Avenue, you know, Is there going to be a delineation to be like.
What is there to entice a parent to drop them off on the seventh Avenue side, as opposed to the main entrance of the building.
You know what is that just school based how we're going to use that stairway entrance.
Yes, So you have an entrance on the 7th Avenue and 86th street.
The principal really is gonna, have limitations about leeway about how to handle that Seventh Avenue entrance, because you're coming into the stair hall, when you enter that door you're in the stair hall that communicates throughout the whole building.
My concern is with children that have those needs, That obviously, would come with a you know: bus, maybe with a wheelchair, lift or something like that.
So I'm just wondering: Will there be any kind of safety measures put in place because crossing 86th street is a main thoroughfare going to the BQE from you know, for morning.
You know gorgeous view of 86th street right now or anything like that.
They do come in at the front entrance because of the security, because you know they're only provided with a certain amount of security, but it is something that does work well, but as to traffic, that school does experience traffic on both sides of the building at the intersection.
I, don't know if you can put that plant back up on the screen, but I noticed that there's two doors, one from the main corridor outside of the kitchen and then one out to the street to battery place.
