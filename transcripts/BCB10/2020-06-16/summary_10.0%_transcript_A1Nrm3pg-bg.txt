I want to give a shout out to the Arab American Association and our board member and co-founder Habib today, who invited me this month to help in the food distribution which was incredibly touching to see and really just incredible experience to be with so many good volunteers and meet and greet residents and our community.
It's, something that we're monitoring and working closely with the tbta And I'm speaking to new board members here to tonight, please, like us on social media.
You know this year at 7 p.m. on a zoom, and there was an application for a new liquor license for a weird wine beer and cider submitted for Luann's coffee bar Inc, located on the first floor of 7405 3rd Avenue.
She stated that you cannot see into the windows New York City Building inspectors attempted to gain access to the premises on February, 25th and 26th of this year.
The committee questioned her further regarding the repeated complaints, noise, promoted, events, illegal use of alcohol and the need for police intervention.
The committee stated clearly that we wholeheartedly support our local businesses, but it is unacceptable to disregard New York state laws by selling alcohol without a license, endanger the welfare of minors.
In some in consideration of the fact that there is no certificate of occupancy for this building that we do not have photographs of what the actual establishment will look like, but the application submitted submission has not included the new york city building inspectors resolution to the construction without a permit.
This february, we disregard of the numerous 3-1-1 calls for the repeated complaints for noise for a year and a half with no remedy and the knowing illegal Sorry , that's wrong for since September and the knowing illegal use of the establishment as a bar with the continued consumption and sale of alcohol without a license, including the need for 9-1-1 police intervention.
The committee voted to deny this application and to send a letter to the New York State Liquor Authority.
Let's call the question again: We have to do a roll call vote because we are on this zoom format, so Public safety committee agenda, Barbara, Leave me the second out of three is O'sullivan's.
The district office reached out to the attorney numerous times beginning on March 9th 2020, stating that unless they complete the questionnaire and attend a hearing, a letter would be sent to deny this application.
They have never needed that there will be no smoking, and the applicant agrees that should it change its method of operation, it will give notice and meet with the community boarding committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change, and the owner has agreed to all stipulations.
Therefore, the decided to delay this application and attend the CB 10 hearing at the police of Public Safety Committee in September, and that was just for informational purposes for you only since they were supposed to be part of that meeting.
A motion was made by Barbara, Bellucci and seconded by Bryan kasuba to spend the total of five thousand four hundred sixty sixty-two dollars and 20 cents in unspent funds for fiscal year, 2020 budget for deep cleaning and disinfecting the district office and printing of military pamphlets and printing of senior pamphlets.
Don't want it to be any mistakes and our lovely staff and the people who are dedicated to our office for some ways and not get paid We have the communications and public relations committee report by Brian, kasuga.
We discussed ways that the committee can help support the work being done by the district office to keep these accounts.
In addition to the committees promoting our pages to contacts, local businesses and organizations, we're playing creative ways to use the CB time social media to promote positive stories in our community and share important information.
The committee will continue to work to support our social media efforts and look at other ways to promote the great work that we as a board to and that the community should be aware.
We don't need to vote I want to thank you for all of your efforts in getting and getting our Facebook page up, because it was something it was in a long time in the work So moving on to the next item on the agenda nominating committee.
I would like to thank the nominating committee by the way for their work and for their nomination.
If you've, you know followed on the police department's social media.
I mean before you know what you're gonna be getting calls three one as the summer continues of noise smoking people drinking in public?
I mean I, don't know if that has to do with the mayor, the governor, but it's something that we have to keep in the dialogue for all of us, as community And I agree with you in many ways, but having been on the community board for a very long time, I can tell you that there's many captains, I wish, would never leave.
I think we need to have an open dialogue about how we can reform the police department within the community, and it doesn't have to be.
I missed in my report, is that we learned that our former district manager of community boards had Mary sand.
You know this one, that's interested to my office into the Jill's point, this information, just as a point of information, not with any views on it, but the borough president last week proposed having community boards and community precinct councils they'd, be able to weigh in on the appointment of new police, captain's, never precinct as a way to empower and encourage community engagement on that front.
We as a community board I support Jill, and we really have to either under the police of Public Safety.
But you know we're hearing, concern And, so we'll work in that direction, so everyone 38 I, think we'd like to get moving on.
