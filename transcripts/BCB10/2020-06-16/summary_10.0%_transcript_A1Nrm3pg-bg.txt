Like me, where you know the leaders up top make big pronouncements, and then we have to kind of sort out what it means locally, but I do want to acknowledge that since we last met there were a bunch of protests in the neighborhood And They were all they were all very positive, and many of them were led by youth young people, which is very inspiring to see.
Let's be sure that we, both as a community and as individuals, continue to do the right, thing, and We continue to follow the laws and the executive orders for those reopening businesses trying to provide for their families.
So I want to take this opportunity to also welcome our new board members, who were appointed by the borough president and express my appreciation for your service on behalf of all of us, so welcome to new board members, Chris Ellison, Marisa Perez and waging We are in a very challenging time in our city's history and together You know we will work and accomplish great things.
It's, something that we're monitoring and working closely with the tbta And I'm speaking to new board members here to tonight, please, like us on social media Bryan's, going to give a report later, but we really are trying to expand our social media.
We've gotten some valuable input from members of the communication committee, so we're hoping that we can push this goal and Our next General Board meeting is going to take place on Monday, September 15th at sure he'll, maybe, but most likely on I'm.
You know this year at 7 p.m. on a zoom, and there was an application for a new liquor license for a weird wine beer and cider submitted for Luann's coffee bar Inc, located on the first floor of 7405 3Rd Avenue.
It is noted that an in a letter to councilman Brennan a resident reported that the board was to prevent anyone from looking into the establishment from the outside another resident, and she was also complaining about the noise to the Rihanna's of the morning.
She stated that you can not see into the windows New York City Building inspectors attempted to gain access to the premises on February, 25th and 26th of this year.
Our new police captain Tolson and officers Panepinto and Inger breaths in' participated in this meeting through zum reiterating captain Conwell's written report, miss Bridget, Garcia and Mr. Luis Garcia Maldonado, brother and sister were present at the Xoom.
The committee questioned her further regarding the repeated complaints, noise, promoted, events, illegal use of alcohol and the need for police intervention.
The committee stated clearly that we wholeheartedly support our local businesses, but it is unacceptable to disregard New York state laws by selling alcohol without a license, endanger the welfare of minors to continually disrupt the quality of life of our community and to show blatant disregard to the essence of this family- oriented neighborhood in some in consideration of the fact that there is no certificate of occupancy for this building that we do not have photographs of what the actual establishment will look like, but the application submitted submission has not included the New York City Building inspectors resolution to the construction without a permit from this February.
1- 1 calls for the repeated complaints for noise for a year and a half with no remedy and the knowing illegal Sorry, that's wrong for since September and the knowing illegal use of the establishment as a bar with the continued consumption and sale of alcohol without a license, including the need for 9- 1- 1 police, intervention.
The committee voted to deny this application and to send a letter to the New York State Liquor Authority.
Let's call the question again: We have to do a roll call vote because we are on this zoom format , so Josephine Joe June is absent: Public safety committee agenda Barbara, but The second out of three is O'sullivan's Pub& Grub limited located at 18, I know to Third Avenue It has applied for an alteration to the already existing liquor.
Terence Flynn Jr. the District office, reached out to the attorney numerous times beginning on March 9th 2020, stating that unless they complete the questionnaire and attend a hearing, a letter would be sent to deny this application.
The hours of operation will be as the following Monday through Saturday 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. kitchen from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Sunday, 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. and the kitchen from 12:00 p.m. The background recorded music remain below the level permitted by New York City noise, code.
There will be no smoking permitted if need be, New York state certified security will be hired and on- site during all hours of operation.
They have never needed that there will be no smoking, and the applicant agrees that should it change its method of operation, it will give notice and meet with the community boarding committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change, and the owner has agreed to all stipulations.
Therefore, the decided to delay this application and attend the CB 10 hearing at the police of Public Safety Committee in September, and that was just for informational purposes for you only since they were supposed to be part of that meeting.
A motion was made by Barbara, Bellucci and seconded by Bryan Kasuba to spend the total of five thousand four hundred sixty sixty- two dollars and 20 cents in unspent funds, for fiscal year, 2020 budget for deep cleaning and disinfecting the district office and printing of military pamphlets and printing of senior pamphlets.
There was some confusion about boards and personnel actions and I do not want it to be any mistakes and our lovely staff and the people who are dedicated to our office for some ways and not get paid We have the communications and public Relations committee report by Brian, Kasuga.
We discussed ways that the committee can help support the work being done by the district office to keep these accounts.
That's, all one word: community, board, 10, B K, and then you can search and find us and like us and share us in addition to the committees promoting our pages to contacts, local businesses and organizations, we're playing creative ways to use the CB time social media to promote positive stories in our community and share important information.
The committee will continue to work to support our social media efforts and look at other ways to promote the great work that we as a board to and that the community should be aware.
We do not need to vote I want to thank you for all of your efforts in getting and getting our Facebook page up, because it was something it was in a long time in the work So moving on to the next item on the agenda.
You know followed on the police department's social media.
Become familiar with our neighborhood I jumped on this a little bit at the end of the last meeting when we were together, Bob was driving along Fifth Avenue in the 80s Saturday night about 7:30, quite early still, bright, light out, and at least two or three of the bars there had a like 20 people outside Do , not think our commander on the police are there with us.
I think we need to have an open dialogue about how we can reform the police department within the community, and it does not have to be.
I missed in my report, is that we learned that our former district manager of community boards had Mary sand.
You know this one, that's interested to my office into the Jill's point, this information, just as a point of information, not with any views on it, but the borough president last week proposed having community boards and community precinct councils they'd, be able to weigh in on the appointment of new police, captain's, never precinct as a way to empower and encourage community engagement on that.
We as a community board I support Jill, and we really have to either under the police of Public Safety, but we can not not speak on this.
