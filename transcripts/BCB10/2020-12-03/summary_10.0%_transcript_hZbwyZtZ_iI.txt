A special permit for a non-permitted use could use for a daycare center and so we're interested to hear the application, and this is, If we remember all the other discussions in the size of the building, is basically what is permitted under current zoning.
So we're here for a special permit, as mentioned for from by section 7319 of the zoning resolution, to allow a daycare center in a building that is being built.
It's, a new building, it's a five partially sixth floor, building, six or a building with the seller and the school is looking to or proposing to occupy a portion of the first floor along 89th, the entire second floor and a portion of the third floor.
Looking at the intersection of 89th and 5th Avenue, the layout of the building the school is proposing to take about 13,500 square feet.
The remainder of the first floor along fifth Avenue is going to be commercial with the school occupying a portion of the building and their main entrance along 89th street there's also a separate entrance for additional community facility and commercial that occupy the upper floors, which I'll show you in a minute.
This, building building's proposed to have 152 students with about 19 teachers coming primarily from the Bay Ridge area, and the hours of operation will be Monday through Friday 6:30 a.m, to 6:30 p.m, again, not all of the students, the entire time, But we have a staggered arrival wherein parents who have to leave early for work or come home late from work can drop off their student, their children at the school.
We have to make four findings in order to qualify for the change of user for to allow the daycare to operate in this location, one of which is that we have to search the area to find an alternate location in a zoning district where the use is as of right.
That's, where the students will primarily come from any alternate building has to be about thirteen thousand five hundred square feet with thirty six hundred square feet at the ground floor to accommodate the requirements of DOH Department of Health, which says that two-year-olds can't be above the first floor, an additional 10,000 square feet between the second and third floor.
That was located in 9201, fifth Avenue, the coroner 5th and 92nd street, the building's still in its planning stages.
As of right, So you can see from this that we're directly across the street from an R6B zoning district which allows for this school use as of right.
They'll, usually put a or suggested no standing sign in front of the building to allow for drop-offs, and it can be tailored that it's during arrival and dismissal so that it's not disruptive to the evenings not disrupted to the middle of the day when we don't have students coming and going.
It's hold on the other businesses so along fifth Avenue, the commercial district, The commercial use only accesses through that front.
And I'm worried about it laying fallow if, in the event that the school moves out right, So it would require, if it's not a so first of all, It would only be a community facility that can occupy this space and it would.
The expense is something that the ownership took upon, themselves, realizing that this is a tenant that has a well-established business, a well-established school and anticipates you know being in this location for a very long time, I'm confused as to how it can only be a community facility.
Was it their intention to have a school move into this building while before they built I, don't think it was, but the opportunity arose and the developer is doing the construction for the school to entertain the school I think it was anticipated as a community facility space like the fourth floor, but the school came along and it became a good match.
Okay, This question, is, with regard to potential recusal in the committee, is brickellage the architectural firm for the new building or for your application.
So I want to just mention to the committee that 89th street between fourth and fifth Avenue, which is the corner, which is the where the this property lies a number of years.
Now the department of transportation, the Community board, approved a pedestrian safety change at the intersection of 89th and 4th, and as part of that safety improvement project 89th street between fourth and fifth avenues.
This proposal is for the Fifth Avenue and meaning that you know drop-off would be on the right side of the building, which would be the you know.
I do know that the school construction authority was looking at that location, I, don't know what its status is, though, and also remember, also that the dealership across the street and Fifth Avenue that also vacate the building.
Are you saying that it's antiquated, because it only allows for very for a very specific amount of community facility and a very specific amount of you know types of commercial where you're not going to necessarily have small retail there.
You know to be an advocate if you had an alternate business, whether a medical office or another community type, facility, you're going to have an equal amount of traffic to me.
Imagine that any issues with traffic would essentially self-resolve within the first couple of months, which is what we see when we build a new school anyway, exactly the same issue, which is why we I think we don't see that many complaints, after one is built, is that everyone kind of figures out how to live with it.
The motion is because I believe that exactly what we're talking about C8 district is intended for this kind of a thing for crowded area and this kind of thing it does not infringe in any way on the local residential, population, I, think that, Under the circumstances and as I said before, we need schools, We need day care centers, and this is something that is needed.
However, in the situation and considering the time constraints, This was done on a temporary basis and now those flexibilities are beginning to expire, and thus this proposal would help make the post sandy provisions permanent and also it would expand them so that communities have a greater flexibility to adapt, and this is based on all the feedback which we received with the stakeholders, the community members, the businesses on what provisions they wanted and wanted greater flexibility with as we'll see in the presentation and ultimately, This will help everyone living and working in the flood plain area to design, as well as retrofit the buildings so that it would reduce future damage from coastal storms would be resilient in the long term by accounting for future risks from climate change and also, of course, potentially to help save on the flood.
They were established after a long and robust study and stakeholder research process, So the first is to encourage resiliency throughout the current and future flood plains, and this is really people living in and around flood plains want to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they are not located in what is currently determined to be the high risk, flood zone and people also.
People want the option to raise the occupiable or ground floor space a little higher than the current flood level that FEMA projects, because they have seen higher flood levels already and, as we know, with the climate change and the risks involved, that level and risk is expected to only grow in future.
What this means is that for any lot, which is located either in the high risk or the moderate flood risk, planes would be allowed to use the proposed special options for resilient building design and just for those who are not aware, The 0.2 percent floodplain serves as a proxy for the high-end projection of 2050 and the one percent annual chance flood plain, allowing the city to advance the resiliency in the longer term.
The proposal would allow such exemptions to apply to both existing and new proposed buildings, and the intent is really to apply the allowance more consistently and support the new buildings adapting to climate change, and the current rules also include flood area exemptions for spaces that are dry flood proofed, and this is to promote active uses at the street level and so moving on regarding the building envelope.
While we have all these rules, we recognize that not all buildings in all situations would be helped by the provisions and the options which are envisioned and anticipated are required, and so the proposal would allow, or rather continue to offer discretionary pathways in the form of Vsa special permits to ensure that certain unique situations which has not been anticipated or expected, or any hardships based on lot issues or special constraints, can get relief from certain zoning provisions in order to meet the standards for construction which are given in the flood plain.
The proposal would allow power systems like generators, solar energy, systems, batteries and other storage systems to be considered as permitted obstruction in open areas across all zoning districts.
It just makes it more flexible for property owners and homeowners if they want to do resiliency retrofits on their homes on their buildings, which can include elevation, But there are other strategies as well, and part of this proposal is allowing for people to undertake partial resiliency measures so that maybe they can't do everything all at once.
Is the flood resilient construction standards and that is required right now for properties in the one percent annual chance flood plain or the high risk flood zone.
Yeah, because I know that, like the New York City, flood plains had only been updated, I think before Sandy they hadn't been updated for 30 years and they were updated after Sandy have not been updated.
I know that the National Academy of Sciences I, think in, like 2015, had said that, basically, That floodplain would probably be flooded every 25 years give or take in the New York City region.
The community board, the Zoning Landings committee reviewed this three years ago in October, 2017 and supported it, But in that time are there any changes to the flood plan in community board 10, since 2017 has the flag.
Is what is currently in the building code for flood resilient, construction.
