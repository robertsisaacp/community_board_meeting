And I would like to introduce the members of the Parks Department, who will be making a presentation this evening regarding the Shore Road Park dog run construction.
But none of these parks have a dedicated dog run space, and here I just want to talk about the existing conditions on the site.
We have some playground features in here that we'll see in some of the site photos later in the presentation, and we've got three great light posts and a currently empty planting bed on the outside of the site and just beyond this 8-foot fence.
You can see we have this fence, that's not in great condition and some old play equipment, and these little tree pits here in terms of accessing the site.
That's not an excellent condition and you can see through the trees, because it's fall, the Verrazano in the background and between the park site and the view point Then we have our little planting bed outside of the fence.
We have this double door: double gate entry here off of the main path, which is aligned with the stairs and Within that vestibule we have a trash bin and a dog bag dispenser, of course, and from there the path There's, a concrete path that leads to either side of the dog run And that's an ata, accessible path which will have companion, seating and bench.
And we're also dividing the dog run with that four foot: high fence we're going to keep the existing 8 foot fence along the back of the site, because that protects us from the adjacent properties It's connect to the highway, and it also helps kind of change.
The view of this site And then we're going to keep the existing 12 foot high chain- link fence on the side of the tennis courts.
What we're hoping to do with our synthetic turf application is used that as a way to do some clever engineering and underneath that we'd like to install a pretty robust drainage system that prevents input onto this area of the path up, here, but also just manages and collects all of the stormwater that hits our site instead of sending it elsewhere or sending it directly into the river Then we'll also be just improving the overall health of the trees by including that softened lawn area, because their roots will finally have space to breathe and that just about ends our slideshow presentation for the dog, run.
It looks like the large dog area actually has some pretty good canopy cover from the north from the upper part of the image there, but just wanted to make sure that there's enough shading and near the seating areas for people waiting around watching their dogs, play.
