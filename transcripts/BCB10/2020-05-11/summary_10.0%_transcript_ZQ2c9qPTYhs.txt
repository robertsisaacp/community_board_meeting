These are our goals on this slide, but we also have a couple of other goals that are based on community input and those are to have softer surfaces, so less concrete, for example, and on top of that, we wanted to think about correcting some of the drainage issues that are currently happening on site So. If you're familiar with this area of site, it is a very low point in the park and there have been some issues with water accumulating there, especially here I think that's very important and you all likely know a lot about this park.
Think these trees will be a great resource in the summer months when it's very warm- So, it's a panorama and you can see that 10-foot high fence , that's not an excellent condition and you can see through the trees because it's fall, the Verrazano in the background and between the park site and the view point, and then we have our little planting bed outside of the fence Next.
High fence into two distinct dog runs with a lot of the same features: We have the small dog run here on the southern point of the site, with both open lawn and synthetic turf, and that's just under 4,000 square feet, and then we have the large dog run here, which is about 12,000 in total and dogs are able to run from the synthetic turf to the lawn and enjoy that shade and kind of Explorer as much of the site as we were able to provide Also to note, we will be including water access in this design.
This park faces pretty much due south, so we're gonna Imagine these shadows here extending a bit further in the summer months, However in terms of being realistic, I think that some of these benches here are likely to get some Sun, so we're trying to offer some shaded seating on the northern side here in the water dog Just having that alternative seating is really good.
