Everyone welcome to our community for 10 clocks, a mini department of committee, meeting, I'm glad that you were all able to join us , It's great, that we can do this via zoom and move this project forward, and my name is Mike Madden I work for the New York City Parks, Department I'm, a designer And I, worked on this project in conjunction with Zoe Chen, who is currently out on maternity leave.
But none of these parks have a dedicated dog run space, and here I just want to talk about the existing conditions on the site.
We have some playground features in here that we'll see in some of the site photos later in the presentation, and we've got three great light posts and a currently empty planting bed on the outside of the site and just beyond this 8-foot fence.
You can see we have this fence, that's not in great condition and some old play equipment, and these little tree pits here in terms of accessing the site.
And I think these trees will be a great resource in the summer months, when it's very warm- So, it's a panorama and you can see that 10-foot high fence.
That's not an excellent condition and you can see through the trees, because it's fall, the Verrazano in the background and between the park site and the view point Then we have our little planting bed outside of the fence.
And we're also dividing the dog run with that four foot: high fence.
The view of this site And then we're going to keep the existing 12 foot high chain-link fence on the side of the tennis courts.
