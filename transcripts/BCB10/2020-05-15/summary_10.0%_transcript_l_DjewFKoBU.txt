It is our second virtual meeting- we're here- to discuss a bsa application, Number two: zero one, nine two: seven five b: two for special permit: I can't remember: section: 73-44 of new york city's zoning resolution to predict reduction of accessory parking for proposed building at 9201 6th avenue, also known for all of us, as the kentucky fried chicken site Yes I'm, the attorney for the property owner, todd dale from rothbruther inspector, and we filed the application to the bsa.
This is an application for a special permit is section 7344, The zoning resolution and that allows a reduction in required parking for specific uses.
The reason that relief is sought is that currently, six accessory parking spaces are proposed, which are less than the 50 That would be required without the waiver and special permit.
The special permit under section 7344 allows for a reduction in the required accessory parking spaces in this instance down to 25.
Limiting the uses to office space uses, but also anytime, a board of standard appeals grant is issued to a site, and there are specific approved plans if they needed to change those approved plans, It's required to go back to the bsa to get an amendment.
This is being built as a development project and they haven't even reached out to try and find any particular tenants, because we're still early in the process that noted it is expected that the tenants would be doctors who have medical practices in the area or professionals who are looking for office space in you know in the neighborhood that said, I'm happy to answer any specific questions about the proposal or the findings or anything else that comes up stars before I open the discussion to the committee members and then other interest.
They should take the bus or the subway, though, instead of driving I, think I'd rather fight one battle at a time, First of all, with the full requirement of 50 parking spaces and in the second scenario, with the special permit being granted, what form would the building take?
and I would just say at this point: we didn't provide any alternate design because that hasn't been contemplated, I'm, not the architect, so I wouldn't want to misspeak about a design If you were going to try first of all, physically I, don't believe it would be possible to place 50 parking spots on that particular lot without creating some sort of you, know: underground garage or seller, config information for parking, So, I, don't know, I, don't have an alternate design.
With respect to the special permit, That said, I can go back to them and see if there were alternate designs that were suggested as far as increasing parking realistically based on the size of the site and the type of building That's proposed you're not going to get a situation where you would have 30 spaces, but it's something I can bring back to them.
You know they would be trying to find tenants based on what they've constructed and what they're, showing and a doctor or professional who wish to lease space in this building would need to assess the available parking at the building and in the area, and it logically follows that you're going to find doctors or professionals who are going to want to rent in the building who have practices where they don't believe that the parking situation in this neighborhood is going to cause them issues.
I, understand, there's concerns about possible future parking, but the it's a situation as far as what leads What- and I would just you know, pass that on, but with respect to the design Can you know every time we come to a community board meeting You know we always like coming to community board meetings, because it's good for us to share our proposal, but also to get feedback , You know from the community and we can pass it on to the property owner and, as I said at this point, this is the current design, but I can reach out to them and see If there were alternate.
You know I, think the concerns have been made clear by this committee and I will pass them on, but you know just you know, I just confirmed that this type of special permit has been filed before you know, and that's the current design that's proposed and obviously one that they're interested in As I said we found many applications of the bsa and just to give you some big picture, which you know this application fits into is a piece you know.
Think there's a few scheduled for july and at this point those hearings are all set as remote hearings , there's really nothing late july or august you know I my sense is: I don't want to speak for the bsa, but my sense is that they're trying to determine when it might be possible to have in public hearings again and that's why the calendar is a little bit on hold As I said I, don't know you know, since our office is very specific, with the special permit and the legal aspects of this , so I guess I'll turn it over back to the committee.
The second part of it, too, is that if somebody wanted to still maintain maintaining his professional offices or medical offices, you know consistent with the use that's on the certificate of occupancy that if they wanted to make any physical changes to the building, it would then be required to go to the bsa to get an amendment to the special permit.
Just to consider Let's take a look, not very much the floor area ratio That's allowed in this zoning district for the use that's proposed is 2.0 You look at an area that has a large number of doctors, I'm going to just say doctor's role anytime , the fire hydrants have people parked on them.
You said that the zoning requires 50 parking spaces and you're, asking for six The special permit.
