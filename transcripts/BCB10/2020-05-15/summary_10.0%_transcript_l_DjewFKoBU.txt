73, 44 of New York City's zoning resolution to predict reduction of accessory parking for proposed building at 9201 6th avenue, also known for all of us as the Kentucky Fried chicken site , Yes, I'm, the attorney for the property owner, Todd Dale from rothbruther inspector, and we filed the application to the BSA, and.
This is an application for a special permit is section 7344, The zoning resolution and that allows a reduction in required parking for specific uses.
Group four, which would be community facility, uses, typically medical offices or uses in use group six that are within parking, requirement, category b1.
The special permit under section 7344 allows for a reduction in the required accessory parking spaces.
There is a section 3623 in the zoning resolution, which then allows any required amount of parking spaces that are 25 or less in a c23 district to be eliminated, so between the special permit and the waiver, the required parking spaces would be reduced to zero, but six are still proposed in conjunction with this development.
The next portion of the special permit says that the uses must all be either use group six commercial uses that are in parking requirement.
Everybody knows that if the special permit were granted-- and this were on the certificate of occupancy, this could not be a situation where the use could then change to retail stores or some other use that would be allowed in this district two-.
This is being built as a development project and they have not even reached out to try and find any particular tenants, because we're still early in the process that noted it is expected that the tenants would be doctors who have medical practices in the area or professionals who are looking for office space in you, know, in the neighborhood that said, I'm happy to answer any specific questions about the proposal or the findings or anything else that comes up stars before I open the discussion to the committee members and then other interest.
First of all, with the full requirement of 50 parking spaces and in the second scenario, with the special permit being granted.
This is todd, and I would just say at this point: we did not provide any alternate design, because that has not been contemplated, I'm, not the architect, so I would not want to misspeak about a design, but if you were going to try first of all, physically, I do not believe it would be possible to place 50 parking spots on that particular lot.
You know, inundated with a lot more either residents or building facilities coming and going in into this small little area that comes to comes to a head.
I think we something's going to happen at that site, whether it's a hotel as a right or the residential facility, Looking at the area as a whole- I agree: does anybody know the usage of the parking garages that are closer to 86?
Think if you keep putting parking spaces in that area with this development, with all the others that we will assume, are going to happen in the future You're only inviting a lot more cars and a lot more traffic I know people do not like to take public transportation, but the fact of the matter is that when you do, you have less cars in the road.
I think you know at this point this design was presented based on you know what is set forth in the zoning resolution with respect to the special permit , That said, I can go back to them and see if there were alternate designs that were suggested as far as increasing parking realistically based on the size of the site and the type of building.
One typically require less parking and generate less traffic, so it was something that was contemplated by the City Planning Commission and also when they established the zoning resolution.
The second point is that, since there are no specific tenants that should this special permit be granted and the building is constructed as proposed, the property owner then, would be obligated.
You know they would be trying to find tenants based on what they've constructed and what they're, showing and a doctor or professional who wish to lease space in this building would need to assess the available parking at the building and in the area, and it logically follows that you're going to find doctors or professionals who are going to want to rent in the building who have practices where they do not believe that the parking situation in this neighborhood is going to cause them issues.
You know we always like coming to community board meetings, because it's good for us to share our proposal, but also to get feedback.
You, know, applications that the BSA has granted in the past, where that special permit and the waiver both have been applied to projects Just.
I, just confirmed that this type of special permit has been filed before you know And, that's the current design, that's proposed, and obviously one that they're interested in, You, know some possible solutions, so todd you're thinking that you're not going to have a scheduled date until September.
That's been set, and I do not want to speak for the BSA, but my sense is that they're trying to determine when it might be possible to have in public hearings again and that's why the calendar is a little bit on hold As I, said, I do not know you know, since our office is very specific, with the special permit and the legal aspects of this.
That's on the certificate of occupancy that if they wanted to make any physical changes to the building, it would then be required to go to the BSA to get an amendment to the special permit.
You discuss not just the six parking spaces, but the fact that there's going to be doctors, offices?
I, do not know how many and that will have people looking for parking spaces at the same time, in other words, you're, taking six spaces away generally going to be used by the doctors, but you have not done anything to take care of the patients and the sales people and the other people that come into the building.
Have we figured out yet what's going into the the other building acrosss the street, and when that's proposed- And, you know what kind of traffic we can expect there We've had a chance to vote because I think they've, basically paused all the all the euler stuff We decide to go ahead with the apartment building.
There is a combination of you know, some of the parking spaces and some of the first floor area to create like a little u- Turn lane that allows for a drop- That, perhaps could relieve some congestion on either 92nd or 5th.
You said that the zoning requires 50 parking spaces and you're asking for six.
