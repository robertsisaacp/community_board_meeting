My name is Anthony Marino, I'm, your committee chair and It's our first meeting of the year of a very interesting year for both libraries, education, youth services, the whole the whole gamut.
We know the schools are having a tough time, it's hard to get someone from education out, but we were happy to invite our Brooklyn public library, representative, Nyla, Rosario who's here, tonight, and now I do have some slides.
Unfortunately, a lot of the construction projects have been unpaused right now so, but the most important thing is that the project has been funded and I'll work more closely with you throughout the year to see what you could do, as our you know, as advocates for libraries and as partners to help us speed up speed up the process or give you updates on the process and that's for the Bay Ridge Library, which was an exterior upgrade and the dyker library, which was the roof replacement and.
There's things I want to see like chairs or shelves that need improvement, but unfortunately, capital is only brick and mortar.
And I think the great work that you have done in your district really reflects that our elected officials, you know, have been very supportive.
Only two libraries are currently open, and that is the Bay Ridge Library and the Fort Hamilton Library, and I do not know if you've noticed, but we only have lobby service available at those locations.
We hope is going to happen that, but we do not have an exact timeline of Is it like the city, where certain criteria needs to be met in order to move into the next phase, exactly okay, exactly and unfortunately, And we're trying to be as transparent and give as much information as possible, so I'll be definitely closely in touch with the board.
You great anybody else have any questions regarding just reopening Unfortunately, you know, lobby service is very limited, but we do have online programming, that's happening at every location.
So, that's going to happen later in November, because that will be a joint meeting between your committee, youth, services, education, Libraries, with the zoning and land Use committee.
You know a lot of thanks and appreciation to the teachers and administrators in the district who are working through these very unprecedented and challenging times.
I would imagine all of our meetings will have something to do with what you know the response to Covid-19 and reopenings and closings and things all right.
