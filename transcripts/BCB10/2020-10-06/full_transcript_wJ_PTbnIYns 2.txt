You're not talking it'll, be helpful just to speed things along as we there we go live on Youtube, I'm sure I see it popped up. Okay, we're live so anthony. You can start the meeting this evening. Great yeah thanks thanks all for coming to our first youth, Services Education Library Committee meeting. My name is Anthony Marino, I'm your committee chair and yeah. It's our first meeting of the year of a very interesting year for both libraries, education, youth services, the whole the whole gamut. We're we've got a lot of things going on a lot of struggles in our public schools, our private schools and so a shout out to all the teachers out there who are making it work, all the administrators out there who are making it work, all the people who offer services to our kids and youth in our community in the community board. You know, thank you so much. We hope that you're thriving as best you can and that we can help you as best we can in any way. So tonight we have mostly informational things going on a big announcements and an update from our libraries here. In the area, some key projects right some that Josephine you Wanna, update us on for construction and needs and budgets. So I would, I would just jump right into that yeah, so, each so each year, just to I know we have new members on the committee. I see Marissa Perez and Robert Oliva Welcome to the youth services and education and libraries Committee. So each year, as you all know, during the month of October, the community board makes recommendations to the Office of Management and budget. We make a list of our capital and expense priorities that we submit and we vote upon as a board in October. So usually it's during the month of September into October that we invite some of our colleagues in government to give us an update and since the pandemic, normally at our monthly meeting, we have a representative from the library's bpl. So we thought today was a good time to just touch base, see how you're all doing we know the schools are having a tough time, it's hard to get someone from education out, but we were happy to invite our Brooklyn public library, representative, Nyla Rosario who's here tonight, and now I do have some slides. Did you have any slides with you or I do not? I do not have any slides, though yeah, so I'm going to see if I could share so as you're doing your capital. Do you have them broken down by branch, so it? What we have this year is something a little bit different. Your district is in a good position that you do not have any outstanding capital needs. There's two projects that are currently ongoing, but there's no outstanding capital needs in the district. Oh wow, that's great. Does everyone see my screen up? Yep? Okay, so we have four libraries just to refresh everyone. If you do not know the Bay Ridge library, the daiko library, 8202, 13th Avenue, the Fort Hamilton Library 9424 Fourth Avenue is also a Carnegie building and the mckinley Library 6802 Fort Hamilton Parkway. We did last year have two capital priorities. So are you saying now these this work has been done for the favorites? It's actually in progress. That's the Good News! I came to share with you guys today, okay, so that is as it's I was. You beat me to it: okay, yeah! Well, that's great news yeah! So that's and I'll talk more about those projects and and where we are so I do not know if you're, if you're done, I am done I'm trying to get over to you. I appreciate the slides I now I feel bad. I feel like next I'll step up my game for the next meeting and I'll have a slide prepared for you. That's okay! So, first of all welcome to the new chairs very nice to meet you. My name is Nyla Rosario, I'm with the community affairs and government department at the Brooklyn public library and as a and as I was introduced. Thank you so much. I am your liaison for for libraries. So every year, as was mentioned, we do have needs that we go through, but this year through the can you hear me? Yes, oh yeah, sorry about that yep, so yeah. So this year, I'm really happy to report that the two projects that were the three projects. Actually there have been done. I know the mckinley have been funded. Should I say so. Let me just be clear: the projects have been funded, but the projects are in progress, and I know that because of Covid-19. Unfortunately, a lot of the construction projects have been unpaused right now so, but the most important thing is that the project has been funded and I'll work more closely with you throughout the year to see what you could do, as our you know, as advocates for libraries and as partners to help us speed up speed up the process or give you updates on the process and that's for the Bay Ridge Library, which was an exterior upgrade and the dyker library, which was the roof replacement and, in addition to those libraries, you do also have the Mckinley park, library, which also thankfully there's no capital needs there, and the Fort Hamilton Library, which again there's no capital, needs and I'll step back a little to talk about what capital needs are because I know many of you are like puzzle. Looking is like well there's things I want to do for my library, there's things I want to see like chairs or shelves that need improvement, but unfortunately, capital is only brick and mortar. We are Quasi City Agency, and so we all our projects, have to go through the department of design and construction and there's a process and also all capital funding only can be spent for things that are brick and mortar. So I want to thank you all for being great advocates and I think the great work that you have done in your district really reflects that our elected officials, you know, have been very supportive. I want to thank you, know our local council member. We also have our state electives that have been very generous with library, and we want to take this time to also thank them. I do not know if you guys have any questions yeah I have. I wanted something to offer. Can you hear me? Yes, stella, we can hear you. I have to end it. No, I do not show that encyclopedia. If they want to use. I will be very happy to donate. It's beautifully, not open, very untouched, and I have also other encyclopedias if you would like to have them. This is 24 books now, maybe to talk a little bit about book donations yeah. So we can yep, so we could talk a little bit use it. I can bring it to you or you can send somebody to pick it up. I appreciate it. I appreciate it and I think- and I want to thank all our patrons and a founder, the library that wants to you know you guys want to give us books and we appreciate it, but unfortunately we do not take. We take donations only certain times of year where we do book drives, and I do not have the dates right now, but what I could do is I'll get back to you guys by the end of the week and I'll send information to the board about when our book drives are happening. So, if you're interested in doing that, you can do that during those times, but unfortunately we do not take donations at the local libraries. Okay. So now we also do expense priorities. We've always mentioned our libraries too. I mean. Do you have a sense? I know every agency is being hit hard. Could you tell us a little bit about your reopening your impact, your budgeting, perfect? So that's exactly the next thing I have after capital, so we do have a reopening plan and I do not know if you have noticed, but in your district, only two libraries are currently open, and that is the Bay Ridge Library and the Fort Hamilton Library, and I do not know if you've noticed, but we only have lobby service available at those locations. Unfortunately, so what we have right now is that we are opening in different phases and right now we are in phase one, which only involves this lobby service. You know patrons are able to. You know, access the lab lobbies for transactions. We are requiring that you wear a mask. You know before you come to the safety of the patrons and also for our staff. Materials are going to be checked out that are checked out during this time are not accruing any fine. So if you owe anything you know you do not have to worry about fines for this moment and the lobby services include, holds pickups and also returns. I do not know, I could take a break and do anyone has questions about this? I could talk a little bit any questions about the reopening or the branches that are open in the services I see. Robert has a hand up. Yes, I've been very impressed with the fact that you could reserve books online and pick them up at the library. So that's really a good, a good step. Yay Glad, I'm going to definitely give a shout out to our librarians for that who are making it happen all the time, and I do want to give a shout out because I know they can make it here today, but you have great librarians that you know really are doing a great job to keep things running and you're lucky, because you have a two libraries that are opening these services and that's again, the Bay Ridge and the Fort Hamilton Robert, I'm sorry, Anthony Robert has a question: yeah Sir, Rob Yep, thank you and thank you. Nyla just wanted to get a sense of what the timetable would be for the other two branches, to open very pleased that two of the four are open but wanted to get a sense of when those other two branches are due to open and then the second part to the question is: does the Brooklyn public library have any plans to do any programming virtually you know. I know I live around the corner from the from the Bay Ridge, the 70 yeah, I'm on the 73Rd street branch and there's always programming going on. You know you know prior to Covid-19 and just wondering if you are offering virtual resources to the community that can provide additional supports, especially for families whose sons and daughters and grandkids are in the virtual world and they're not getting everything they can from being in school in person, I'm wondering if there are any supports virtually that the library can provide the community. Thank you barbara. You got ahead of me so that was my next point. You guys are on a roll today, so that this is good. So yes, though, so yeah, I am going to talk more about our virtual programs, which we do have, but I'll step back a little and talk about our reopening stages, a little bit more. So right now, as I mentioned, we are in the first stage and we are following. You know, we're working closely with the mayor's office and we're following CDC guidelines, and I do not have an exact timeline right now. Unfortunately, so I do not want to tell you know one thing that is not I can I'll be in touch with the board and what I can do is I can send you a sort of an estimate, maybe of where we are and when we can start the next stage, but as of right now, I do not have like a date per se and we do not have a timeline, but what we could do, but I can't tell you: can you hear me yeah? So what I could tell you is that the next stage of what would happen the services that we're going to offer at the it would be limited access. You know what you would you know patrons will be able to come in and lend and browse a little bit more only on the first floors and we're also going to open the checkouts and the return. The self- service kiosks, which right now are not closed and we're going to have a census computer only available, but we won't have other computers and of course you know, we'll have ecards and all that and the last and the next thing for this next stage, which is the limited access one is also restrooms for patrons. So that's what that's! What we hope is going to happen that, but we do not have an exact timeline of when and I'm sorry about that, it's okay does anybody else have yeah? I have a question so do certain. Quite. Is it like the city where certain criteria needs to be met in order to move into the next phase, exactly okay, exactly and unfortunately, we're sort of in this position where we also had to close down branches in certain zip codes based on the latest guidelines? So it's you know, unfortunately we're living in times where it's very uncertain and we're trying to be as transparent and give as much information as possible, so I'll be definitely closely in touch with the board. Updating you guys every step of the way. Okay. Thank you great anybody else have any questions regarding just reopening and I'll talk briefly about. I do not know how much time I have left no go ahead. Go ahead thanks so much. I feel like next time. I I'll have more for you guys. I promise it'll be a fun slide show up, but so the last thing I want to talk to you guys about was what we're doing while we're closed so yeah. Unfortunately, you know, lobby service is very limited, but we do have online programming, that's happening at every location. We just finished a series of virtual story times for for families in different languages, and I think I'm really proud to say that in your district you had, I think, six or seven languages recovered, so the librarians did a really great job in that district and really trying to do as much as that. So that's still happening which happens weekly. We have our virtual cooking programs, which we've launched, which have been very popular, so that's also happening. You know what I can do and I'm sorry you did not have this, but I have a link that I can share in the chat yeah. If you share it with me, I could also share it out to the board and we'll put in our next newsletter too. That sounds like a lot of fun, yeah and then and then a great way to also stay on top of what's happening. Virtually is also to check out our bookmark newsletter, and I do not know if you're signed up to the to our newsletter. But if you're not, we really urge you to sign up to the newsletter. We have a newsletter that you can get. You know personalized depending on you know where you're interested, if it's family services or senior services. So I really recommend that and I'm going to share that in the chat and yeah and if you sign up to that's the best way to get information about what's happening at the library. Do not. We know what languages you said you have, I'm going to look it up, because I do not want to make it up, but I know I had six or seven languages at the virtual story time they did Bengali, they definitely the Chinese in the district, spanish. Of course, there was a french one which was really nice and there's another one, but I'm going to. I can get that exact information and give it to you great. That's awesome was there, I hear something about the virtual. I know Rob bird had asked something about virtual. Did we talk about that or the zoom stuff? Yes, cooking, there's virtual story time, there's a virtual we're also doing a lot of our adult services virtually. So this is a great way for people who, for example, do not have a learning center in their district in their area that they can virtually do the classes. We also have and I'll send all this information, so you can share it in your next newsletter. What oh sorry God outside yeah? What ways can so like virtual storytelling cooking, like what ways can people who I'm assuming those are employees of the library like doing those things? But how can people volunteer like? Can someone volunteer to do a story? You know or is there something? What can people do while you guys so about supporting the libraries? Let me look into that. I do not know if we have any programming that we're using with volunteers, but we do have a department, that's that just works with volunteers. So I'm going to try to get some information about that and we'll see I'll, find out ways that you know folks can volunteer yeah. That would be great with so many teachers. You know at home, and parents with you know their children at home. It could be interesting if there's a way to volunteer or get involved with the library, yeah yep. That's great, definitely I'll get that information and I'll send that over to you actually tomorrow. Thank you. Anyone else have any questions or comments or concerns. I think it's great that libraries are, you know, they're still just a huge part of the community and they adapt and evolve and they're still just so important. So I look forward to what the future might bring hello. You know necessity and invention. You know I mean who knows what the future is, but thank you so much for your time. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. So much all right. Thank you, Anthony. I have two other quick things for the committee. The first is that we did receive a call from the school construction authority regarding the Nathan's site on 86th street. So, as you know, the board did in its recommendation, ask that they come back to us during the design phase, which is quickly approaching us. So that's going to happen later in November, because that will be a joint meeting between your committee, youth services, education, libraries with the zoning and land Use committee to take a look at the design plans for that middle school and we were notified today. As you know, the mayor's announcement schools are going to be closed in the 11219 zip code and there are two schools within Community Board 10 that are impacted by that closure. First is Christa Mcauliffe, which is on 65th and 12th, and the other is Ps 176, which is on 69th and 12th. So we do not have too much information yet, but I wanted to share that with the committee. I know it's a tough time for our local schools and in dealing with it I know anthony. You had mentioned this also a lot of students that attend different schools that are within the impacted, zip codes. So schools will be closed. You mean will be called. Oh, they are closed already they're going to be closed. Yes, I think anthony so that'll mean so they're going to be cl. It started today was the first day close to in person, oh yeah right, yeah close to in- person learning. So that means these schools are going 100, remote, so they're going to shift over and a lot of these schools had rotating schedules to begin with whether you were going in for a day or two and then doing days at home, so it's just the teachers are now shifting to all lessons being remote. You know through whatever portal they're using zoom or Google, so the kids are still getting instruction. It's just it's through it's through the virtual, I said as a teacher for many years. I do not understand what benefit we have to close for to schools and then work in a I mean. Have a zooming section. The other two that does not make sense does make any sense because they can really be contaminated from those two days that they go. It's it. So there's no yeah, there's no perfect! There's no perfect solution for it. Certainly, I think the teachers and the administrators are working even independently from the mayor and the chancellor. I mean they're everyone's working as hard as they can, and I see this my wife is an assistant principal. So I see this firsthand how hard it is, but you know having the rotating is trying just to mitigate having a large population in the school at the same time so, instead of having all say, 1500 kids in the school at the same time, you know you have two three hundred, it's not perfect, but with math squaring with social distancing it you know. Hopefully you know it would work. We have to have enough time in the schools to even see how it works. We have not even had that much time in the schools, but but right now those schools and those zip codes are going to remote. Hopefully it just takes two weeks and by October I think, that's like October 21st they'll be back. If not, it brings them to November. Third, I believe if they have to extend it yeah, let's just hope it does not. It does not. You know creep into our district even more. I know that 11209 I was in the top 20 sort of warning on the warning list, so we'll see we'll see but yeah nothing's perfect. I agree Stella, nothing is perfect, but I think we're doing or they're doing the best that they can. I can only speak from what I see with my wife going crazy trying to trying to organize stuff so yeah, it's unfortunate. You know and there's a there's, a lot of effort, energy and and work that's put into making these very difficult decisions, and I see it on the college level. The things that we needed to do in order to protect the wellness and safety not only of the students but of the teachers as well. So there's a lot of different stakeholders that are affected, including parents and guardians. So you know, I know the health and safety is everyone's concern and you know mitigating the number of people on different buildings and different campuses, I think, is driving these decisions moving forward. So you know a lot of thanks and appreciation to the teachers and administrators in the district who are working through these very unprecedented and challenging times. I do have one question: Josephine were the pre- k centers closed down as well, because I know there was a pre- k center acrosss, the street from Christa Mcauliffe at the old Regina Pages Youth Center. Do you know if the pre- k? No, I'm not, I'm not sure, because you know I watched the governor's address and it was a lot of details and that a lot of it just came out. My understanding initially was that nursing nurseries were not, but it may be Anthony. Do you know more? That's a good question. I'm not sure the that age range is usually like they're, a little separate, typically those you know when in the three four five year olds, but and that's something I can probably easily find out yeah there's so many it really is all just coming out. I would think if the department of Ed Ron most likely they'll be closed, but I'm not 100, but we will definitely find out by tomorrow. Yeah. There are so many questions I was. I was overhearing a PTA meeting tonight again. My wife is an assistant principal one of the schools that did close in the in the zip codes, and I mean the PTA. I mean everyone is just it's just a struggle, for you know, updated information and to get everybody on the same page. So you know, patience is definitely a virtue for sure, but Shirley Chin has her hand raised, I'm sure yeah, surely yep sorry. I just want to add that you know some of the teachers also have like young children. So like one of our teacher who have a kindergarten and the school is close, because the school is part of the one, two one nine so now. What's she going to do she have to be in school? You know Monday to Friday, but then her son can't go to school anymore. So it's kind of hard, so yeah. It's sacrifice. It's sacrifice all around again from my personal experience, my wife stays home with our newborn, you know and is working from home and everybody has all these different situations. I think we're all doing our best to step up to the challenges that have been presented to us and there's just who could have ever guessed. We would still be here. I mean this is completely Rob said it's completely unprecedented, and it's literally day by day I mean it's literally day by day. So again you know so much thanks to the teachers administrators, you know from the custodial staff to the principal from everyone in those schools. You know trying their hardest. That's all we can do right now, and I heard that I'm sorry. I heard that the zip code might be changed to areas that are more serious than others. In other words, Cuomo is thinking of color coding, certain areas, so the thing with the zip codes might not be a final situation. Yeah I mean that your guess is as good as anyone right I mean it's like I said a day by day thing where right they're going to try to minimize the shutdowns. I would imagine they do not want to do broad shutdowns. They want to keep it to where you know there are really are the hot spots. So I mean I think that would be great if they can narrow it down more and more so that we have just like specific areas. You know, so it's not an entire zip code, maybe just portions of zip code, but right, I know who's to say you know how there's just so many factors that go into it and on all levels, from pre- k to college everyone's dealing with us so who even knows yeah. This is going to be something I'm sure this committee is going to be talking about for the next year easily. I would imagine all of our meetings will have something to do with what you know the response to Covid-19 and reopenings and closings and things all right. Well. That concludes your agenda. Anthony. I like these zoom meetings. They they start on time and then they we sail through them. So thank you, everyone, yeah! Thank you. Everybody welcome to the new members. I think it's going to be a lot of fun Rob in particular nice cnu. He and I went to the weekend yeah you and I went to pre- k together exactly so. It goes back. A long way a long way yeah you guys we did. We did yeah pre- k, high school yeah, so good, seeing enough familiar faces and new faces, and thank you so much. You know if there's no, if anyone else has anything to add they want to add before we adjourn if I have to have a motion there to end the meeting right motion to Adjourn first and check anybody. Second, thank you. Okay, great all, right guys.
