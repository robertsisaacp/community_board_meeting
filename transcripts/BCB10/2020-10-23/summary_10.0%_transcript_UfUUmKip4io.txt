Is we have a number of presentations this evening and what we decided to do, because this is our first committee meeting in a while, and the reason for that you know, is Covid-19, and yet talking about health welfare senior issues really looking around, what's been going on in our community, what people have been doing individually to help and some of our organizations?
We really wanted to hear from some people tonight to get an update of what you've all been doing and be able to share that with the community, particularly people who may be tuning in now- One of the things that we've seen or get to sense of is maybe how little we need, how much we have and the importance of human connection.
I, want to introduce first Karen Tadros Karen is president of Bay. Ridge cares a wonderful volunteer- based organization that has done tremendous work over these months So, you know, I've been following everything, you've been doing in the community.
We were really presented with a you know, a problem, because we had a lot of pop- up little pantries in the community, but that did not address the seniors.
Maybe, you know 10 people who said yes, I need a delivery of food over the next 14 weeks.
Our territory is Bay Ridge, that's where we work, but one of the things we wanted to do was in order to get the word out that we were providing this food to people.
We would take over their community room and 150 of their residents would come down and have dinner, served by beverage, cares and our volunteers and then another additional 150 meals would be delivered out to the community to people who could not afford a meals on thanksgiving or seniors who were alone because of Covid-19.
You, know people think Bay Ridge is such a rich community.
Please share with the group sure just to kind of start out to make I'm pretty sure everybody is familiar with Bay Ridge Center, but just a couple of things to talk about in relation to the things that happened is you know the, which is what I wanted to talk a little bit about what we've been doing through the pandemic, and what I want to emphasize is that, even though the centers have been closed, the staff has still been working so just like what Karen was talking about in terms of all the excellent work that Bay Ridge Cares has been doing.
Whitney hamilton, who is teaching a drawing and watercolor class for us, and she figured out a way to do two to have her laptop and then also her iphone connected to the zoom meeting, so that she could have her hand be seen in one of these little boxes so that people could actually see her hand movements as well as when she's talking, and I just thought that was extraordinarily creative and very fun and also seems to be very helpful.
There was pretty lousy, so she was actually going to different neighbors homes and working in their cellars or on their porches or other places to be able to conduct her exercise class, and so there really was a sort of a time when each of the students would begin the class.
I'll show that to you again, and we also have a number of resources and especially wonderful groups that we collaborate with just wanted to shout out to our friends at the Community board, 10, for all the things that we do, and you know making sure that it's easy for people to be able to find different organizations in the community that they can connect.
You know eagerly working on being able to grow that we have a sort of a my section here in terms of being able to create the profile, we're able to do mail back and forth to people individually and securely access.
We're really excited about making this become a real destination for people 60 and over in the Bay Ridge area, and have it be a resource for them to you know just to participate with each other and to build the community and find deeper ways of in engaging with it.
I have more friends now you know and open up meeting new people and things like that, so I'm not as isolated as I have been so it sort of opened up.
You could talk a little bit about you know and speaking about the digital divide, do you think there's any way that we can help or apply for grants that help seniors?
Do not really have those resources, but there are a few people that I'd like to join, but I do not even know how to open up a computer Maybe we can work on helping those seniors?
You know a good collaborative effort with the Bay Ridge Center, and certainly you know it's going to be challenging getting off the feet during Covid-19, but as we roll through, I think.
Do their kids come and do a lot of our events with them, but they have about 400 of their students who look to do community service, not for any other reason except to they want to help, and these are young kids who are available during the daytime that can meet up with seniors.
I did want to sort of piggyback on one thing that Marianne was saying, which is that the device is certainly a challenge for people to be able to get.
You know basic service being able to order food or to be able to communicate with people receive information.
It is a little bit of or a lot of bay ridges, but it sort of starts off with Bay Ridge Center, which is essentially the headquartering headquarters organization, and then the Satellite Office Bay Ridge Connects is actually a natural, a neighborhood naturally occurring retirement.
I think this has really pushed the use of technology ahead in ways that we will continue to use it going forward and then be able to reach more people.
It's really a very broad base need most of our clients are working going to school, doing well in the community.
You know we work well with people to make sure it's available to them.
