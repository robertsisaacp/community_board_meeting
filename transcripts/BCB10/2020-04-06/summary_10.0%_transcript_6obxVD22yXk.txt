This point we have approval from the Department of City Planning, and the application now goes to the community board and, as it makes its way down already we'll be looking at all plans to make sure everything's legal and it may be changes by them and we're here to talk about the cafe with Joseph This is the enclosed sidewalk cafe application We do have a non enclose cafe, meaning the unenclosed cafe are just seats and tables that are out on the sidewalk way to describe it.
You know the police department comes by It's a little bit of the nature or the beast of the restaurant if you have a table o'clock, seven o'clock, Saturday night, there's just a lot of cars that come Well we're trying to by increasing the attendance we're doing a better job Not only for people enabled parking also for the attendants being in the street.
Is the windows will be opening up so give me the feel of a non enclosed cafe there, especially during the nice weather, but it also has the ability Drops down to street level creates like sort of a barrier also in between the restaurant and the sidewalk, but gotta be open.
That was what made it was, what made it illegal since then, we've had this meeting and we rectified it by applying the proper way to get the outdoor cafe realizing now that we applied for the wrong permit, because we'd like to keep a year round, That issue came up before the community board.
Now, there's no outdoor well, actually, now legally we could have an outdoor cafe weather, permitting So. If the weather is permitting, you would see chairs and they'll be there were tables, they would be there within the law within the, but while you applied for it, you continued to operate it despite the fact that you advised that you should not so my question again is that since you didn't listen to us the second time, why would we believe that you're now going to operate properly?
The workers would look whatever they're doing downstairs and then they closed it down when people started sitting in the cafe, like you know, until there's a problem, yes, Joe saying there is access out of that basement through the building Besides our closed cafe, Joseph I'm, just thinking is it possible to let's say, put a door on that part of the enclosure, my floor, I'm, saying on the under on the enclosure that you have yes, so we could use it during non operating hours, but if, for some reason we just you know it becomes a situation that we have to use during operating hours.
We know that there's all sorts of development going on there potentially and initiative notes at the meeting and put together a presentation that sort of summarizes some of the ideas that we came up with and some of his own independent study of the area to give us an idea of what we may want to see there on 60th Street, so I'll leave it to initiative to go over some of his findings that he has and yes present to us , The report should have I could also post the report link in the chat here so that if anybody wants to have a look at the report, just do that right.
The streetscape currently looks dull as there are no trees and many auto repair shops fill the street with dust and dirt, there's also a mix of traffic on the road, because it is also a designated drug route and a lot of auto shops, auto repair shops and also cause mix on the street, and they all speed up after Fort Hamilton Parkway as they get a clear road as the area after the Fort Hamilton Parkway is predominantly residential other than this There was also preference for six to eight story, buildings in the area and also building form that would taper off like that would decrease in height as we go to the fotomat Hamilton Parkway Some members also light this building model in the zoning handbook.
Let us see the current zoning map first, most of the corridor, most of the corridor It doesn't permit residential uses as of right.
Earnings from sixth Avenue to forty Milton Parkway, the first option, I think which could be useful as if we zone all the Lord's before the seventh Avenue, that is, from the sixth Avenue to the seventh Avenue as m12 zoning, with a kind of insane incentive zoning that is currently proposed in North Philly imper Williamsburg, we'll talk about it in a bit and the Lords after the seventh Avenue till the Fort Hamilton Parkway could be zoned as one of the zoning types of c4 districts After that the residential areas would be kept as such The incentive.
The developers get an additional 2.5 square feet of commercial uses, so it is a way to up zone the area permit more types of uses, but also to house the light manufacturing uses and the c4 zonings are to serve a larger needs of a larger region than the local retail stores we find on, say 5th, Avenue or 4th Avenue, and the pictures here on the next page shows some building forms that are present in sorry.
The commercial overlay allows the retail for neighborhood needs and the new buildings are required to follow the housing requirements and thus start right up from the street So. The conditional zoning you see here is this one, and the height factor This could be another option for the area permitting eight to nine storey high buildings over the street.
Maybe, four maximum of four stories or five stories in this area and for a CA de state I think it's the same because a commercial fer I'll recheck for the CA district, but I guess for these two kinds of options, the maximum building height could be four to five stories.
So there are two reasons for that: If I am NOT, I guess it also comes under the beer if districts, which limits the height and second thing, is most of the buildings which are like low-rise I, checked on the zoning and land use map.
