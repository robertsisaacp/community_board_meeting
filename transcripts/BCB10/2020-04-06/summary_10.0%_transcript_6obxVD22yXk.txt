This point we have approval from the Department of City Planning, and the application now goes to the Community Board and, as it makes its way down.
They're open to the sky in closed, cafe, I sense, some type of rendering of what doing and the enclosed cafe is actually a built structure with a roof on it.
If I could just jump in for a second nice to see some of you again, we've been I , think I've been to community board , We did have a meeting regarding Positano and the outdoor enclosure, which was a while That we had was that we did not close that with bad weather, or has it got colder, and we realized that we did not for the right permit at that.
Drops down to street level, creates like sort of a barrier also in between the restaurant and the sidewalk, but got ta be open.
The outdoor cafe was up that night and it was down by Monday That I do recall that there's no use for that, but this two times I do not know the second time.
We have not had any issues regarding anything you know with the community board, so I would use that as the barometer of my credibility as opposed to what my partner has done as the managing member previous to me, we obviously have our differences.
Are there, any issues with that with buildings or other departments, key cell doors, for where we get deliveries in yes, so they're going to be finding a new way to come up and down in the inside?
When people started sitting in the cafe until there's a problem, yes, Joe saying there is access out of that basement through the building.
First, even though the practicality of having a table on top in the cellar, door, I, do not even think it's possible and supported during hours of operation, but okay, I would just go there to get rid of that.
We are the first thanks mark right coming to the end of his fellowship here, a community board- You, know, sort of vision for the 65Th Street corridor.
We know that there's all sorts of development going on there potentially and initiative notes at the meeting and put together a presentation that sort of summarizes some of the ideas that we came up with and some of his own independent study of the area.
The first option, I think which could be useful as if we zone all the Lord's before the Seventh Avenue, that is, from the sixth Avenue to the Seventh Avenue as m12 zoning, with a kind of insane incentive zoning that is currently proposed in North Philly imper Williamsburg, we'll talk about it in a bit and the Lords after the Seventh Avenue till the Fort Hamilton Parkway could be zoned as one of the zoning types of C4 districts.
The developers get an additional 2.5 square feet of commercial uses, so it is a way to up zone the area permit more types of uses, but also to house the light manufacturing uses and the c4 zonings are to serve a larger needs of a larger region than the local retail stores we find on Say, 5th, Avenue or 4Th Avenue, and Pictures here show some building forms that could be generated using a c4 zoning, for example.
Storey, high condominium building at 60Th, Street and Ninth Avenue, twelve storey height is actually I, guess determine also by the building's location in a transit zone which decreases the required amount of parking for it.
The commercial overlay allows the retail for neighborhood needs and the new buildings are required to follow the housing requirements and thus start right up from the street.
This could be another option for the area permitting eight to nine storey high buildings over the street.
The third option could be if we keep the area as it is, that is, to keep the area zone for uses which are currently present on the street.
It is different from the current zoning Is that when one type of zoning allows for a commercial fer of 2.4, if we choose a higher suffix earning, such as it C, 8:3 or C 8 for higher density, community facilities could also be located in the area.
The second used are 6 or r6p districts that is allowing for only residential uses with commercial uses along the major avenues, and the third was using a CA district to preserve what is currently not to preserve but to house similar kinds of uses in the future similar to the uses which are currently present in the area, but also to allow for higher Fer community facilities.
I had some suggestions for sweet scaping, but because the zoning changes also require a kind of street treatment from the new buildings.
Maybe, four maximum of four stories or five stories in this area and for a CA de state I think it's the same because a commercial fer I'll recheck for the CA district, but I guess for these two kinds of options, the maximum building height could be four to five stories.
A maximum of eight stories can be permitted on the block, and if it is a non conditional zoning, then the Builder can use the height factor or the tower kind of development, but that is generally not encouraged because they also get a higher fer, make a more fer if they align their building.
: You talked about after the zoning, the new kind of zoning I'd be in the corridor and it would I think it was the ca3 c84 There are a couple of initial shops and all the uses are I guess either restaurants or the three guys from Brooklyn store.
I will recheck once like what are the height limitations for this type of zoning and how high can buildings go?
