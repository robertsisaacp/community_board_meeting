This point we have approval from the Department of City Planning, and the application now goes to the community board and, as it makes its way down.
The outdoor cafe was up that night and it was down by Monday That I do recall that there's no use for that, but this two times I, don't know the second time.
But you know once he puts the canvas around it technically, he would be operating him in closed cafe, so he was breaking the law at that time.
Okay, I just wanted to say that I think the despite the fact that I'm a little bit concerned about the past I'm likely to vote for this, but I am concerned about the latter has to be passed through the department that ladder is crucial to the people who live above mr.
When people started sitting in the cafe, like you know, until there's a problem, yes, Joe saying there is access out of that basement through the building.
Just thinking is it possible to let's say, put a door on that part of the enclosure, my floor, I'm, saying on the under on the enclosure that you have yes, so we could use it during non operating hours, but if.
Coming to the end of his fellowship here, a community board- We've been talking about you, know, sort of vision for the 65th Street corridor.
We know that there's all sorts of development going on there potentially and initiative notes at the meeting and put together a presentation that sort of summarizes some of the ideas that we came up with and some of his own independent study of the area.
This is a mixed-use building type, with a base as commercial type of uses and condos or apartment buildings at the top set back from the road, so that you don't see a major mass of the building right from the sidewalk, so You from these building forms and streetscape I've tried to select some zoning types which we can see if they suit what we are envisioning for the street.
The first option, I think which could be useful as if we zone all the Lord's before the seventh Avenue, that is, from the sixth Avenue to the seventh Avenue as m12 zoning, with a kind of insane incentive zoning that is currently proposed in North Philly imper Williamsburg, we'll talk about it in a bit and the Lords after the seventh Avenue till the Fort Hamilton Parkway could be zoned as one of the zoning types of c4 districts.
The developers get an additional 2.5 square feet of commercial uses, so it is a way to up zone the area permit more types of uses, but also to house the light manufacturing uses and the c4 zonings are to serve a larger needs of a larger region than the local retail stores.
It requires a set back from the street, and if it is a contextual zoning, it also requires a setback after the seat wall height, if it is a mixed-use building, the residential portion is treated differently than the commercial portion, and it would result in a building form that we discussed that day.
The commercial overlay allows the retail for neighborhood needs and the new buildings are required to follow the housing requirements and thus start right up from the street.
This could be another option for the area permitting eight to nine storey high buildings over the street.
The third option could be if we keep the area as it is, that is, to keep the area zone for uses which are currently present on the street.
It is different from the current zoning Is that when one type of zoning allows for a commercial fer of 2.4, if we choose a higher suffix earning, such as it c, 8, 3 or C 8 for higher density, community facilities could also be located in the area.
If you can see here in the table, the CH, 3 and c84 have a higher commercial fer of 2 & 5, and also a higher community facility affair, which would allow for uses such as schools or other kind of committed community facilities to be housed in the area.
The second used are 6 or r6p districts that is allowing for only residential uses with commercial uses along the major avenues, and the third was using a CA district to preserve what is currently not to preserve but to house similar kinds of uses in the future similar to the uses which are currently present in the area, but also to allow for higher fer community facilities.
Maybe, four maximum of four stories or five stories in this area and for a CA de state I think it's the same because a commercial fer I'll recheck for the CA district, but I guess for these two kinds of options, the maximum building height could be four to five stories.
So, with both those options, a maximum of eight stories, can be permitted on the block, and if it is a non conditional zoning, then the Builder can use the height factor or the tower kind of development, but that is generally not encouraged because they also get a higher fer, make a more fer if they align their building.
: If I am NOT I guess it also comes under the beer, if districts, which limits the height and second thing, is most of the buildings which are like low-rise I, checked on the zoning and land use.
I will recheck once like what are the height limitations for this type of zoning and how high can buildings go?
