This is an application to the board of standard appeals for a special permit under section 73-44 of the zoning resolution, and a special permit is seeking to permit the reduction of required accessory parking spaces for a proposed new building with uses and parking requirement.
So you know, category b1 is generally office, uses all right, so this site is located at the corner of the intersection of fifth avenue and 92nd street.
But one of the key questions that first came up was: would it be possible to relocate any of the floor area on the first floor up to the third floor, because the third floor is a partial story : , it's only 4 500 49 59 square feet, as opposed to the larger second and first floor, and the thought was that if you could relocate some of that area to the upper floor, that could provide more parking or more space down at the ground.
You know the drop-off and perhaps patients coming to the medical uses that would be located on the upper story, and so we went back We had a long talk with the architect and the property owners about the idea about these six accessories bases and as an alternative, could we remove one or some or all of them in order to provide a turnaround or a loading and unloading area.
Is that especially, you know with the current BSA, we tend to try and not do too much design before we have the first hearing, because often we'll do the redesigning So I would just say to your board that if that's something that you feel is a better idea removing against some or all those parking spots and coming up with a unloading or unloading area If you do issue a recommendation on this, application.
There still are no specific tenants set for the building, because it's still early in the process, but I would want to reconfirm that the seller and the first floor, which would be commercial office space, should this be granted by the BSA.
That's one of the conditions of the grant, so I just wanted to put that out there again and to reassure that this would not be a bait-and-switch situation, especially for this type of application, because the specific grant requires that the co list this and list the conditions that it cannot be changed and then the other question that came up is there was a question about the open area and the access to the site just to confirm.
If well maybe we could shift it that way and have access from fifth avenue instead of 92nd street, that doesn't end up working both because of the desire to maintain the open space, then area, but also importantly, because the zoning district, the commercial overlay, only extends the.
And I live very close in the area, I'm concerned that you feel you cannot relocate the access to the property to fifth avenue, because access at 92nd street at many times a day will be very problematic other than that Any questions from the rest of the committee come on guys, you're, never that quiet [Laughter], because I talked too long.
I said that the design of this special permit- A variance is a more involved application where you have to meet specific findings and if a variance is granted by the BSA they're.
It did provide an option for a little bit of a turnaround and it might be possible to be honest since we don't use these parking spaces right.
The recommendation will be presented to the full board on at monday's meeting and that's to approve the BSA application, as presented with the following recommendations: to have the redesigned turnaround area for the vehicle.
He could talk a little bit about putting together a handout for zoning and land use committee meetings and board members both present and in the future kind of like a zoning for dummies or zoning 101.
Is it required for a public school like what are the requirements for like citing a public school in the community district, and things like that So and then general questions which get asked in the community board meetings or in the public hearings and so, for example, for a sidewalk, cafe.
It is a very detailed application, so it's going to require a lot of reading Will be working with department of city planning to get someone advice, because this will be our first virtual euler review.
We talked about zoning in land use committee, but it really is just a change in the design of the way some street poles will have antenna affixed to it.
So be on the lookout and as zoning and land use committee members , I know you have a lot to say about design and streetscape.
