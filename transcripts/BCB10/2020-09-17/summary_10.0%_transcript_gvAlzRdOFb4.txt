This is an application to the board of standard appeals for a special permit under section 73- 44 of the zoning resolution, and a special permit is seeking to permit the reduction of required accessory parking spaces for a proposed new building with uses and parking requirement.
The actual required parking accessory parking should the special permit be granted would be zero parking spaces but, as I said.
But one of the key questions that first came up was: Would it be possible to relocate any of the floor area on the first floor up to the third floor, Because the third floor is a partial story, it's only 4,500 49:59 square feet as opposed to the larger second and first floor, and the thought was that if you could relocate some of that area to the upper floor, that could provide more parking or more space down at the ground.
Is that especially, you know with the current BSA, we tend to try and not do too much design before we have the first hearing, because often we'll do the redesigning So I would just say to your board that if that's something that you feel is a better idea removing against some or all those parking spots and coming up with a unloading or unloading area They would recommend that in any communication you send to the BSA.
There still are no specific tenants set for the building, because it's still early in the process, but I would want to reconfirm that the seller and the first floor, which would be commercial office space, should this be granted by the BSA.
That does not end up working both because of the desire to maintain the open space, then area, but also importantly, because the zoning district, the commercial overlay, only extends the.
The chair, And I live very close in the area, I'm concerned that you feel you can not relocate the access to the property to Fifth avenue, because access at 92nd street at many times a day will be very problematic other than that Any questions from the rest of the committee come on guys, you're.
Floor area ratio got it way, we're going to get you an acronym, book, and Yes and after this meeting we're going to speak to one of our fellows who's working on that They have an online zoning resolution and the last time I checked.
Recently we've had situations where we revise plans right before BSA hearing Then we get to the BSA hearing, and you know the chairwoman of the commissioners are like That's why I wanted us to confirm that we're very open to looking at it, but just from a practical and operational standpoint.
What that likely was me saying that the Department of City planning or the city council, when they installed or put this into the zoning resolution, there was an understanding that these b1 parking category uses which are office uses, have less stringent parking demand than other uses.
I mean unless it's April, And, perhaps I did not was not clear when I said it last time, but the understanding is that this special permit is designed to reflect the understanding that city planning and City Council recognize that, even though these are all use.
It did provide an option for a little bit of a turnaround and it might be possible to be honest since we do not use these parking spaces right.
Think that you know the BSA does like to hear from the board and perhaps putting our thoughts and concerns down in the form of emotion.
The recommendation will be presented to the full board on at Monday's meeting and that's to approve the BSA application, as presented with the following recommendations: to have the redesigned turnaround area for the vehicle.
He has been working with us, this summer, which was so happy to have him He could talk a little bit about putting together a handout for zoning and land Use committee meetings and board members both present and in the future kind of like a zoning for dummies or zoning 101.
Unless you could talk a little bit about what you've been working on for us, So, so, Sophina and Michael had a great idea about like creating a informational handout containing, like general terms, which the committee refers to while reviewing applications or like the common type of applications.
Is it required for a public school like what are the requirements for like citing a public school in the community district, and things like that So and then general questions which get asked in the Community board meetings or in the public hearings and so, for example, for a sidewalk, cafe.
So things like this, like general questions, which get asked about all these applications, and then there will also be a section on like what terms, for example, what is BSA?
We talked about zoning in land Use committee, but it really is just a change in the design of the way some street poles will have antenna affixed to it.
