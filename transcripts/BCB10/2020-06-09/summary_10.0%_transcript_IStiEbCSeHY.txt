Okay, thank you all for joining us tonight, zoning committee reading forum to discuss BSA application for 437 88th street to allow a physical culture establishment gym at the site, which is not permitted under the zoning, and we will have a presentation through quick presentation of the issues that you send us in the application.
The majority of the site is in a CD, 2 zoning district, a that's a hundred feet.
They could convert this name joining passive rain commercial space, which would be in this case, and the seller level, like retail storage or office, or something as loud They would need them to go back to the BSA and file for an amendment.
Should this special permit be granted by the BSA as they do set forth or requirement.
