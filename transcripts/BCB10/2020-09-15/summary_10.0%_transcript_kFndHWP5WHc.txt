I can go into a bit more detail for what we do know of in terms of what our budget outlook looks like for the next year, but I think.
So, meaning they have a design, that's been completed and it's been either bid out, or you know, kind of waiting for a contractor to give some prices for the city to put it into construction.
The agency has been working over the last few months to figure out how scope meetings will work moving forward as of right now, So we'll be reaching out as soon as tomorrow morning to the board and elected officials with some possible dates for a scope meeting for this park and some others so very exciting shore road park, the field house building, is under construction.
So this is another one again that will be reaching out for a scope meeting very shortly and then design will start howl's head park, the basketball court So just adjacent to the playground, also funded by the council member again, we'll we're hoping to start design this fall.
I wish I had a better answer for you, but we don't really know we're kind of waiting for more direction from city hall, but once we get notification, I think we can definitely reach out to community board 10 and let you guys know that there's also another resource called the capital tracker, which I don't know.
That, has kind of a tracker bar for how far along the project is I think that project will maybe do some of it between the vinlin project, that project and the short and the field house You know it might seem like a kind of a trivial path, but it actually does sort which is on the kitchen table little black purse.
This is my first time on the community board, and this is my first meeting If I like ask questions that you know, you guys are already familiar with, but being on this committee.
Then new york city parks comes back to the community board and the parks committee will look at those design.
Like you know, it's like community campaigning for elected officials So far by funding things- The state senator, has also been really helpful in his district for funding parks, things, which is unusual for state legislature, actually funded because most of our money comes from either council members, the borough president or the mayor, and so they will fund projects based on you know, kind of the support they're getting in the community.
So, and how do we prioritize the work or the you know, Like who gets to you know, have that renovation first over the over another project, all right who makes a decision.
As far as prioritization you know, every project is slated to start within the fiscal year that it's funded.
When we do the scope meeting, we are looking for just you know, we're not actually doing the design, we're not laying out the spray shower and where the screens are And, we let the designer go to work And Then and then we'll schedule at a parks committee meeting a review of the schematic, design.
2020 fall 2020, so looking forward to more, I think that the the parks committee is going to be very busy.
That's going to be a low priority, whereas if you have a tree, that's kind of cracked and is falling over a car or a house or a You know a place where people could walk by, or you know like a school or whatever.
So it just it just shows the you know the impact really of the of the storm and the same thing for that category fallen, tree, year-to-date is 452, but just on august 4th and 5th there were 266.
I. Think that you know we're moving into our budget time, where the board will advocate for expense and capital.
Think a lot of people in bay ridge are shocked to hear just how much tree cover we have, and that actually is one of my other questions, which is how does bay ridge compare to like Brooklyn as a whole, or maybe other neighborhoods?
Did, we take up a lot of time for the parks to like come out here, because we have so much tree cover just some context for some of the numbers.
I think that's important for us as a board to know, because you know anecdotally, people come in and tell us all the time the trees aren't being pruned enough and often enough And, it's funding, But I think it's something that we should delve into a little bit more as a committee in terms of our advocacy for funding for parks.
Fiscal years with you know where we are financially, but it might not seem like a lot, but it's what the industry typically does to look at trees, right, and I.
