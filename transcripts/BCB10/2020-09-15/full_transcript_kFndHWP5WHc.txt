Okay, here we are all right. All right streaming live excellent. Let me know when you want me to start yep and I can confirm we are live. Thank you excellent. Thank you so diane already, I guess we could start with parks Chris. I think you could start. Can you share your screen or do you have a presentation? I do good evening. Everyone, I'm christy Andoly, I'm the director of capital projects for the Brooklyn borough office of parks joined well. This was already mentioned, but joined by chief of staff, davey ives and our park manager, lauren Sylvester I'll, run through a capital status report for the district davey. If I got anything wrong or you need to jump in, please do never been live on youtube before so I'm going to give it a shot. So I'm going to try sharing my screen now. Let me know if you can see it. Let's see. Did that work. Yes, okay, looks good yeah, I'm viewing a pdf, so it's going to be. This is probably the best they can yeah. Let's see all right. So let me let me know if everyone can see it as we go through so like I said, the capital status report for Community, Board, 10., we'll just run through it and if there's any questions, maybe we'll take them at the end. So the first up is a is our completed project. This is Fort Hamilton Athletic field. We worked with the school construction authority on this one. The project was managed by the school construction Authority and it was a synthetic turf field, reconstruction that was completed in August of 2019.. This is on the same property. This is the Fort Hamilton Field basketball court. So this is a terrible site currently and will be beautiful when it's when it's completed. This project is one of a few that we have that's actually sort of stuck in procurement, we're having trouble with the Office of Management and budget getting these projects through due to some Covid-19 related delays. As far as budget goes, I do not davey, I do not know if there's any other thing you want to mention on that, but as I go through there's a few, unfortunately that fall into that category, so we're not sure the the future status of this project, but as of right now it's in the procurement phase and we're not sure when it will be approved to begin yeah. This is davey. I can go into a bit more detail for what we do know of in terms of what our budget outlook looks like for the next year, but I think maybe we can go through this presentation and kind of circle back with questions at the end, but with all projects that are in the procurement phase, so meaning they have a design, that's been completed and it's been either bid out, or you know, kind of waiting for a contractor to give some prices for the city to put it into construction. Those projects have been put on hold so they're, currently in a waiting period. So that means that they're slightly delayed. Thank you so moving along this is really exciting. Council member Brandon funded this project. This will complete the site at Fort Hamilton, so this is Russell Pedersen Playground, we're excited about this one and in the future, we'll shortly we'll have a scope meeting for this one John J Carty Park. This is a project, that's under construction. Currently, it's a renovation of the tennis courts on site right near the senior center. This one is delayed a bit due to some of the bridge construction and it was also put on hold because of the Covid-19 shutdown. So it has restarted it's back on track and we're hoping to have it completed by this fall, and this is also exciting, funded by councilmember browning renovation of the playground at John Jay Cardi Park. So the agency has been working over the last few months to figure out how scope meetings will work moving forward as of right now, I think we've settled on virtual scope meetings similar to the meeting we're having right now. So that's really exciting that we're going to actually be able to get going with some of these projects so we'll be reaching out as soon as tomorrow morning to the board and elected officials with some possible dates for a scope meeting for this park and some others so very exciting shore road park, the field House building is under construction. It's moving along again was shut down a bit for Covid-19 delays, but has restarted and we're hoping to have it finished this fall. This is a another site in shore road. It's the brand new dog run. So this is sort of near, I guess, what's called cannonball park down the hill a bit near that bus, Stop, comfort, station combination, this one is indesign and we're hoping construction will start in fall of 2021. another project in shore road park. This is sort of a pathway, connections, project, sort of increasing accessibility and making connections throughout the park. So this one is also in design this exciting project. For us, finland, Playground in shore road park is another one where we'll be reaching out this week or next week, with some possible dates for a scope meeting for this park, so designed to start shortly. Dyker beach, we're what we call our state of good repair program, this one's being repaved and renovated through our city- wide services, it's a sort of internal branch of the parks Department. This is another one where we're hoping the project will start construction in spring of 21, but depending on the current climate, we'll we're going to hope for that. For that start date, Patrick O'rourke is another one that we're doing under state of good repair and davey. I'm not sure. I think this one might be our green infrastructure team as well. So some of some of these were we're partnering with DEP to do some water retention on site and some other sort of environmentally sustainable design. So this is one of those sites. This one is also indesign owls head park. We have a few projects going on. There too, which is great, also funded by councilmember. Brandon is a reconstruction of the playground, so this is another one again that will be reaching out for a scope meeting very shortly and then design will start Howl's head park, the basketball court so just adjacent to the playground, also funded by the council member again, we'll we're hoping to start design this fall. So that means a public scope meeting this fall and these two projects could be merged in the same contract. It might just be an easier thing for us to do. Sometimes it's like buying in bulk. You know, so you get a better price on contractors, so we're going to figure that out, but you know I think, as far as the public will see, there will definitely be work happening right here in the next couple of years. Thank you and, lastly, the short Parkway bike path. So recently, I'm sure a lot of you noticed we did some top course asphalt coding to sort of address some immediate safety concerns on a stretch of the bike path. This project is separate from that. So this is more of a resiliency engineering, reconstruction of the sea wall and the bike path and sort of long term strategic plan for the bike path. So we're doing our design investigations right now and we're hoping to finish design fall of 21.. With that, I think that's the last project. I do not know if you had any questions from the board. I have a question: when will we be notified when some of these projects that are on hold will be moving forward? Is I mean? Is there a date that or is it just an ongoing hold on everything because of the budget consent? Yeah? Maybe I do not know yeah. I can do my best at answering that one we're right now we're not we're not really sure. I wish I had a better answer for you, but we do not really know we're kind of waiting for more direction from city Hall, but once we get notification, I think we can definitely reach out to Community board 10 and let you guys know that there's also another resource called the capital tracker, which I do not know. If anyone on the board is familiar with, but it's a it's part of the park's website and for every single park's capital construction project, there's its own web page- that has kind of a tracker bar for how far along the project is so that and then in addition to that, it gives you an estimated date for when construction would start on that park. Thank you, yeah. It's really! It's really easy to use. I can. I can share the link to it too, in the chat. Okay. Henry has his hand raised. I just wanted to ask about one of the projects you mentioned on shore road. You said it was a like a paving connection right. I think that's just something we have not heard about here before and I just was not clear on what exactly it was yeah there's some. There were some historic pathways that have been sort of covered over the years sort of right from the stretch it sort of goes from that new. What will be the new dog run almost stretching all the way past the newly renovated field house to almost a finland playground. So it's sort of behind that baseball field along the belt, parkway and it'll just be sort of uncovering some of the historic pathways because right now it's back there. It's just you know piles of wood chips, it's not accessible. The drainage is not great, so just making that sort of an accessible pathway, it could be a walking or a bike path, but I'm connecting you know, pedestrians to the to the comfort station at the field house and to other amenities, and I think another thing that you know anytime. We do that we'll look at the underground utilities there. I think that project will maybe do some of it between the vinlin project, that project and the short and the field house we're hoping to address some plumbing issues. So all that plumbing is really ancient from like the 30s or 40s. So that's another reason. You know it might seem like a kind of a trivial path, but it actually does sort which is on the kitchen table little black purse. Oh right, I have a question. This is way Leo. This is my first time on the Community board, and this is my first meeting so pardon if I like ask questions that you know you guys are already familiar with, but being on this committee. Is there a program that we that the either architect or the landscape, architect or design firm, requires from the Community Board and do we provide any input or do they take any input? And then are we allowed to kind of you know review any conceptual designs of these parks? How does that whole process work? I checked the whole thing, so I do not. Let me just make sure I mute everyone because I'm getting a little background. Noise hold on one second way and I'll answer your question. You know if your keyboard runs out, if it's plugged in it'll still work. Okay, so can everyone hear me very good? Okay, so basically the the Community Board and the Parks Committee we do review all of the capital projects. There's an opportunity both at the scoping period of time, which is before the project is led, and you know davey. Maybe you could. You know explain it a little bit better than I do. We invite the community, the elected official, the parks Department. We do broad advertising to invite people to put ideas about what they would like to see in the park at a scoping meeting and it's usually either held on site. I mean we've done it different ways: we've held it here and people we invite from the community activists or community residents who live near the park or who utilize the park will come and submit ideas and suggestions, and then parks takes that back to their design people and they kind of look at the budget and they see what's feasible and they come up with a design. Then New, York, City parks comes back to the Community Board and the Parks Committee will look at those design plans. We also invite the community to to comment tweak. It have suggestions, say we hate, it say we love it and then we, the parks chair, will present that to the full board for an advisory letter to the Parks department about how we feel about the design. Is that helpful hope you are mute? I have you on mute. Can you want to unmute yourself? Okay, I mean I come from a design background. I studied interior design and I was director for like 20-plus years at various fashion, luxury brands. So I know the whole like. I understand the whole process from a fashion point of view. This is my first time on like a parks Committee. So, but I have you know friends who do this for a living, so I was just curious to see like because I understand you know. I know from experience that design. You know, there's always like multiple meetings like there's a lot of back and forth. So I just wanted to you know to see if we and how involved are we in the whole design approval process and who actually selects, like the design? Architects, you know is that out of our control like what that's what yes, what is in our control versus what's out of our control right, so scoping is within our purview, meaning you know putting together. Community review of you know, input the input state and then once it's designed but I'll hand it Parks Department is the agency that handles the procurement, and that includes the the rfps and the contracting, and that includes who is hired to do the design. Is that right davey. They say that right, yeah that you hit everything so far. I think so way. Leo. Thank you for your question. Yeah. I think just earlier in the process. It's important to understand that you know we do not parks department does not have a set capital budget, so it's not like we get to say you know we're going to do vinland, playground first and then we're going to go to shore parkway and finish that and then we're going to go to Jj Carty once we're done with that. So all this money that we get for capital projects is through kind of almost it's like community campaigning for elected officials. So you know, Justin Brannon has been really great to us so far by funding things, and he was great before with councilmember gentilly as well. The state senator has also been really helpful in his district for funding parks, things which is unusual for state legislature actually funded, because most of our money comes from either council members, the borough president or the mayor, and so they will fund projects based on you know kind of the support they're getting in the community. So once it kind of is solidified in our budget, then we start that design process with the scope meeting and then the design review once we once we take a first pass at it. So that's the start of it as far as who actually does the designing we actually have. I think if we were, if the parks Department were a landscape architecture firm, we would be the largest landscape architecture firm under one roof. I think we have a 100, I think 100 or 150 registered landscape architects that work for the parks, Department so they're, obviously all acrosss the city. But it's a it's, a pretty amazing shop that they run out there that they do a ton of work every year. So when we can, we try to do in- house work and do it through them. They've been you know, we've been doing so much that they do contract out designs for that there's a whole process that landscape architecture firms can get registered through vendex and kind of get in our system so that they can be in kind of a rotation for projects that kept bid out. I think there's like a short list of people that these go to yeah. Did you have a question? There's probably like a preferred list of you know of design architects that are allowed. I think I think that's pretty common with city work too. You know so it's so it's not only landscape architecture, it's architects! It's engineers and kind of every kind of flavor of engineering. You know whether it's geotechnical or structural or coastal, so there's a lot of different stuff that we do yeah so and how do we prioritize the work or the you know like who gets to you know, have that renovation first over the over another project, all right who makes a decision it's based on. You know what gets funded in that fiscal year. I think this fiscal year we had 30 new projects in Brooklyn, so I think we were looking. I think we have. I do not know what the amount is, but you know at any given time in Brooklyn we have of funded and started projects. We have about 90 projects, so that's and it roughly breaks down a third, a third or third. So third of those projects are in design. The third are going through the process to get a contractor on board and then the third are in the process of actually being built. So when it comes to prioritizing which one starts first, it's basically we we've tried this year aside because of Covid-19. We aim to start every single project that gets funded within the fiscal year. This was something that I think when the De Blasio administration came into office and when I think our the Park Commissioner Mitchell silver was. This is one of the changes that mitchell silver put in place, along with the website that I just shared on the capital tracker, so there's so these are kind of some of the changes have been implemented over the years. So as far as prioritization you know, every project is slated to start within the fiscal year that it's funded. So it's I think that makes sense. If you have more questions we could yeah. It makes sense. I mean that's how it is in the fashion world too, like yeah, you know, there's always that meeting and that the capital funds are provided to. You know the most urgent project, so yeah, and I think one other important thing to note is that you know so when we do the scope meeting we are looking for just you know we're looking for as much input as possible, we're not actually doing the design, we're not laying out the spray shower and where the screens are and we let the designer go to work and then and then we'll schedule at a Parks Committee meeting a review of the schematic design. So you know just a for those other non less designy people, that's just kind of a map of where things are going to be laid out. So you know designer has to make sure the spacing is right to accommodate for tree roots or for fall zones for play, equipment and all this other technical stuff, and you know where the water utilities will go and how to do that in the most cost effective way. Once that's done, then they go into contract drawings where they, actually, you know, determine how many screws, how many swings? How many you know how many linear feet of fence are all going all the details under the sun are going to be in that contract and then that is finalized into a book that actually gets put out and goes to bid. So it's a it's cool. That's why it takes. It basically takes three years start to finish from the design. Thank you. That was probably a lot more information than anyone might maybe want to know. But you know, if you have any questions about it, we're happy to answer it too. Hey. Thank you. Anyone else have questions. I feel like we're going to have a lot of things coming up this fall, so I think it seems like almost all of those were scoping for this coming. 2020 fall 2020, so looking forward to more yeah, I think that the the Parks Committee is going to be very busy. So in terms of scoping I mean I just want to share. I guess you know with the parks team is that we have had success in reaching out. You know to hold public, you know, hearings and meetings, so I guess we'll you know figure out a way to do it. Remotely we've been able to you know, do mailings to certain areas and provide the you know the virtual link, so we could get feedback or you know our email newsletter list is brought in. So I think we've really begun to adapt to the virtual world and doing public meetings. So we look forward to working with you as we move closer to those very exciting projects. Thank you. We're definitely going to need the help, because this is there's no playbook for this kind of stuff we're just these are going to be the first round of sort of the virtual scope meeting, so great we'll figure it out together, and so I assume that we'll be getting a copy of this powerpoint as well. I can send it in the morning sure great. Thank you Chris. Thank you. There be no other questions. I guess we'll move on to our next item on the agenda, which is a review of the tropical storm Isaiah's response by the Park Department. It did quite a number in our community as in many communities and so we're all ears great. Thank you. I can take that on just a heads up. I think my headphones might be dying, so I will be able to talk through my computer so, but if there might be a temporary lapse, so just let me know if you can't hear me so yeah, so thank you yeah so storm is was a big one. You know it. I think this storm in terms of tree request was second to only sandy. So if you can so, although it might not have caused that much damage in New York, it was actually quite bad in the tree world. So to speak, but basically you know so I think I can. I can read our numbers. Read our numbers off, you know so the way we look at it is we look at service requests, so that's anytime, you call into 311 which we encourage people to do, because that creates a record of of what of that there's an issue. So when you call into 311 that creates a record and then it makes the Parks Department Respond to that which is kind of the only way we can guarantee that your tree will get addressed. You might not agree with the assessment from our arborists, but they are trained arborists and they do this professionally, but that, but by putting in a service request, they will come out and visit your tree. So, as far as service requests for that one little storm, we got 6,000 tree requests in Brooklyn so of those 6,000 requests. So some of these might be duplicates, but some of those 6,000 requests 529 were just in community board 10.. So that's a lot of that's a lot of trees down for for the neighborhood, I think so we break it down by hanging limbs. So that might be a limb that fell, but it's kind of still dangling over. We go by limbs that have fallen to the ground, so they might be blocking something and then actual trees falling down. So in community board 10 we had 45 hanging limbs, 205 limbs fall falling down and then 279 trees that were all reported in and then the next thing I'll go through is just our process for are how we prioritize things. So in our in our forestry world, we've switched from kind of the person who calls in the most guest their true service to a actual system called risk management where we try to prioritize the most dangerous tree situations first, so you know if a tree falls in a field and nobody's you know in danger of getting hit by it, that's going to be a low priority, whereas if you have a tree, that's kind of cracked and is falling over a car or a house or a you know a place where people could walk by or you know like a school or whatever. It is, then that's a higher risk priority. So during the storm, the wave or in the aftermath of the storm, with all those requests we went through and looked at the first thing, with trees that are blocking streets for emergency access, so that took us about a week to go through once we once we addressed trees in the street for access and vehicular. You know so that other emergency services could serve their role. Then we looked at trees that had fallen on houses or structures or cars or any of those things. That was the next thing that took another week to address so burrow wide and then and then the third thing was, you know, kind of everywhere else, so that was in parks in kind of non- critical areas and trees that had kind of fallen in a in a relatively safe area now and that took the third week. So after those three weeks went by, we actually ended up. We ended up. You know what you probably saw, and you probably got three requests for were piles of debris on the street. This response yeah. I think we were talking to our chief of operations and he said he'd, never seen such a big response to storms. We called in crews from as far as I think, Buffalo to help us respond to this storm because we had so many requests those trees so between contracting forces and parks. Department. The priority is to get the tree down to chop it up and to put it in a safe place, so that you know the rest of the city can keep operating the remaining time after the storm was going back and having trees cleaned up in throughout the neighborhood. I know that, like in marine park, for example, we had the parking lots in marine park if you've been down. There have been filled with tree debris, because it's all the contractors brought their trees there and then they're also contracted to take it out and put it elsewhere. So there's so there's it's a complicated process is what I'm trying to say here, and there is a method to the madness. Although it does, it might seem that your tree is kind of precariously out there and just kind of not being addressed so maybe I'll close with the work orders that actually happened so those service quests that turned into work orders where people had to actually do something. So in Brooklyn there were 2791, so almost half nearly half of the tree requests were actually required. Our foresters or contracted forces to do something in Community board 10 that was 201 work, orders that included 41 hanging limbs, which and the hanging limbs can be. You know, forced or actually scaling up the tree and cutting things down limbs down on the ground that was 120 trees that were down there were 32 downed trees, so you can imagine blocking streets and kind of the chaos that I'm sure all you guys know about, and then we actually had to remove eight trees during this process. So it was quite quite quite an involved. Response was needed to the storm and I- and I think you know our foreshoe crews were working overtime around the clock to get this done. So it's an imp, impressive effort that those guys were able to accomplish it, and I think with that I I'd open it up to questions if anyone has any. I have a question sure so I pulled the 311 data and I know it's always a tricky thing when you use open data, but I had pulled August 4th and August 5th, which I would say were the two biggest 311 reporting days and there were 266,311 complaints that were made in the category of fallen tree. So are you saying that in total we had about 40 downed trees? I realized a lot of duplicates. I did not, you know, go through each and every one of them total of 40 trees so down. So I think it's important. I do not know if open data how it separates the different categories down versus limbs versus yeah, I'm not sure if it breaks it down. I think that might be maybe an internal thing for parks, so it's fallen tree and then there's a separate category tree branch, cracked, slash down yes, so fallen tree is pretty close. I mean for fallen tree. There were 32 fallen. Trees that are our forces were ended up, kicking away. So that's pretty close to the did. You use it. I do not know why that was. The number was large, it was two hundred two sixty six, so I mean I'm sure there were multiples and then some people pull in different addresses for the same tree and yeah. I was just trying to get a sense from that number yeah. How many trees did we actually lose in 410? It seemed like a lot more than 40 yeah on the ground, because we had so much damage, but I think 120,40 is a lot, but I think 120 limbs down is also important to think about, because you can think about a huge. You know 57 year old tree, that limb is going to be big much bigger than your average. You know newly planted street tree or even a smaller species tree so that I think people could be calling that in as a fallen tree, even though it's you know, one of our co- workers had a tree. Had a limb fall through her windshield and crack it. You know and damage her car, so it might sound like it's just a teeny, tiny limb, but they can actually be quite big, and I think people calling that in could call it could justifiably say it's a downed tree right well in the category of tree Branch, Craft year- to- date, we have 890,311 service requests in board 10 compared to 2019 of the whole year 588., so it just it just shows the you know the impact really of the of the storm and the same thing for that category fallen tree year- to- date is 452, but just on August 4th and 5th, there were 266. So looking at it as a board. I think that you know we're moving into our budget time where the board will advocate for expense and capital priorities, and certainly forestry has always been an expense priority for us, but I think this year in our district needs statement we're going to delve a little bit more because of the impact of the storm and even moving forward. You know many of the board members and members of this committee have talked about. You know funding and we're in a covered world, and we understand the budget to being cut, but certainly to really highlight the need for tree. Maintenance is just is just paramount yeah and I think a lot of people in Bay Ridge are shocked to hear just how much tree cover we have, and that actually is one of my other questions, which is how does Bay Ridge compare to like Brooklyn as a whole or maybe other neighborhoods? I know you might not have the data for other neighborhoods in front of you, but like how bad were was CB10 hit versus like some other parts of Brooklyn. Did we take up a lot of time for the parks to like come out here, because we have so much tree cover just some context for some of the numbers yeah I mean you know. I think looking at this is not a direct answer to your question, but looking at service requests compared to work, orders or work orders compared to service requests. It looks like for every two and a half service requests. You get one work order which I think is probably exact yeah and so you know work orders for total, for you know I think between here and between Bay Ridge, I would say: Marine Park is another neighborhood that just gets. You know it's a lot of older single-, family, home neighborhoods that have like. We do not get a lot in Williamsburg, for example, because it's also dense and it's big buildings, but in Marine park borough park Bensonhurst, you know you get you get a ton of you know places where there are a lot of single- family homes, especially you know around right. If you think about when these neighborhoods were really built out in the 50s. You know the trees are kind of reaching about a 70-year limit where they're, where they're pretty large and so tree growth falling it's going to have a pretty big impact. You know you also. I mean I do not want to bring it up, but you know you're going to get heaving when these trees grow on the sidewalks as well and all sorts of nightmares like that. So I think it's just kind of yeah. I would say: Bay Rich, I mean if I did it just on you know, council members calling him things. I would say brave ridge is definitely on the top, because you guys definitely have some local council members. They definitely know my cell phone number for sure and all my staff numbers. So we thank you for that. Also, the state senator, thank you, but yeah I mean yeah. I think you know, I think it's just kind of the design of the neighborhood and kind of the rough age. That is that 70-year lifespan is really interesting because that does go right back to when a lot of our development really starts up and a lot of our trees. Now that I'm thinking about it are massive in this neighborhood, we do not have a lot of younger narrower trees. So that's that's really interesting. Thank you. Yeah. We have a lot of magnificent trees. I would say too, you know some really a lot of London planes. You know we lost a lot of silver maples, but we still have some. You know pretty mature trees here that we're concerned about, and we think that those the maintenance of those trees clearly is very important. Also davey. While I have you, I wanted to ask about sidewalk damage resulting from some of these large trees that came down. We have. We have a few that are in limbo. Are we any closer to figuring out how to get those fixed yeah? I knew I should not have mentioned that, but no we, you know it's definitely a big issue. Acrosss the city. You know right now we are still trying to figure out how we contract for it. We do not have an active contract to come in and plate, replace the trees and sidewalks. We normally have a trees and sidewalks program, but with budget cuts. I would not it's it's not in a great shape right now, so you know what I would say to homeowners or property owners that have tree damage and sidewalk. The first step is always document it as much as possible. You know you can talk to your insurance companies about. You know whether you can you know whether, if you pay for it they'll reimburse you I mean I'd die on anyone having to go down that route. We've spoken to homeowners and they've said absolutely not they're waiting for the city and I get it maybe yeah. We have some sidewalks that are just not passable. We have one in particular, that's very bad. The other option, you know, I think is you know, is actually preparing it yourself and then filing a crane with a comptroller's office. I know it's kind of a leap of faith and you have to trust that they're going to reimburse you back, but you know I think, that's, that is the system. That's set up in place right now. So that's you know. If you want it replaced quickly, I would say: that's your best bet. Otherwise you know you might be waiting a pretty long time, given the financial situation we're in right now I have a question. Do you know why excuse me if this is beyond your purview, but do you know why this particular storm was so damaging to trees? The storm did not seem so ferocious and I was absolutely shocked when I went out the next day and saw so many trees down Chris. I do not know, I do not know Chris or lauren feel free to jump in on this one, but I think it's a combination. I think. First of all, the winds were really strong and then I think the second thing here is that you got a bit of rain and that rain kind of weakens up loosens up the ground and yeah. I that's the only thing that I can explain, but it's mostly just a win condition. You know, and I would add marty I mean we would again we're going to delve a little bit more. If I had a bigger staff, I think I would really love to look at this data, but what we're concerned about too, is that you know with budget cuts and the longer pruning cycles. Many of the trees that came down and my numbers are a little off from davies numbers. You know a good percentage of them had prior tree maintenance requests on them. So I think we want to delve into that a little bit more. You know. Is there a relationship, I'm not an arborist, but I look at numbers, and so when I look at tree trees that came down and looked to see, you know I do a five- year cross and see how many trees had prior tree service requests. I think that's important for us as a board to know, because you know anecdotally people come in and tell us all the time the trees are not being pruned enough and often enough and that's budgetary and it's funding, but I think it's something that we should delve into a little bit more as a committee in terms of our advocacy for funding for parks and I'll say one more thing. You know our regular tree maintenance program is on a seven year cycle, meaning every tree gets looked at every seven years, that's better than industry standards. Actually, I think I think industry standards about ten, ten or more. I do not know what it's going to look like in the next couple. Fiscal years with you know where we are financially, but it might not seem like a lot, but it's what the industry typically does to look at trees right and I think we have a lot of larger trees that may need. I mean I think some trees can fit the seven year pruning cycle, but I think some of the largest trees. No, I you know just from what we hear at the ground at the District office and the thought of it being extended to more than seven years is a little frightening. Frankly, it's simply dangerous. I mean you know the way that they overgrow and covering street signs and stop signs and everything else as it creates a very dangerous situation throughout the neighborhood. So we're going to go out there with our own scissors and sauce, and there is a there's- a citizen pruning course that you can take if you'd like to you know- and we had some board members who were citizen pruners in the past. So, okay, thank you so much, and I just I just want to say from the District office staff I know Dorothy and I we had we sent parks over many of those emails during the storm. Probably I do not know 20 a day, would you say dorothy people yelling at us, and so we appreciate your patience with us as well. So thank you. Are there any other questions that anyone would like to raise this evening? If not, I want to thank Gaby and Chris and lauren from the Parks Department, and I thank you all for joining us this evening. We will report on this we'll give an informational report on Monday evening at the General Board meeting for September and I'll look forward to getting the recording to make sure that my notes that I could write fast enough. So if there's nothing else, I guess we can adjourn great. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Everyone. Thank you. Well, I think. Well, everyone take care. Take care guys, have a good one and happy first meeting for everyone who's. It was their first meeting. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
