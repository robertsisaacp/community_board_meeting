We do have a draft of the menu sent in to the Community Board Office earlier today, premise, photos and floor plans for both indoor and outdoor seating areas were provided and the owner intends to maintain outdoor dining in the rear.
There is no adverse history associated with this owner, as this owner has had several other establishments owned in this community, known as spartan, Souvlaki, One and spartan Souvlaki 2, so Joe. You want to just browse through that, so the committee can look at the floor plans and the menu that would be great, So you just roll back one, so the rear yard will have room for five.
The wording for our meeting is that we say that the committee's decision is to deny an application unless the owner agrees to following stipulations so, and they are basically pretty routine for this type of establishment.
So I'm, going to read what the usual stipulations are for an establishment like this.
Okay, So I will say that the committee will deny this application unless the owner agrees to the following stipulations: that the premises will operate as a restaurant, that there will be no sale or consumption of alcohol on the premises until appropriate authorization is issued by the SLA that the hours of operation, as you had in the application, will be Sunday through Thursday 11 a.m, to 11 P.M and Friday, and Saturday 11 A.M to 12 a.m. Yes, The doors and windows are to remain closed in coordination with any amplified music that there will only be background recorded music and the sound level will remain below the level permitted by the New York City Noise code.
Okay, So as the owner has agreed to the above stipulations, committee, Can I have a motion to accept this recommendation.
