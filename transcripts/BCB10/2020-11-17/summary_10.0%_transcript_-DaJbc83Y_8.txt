We want to thank Mr Lamia for his service to his country and this community, and we humbly present him with the honor of the pledge.
I was with you all in person, but right now we're going to be zooming, at least for the short term, but I wanted to just come by and talk to you directly about some of the issues we're facing in the city.
That's right, but let me first acknowledge Laurie Willis, our great CB10 chair and Josephine Beckman, the district manager I know Councilmember Brandon.
We should recognize that roughly one-third of the city's 240,000 small businesses may never reopen that's a lot of small businesses that have been blindsided by the pandemic and when you think about the fact that 98 of city, employee city employers, provide business or jobs for 3 million people, we first have to go directly to help our small businesses.
First, we're going to have to invest in tax deferrals for our small businesses that are struggling right, now, they're, trying to navigate city agencies, especially the restaurants that are moving from indoor to outdoor dining or did that during the warmer weather.
We're, also going to have to incentivize some tax credits, new businesses that will come to vacant commercial corridors, whether we're in this community or in communities around the city.
I want to talk a little bit about how we do that, and obviously we're going to have to help our small businesses with tech and give them the assistance to expand their businesses.
My office has continued to work with parents around the city and look I know from personal experience.
They're, going to remote learning right, now, they're on remote learning and I can tell you it's one of the hardest things I've had to face as a parent, but I also know my wife.
Many parents can't do that, so I'm just wanted to come by and let you know that my office is here to help.
Lastly, I just want to say to all of you tell me, where you're seeing the trash pile up, we're spending a whole lot of time in our office, trying to understand why the mayor is cutting such essential services like trash pickup, when at a time we want to show that the city is by it is vital and on the way, back, you don't cut programs that really impact communities.
Lots of familiar faces today is a very anxiety invoking provoking day, but I wanted to come by tonight to make sure that I say hello to everyone and to remind you that our office in Bay Ridge is here for you.
When Bay Ridge was in one of the orange or yellow zones, we started doing, you know practicing no contact, but anybody who needs help.
I want to make sure that everyone is staying in touch with the office and know what we have planned tomorrow.
I want to echo some of what I heard the controller say and just let everyone know that I continue to monitor.
What's going on here, not only in Bay Ridge but across southern Brooklyn vis-a-vis, the Covid-19 ray and the precautions that we're taking a lot of people are suffering now, not just people who are falling behind on their rent.
And I certainly want to hear from people in the neighborhood where they think these cameras should go so I'll be putting some stuff out on my social media and in the press about this.
If I'll have a chance to speak, so I'm just going to bring it up now for the Fifth Avenue Euler peering that we're going to have if anyone from the public or from the community board wants to submit testimony to the borough president's office.
Southern Brooklyn has some of the most special small businesses in New, York, City and in the world, and we want to honor those small businesses and just a quick note.
So, that's something that you know he's very committed to working on and something that we want to mention and last, but not least, happy thanksgiving to everyone.
I would like to thank community board 10 for allowing me to speak.
We have begun a brand new program in which we work with people who are interested in taking a look at their very block and who are wanting to implement some changes to improve their blocks.
The lot at 9114, Fifth Avenue, was purchased by a local doctor who wanted to build a hotel, 91 14 5th avenue is located within the Special Bay Ridge Zoning district within the c82 district, which allows for the construction of commercial community facilities buildings with a maximum height of 70 feet.
The application included a wider area beyond his lot because of existing legal precedent that does not allow developers to limit a rezoning.
At, the October 29th meeting members of the public raised good points about maintaining the commercial uses in the area and the residential mix, block density and scale again any of the properties along 90.
08 to 91, 28, 5th avenue, blocks, 23, 26, 28 and 27, and 29 and 405 for 19 90 second sheet, and they voted to reduce the project area in the mid block area of 92nd street by three zoning lots, 405, 47 and 409.
The community board can not change its own current zoning, contextual district regulations.
Again the discussion by the committee and comments from the public, most of which concern the scale of the building and the impact on an area that already has many traffic problems and that we have this proposal as an alternative to an as of right.
A second motion was made to approve the application, but reduce the number of lots considered for rezoning.
Just would like to note, in addition to the community discussion at the October 29th meeting district manager, Beckman, had lengthy discussions with residents and business owners who contacted her with concerns about the site and the proposal.
Yes, Lori I just want to also mention that the applicant is present through their representative fan and available to show any slides or if you wanted to do a you know, a brief run through visually of the project.
The motion was to approve flat out, to approve and at the same time, to write and ask that, while we approve-- because we don't want to lose that at the same time, we said that we would have a right to the city planning or excuse me.
We agreed to you're correct, so we have a motion to approve the resulting application as presented and then to write to the department of City planning and the borough president to request the reduction of the number of lots as 32 33 and 34.
I know: we've presented a few times at the land, use committee and procedurally, as Doris said, we're in new larp and we're towards the end of the community Board review.
Stephanie I just wanted to raise some of the concerns that we addressed in the committee meeting.
Each lot would also receive the bonus far and that's just the height and the bulk just seemed to violate the you know the intent of the Special Bay Ridge District, and it really.
That means that if we don't change the zoning to allow for this residential building, we will get a hotel.
The gentleman who owns that has a right to build that, and the thing is that this whole controversy stemmed from the fact originally that the community did not want to see a hotel there directly across the street from the school.
The committee spoke anything about how the community would support that amount of housing, but not just that building if there would be nine other lots that would build or have the right to build to that height in that capacity, how the Bay Ridge community itself as far as schools.
What you're, referring to as a corridor, which runs from 92nd, that portion of the building will be one story, but it's one building and the concern is that the builder is going to combine all the twos and all the threes into two separate developments, not this builder, but that the zoning, the rezoning would permit someone else to build.
The community response was that we don't really need or want a hotel right across the street from the school.
So he, the developer, said: okay, I will look into building residential as opposed to hotel, but the current zoning does not permit that residential use.
And I just want to ask the question of Doris or, if Steve knows when they did, that environmental impact study on the no need for parking, because we were in.
He could explain more about the parking, but it looks at what is an as of right, which is the no action which would have been the hotel versus the residential and does a quick question on that.
You know to like say nine stories: Will that open the door then, for us battling everybody else to try to keep to our height requirement.
We could approve that knowing what's going on in our neighborhood also, if the developer would build a hotel, he would certainly have to have an opportunity for parking.
So I think that if the developer built a hotel, he would probably build parking inside and frankly.
I, just I think the hotel doesn't need a lot of parking, although you say that.
It, was purchased by a local doctor who wanted to build a hotel and.
I, don't I think we need a lot of things in Bay, Ridge, I.
Don't think we need another hotel, our first idea to get the school construction authority to purchase the lot.
If we didn't want a hotel, was to try to do what we're doing now, which would be to allow the developer to do much needed rental, housing.
So, you know we're not up zoning here, we're not upsetting Bay Ridge for skyscrapers or anything like that.
I. Think it's just important to remember that the developer has purchased this lot and he you know he has a right to build something: here.
So my only concern is, like I, said, the community support for these buildings and families.
I think we need to consider that, because once you rezone it's going to be very hard to stop everyone else to want to rezone certain areas.
I would like to just speak to one thing, just because just a point of Fact Bay Ridge, when this community board worked very hard to get it.
You know most of our avenues, most of our the areas in Bay Ridge and in community board 10 as a whole.
It was noted that there were no comments at the borough president's meeting and I want to say that I logged on to the meeting at six o'clock and at 8:20 the first issue about a development in community board 14 on East 16Th street was still going.
Our mandate is to voice the concerns of our community, as they pertain to the matters that come before us and to voice the unique needs of our portion of this vast city to the local officials and agencies.
Like, the local zoning resolutions we just discussed, then there are the needs and concerns of the community that we hear from you, and we use our form to relay them, to the elected officials and to city agencies and during our public hearings on matters that come before us.
This board is a city mandated group of people from your district who want to hear from you.
The preservation of this local treasure I thank and applaud the efforts of the community, including councilman Menchaca and Councilman Brannan, this board, the historic Districts Council and the Duiker Heights Civic Association in obtaining this first landmark designation in diker heads.
Despite the board's recommendation and our subsequent urgings to the landmark preservation committee that just the designation for some reason carved out the convent or mercy building on 63rd street, and this is something that I intend on raising in new business at the end of tonight's meeting.
4Th avenue, I would also like to share with the board tonight and thank all who volunteer in our community during this time to support local efforts to help feed those in Need community board.
Ridge cares tonight in her report, but I too want to highlight Pam from Pc's bar and grill, who organized with the help of the Fifth Avenue business, improvement, district and 28 local Bay, Ridge bars and restaurants account on Us food drive that ran from November 2nd to November 11, and we also made a contribution to that.
You know we can still all eat out, but bars and restaurants are going to be limited now to 10 p.m and outdoor dining areas you may have noticed, are permitted now to have heat outside and different types of heating guidelines have been sent to the board, and you know we see many businesses on the avenue who are changing the looks of their restaurants, so we do want to support them in and moving forward.
The New York City Department of transportation and buildings announced the extension of the outdoor dining areas.
The agency now has over 600 volunteers providing services that range from orchestrating a full renovation of the Fort Hamilton Senior Center to small local cleanup, events, so they're involved in so much in the community during the Pandemic Bay Ridge.
Cares with added Covid-19 relief funds is again addressing needs during an emergency extending services beyond Bay Ridge to all communities served by our local elected officials.
We did know both Bay Ridge Parkway and Fourth Avenue.
Well, I think that I don't know if the convent would tie into it, because I think that the present developer doesn't want.
