Okay, Madam Chair. We are now on live stream good evening. Everyone. Thank you for joining us. Thank you committee members, and we are amazed we have as of now 18 guests sign up and we had 25 people say that they would like to participate and just as some background holding a meeting of this type in a virtual format is very challenging. We have many speakers and therefore each will be limited to one minute. Your audio will be muted unmuted when it is your turn to speak, and you will hear a bell tone when your time is nearing the one minute mark after the one minute mark, you will be muted again and once all have had the opportunity to speak, the public portion will be closed. You may remain at the meeting and be part of listen to the discussion among board members and the presenters and you may remain meeting and the YouTube live stream will also be available. If you would like to watch later on, the YouTube channel information was provided in the email or in the mailing you received, or you can also get it by emailing Bk10 cb.nyc.gov. We ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and if your question or comments have already been raised, we ask that you know when you do not, when you're called upon you'll have the option to pass me your speaking time if that works, and since this is a formal process of part of the City Council's, the uniform land use review procedure, we will only be discussing this site today, so thank you all and- and I just wanted to repeat that the district office did a mailing of over 2500 of residents of business in the immediate area, and we thank you for your efforts. Thank you Doris. So I see that Richard Lobel is here and councilmember Brandon is here. I know that the councilman I know if you wanted to speak before the presentation. I do not know what your schedule is this evening. I can't wait laughter. It's fine, okay, great doris I'll, give it back to you. Okay. We will turn it over to Richard Labelle and hear his presentation on the rezoning of you look reference numbers, 190-, 447-cmk and 190- 448-cmk. Thank you chair, good evening and good evening to the members of the landings Committee once again, Richard Lobel from Sheldon Lobel, I'm joined by fan Baton for my office, who is going to be sharing her screen as well as Rob green from equity, environmental who can answer any environmental questions. Regarding the proposal we're also joined by the applicant, I believe that Ankit is on the line, and so we can answer any questions that are posed by the committee. So once again we're here for the 91 14 5th avenue rezoning you can scroll through fan. So the zoning map here, as we've discussed before, is the properties located within a c82 district within the Bay Ridge special district, Ca2 district permits, automotive uses, intensive commercial uses does not permit residential. So, as has previously been discussed, a hotel would be available here, as of right. Ankita actually has approved plans from the department of buildings for that and then after many discussions with the community and different stakeholders, this rezoning came about, and so the rezoning now sought is to allow for mixed use, residential and commercial development. So you can see what the proposal would entail and what the what the area covered by the rezoning would be. This would be to an R7A with a c24 commercial overlay. The R7A district is equivalent to several of the districts in the area, particularly there's r7a, further north and west of the property there's r6 equivalents which allow up to a 4.8 far, and so here we'd have an R7A on a discrete corner along. Fourth, I'm sorry, one Fifth Avenue, the you can see in a larger area. The zoning district would travel along fifth Avenue as well as 92nd street, and would encompass roughly 11 to 12 properties. These are relatively small properties, so the actual lawn area that's covered by the rezoning is not great. It's roughly 24,000 square feet, of which the development site is roughly 9,300 square feet. You can see that the zoning district boundary roughly equates to the land use in that corner, which is currently there's two empty lots: vacant lots which are owned by the applicant and then there's about eight or nine additional lots and those lots are multi- family or have some sort of mixed use. On them, none of those residential uses are currently conforming in the in the ca2 district. All of them would be conforming uses within the rezoned area. So, as we've discussed, it's kind of one of the benefits of the of the proposal you can keep going fan so to quickly page through. You can take a look at the development site. These are some of the there's, the used car lot and some of the vacant lots as well as some of the mixed use, residential and commercial buildings. This is what would be effectuated by the rezoning, so you can see on the on that area between fourth and fifth avenues, north of 92nd. Right now you have a ca2 district after the rezoning, you would have this corner, which would be r7a to give you context, there's an R6B across the street. Obviously the schools across the street, which is a relatively large building for for an R6B district. It is four stories, but it's built very tall, so I think you know. The numbers we've seen is that it goes to somewhere between 60 and 70 feet, and you also have residential districts along fourth Avenue to the west. These are the zoning calculations and the plans just to run through briefly. This demonstrates what the current proposal would entail on the development side, as well as what the surrounding uses are. So this is a site plan showing what would be in the intention. The property wraps around. You can see in an inverted l from fifth avenue around to 92nd. There would be a one- story, commercial portion which would carry through on the 92nd street side as well as through to Fifth Avenue, and then the the bulk of the building. The nine stories really eight stories above with residential, would be along fifth avenue on the wider street, and so just to page through the site plan and floor plans, you can see the ground floor plan would contain roughly 8,400, I think, maybe slightly more than that of commercial square footage with a small residential lobby, totaling roughly 1400 square feet, and then you have the unit mixes as you go up the building. So in the first story, there's roughly five studios with one bedroom and one two bedroom and then, as you go up, there's a typical mix of one bedrooms and two bedrooms. The total unit count for this proposal is roughly 41 units, which would include, as per mandatory inclusion, inclusionary housing, roughly 11 units of inclusionary housing at various levels. The bedroom mix here is relatively generous as far as the square footages are concerned, there's roughly 36,000 square feet of residential in the building for roughly 41 units. So it's a fairly good square footage per unit fan you can keep going and then you have the building in section and elevation. So you can see what the you know, how the bold the how the building would fit within the streetscape of the surrounding area. So there's a there's kind of an Eagle eye view of the surrounding area, the building. How that would sit. You can see it across from the school, both those buildings being fairly prominent within that surrounding area. And again you know the just to kind of summarize. The ca2 under the existing Bay Ridge special district regulations, would allow anywhere from a three to a 4.8, far for current building types, with a maximum height of roughly 70 feet, so at 70 feet or seven stories. The proposed building would exceed that by roughly two stories. This is a nine- story. Building you see in front of you, and so you know the discussion prior to this time was that you know in good faith. The applicant did have a hotel was intending to do a hotel and after further conversation you know we came. We came in with this proposal, so that's really kind of a summary of what we've put before the committee before and we're happy to answer any specific questions. Thank you councilman. Would you like to jump in now sure thank you. So thank you guys. So much so 91 14 5th avenue is an interesting one, a lot which has been vacant for several decades. As long as I can remember, as was mentioned here, was purchased by a local, ophthalmologist and developer. His plan was to build a hotel and because of a an unfortunate blind spot in the 2004 special Bay Ridge District Zoning law. A developer can build a hotel here as of right, but he could not build housing here as of right. So if he wants to build housing, you'd have to get a rezoning. That just did not make any sense to me. You know. Naturally, a lot of folks are up in arms, because many felt that a hotel across the street from a school was not ideal, and I certainly struggled to disagree. I think we need a lot of stuff in Bay Ridge, but never heard anyone say that they think we need another hotel and certainly not across the street from a school. So my first idea was to see if the school construction authority might be interested in this lot and I reached out to them and they came and took a look after their review. They said it was too small to build a school here. You know understanding that I think to you and I a lot that might seem big enough to build. The school, unfortunately, is not always what the school's construction Authority thinks and what they need, the space that they need to build the school. So once you know sort of the anti- hotel protests subsided, I sat down with a developer and I tried to convince him that what we really needed here was housing rental housing and we did not need a hotel, but in order to do that, we have to rezone the lot. So that's what we did and you know I got ta. I have to say that, throughout this whole process, the developer has played his cards face up. You know, even though he's allowed to build a hotel here, a seven or eight story. Hotel would be allowed and there would be nothing we could do about it because he could build it as of right. He did not. You know he did not want to build something that the community did not want, which is which is more than I can say for a lot of developers. You know a lot of horror stories out there, where the developer can build as of right. Well, they're going to go ahead and do it and unfortunately there would not be really anything that I or the community board could do. So. I appreciated that he was willing to listen and take into consideration what the community was saying and that's. Why we're here today- and I think this represents a lot of hard work, a lot of back and forth and really as good a compromise as you as you can get. You know he. The developer has a owns. This lot now purchased a slot and has a right to build something on this lot. So I'm thankful that he was willing to work with us to to not build a hotel but to build to build housing and to get some affordable units out of it as well, which we desperately need so look I'll, say: threading, the needle between preserving our existing small town neighborhood character. While meeting this truly desperate need for more housing is not easy. It takes a lot of time, takes a lot of oversight, but it's something that I am certainly dedicated to getting right with the guidance and the council of the Community Board, and I think that I think that this is really the best of both worlds. So I'm happy that we've been able to get this far and certainly look forward to hearing what the Community board has to say about it. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to make one comment: I'm going to be I'm going to nitpick it. You said that I just want to, because we have many guests who are not familiar with our process. This property is not yet rezoned. No, we are in the process of going through the rezoning, which is what the universal land review process procedure is correct, so he so the development right. So as it stands right now, the developer could build up, build a hotel, we're doing this for zoning to prevent that yes and allow him to build to build houses. Okay, so Doris, I guess I'll go through the list of speakers. People who signed up to ask questions or to speak. The next speaker is ina guzenfeld from Brooklyn borough, President, Eric, Adams office hi good evening, members of Community Board Good Evening Council member good evening, rich lobel. I just wanted to quickly announce, as I stated in the previous meeting, that our president is hearing on this agenda on this item will be held on Tuesday November 10th and I did share the agenda with Josie. Yes, I got that email today and I will be emailing that out. Thank you so much. Thank you and I'm happy to take any questions about that via email or at some other time. Okay, great. So I guess I'll proceed. Jake goldfinger is here from assembly member Matilda Francis's office. I am going to mute him. I think he's in the attendees Jacob. I do not know if you wanted to speak. No. Thank you, I'm here to listen, mainly okay, great next, so we have about 30 people who signed up to speak so we'll go throughs one at a time. George Jorcallis, George, Welcome, hi Josephine. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you good evening, Everyone Board, Councilman Brennan. Thank you for your efforts. I'm going to make it quick, my name is George Atlas, I own the property immediately adjacent to the Fifth Avenue parcel it's lot 26.. I also maintain my law practice at the location. Just want to give my support for the rezoning. I want to thank Councilman Brannon for his efforts in getting this done, and one important piece to this to this whole thing is that the hotel that could be built here as of right would have also had a substantial size to it as well. So just ask the board to keep that in mind and again, as the neighbor, I want to welcome ankit to the neighborhood and wishing best of luck with this development. Thank you. Thank you. So much george. Thank you. Okay! Next, we have a smallis. Sorry bear with me gus, I'm sorry about that. I was having some technical issues gus you're on. I think I'm on now. Okay, great welcome good to hear you, it's good to see everybody. I was really here as an observer. I just wanted to see what's happening. I happen to be George's partner and interested in. You know the neighborhood. Obviously so you know I'd like to say thank you to everyone for their efforts and it's nice to even on a virtual basis to see everyone. I hope everyone's safe and healthy great. Thank you too John Goss good to see you same here. Okay. Next we have Ralph Zakar. I believe I saw him and Joanna Zakar Joanna. Is this you Joanna Sakara, I'm here both of us here both of you. Are there? Okay, hi Ralph Hi Joanna. Are you the next two up to speak? Thank you I'll. Ask a question. First of all, thank you Justin for the update and thank you for not having the hotel there. I was very much against it. I the only my only concern is the 41 units additional for parking. My only concern of congestion in that corner as usual as I reset it before because of school. I do not have any objection of anybody building anything that is so. It's really beautiful. Building that's going to be if it goes through, I'm not against it at all, but I just want to present that Bay Ridge is tight and that is a very concerned corner and I wish everyone, the best of luck and it's nice to see everyone healthy. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Next I have Giuseppe Ann Zalone. Let me see if he is on giuseppe. If you are here, can you raise your hand? I guess, if not, I will get back to you I'll go on to the next. I see a board member who's on the Anthony mourinho who's joined us, okay, I'll put Giuseppe aside, Ruth Redunda. I do not see Ruth just for some background. Josephine is going through the list of people who said they were going to speak right who registered okay, I see Charles. I had Charles Shenfield, I'm just having a little bit of a technical glitch here, okay Charles, you should be able to speak now. Yes, I do not have any particular objections to this particular construction, given the residential units that are going in as opposed to the hotel. However, I have a big concern about the rezoning of the adjacent lots, because if you see this one in two years from now, you have you have two construction sites, just waiting right next door to it on either side and then you're going to be building seven stories on that side and seven stories on the other side, and that's not going to be very good for Bay Ridge. It's going to really give in a heck of a lot of congestion, there's no parking facilities available, nothing, and so I like Bay Ridge in its current form and a seven- story building. I had to swallow a little bit, but I see on the other two blocks away. They've got another one and I do not think it's going to ruin anything being on Fifth avenue. This one bordering on fourth avenue might be a little more of a challenge, but again the cars passing back and forth and the school being across the street. When you have all these children. I do not know how this is going to work out in the future. This particular construction, probably okay, but anything rezoning around that once you rezone those other areas, you're opening them up for another construction site to the left or to the right of it and that's going to be a real mess. That's pretty much all! I have to say: okay, nice, seeing you again it's nice to hear your voice Charles. I was happy to see you register. It's been a long time. Thank you. Thank you bye. I do not know if Donna she wanted to we'll just keep going through the of people comment on Charles's comments. They were concerns that the committee has had and will be further discussed. Okay, so my next speaker was Ruth. Redondo Ruth have you here. I guess I'm having difficulty because a lot there's a lot of phone numbers and not names described to some of the attendees, so I'm trying to just match so next I'll take Beatrice, Turnbull Beatrice beatrice you just have to unmute yourself. If you'd like to speak beatrice, do you just have to unmute yourself at your lower panel to take yourself unmute? I did I allowed to see okay, I guess I'll. I will move on Brian Leonard Brian. You could go ahead to speak. How are you very good? Thank you. I had some concerns about the parking and also some future development. That's projected for the site where Kfc is today like 9201, fifth Avenue. Both of them were out there and, I believe, are requesting for no parking to be as part of the development and we have a school right there and we have the traffic that goes to the Verrazano Bridge. So you're talking about adding you know, 40 plus units in that and then the upcoming medical facility at Kfc. I think it's going to be a recipe for disaster with traffic and a danger to the children. Thank you, doris. Yes, we are very aware of that. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. I do not want to miss anyone ruth if you're here, if you're you just raise your hand. Okay, then I'll skip on to the next person, Alison Martin, okay, Leon and Cinewich Leon. I just clicked you on you'll be able to talk. You just have to unmute yourself. If you would like to speak Leon, okay, I do not know if they're having technical issues Joe they can just if they're on a computer, they can just hit the space bar and hold it that will also unmute it yeah, okay, so Leon! If you could hear us, if you want to hold your space bar down, you can mute yourself that way. Okay, I'm going to move on then to the to the next person Jennifer Moore Jennifer. Would you like to say something I just unmuted, you hmm! I do not know if there's an issue. Okay, so I see from Gregory Lopez. Nine stories is very out of character for the neighborhood and may set the president for more high story. Luxury apartments in the future, while more housing is welcome, nine story, buildings may open the door for fundamentally changing the character of Bay, Ridge and Gregory. Lopez did right why nine stories instead of six or seven well, I can. I can answer that if they were zoned to r7a, seven stars are permitted, but under the mandatory inclusionary housing program by including affordable housing, they are allowed a bonus of extra height in order to compensate for the met for the affordable housing. It's a city- wide program and it's it helps to encourage affordable housing. Although I would say the committee was not thrilled with it: okay, Allison, Martin, Allison, hi, sorry, I'm just tuning in. I had a little technical difficulty. So my issue is that I watched the last meeting via the YouTube and they're saying that there's no- and I also was looking over the contract that was sent over via email and they're, saying that there's no intent to develop on the other adjacent lots which I find interesting because, after looking up online one of the adjacent lots which is directly across the street on 90, see address here on 90 9201, fifth avenue, there's already there's already. It's already listed up, there's already space listed up for release, and it says those properties located at the hard corner of 5Th, Avenue and 92Nd street in the heart of Bay Ridge Brooklyn. A denton sliv workplace urban community, the location is great for walkers, as well as transit and car commuters. The site is located one short block from the R- line: subway station minutes from the Verrazano bridge, Brooklyn Queens expressway in the belt parkway available now up to 31,500 square feet of aaa retail medical office school space in a brand new elevator and spring and sprinklered commercial building with parking. The building when built, will boast approximately 200 feet of wraparound frontage on fifth Avenue and 92Nd Street. The prestigious building will feature excellent visibility from all directions, as tens of thousands of cars passed the site dealing daily being a corner property. So I mean it's already being advertised that this is going to be leased and developed directly across the street, and if you it says, the property address 92 on one. Fourth at the alternate addresses are 90,202 fifth and 402 through four to four ninety second street office, with commercial, seven to nineteen right stores, Allison 9201, fifth Avenue is not part of this application and is not part of this rezoning effort. It is. It is a completely separate matter. It's a that was an as of right development project. That's not part of this application, but if it's rezoned, then that will it's in the zoning area so we'll? No! It's! No! It's not within this rezoning area, so that won't so if they re- zone this it won't allow. No, it will not on this lot. No! Thank you all right. Thank you! Okay! Next I have Lewis cookies Louis. I see you here louis you are now. If you would like to speak, you could take yourself off new holding down the bar or unmuting yourself. If you hover over the lower portion of your screen, Louis, okay, we'll go back to Lewis. Sorry hot Leon, I'm Leon! I'm going to go back to you Leon. Would you like to make a comment this evening? Okay, all right, so I think that if there's anyone that would like to speak, if you could use the hand raise function who have not spoken yet that that's not the script, that would be great Joe. I saw it in the chat that Beatrice Turnbull said she's back. She was bumped off somehow so. Oh okay, I'll put Beatrice back on okay, beatrice you're on. If you'd like to unmute yourself, you can address the committee, the zoning and land Use committee beatrice you can also press the space bar and hold it down. I guess she's still having. Maybe you could write your question in the question and answer and we could take a look at it. Okay, I do not know. I guess beatrice is having some technical difficulties. I really apologize. Abby Krantz! Let me see, let's see, I know beaches, my goodness all right if Abby Krantz is on. If you want to raise your hand, if not, I guess we'll move to, I do not. I do not see Mary Martin, okay, so we'll move to the next speaker we'll move to mustafa. If you'd like to speak, you can unmute your speaker, yes good evening to the representatives that represent Bay Ridge Community Richard Lebel. This is a question for you. How long have you known about this property? When did the developer come to you and about this property? Application probably was brought about a year and two months ago, a year two months ago, okay because, as Josephine knows, there's a property next door to my house that the developer stole my driveway. Now this is in relation to the your development side, because the way the developers work is that they have concoted relationships with example like vincent gentilly or marty golden, and they were in hand. So when Justin Brennan came on it's like here, he already organized the deal with you and him how this relationship's going to go work now and Doris. You know and Justin Beckman. You should be for the community and fight and not allow this property to go forward. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mustafa okay, Alison Martin, Allison you're on. If you want to all right, not really okay, so another question that I had was. I have a few questions for now. My other thing that I was the other question that I had was in the last meeting. I that I watched via YouTube one of the I believe it was anthony, asked about the gas station being on on the property and, I believe Richard said it was only a small portion that was on the property. According to public records that gas station has been sold. Do we know who acquired this? Was it any of the property developers or do we know for one of the proper? The developer acquire purchase this land because, according to public record, that gas station has been sold? As of recent, I know that anthony was brought it up in the in the meeting, and Richard was saying that it did not matter because it was only in a small portion of the land. I do not have any information on that if it was recently sold. I do not know if Richard I mean it's not. I do not believe it's part of I can. I can confirm the gas station was installed to the applicant. It's somebody else purchased it okay, because there's a lot of property. If you go on there's a lot of property around that area, I have numerous addresses indirectly in the direct vicinity, all the way going to 8904, I believe and fourth, and which there they actually have these properties. There's a company. It's called they do not it's. So what Richard was saying is that the property developer only has this one property and he's not interested in purchasing other properties. There is a company that is called. Let's see what their name is all right. This is important information, but we very much are just focusing on this application. It is to do with this application. Basically, this company, what they do is they put the deals together. So all these it raises some red flags, because, if all the properties in the vicinity that are bordering this one have been sold and they are being shot in the rezoning area. It's not just a gas station, there's numerous properties. Yes, thank you very much allison. I will have Richard respond to that. Thank you sure. So, just just to answer. Allison's comment. So, first of all, if Fam wants to bring up the map, I do not know if it's necessary, but you could take a look on the atlantic map. It shows the resulting district boundary and so, let's just go back to the color Graph fan yep a little slow one, second doing great, okay, so right so be able to focus in. So you can see the gas station kind of in like like a pale purple so that where that arrow is right there that black arrow head, that is, that is where the that's, where the gas station piece will be rezoned it is. It is inconsequential in the development of the gas station. Basically, it's like having a you know: 100 square foot parcel on the gas station piece which can be developed residential, it's just for all practical purposes, there's nothing that can be put there pursuant to the new zoning. You know. With regards to the other lots. Unkey owns two of the lots you can see him highlighted in red. He does not own any of the other lots and the other lots are included in the resulting area. If somebody else wanted to develop them pursuant to the new zoning they'd be able to you know it's as part and parcel of the resulting city. Planning includes lots at the request of the developer, but like in conjunction with the developer. That makes sense to be included, and here city planning wanted to include an encouraged inclusion of all the lots of residential on them. So yeah I mean there's other lots that are including rezoning. I do not think there's nothing. You know nefarious or anything like that. It's basically just that rezonings have typically have more than one law. Great. Thank you. Richard! That's helpful. Okay, so we're going to try beatrice again features turnbull beatrice! I see you have your hands up and I know you're. You tried to log on we're going to try you again. I see she signed on in a different way hold on one. Second, I'm going to try her this way beatrice you could just mute yourself. I see you on the screen. Oh finally, great I'm so happy so go right ahead. It's your time to comment all right. So we are the windows door next door. Okay, great welcome how you doing we've been there for 30 years, welcome everybody, and we have been in this neighborhood for a long time serving this community as a commercial business. This is this is a very interesting situation, because, with this rezoning there's going to be a lot more traffic and we take a lot of traffic ourselves with tractor trailers, and you know it's a circus already just trying to run our business in the zone that we have and we help out the school, we'll rent out spaces to the teachers for their parking. So we're going to also eliminate the teacher parking we're going to create a lot more congestion and we as a commercial business in our own zone. It's going to be very difficult for us to operate. So I do not know what this is going to bring upon us, we're not in the rezoning and that's another. You know another discussion and with one of the other gentlemen said, you know what's good, for the goose is going to be good for the gander in the future, so this 41 unit building is just the beginning of what's to come. So this decision today that everybody's going to make or in the future, is going to affect not just this property. It's the corner property. It's the restaurant! It's going to be my building, it's going to be the school across the street yeah. This is this is a big decision here. I know that councilman Justin said that we need more housing, but we also need space to operate. Businesses in the neighborhood and commercial space is limited, and if we take away more commercial space, what is the plan to reallocate space for commercial businesses? Is there another piece of land where you would like us to move to and operate our business and serve our community because we've been there for 30 35 40 years in the same location, almost 50 years? So this decision that's coming upon us is going to you know it's going to set a precedence for the next 50 years in the neighborhood? That's all I have to say all right. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming this evening. Important questions. Yes, okay, so I'm going to go, I'm going to go to the next speaker. I'm sorry! Leon! Okay, Leon, you can hold your, you can hold your space bar down or you want to try to hit the unmute button. I know you were trying as well. I figured I'd. Try you again: okay, all right, we'll move to the next person. Let's see, there's so many people who signed up and it's just difficult with the bear with me. What do you think next? Are they? Okay, sadia abula-, San? Okay, you can unmute yourself, you have one minute! Thank you, hello, everyone good evening, so my question actually is two questions and I second, what beatrice Mr B said it's to the floor area ratio. I do not see where the building is following the floor area ratio. The far it's really it's a square and it's taking all the all the size of the whole lot from one avenue to the next and from one street to the next. Okay. Thank you. I do not know Richard if you wanted. Yes, Steve yeah. I just wanted to see if Richard would answer that. So thank you for the opportunity. So the government site is you know. There's frontage is on 92nd and on 5Th avenue and so to the extent that there is a one- story portion with a building in the rear and then there's a portion on fifth avenue which sets back on the upper stories. Obviously, the one- story portion is not filling up any floor area on the on the portion above the one story. So basically the average out of the of the entirety of the development site is, to an far of I think it's roughly 4.79 something so, but as a separate calculation, the r the owner has to go to the department of buildings. They have to review the plans. We show city planning. What a proposed building is that complies with zoning and they're, not able to you know, they're not able to get around DOB permitting requirements merely by giving plants to city planning they're going to have to show DOB that they're, using the appropriate amount of floor area for the for the proposed district and that's part of the development. But as far as the building that's shown, that building is complies with R7A bulk. Thank you, Richard Doris, you wanted to. I just want to let everyone know that zoning exists and we, the community board, do not have the power to tell people what they can do with their property and that this is a limited review and there are zoning laws in place, and we are discussing this because the community does not want a hotel at that site a minute to just echo what Dar said sure I just wanted everyone to know, and you know it's funny, because you know we do a number of applications before city planning. This was somewhat unique for me in that, in that I was a little bit of an afterthought. I mean there were discussions that went on about this property. That happened before I was even around, and the truth of the matter is that the zoning right now and the permitting right now would allow for this six- story, hotel and when you talk about density and use and height you're, not just talking about a box you're talking about a hotel that numbered about 65 to 70 rooms with roughly three parking spaces. So I think, all those conversation- and it's not just and again it's in again, everyone here on our side- has been going in good faith. You know there were. There was there's just been conversations going back and back and back Keith to his credit is went to the department of buildings and there's full plans and materials for you know for permits. You could walk into DOB tomorrow, pull permits and start building next week. But when you talk about density and everything around that traffic congestion, etc, there was going to be a 65-room hotel here and you can imagine what that would engender versus a 41 person, residential building, it's like when we when we hand this to the environmental consultants who are available to us this evening and they go and do their studies. They look at what you can do as of right versus what you can do under the proposed zoning, and when you show this city planning and the environmental and assessment review division. What that traffic pattern would look like what congestion would look like, particularly for a hotel when you do not have the same luxury of a residential building where people come in and come out and a hotel. You know you get a lot of people coming in the morning and a lot of people you know leaving in the morning and then a lot of people coming at night and leaving, and so you like get these very concentrated traffic patterns which are really challenging. So I just so again when doors said you know zoning and zoning and they could build what they could build. It's true there was. You know that was the baseline here and so the discussion. While we understand it and people saying that, what's what it's going to do to this corner, you have to look at in the framework of what they could have done and also what they could still do. Even if it was not a hotel, it could be a rather large community facility, doctor's office, commercial building, again, not something that is desired here. But that's why we've got this plan and I would just like to read something that I said when we saw a preliminary discussion of this in February and again last earlier this month, the committee felt they were between a rock and a hard place. They're not. This is not something we're doing by choice, but considering the option of a hotel. We have to consider what else could be there and how it works. Okay, great so Doris I have a you know. A good stack here of public session forms that people had registered for in advance, and you know it's. I think I have not been able to match some of the names here with the names I see on the screen. So I think I'm going to ask anyone who has not I'm going to lower all hands and anyone who has not spoken yet before and who would like to have a question or a comment to please raise their hand, have not spoken before. I would like to add something: a community with public participation at our next community board meeting in November. We will have what is called a public hearing. So anyone who was not able to convey their concerns tonight can relay them to the district office and they will be discussed and reviewed yes and we'll also be reviewing emails and the Q&A here tonight. So next I'm going to go with Joanna Sukhar. I know that Ralph spoke, but Joanna did not so Joanna. Thank you. Thank you very much good evening. Everyone. Thank you. First of all, Mr Labelle for sitting in my. Is there any possible way we all wish the success of the land owner. I know that, however, the parking facility of any sort would be so beneficial to the area, including the adjacent stores. Is there any way that this gentleman would consider anything like that with any a minimum amount of housing, but to also incorporate some sort of parking facility within that building? That's what I'd like to say and again. We wish him all the success that he deserves. However, please consider the community as well. Thank you very much. Thank you Joanna, okay, so I have one more who I have not allowed to speak. I'm going to it's just two initials, I'm going to allow to talk. It's tm I'd. Ask that you just introduce yourself and provide us with your name and you're. Go ahead. You can proceed tm. Can you tell us who you are please? The name is Tamara. I live in Bay Ridge on 79Th Street. My concern. I came here for two reasons. One is actually legalize land theft through the buildings Department, but I'll address that at another time. However, this particular concern because I have fdny family members, it raises a bell because that area is already congested so much right. Now, as we travel to and from the Verrazano Bridge, we can't even take 90 seconds to exit Verrazano Bridge. We have to go to 86th street to get to our house. We continue on. I can't never remember the name of that street. We continue on to from the Verrazano exit all the way to 86th street, because you can not turn there because of the traffic, the students, the buses. You have poly Prep, there's so much at Fort Hamilton. I'm sorry, I can't think the name of the school. I think it is for you, but you have Fort Hamilton, you have the Va hospital all in that same area and they're all fighting to get to and from Fourth Avenue, Third, Avenue, etc, and now it. What boggles me is the fire department is right there, it's a small fire station. How are they supposed to get out and respond in a timely manner if there's a gridlock of congestion in that area? That is we're now talking about a deadly situation here, because God forbid there's a major fire in Bay Ridge. How are they to respond when there's gridlock at 92nd and 5th avenue actually from 92nd from 4th all the way down to about Fort Hamilton Parkway? So how would fdny get out of a gridlock situation to respond to a major fire in Bay Ridge? Is this building worth the entire area burning down because of a low response to a fire? Thank you very much. Thank you. I do not know if richard, if you wanted to or Doris you wanted to speak to that, that congestion is currently exists in that area. So I do not know this will have some impact, but it is it's definitely a highly congested area and there are lots of concerns and traffic issues should be addressed. But this is not the forum form okay, so so Doris. I do have a bunch more speakers, but I do not see them on and there are no more hands raised of people who have not spoken already. There is a one person that has called in I'm going to just allow them to speak, because if they wish it's a 646- 331- 2929 number only because you could. I want you to be able to give you a chance. If you'd like to speak to unmute yourself. Do you know the unmuting on the phone? Okay, yeah Cola? Would you like to add anything? Okay, nope so Doris? I think we've gone through everyone who has registered we've, given everyone an opportunity to speak, and maybe you can explain as we proceed during regular Commit committee meetings, what the next process is and what the next steps are right. What we, if we were, having a meeting where, all together in one room, we would close the discussion to the guests and the committee would discuss what would continue with the discussion and vote. So we will proceed to that. Everyone is welcome to listen to us, but this is our time to discuss the issues and thank you all for your participation. It's very helpful, hello, okay, that's it we're done yeah, but you're we'll be talking for a while. So you're welcome to listen to us if you'd like okay, great so turn it over to the committee. Okay, I think some interesting issues were raised and I think they're issues that we have all looked at and know about, and so I ask any questions or concerns. I have a question for Richard. Are you there? Okay, you said that at the request of city planning, you enlarged the area and included all the other lots like 11 or something it done. How was that determined? Did they make the choice? Did you make the choice? So when we approach city planning for rezoning, we approach with the applicant's property alone and for every property? That's included under rezoning. We've got to do additional architectural legal environmental work because and also pay additional filing fees. So it's always in the applicant's best interest to you know from a numbers standpoint to keep the rezoning as small as possible. City planning does not operate that way for city planning, it's in their interest to basically make sure that the rezoning represents the context of the area so that they do not want to be accused of a spot zoning which basically is just rezoning a parcel or multiple parcels for the development for the benefit of one developer. They need to make sure that when somebody looks at this rezoning afterwards they say: okay, it made sense, and so it's wrong for me to imply that city planning imposed that honestly they did not. We basically are required to come up with a land use rationale, including zoning district boundary and then at the end of the day, city planning says: that's acceptable us and we move forward. We came in and we currently have these 11 properties, all of those in the applicant's development site have residential in them and so for city planning. From city planning standpoint, it made sense for them to include them as as they would be. You know they would now be conforming residential uses. Do the zoning district boundaries change over the course of an application they do as the application goes through euler. The applicant goes forward with. What they feel is, you know, is an appropriate rezoning area and sometimes when it gets to city planning or the council, that the zoning district boundaries changed. But what I will tell you for now is that is that the donating district Boundary was set in conjunction with city planning, but basically reflects that. You want to make sure that this is that the that the rezoning district has context having and just to summarize having been in court within the last year over rezonings and been challenged as far as spot zonings, everyone's very sensitive about this, you want to make sure that your resulting really holds water and is you know, just makes sense, and so that's why we included what we included. Thank you. I see. Dean has his hand up Dean you have to unmute yourself, I muted myself yeah. I wanted to speak to that because we have two situations: we're dealing with now: the applicant's actual proposal and then an additional burden. That's really put on the community by additional parcels being up zoned, which makes them extremely more valuable and they can come back now and build the 9:10 story building whatever the case may be, so somebody will be looking at buying up these parcels and doing the same thing over again. So what we have really never discussed is this: could we approve the developers the specific plans of the developer, but disapprove of this additional zoning now and then what city planning does they going to do? But that will protect the community somewhat with a recommendation like that interesting, I do not know and zoning fans anybody have any input. I think you can dean this Steve Dean the problem with that is that if they build it right now, you're saying like if they would wind up with the hotel, that's exactly what we're trying to avoid. No, I'm not saying that I'm saying that just approve this that would become that would be cool. That would be spot zoning correct. It would be spot zoning yeah, I do not. I do not think you could you have to approve it all you can't. I do not think you well, it's not just spot zoning. It's like you can't. If you take this one lot and say we're going to make this into something it. That becomes like almost a super spot zoning and it can't happen it's not going to occur. They look at it in context and they say I think that Richard just did a pretty good job of explaining it. From that point of view, we can't just go. You know we really like what Richard is proposing, but let's just limit the zoning. To that one particular lot. Can I speak again. This is really for committee discussion. I'm sorry yeah. I understand what I'm saying is to say the least, not traditional, but we can make any kind of motion we want as a community board and what I'm saying is the least objectionable piece would be if we only approved the developers a residential request, and we say we do not want the rest. Now what city planning is going to do? They're going to do, I know it says it's a spot zone, but it's not city planning asking for a spot zone. It's the community asking for a spot zone, it's a ve, a very different approach, which we've never looked at before. Okay, let's move on Stephanie, I was just going to ask if it if we could reduce the number of lots that would be in the rezoning and just to bring up again the point that the environmental assessment says that there is no adverse effect from this project, even though it's looking at 11 lots, but it does not look at the cumulative impact on the infrastructure. You know sanitation, schools, transportation and certainly parking richard. You know it might be helpful if you could put up that slide with the zoning area. That includes the 11 lots I know fan if you could do. That might be a little bit helpful just to visualize. I think what Stephanie is saying about reducing the size, maybe just taking a look at the whole zoning area. Again, just really quickly would be helpful. Also. I just I would just add to Dean and Stephanie's point, and you know everything's above board, and I deal with the public record. There are. There are cases there are cases we've done within the last year, two years or so where the Community board has recommended a more limited scope of rezoning and city planning has responded to that. So zoning district boundaries get adjusted. It is it's my job as an applicant to put forward what we feel is going to best represent the context of the area and be accepted, but you know there are. There are cases where that does happen. But again, like that's, you know, that's a it's a it's a deeper conversation that does not really have anything to do with us as an applicant, but more has to do with the Community Board say Richard. I so are you saying that you have you know of cases where the project was cut back at the request of the community? That's correct! Yes, it is which is exactly what I'm saying we should do so yeah, so that would not create a spot zoning a lot. It would create just a smaller impact zone, so instead of the 11, it would be- maybe let's say five or something if we ask them to reduce it. So that way, there's still contextual zoning happening, but to a lesser extent I think I I'm concerned about the rezoning on the 92nd street blocks, because 92nd street is the narrowest street between Fourth Avenue is wide. Fifth avenue is what is not as wide, but 92nd street is not wide and to allow development of an R7A building on 92nd street would be very detrimental it. It is not only is that entire area very congested, but that corner has four bus, turns, has very poor visibility and already is a history of traffic problems. So I think adding a seven to nine story. Building on facing 92nd street would be problematic. Can you swing it around the other way? Richard? Can you do it like down 91st street to 4th Avenue instead of down 92nd street? Was that considered what was the rationale to go down? Yeah going down 91st street would have involved if I'm, if I'm understanding from fourth to fifth- I'm sorry from fifth to fourth yeah. Yes, so they did not the the properties that are to the north of us and to the northwest of us are all none of them are residential and so rezoning them to mixed use. Residential did not make sense, and they also you know. There was also environmental ramifications to rezoning intensive commercial and gas station uses. So that's why the only properties included in the rezoning were the ones that were contiguous and residential. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Richard. That was helpful. Thank you because maybe we could go back to the group chair. Okay, Dean, your hands are still up. I do not know if you I just did not take it down, but you know me. I could talk a lot, but I just want to reiterate what I was saying before, especially from Richard's comments that my suggestion has been done in the past. So if we want to try to limit the additional lots, we should consider a motion approving only the developer's site and not the rest of the sites, and then let city planning do what they wanted to do. Maybe they won't eliminate it, and maybe they will change it, and then we do not have the problem of a developer coming in buying up those other properties and putting up another 90-story build building. I mean that is the safest thing we could possibly do. Josh Vogel is here from city planning. He has his hand raised Josh hi yeah. Thank you for having me just quick comment in regards to the district and to echo what Mr Lobel said so the this district. These are all non-, conforming buildings right now, legally non- conforming, so they're residential buildings built before 1961 or later, when they were rezoned to a district that does not allow residential, so part of the rationale for including them in this district was. These homeowners would now be in a district that represents the character of their building if they wanted to get a mortgage or a refinance. That could be a benefit in the long term. The only conforming uses are the current sites, which are parking, lots and the gas station, but all those residential buildings currently are in a commercial district. So just wanted to echo that point great. Thank you. Josh Stephanie, you had your hand raised, I guess Unmute Stephanie yeah. Thank you, two questions. Once those homes or buildings become conforming, then they also have the opportunity to become grow, larger or build larger buildings, and they also would have the mandatory inclusionary housing mandate. Is that correct? So they would have the bonus far on all of those, and I guess the other question is. I was just curious as to why an R7A was chosen and not something with the smaller floor area ratio. That's it sure the one once those multi- family, existing multi- family buildings were enlarged, demolished and enlarged or just enlarged. Any enlargement would be subject to mandatory inclusionary housing. So the idea is basically that that there's no straight presidential benefit from this. It basically is like you're allowed to enlarge what you need to do it to the for the benefit of the area by including affordable units. The R7A was chosen for a few reasons. The existing c82 carries with it a maximum floor area ratio, far of 4.8 in the Bay Ridge special district you're limited to three for community facility uses. So if you're just doing a doctor's office, building you'd have to do a 3far, but for mixed- use buildings you could cap the community facility of three and you could go additional to commercials. So what does that really mean ten thousand square foot lot? Let's say you could currently build a 48,000 square foot, building, 30,000 square feet of commercial 18, sorry of doctors, offices, 18,000 square feet of commercial. The R7A was seen as being equivalent to that in being a 4.6 far so the maximum development unit development rights under the existing zoning 48,000 under the proposed zoning 46,000.. Even if you looked at a maximum commercial, far community facility affair of three you're still looking at 30,000 versus 46,000, it's a comparable building type. The other thing very specifically and frankly, was that the zoning districts as you go from an R7D to an r7, a you go 5.6 to 4.6. So what's the next one down from an r7a, it's an R6A at a 3.6 which is you know frankly, it did not provide enough of an incentive for the developer to say I'm going to abandon my six story. 65 unit, you know hotel. Thank you. Thank you. Michael has his hand raised Michael Devine, hi how's it going. I got a question for Mr Labelle about the environmental studies. Did they consider the traffic impacts and if they did do they consider them between sort of the no change scenario, the scenario with the hotel and then the current proposed scenario? Yes, so Rob green, I see just came off. Mute Rob is a an environmental consultant at equity, environmental, consulting who's able to talk about all the impacts. So just to give you the clip notes, there's an environmental assessment statement. That's performed it's, you know numbers over 250 pages and it looks at over 26 different impact categories, including traffic and parking. I will let Rob discuss this far more eloquently than I can, but essentially my understanding is that there was a negative determination was issued that given what they look at is the margin they look at a spread between what you can do and what and what you do with the rezoning. Given that spread, it was found to have to not have a significant environmental impact. Rob can you can you speak to that sure, so so the question that Michael had was, comparing the I guess what's existing and what could be built with the hotel and what could be built now with the proposed project. So what we actually evaluated was the proposed project, which you saw the plans for and what exists there now, and so the city asks you to look at what the most conservative analysis would encompass, and so, instead of comparing the hotel to that building plan, you saw with the 41 dwelling units we compared the two empty parking lots to this, the maximum building that you could build. So, instead of the 41 dwelling units that you saw in the plans, we actually looked at the maximum that you could build, which is 50 dwelling units, and then we also assumed that other sites in that area would also develop. Because of the rezoning which I see, everyone is kind of concerned. You know some of the neighboring lots would build, so we actually worked with the city to develop a full build out of what would reasonably be built and so traffic. Actually, according to the secret technical Manual, which is seeker, the city, environmental quality review it actually, so it screens out. But so I started seeing some of the comments pop up in the Q&A that people were concerned about traffic. So I actually just now when everyone was talking, I ran like a preliminary traffic analysis for you and just kind of using, I guess generic, I guess, dwelling units and local retail, which is what we assumed for the ground floor for this building. It would actually generate about 10 vehicle trips in the morning eight in the afternoon and then ten more in the evening, just using standard factors. You know, assuming that people would take, some people would take cars, some people would take bus, some people would take subway and those factors are actually taken from representative samples of Ferris and the community district 10, and so that's what people have reported in the most recent census, or I think the most recent 2014- 2018 American Community survey, and so people from that area have reported and said. This is how I travel to work. This is how I travel in the afternoon, and so when you run that through the simulation, the the transportation model, it comes up with 10 trips in the morning and then that's which is actually very far below what the city requires like a detailed analysis for, and so that's what was compared with what exists right now and what could be built at the maximum capacity under this rezoning. Okay, hey! Thank you. Robert, let's see, Anthony Mourinho has his hands up. Hey thanks, Richard. I have a very simple question: if none of this rezoning happens- and you can't build this residential building, the only option is a hotel, correct. I'd say that the most likely option is a hotel, because there's I got like that's fine, no, that's perfect right. The most likely option is a hotel, so there's others there's a die. There's plans and materials. I mean this is he's, got permits yeah, no, I'm just trying to like, simplify it to really like the most like what I ever like. All. This is a great conversation, but really it's like a rental building where people can live or a hotel, and so I that's. I just want to just kind of make it a little bit more black and white, and thank you. Thank you. Dean your hand is still up. Is that because you have a new question, or did you forget to take it down you're on Mutine? It's down, okay, doris. I see no more hands raised here. Oh Barbara has her hand raised. I'm sorry Barbara, I think Dean's suggestion is good. Go for this, throw it back to city planning, see what they say, because the congestion aspect is tremendous. Thank you. I think we know historically that just approving this lot is not going to happen. Maybe we just want to do something with options say we would like them to consider reducing the number of locks. Anthony is your hand back up again, yeah, sorry, yeah, so Doris to go with that. You know I all right. I say you know. Maybe we go with Dean, we go for. You know a hail mary and say listen. We seem most concerned with the buildings on 92nd street. So maybe we go from the building the lot in question down to the corner and then those buildings that are next to it say you know if you could reduce those, at least so that it's off 92nd street and keep it just to the avenue. Then that'll reduce the number of buildings affected by the rezoning and then we won't have a spot zoning and maybe that that's the option, but I think you know anything asking for anything less than that is going to be, I think, problematic, and you know in terms of being spot zoning. Sorry thank you. Laurie Morris hands up, you have to unmute, okay, I just I am muted. Thank you just because I see. I know that this is the committee discussion, but I do see many comments going back and forth, and so I was hoping that maybe we could give some clarification for those who are listening in if we kept so that what the current zoning would permit in the lots that surround this development site, for which we are considering this application, how big they could build up or what they could build if the residential units that are now non- conforming were knocked down compared to what they could build if this area were rezoned so that everyone understands what the law permits, because we do not get to say hey. This is what we want and we have Carte Blanche to restrict people from using their properties within what the law provides, which is the zoning. So if we could just get a clear understanding for everyone of what the current zoning would permit for those adjoining lots and what it would permit if they were re- zoned, so everyone really understands what we're dealing with. That would be great. Well, the current zoning only allows commercial development, so if anything were to change, it would have to be commercial right, but in terms of height in terms of is really, I think when people are concerned about the scale yeah Dorothy's going to get the book but off the top of my head. I know the c8. The community facilities capped at 70 feet the commercial she's going to pull out the fars. I do not know if Richard has them handy, but we're going to we're going to pull them. I just wrote it down Richardson, so the commercial far is two: the community facility, far caps out at three excuse: building caps out of 4.8 and and in case anyone is interested and needs to sleep. Well tonight you can look in the zoning resolution. It's section 114- 11. Thank you sure. The only caveat I would say in the special Bay Ridge District, for if it's not a commercial use exclusively community facility, there is a height restriction of 70 feet correct. So that's the Bay Ridge special district text limits the community facility portion to three, but the the total far for a community facility building and is just a 4.8. Thank you. I'm thoroughly confused. It's confusing. You know I actually looked at the numbers when we were just thinking about on Keith's site and it's that it's that using those ratios. The current proposal is forty. Five thousand three hundred square feet at nine stories. The existing as of right, zoning for a mixed- use, commercial and community facility building would be 47,280 square feet at seven stories. So you end up with a slightly bulkier building and a hotel. I do not know. That's the whole. That's the hotel right! Okay, the hotel is occupied, the hotel was a was a was at a 2far, so the commercial would cap out for the hotel at roughly 20,000 square feet, so a hotel could be a portion of another building, but the hotel that was proposed here was a 20,000 square. Foot six- story hotel, okay, so I just wanted everyone to get an idea of. You know the size of the building when people are saying say no to this. You know just you have to compare it to well. What else could possibly be there within the limits of the law and to understand what our function here is. So I just wanted most. You know people in the public and the community to understand what our function here is and really that we operate within the zoning laws. We can't just willy- nilly, tell people yes and know what they can do with their property. All the time is not it true that the richard that the top two stories of the of the residential building are also set back correct. The top two stories are set back so that the appearance from the ground would be seven stories, which would be the same as the hotel correct just to add, because of because this has been a great conversation for me personally, but I just want everyone to know 92nd street, because there's been some discussion on that side. The property is a through property, so there is a portion on 92nd street it. You know there are three additional buildings to the to the west of the property, but the property. It's like when you look at that l, the rezoning for the l there's like a portion that juts out and then there's the tail end of the l on 92nd- is not the applicant's problem right so, but beyond the tail, it's kind of like a square almost from the 92nd street portion and fifth avenue, and then there were three additional property. I think that Stephanie was referring to is that kind of creates that additional area which is really more of a mid block? You know you know, we've always looked at. You know when we look at the commercial Overlays in the district. You know the contextual zoning there's typically, you know off the Avenue 100 feet, 150 feet the overlapping of the you know: Fifth Avenue, the Avenue Zoning and the mid block has always been a little bit different in terms of height and bulk and density, which I guess, which is you know, hearing what Stephanie and Dean were saying that extended area onto 97th street really distinguishes it and it's be kind of more square. If you limited it to the end portion of the property to Fifth Avenue lori, do you have your hand up again or you did not take it down? Okay dollars, I guess I'll turn it back to you. Okay, Robert is your hand up again, so we had Barbara have her hand up. I'm sorry dory I was Barbara. Do you mean to have your hand up, or did you forget to take it down? Okay, I'm going to move along and Barbara can interrupt me if we need it. We have discussed this several times, as I repeat, as I said in two reports, we're between a rock and a hard place. We've had some input. We will go through some of the comments to see if there's anything more, that's pressing. Does anyone want to make a motion, as I said, do we want to make a motion to advise to see if we can shrink the zoning area yeah? So before I make the actual more, I could make the motion then we could discuss it. So my motion would be that we approve the developers plans for the residential building and disapprove the additional the expanded zoning, as presented by the Department of City planning that I know that the zone, the zoning change only that the additional properties be removed from the zoning change, which will give us just the residential building. Well, I mean we have to reword it, but that's what that's what I suggest we do and what Richard said before was. Actually you know pretty good news. It has been done. I wonder if we could take his motion and change it to maybe specific addresses that we are looking to in 92nd street that we would want removed from so being a little bit more specific with it. I think that if we flat out ask for approval of one and rejection of all the others, well Anthony you're, referring to those three properties on 92nd street yeah, I do not have a map in front yeah. I do not know the address is off the top of my head. I only suggest I only suggesting that maybe we'd be a little bit more specific because I feel like if we just ask for what really kind of looks like a spot zoning. They might sort of, reject it outright. What's the alternative, I do not understand the alternative that you're seeing so well, so maybe looking at specific addresses or no, I guess Anthony- I just want to clarify so dean. What Richard was saying that the rezoning area, the building affronts both 5th Avenue and 92nd street, so you can not restrict you can't restrict- and I think Josh had mentioned- that and others that would be limiting. Just a lot would be considered spot zoning and what we were kind of talking about what anthony was saying is squaring it off, so that you do have that section of the building on 92nd street and the front of fifth avenue almost like a square and kind of just eliminating that mid block of 92nd street the three properties there. That would not be my motion because we saw the same problem with those with those with those additional lots. I say we just go for only the developers project. Let city planning, do what they're going to do: okay, Steve, Unmute yourself! Why am I doing that because your hand, your hands up, oh my hand, should be down? Oh come on Steve. You got something brewing so anyway, we would need a second to the motion anyway before we, I have a question one last question for Richard Labelle. Is there Richard? Please there are two. There are two eulip reference numbers 447,448 why? The way that rezonings have gone since 2016 is that you've got the primary application, which is for the actual rezoning from ca2 to r7ac24, and then you have a text. Amendment application to map the affected area as a mandatory inclusionary housing area so that any residential development there moving forward would need to be affordable, housing or include affordable housing. So it's just it's just the rezoning and the text. Amendment. Okay, thank you. I've been meaning to ask that for a month and I could be of service. Okay, thank you. Okay, so you know I would make the motion even a little bit simpler. Maybe we would make it that we approve the request for the residential building. Only I do not have my hand up. Do you want to put it up? Oh I'm. I just wanted. I just saying my fear is when we phrase it like that is that they say no yeah and you know we've approved it and then, as a result of that, we lose the you know the we throw out the baby with the Bath board all here. The primary goal here more than anything else, is to make sure it's not a hotel. The developers have worked with us to this point and while I do not mind something that would be advisory along the lines of, but we approve of this, but we would like the city planning to look and see if there's some way that they can cut back on the on the 92nd street. But I think we should say what, but otherwise we approved, but we do believe that you know. I think that it should be an addendum and but outright. We should say yes that we approve the the request, because otherwise I fear that somewhere along the line here we're going to lose this and as Richard points out, they literally have Richard. Tell me if I'm wrong that you actually can get those permits in a matter of no time correct. Yeah I mean you can go on the website on Dlb's website. There's a zoning diagram approved, he's yeah, he's ready to pull permits yeah, and so I'm very concerned that, by what I consider at this point diddling around about this right, I mean I do not mind in any way shape or form of saying that we would like to city planning if there's any way that they could cut back on those over there. Yes, but we approve of it. Nonetheless, why do not we do this? That we we approve of the the developers requests for the residential building, but disapprove of the additional zoning plots that are that are included so we're saying outright. We approve of the residential aspect of it, I think, a dean. If I'm not wrong here, you can't just say that we approve the residential aspect of it, because it's not in a residential zone. Right now, we have to say that we approve something about the zoning if we do not say that we're proving something about the zoning we're saying well, we do not want that zoning. It's basically that equivalent saying we do not want the zoning, but we approve of the residence and to say fine, but you can't build it in that zone, so I think we're kind of stuck here. We have to make the determination. Do we want the hotel? Do we want to do? We want the residential building? I see many of the questions that people are asking out there and I know that Beatrice next door. I know other people are saying that this is you know, going to be very large in that kind of thing, but what's going to be built is going to be larger, all right, it's going to that can be built there. So all the arguments about fire. All the arguments about you know like we, you know it's a big building. They all disappear because the building that will be built. If we do not do this is going to be a larger building. That will be a commercial building under those circumstances, I think we have to say that we approve the new zoning. It does not mean that we can't ask them to cut the zoning, but it has to be phrased in terms yeah. I agree, I agree with Steve. I think it it's important to try to scale it back, but ultimately a residential building, I think, is going to be better than a transient hotel that when it's vacant it's going to be turned into. Who knows what and then it's going to be a whole other can of worms. At least we have a developer who's going to own. The building people are going to live in the neighborhood, become a part of the community. Hopefully- and you know so, yeah, let's see if we, if we can request to scale it back. So could we word it? Then we approve a result. The zoning change for the proposed residential building, but disapprove of any changes for any additional zoning lots. I think what everybody what people are saying is no that phrasing it that way is not going it is it's not getting support from the committee yeah, it's functionally equivalent to saying that we approve the zoning, but we do not and there's the problem. I mean I you can you can make like I'm saying you can, if you want to add some kind of a statement to it, that we approve the zoning. We appreciate it if the city could look at it and see if they could cut it down on 92nd street. That's the right approach. I can't see anything else. Working. Well, listen! I disagree, but I've made my case and I'm going to withdraw the motion, but I think it's a mistake not including it in the motion. Well the problem with it. If I can just say it dean if we prove it in the motion and they disapprove it, then we have to go through this process again. I am not sure that the developer will be will look upon that kindly, and so I think that we have to look at where we are. We are caught between a rock and a hard place and I think that we have to pick one or the other and I'm going to pick the hard place because it's often in the rock, in my opinion, okay and I understand what you're trying to do Dean. I want that yeah completely agreed Dean, we understand. Okay, so Dean has removed yeah go ahead, Steve go for it. No, I was because then we can discuss it. I would just move that we approve the application as written okay and that, in addition to approving the application, is written that we asked the the Dm to compose a letter asking that, while we approve, we would appreciate it if they could look at it and see if they could reduce or in some way eliminate, I'm not sure, quite what the word would be, but in some way reduce the the impact of the zoning on 92nd street, reduce the size on 92nd street yes or skip maybe scale back right back. Okay, you need a second yeah. I second that okay, thanks Anthony. Thank you any comments. Yeah. I would. I would just say that maybe sorry, no real quick that maybe we actually look at addresses and include the addresses of what we're that would be fun. Okay, yeah! That's all yeah somebody writing down the yeah, I'm writing it down. Dorothy, and I were writing we're writing. We got it. I have a third of it. Okay, all right we're voting we're discussing. Could we just write it? Could we read it back, so we all know what we're voting on. So it's a motion to approve the euler application. That's presented before us, I'm not going to read the numbers as written, that's written and additionally, we will request the department for city planning to look at the possibility of reducing the size or scale back the impact, no reduce the size of scale back 92nd street portion of the rezoning application. Yes, and we have a second right who's, this anthony did it okay, Madam Chair. Do you want to pull the paper? Can we just raise our hands? You want to raise your hands, so I could see you all in favor, okay, so I have Michael yes, Anthony Barbara, Steve, Stephanie, Susan and way oh hi. Thank you. Okay, opposed Dean, okay, recusals motion carries abstentions. Okay motion carries. Thank you all. Thank you very much, so good job, great job, thanks guys. Yes, yeah, it's a rough one, richard thanks for everything. Thanks for the information, I just want to add to everyone. So this will be on the agenda for the November 16th General board meeting in the public hearing section of the meeting. I want to thank everyone for attending and we will also be looking at if there are any additional questions that come in we'll certainly pass them along to Richard or to the committee to wherever they're appropriate. So thank you. I would just before we sign off, because I see that Aina is still on from the borough president's office, and I would like you to know just be our caveat. The we approve it, but we would like to have it reviewed and have those lots looked at and when, because the borough president is having his public hearing before the full board meets hey, I absolutely understand that and if you would like to have a consultation with Richard Barrick director of land use, oh any of these issues were absolutely available to assist you. Thank you. Thank you. So much, okay, Josephine! Thank you. Thank you very welcome. Thank you Doris. Thank you. Everyone thank you dude. So we have. We need a motion to Adjourn. I guess right I make. I make a motion to Adjourn, say good night Zoe hi good night zoey good night.
