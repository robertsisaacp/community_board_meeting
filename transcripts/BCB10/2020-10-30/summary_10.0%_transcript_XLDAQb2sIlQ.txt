If your question or comments have already been raised, we ask that you know when you do not, when you're called upon you'll have the option to pass me your speaking time if that works, and since this is a formal process of part of the City Council's, the uniform land use review procedure, we will only be discussing this site today.
The zoning map here, as we've discussed before, is the properties located within a c82 district within the Bay Ridge special district, Ca2 district permits, automotive uses, intensive commercial uses does not permit residential.
The zoning district would travel along fifth Avenue as well as 92nd street, and would encompass roughly 11 to 12 properties.
You can see that the zoning district boundary roughly equates to the land use in that corner, which is currently there's two empty lots: vacant lots which are owned by the applicant and then there's about eight or nine additional lots and those lots are multi- family or have some sort of mixed use.
There would be a one, story, commercial portion which would carry through on the 92nd street side as well as through to Fifth Avenue, and then the the bulk of the building.
The ca2 under the existing Bay Ridge special district regulations, would allow anywhere from a three to a 4.8, far for current building types, with a maximum height of roughly 70 feet.
His plan was to build a hotel and because of a an unfortunate blind spot in the 2004 special Bay Ridge District Zoning law.
So I'm thankful that he was willing to work with us to to not build a hotel but to build to build housing and to get some affordable units out of it as well, which we desperately need so Look I'll, say: threading, the needle between preserving our existing small town, neighborhood character.
Building, that's going to be if it goes, through, I'm not against it at all, but I just want to present that Bay Ridge is tight and that is a very concerned.
However, I have a big concern about the rezoning of the adjacent lots, because if you see this one in two years from now, you have you have two construction sites, just waiting right next door to it on either side And, then you're going to be building seven stories on that side and seven stories on the other side, and that's not going to be very good for Bay Ridge.
It's, going to really give in a heck of a lot of congestion ,, there's no parking facilities, available, nothing, and So I, like Bay Ridge in its current form and a seven- story, building.
One short block from the R- line: subway station minutes from the Verrazano bridge , Brooklyn Queens expressway in the belt parkway available now up to 31,500 square feet of aaa retail medical office school space in a brand new elevator and spring and sprinklered commercial building with parking.
It's like having a you, know: 100 square foot, parcel on the gas station piece which can be developed residential , it's just for all practical purposes, there's nothing that can be put there pursuant to the new zoning.
Somebody else wanted to develop them pursuant to the new zoning they'd be able to you, know It's as part and parcel of the resulting city.
A proposed building is that complies with zoning And they're, not able to you know, they're, not able to get around DOB permitting requirements merely by giving plants to city planning They're going to have to show DOB that they're, using the appropriate amount of floor area for the for the proposed district I just want to let everyone know that zoning exists and we, the community board, do not have the power to tell people what they can do with their property and that this is a limited review and there are zoning laws in place, and We are discussing this because the community does not want a hotel at that site.
When you talk about density and everything around that traffic congestion, etc, there was going to be a 65-room hotel here, And, you can imagine what that would engender versus a 41 person, residential building ,, it's like when we when we hand this to the environmental consultants who are available to us this evening, They look at what you can do as of right versus what you can do under the proposed zoning, and when you show this city planning and the environmental and assessment review division.
You said that at the request of city planning, you enlarged the area and included all the other lots like 11 or something it done.
We basically are required to come up with a land use rationale, including zoning district boundary and then at the end of the day, city, planning.
All of those in the applicant's development site have residential in them and so for city, planning.
You know, is an appropriate rezoning area and sometimes when it gets to city planning or the council, that the zoning district boundaries changed.
They're going to do, I know it says it's a spot zone, but it's not city planning asking for a spot.
Yeah going down, 91st street would have involved if I'm, if I'm understanding from fourth to The. The properties that are to the north of us and to the northwest of us are all none of them are residential and so rezoning them to mixed use.
If we want to try to limit the additional lots, we should consider a motion approving only the developer's site and not the rest of the sites, and then let city planning do what they wanted to do.
Existing c82 carries with it a maximum floor area ratio, far of 4.8 in the Bay Ridge special district you're limited to three for community facility, uses.
Instead of the 41 dwelling units that you saw in the plans, we actually looked at the maximum that you could build, which is 50 dwelling units, and then we also assumed that other sites in that area would also develop.
I know that this is the committee discussion, but I do see many comments going back and forth, and so I was hoping that maybe we could give some clarification for those who are listening in if we kept so that what the current zoning would permit in the lots that surround this development, site, for which we are considering this application, how big they could build up or what they could build.
If the residential units that are now non- conforming were knocked down compared to what they could build, if this area were rezoned so that everyone understands what the law permits, because we do not get to say, hey This is what we want and we have Carte Blanche to restrict people from using their properties within what the law provides, which is the zoning.
I actually looked at the numbers when we were just thinking about on Keith's site The existing as of right, zoning for a mixed, use, commercial and community facility building would be 47,280 square feet at seven stories.
You know there are three additional buildings to the to the west of the property, but Is, not the applicant's problem right so, but beyond the tail, it's kind of like a square almost from the 92nd street portion and fifth avenue, and then there were three additional property.
What Stephanie and Dean were saying that extended area onto 97th street really distinguishes it Do we want to make a motion to advise to see if we can shrink the zoning area My motion would be that we approve the developers plans for the residential building and disapprove the additional the expanded zoning, as presented by the Department of City planning.
What Richard was saying that the rezoning area, the building affronts both 5th Avenue and 92nd street.
The developers have worked with us to this point and, while I do not mind something that would be advisory along the lines of, but we approve of this, but we would like the city planning to look and see if there's some way that they can cut back on the on the 92nd street.
There's a zoning diagram, approved, he's yeah, And, so I'm very concerned that, by what I consider at this point, diddling around about this right, I mean I, do not mind in any way shape or form of saying that we would like to city planning if there's any way that they could cut back on those over there.
We we approve of the the developers requests for the residential building, but disapprove of the additional zoning plots that are that are included.
That, will be a commercial building under those circumstances, I think we have to say that we approve the new zoning.
We will request the department for city planning to look at the possibility of reducing the size or scale back the impact, no reduce the size of scale back 92nd street portion of the rezoning application.
