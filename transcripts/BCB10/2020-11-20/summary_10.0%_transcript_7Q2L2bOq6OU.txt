We have one item on tonight's agenda and that is that the New York City Department of transportation will be in attendance to present its safety improvement proposal for 7th and 8th avenues in sunset, Park from 69th street to 65th street.
And we're here today to discuss our preliminary findings and proposal for the safety improvements on 7Th Ave and 8Th Ave from 39th street to 65th, as was mentioned before, as you may, or may not know, 8Th avenue in our 2019 vision.
Our agency rejected the proposal, but we this time we took a fresh look from a safety perspective and the opportunities that it could provide us if we did convert the the streets to one a one-way pair, and we believe that this is a good path forward for safety improvements, but not just safety.
These corridors are also located within the borough, Park senior, Pedestrian focus area and a vision, zero priority area due to the high rate of seniors pedestrians being injured in this area and pedestrians in general, in the kind of greater Sunset Park Community Eighth Avenue, is partially within, is within a bike.
We, see a lot of failure to fail to yield right turns to cyclists, which is often because they're trying to kind of squeeze in between moving vehicles and parked cars, as well as a lot of mid-block crashes, again partially, due to them having to go around all the stopped vehicles and the breakdown and how the streets function.
The b70 bus as well as charter buses, and the b70 is so ineffective that when we talked initially to the MTA about the idea of one-way pairs on this street, they were, they were actually quite supportive of that proposal.
We're, also looking to reduce congestion and improve safety at and around 65th street and 7Th Avenue, and we're going to look to further address the crash history on these corridors by implementing additional traffic calming elements, roadway, organization, curbside controls and mobility, improvements that we're able to do because of the one-way conversions.
The reason that we're excited about them is because it's really a substantial safety improvement that directly addresses the crash history of 7th and 8th avenues by eliminating the two-way traffic on these streets.
And, really that predictability, and that reduction of conflict is really what we're looking for as the main kind of thing driving the safety improvements on these corridors.
When we do these one-way conversions, we kind of get to look at the streets are new and think about how we can use all of this space to most of to most effectively get people safely and quick efficiently through the the neighborhood.
It allows for the addition of a safe, dedicated space for cyclists to connect to the 7Th Avenue South protected bike lane that was installed by DOT.
It allows us to look at new load and right new loading regulations to address double parking and loading on the corridors, and again it's we're looking to with the elimination of two-way traffic.
If one we're kind of looking to convert this long of a stretch of streets to one-way pairs, it's going to have effects on real on 65th street, which has always been a challenge and 65th between 7th and 8th avenue, as well as all the surrounding streets.
So we're looking in our proposal to minimize the impacts on the street network while making improvements to vehicle processing, and.
And, now I just kind of want to go through the Ben, especially focusing on this kind of congested area at the southern end of the corridor, around 65th street, and kind of talk about why this conversion helps it.
The proposed design with these one-way pairs is going to reduce the total northbound volumes at 65th street and 7Th avenue, because vehicles are no longer going to be able to go north at 7Th. We anticipate that vehicles are going to reroute over to 8Th avenue before they get to 65th street, so whether that's going over on 71St Bay, Ridge, Ave, 67Th, Street, or just going diverting right to 8Th Avenue.
In addition, by having these one-way conversions, you're, removing Thr possible movements at the intersection, the northbound through the eastbound left and the westbound rights, and by doing that you're, reducing the total vehicle movements and reducing conflicts and therefore.
We've got collected data for the intersection and found that two-thirds of the northbound vehicles currently are already turning at 65th street and 7Th Avenue.
It actually leads to additional congestion and safety concerns around 65th street and 7Th avenue.
We would be actually increasing the vehicle volumes and conflicts at six at seventh, Avenue and 65th street, because we would be rerouting both northbound nor all northbound vehicles to that intersection, driving up the volumes and driving up the turn volumes considerably, especially as you can kind of see in this map.
It reduces congestion and improves safety at 65th street and 7Th Avenue.
I have visual issues, sometimes because I can't even imagine redirecting traffic on 7Th Avenue heading northbound, because currently there's such a heavy volume, you know so for the board.
Members on the call community, Board 10 is 7th avenue from about I, would say 66th street in this, and we go about to the railroad cut right of way.
I mean I, don't know if it's stoop line permits, it seems like a lot of bad behavior that extends beyond the normal stoop line and creates such congestion on the sidewalk that almost forces pedestrians into the street.
That would keep those trucks at least off of eighth Avenue, but totally hear that I hear that concern and we can look into how we could minimize that also the truck route ends at 65Th street right, so the northbound.
It's, still one way, I'm, sorry in our portion of the district 7Th Avenue until 65Th street right, because that's when the change would occur.
What I'm saying is that if now there's a backup, because now you're going to have really traffic coming southbound on 7th Avenue, which will converge on 65th street right, because the new 7th Avenue will be southbound Tiker heights in our district is northbound until 65th street.
My concern is: Would that traffic then go to 8Th avenue to kind of come.
If, there's an inability to make that left turn because traffic is now making a right from 7Th Avenue from Sunset Park and a left from Diker heights onto 65th street.
I mean do you think a lot of it's coming up from the neighborhood on Seventh Avenue.
You did mention that, like your concerns with safety, were about due to the unpredictability and the street function and really where there are some things that are out of our control, and you know the crowded conditions are still going to exist and the loading and unloading is still going to exist.
You, know shut down the street as it kind of is now, and also expanding pedestrian space bicycle facilities.
This is a safety first kind of proposal, because on our little stretch of ninth Avenue, where Ps69 is located, we did a one-way conversion and daily that is violated daily still, today, wow.
I would just wonder about how the community up there is going to adjust to it, because they've had their own way along eighth avenue for all of these years and with the double parking, the sidewalks, completely cluttered, and oil.
You know it's going to be in the bike lane, because right now it was in the street.
