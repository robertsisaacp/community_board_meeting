So, what's happening now, michael with the state liquor authority, is that establishments that are licensed where they file their new york city DOT application to be outdoors Only to that area, So I'm going to read to you some of our usual stipulations, which then, if you agree so we say we will deny your application unless you agree to the following, and that is usual with what we do So. The motion that I present to this board right now is that we deny this application unless the following stipulations are agreed to, the premises will operate as a restaurant, The certificate of occupancy will be held, the owner or manager will be on site during all hours of operation.
There will be no smoking permitted, and the applicant agrees that shouldn't change its method of operation, that it will give notice and meet with the community board, and the committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change so and that would be it.
Beer cider in this restaurant The application states that they will not have any promoters, but there is no outdoor usage and I believe there is a question regarding the building department and the ceo to convert this to a restaurant The last one on file is for the furniture store that this zoning district does permit eating and drinking establishments and that there was an attempt in 2016 to make those changes to a restaurant, but yet that permit was revoked for some reason, which I don't know we checked in with buildings, but we don't have that answer yet What we do know is that a needing a drinking establishment can open here and I would imagine there needs to be follow up with the owner, either correcting the permit or getting a letter of no objection from the building's department.
There will be no smoking permitted, and the applicant agrees that, should it change its method of operation, it will give notice and meet with the community boarding committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change.
