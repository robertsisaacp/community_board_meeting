Good to see everyone, although our first establishment is Bhati Brothers Corp, B-, H-, a-, t- t-, I located at 6752 4th Avenue the owner is haroon Iqbal. This is a new application for a beer and cider license going through this application. First of all, there is no outdoor area. There will be only background recorded music. Their hours of operation will be seven days a week, Sunday through Monday 6 A.M to 1:00 A.M. There is no rear yard use there in the application, also states that there is of course only background, so there's no dj no promoters and the application is complete. There's photos say the menu, the Cfo and everything seems to be in order, but I do have a question for the owner or manager. Is that Sarah? Did you say? No, it's Neil is on the my client's on the phone, but he's trying to go into zoom hold on. Maybe I can harun. Can I just maybe put you going to hello? Can you hear me and also you know what Harris studios has? I do not know who's on? If it's mark or not, we do. I did. I did send over a powerpoint, I do not know if you were able to put it up hi. Yes, this is Alexandra hi, Alexandra, powerpoint and also you know, I've lost you you're on mute. Oh, I do have the powerpoint. Would you like it on now yeah? I think we'll put it up so board. Members could just see the location and then Neil, I think, he's trying to get his clients on the phone. Okay go to the okay right there. I guess we could leave it there for now. So this is the location everyone, but this is the question that I have and it's fairly simple, because in the old picture it had like a deli like H, n Delhi and then the establishment corporation name in the application that I could see, says body Brothers corporation, but the menu, and you see the new awning says bees. So I just want a clarification as to what the name of this establishment will be. It's going to be body, Brothers Corp I mean. Has the canopy changed the canopy and everything has changed. This was the time that I actually went to the location when it was actually still. You know there was a renovation. Okay, I noticed on your menu. You have like the bees Hamburger. So that's what I'm confused about is this the trade name and the corporation name is body brothers yeah. The core question name is that's the corporation and the trade name is B's deli sure. Yet what is it going to be? But at the moment that's what I was using. I it's not very clear: what did he say? Somebody tried yeah, so he said that he's still not sure what the name is going to be. Okay, because I saw on the menu you have like the bees hamburger. Okay, that's why I was confused. I mean, obviously I made this application literally about three months ago, so anytime. At that time I just wanted a menu from so I can make the application okay but other than the word bees is that representative of what your menu will be? Yes, okay, great. If we go to the no. I just wanted to. I had a slide presentation, so I'm just showing everyone that just portions of the application that there's going to be recorded music, but no outdoor use is yes in the method of operation. I've got about 20 chairs, five cables, no bar, nothing, okay and the so this is kind of the interior. Is that going to remain the same? Yes, it's going to remain the same. Okay, we go. The and the hours of operation are six again to one, I'm sorry. What are the hours our operation hours are that we put down six to one am six, am to one am okay and we were just talking about the menu. It seems pretty simple: okay, that's the next one we'll hold there. So this is not your location Barbara! I did speak to the 68th precinct before the call. There is no adverse history at this location. There are no one calls pertaining to the operation of any prior establishments at this location. So I wanted the committee to know that. Okay, is there any questions from anybody from the board? Hey Barbara, it's Michael just out of curiosity because of what's going on over the past few months, with Covid-19 and outdoor dining and so on. Do we need to talk to the owners about if they're setting up outside or anything of that sort, or it does not really make a difference? That's not in our hands and they separately right. So what's happening now. Michael with the state Liquor Authority is that establishments that are licensed where they file their New York City DOT application to be outdoors. There is a like one form SLA, which gives them temporary authority to expand use only to that area. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome any of the board members good from Neil. Anything else. You'd like to add to this. No, I do not okay well. What is our usual procedure for most establishments is that we deny the request unless some a series of stipulations, a series of agreements are made, which we eventually bring before the board in about 10 days. So I'm going to read to you some of our usual stipulations, which then, if you agree so we say we will deny your application unless you agree to the following, and that is usual with what we do and you will see that they basically are pretty much standard. So the motion that I present to this board right now is that we deny this application unless the following stipulations are agreed to, the premises will operate as a restaurant. The certificate of occupancy will be held, the owner or manager will be on site during all hours of operation. The hours of operation for this establishment will be 6 A.M to 1 A.M. The applicant will not sublet the premise. The doors and windows are to remain closed in coordination with any amplified music. The background recorded music remain below the level permitted by the New York City Noise Code. There will be no music on the outside of the premises. The licensee shall not use any promoter or have promoted events. There will be no smoking permitted and the applicant agrees that should not change its method of operation, that it will give notice and meet with the Community Board and the committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change. So and that would be it neil. So you agree to those stipulations. Yes, okay, josephine! Will you do a roll call? Yes, I will so you actually. You need a second barbara somebody. Okay, can I have somebody second that motion I dude okay, Nick seconds now I'm going to take the role Barbara Velucci, yes, Judy Collins is Judy on the phone. Okay, Chris Ellison. Am I saying your name right: Chris, yeah, Ellison, that's right! Yes, okay, Michael, Festa, yes, Marty Lentz, yes, Nick Leonardo's, yes, Ryan Mahoney, yes, Ruth, Mazer, yes, Susan Pulaski! Did I miss anyone who's on the call? Okay, I think that was it. So motion carries okay. Well, thank you! Bonnie brothers, thank you Neil and you are invited to join us at our full board meeting right, zoom. Yes, we're going to be on zoom again neil. If you want to come. That would be great in case there were any questions from the full board and we'll send you the zoom information we do not have it yet, but that will be Monday the 24th at 7.. Okay. Thank you great. Thank you. Okay! Thank you. Neil. Okay, next up great, the next establishment is cali Tejas T- a- j- a- d- a- S corporation located at 241 Bay Ridge Avenue, the owner is Diego a garcia, and this is a new application for wine beer cider. In this restaurant, the hours of operation Monday through Friday is 8:00 A.M to 8 P.M, Saturday, 8 A.M to 9:00 P.M and Sunday 9:00 A.M to 9:00 P.M. They will have background music. The application states that they will not have any promoters, but there is no outdoor usage. There are menus, there are photos and there is a floor plan and I passed by the store. It is a very small establishment, Josephine right, it's yeah, that's small and you're, saying that this was originally a furniture store. There is it's fully attached with the very small storefront doorway, so I guess originally it was seeable for oh yeah there. It is furniture and warehouse there. You go right in front of me, yeah and the owner plans to convert this to an eating and drinking establishment. Now the owners are here- and I believe there is a question regarding the building department and the CEO to convert this to a restaurant. Do we have any further information regarding this right? Now is the applicant on yes, I'm here: okay, so hi? How are you so? What so? What we found out today in doing our research is that there is a certificate of occupancy. The last one on file is for the furniture store that this zoning district does permit eating and drinking establishments and that there was an attempt in 2016 to make those changes to a restaurant, but yet that permit was revoked for some reason, which I do not know we checked in with buildings, but we do not have that answer yet. So what we do know is that a needing a drinking establishment can open here and I would imagine there needs to be follow up with the owner, either correcting the permit or getting a letter of no objection from the building's department correct. Yes, I was actually concerned about that. I noticed that when somebody from your office just called me- and I did not notice the letter that said all the noticing below and then I also mentioned the owner- that he's a new owner just now he's just reasonable for, like, I would say less than a year and then as far he knows back in 2014, the first very first peninsula took over the place. Yes, he was trying to convert a restaurant and then, as far as he's known, there was a sign- off for the fire suppression system, and then I was actually was not sure whether or not to apply for a letter, no objection first to come for the meeting. If that's required or not, I have no problem asking for lno with the apartment buildings and clarified that with them, if they can provide me, one just to certify is even a different establishment inside right, so I mean the the ABC law when you, when you submit your liquor license, application does require a certificate of occupancy that does reflect an eating and drinking establishment. So it's going to be questioned, I mean no doubt by the state liquor authority. We take a look at it when we do an application. You know to make sure that the zoning is properly is. You know, is right because we've had times where zoning did not permit eating and drinking establishments, but in this case you know it is not a c1 district eating and drinking establishments are part of the youth group. So there's no problem there at all, but I would believe that you are going to need to make this correction either the lno or the or fix whatever you know, needs to be adjusted in order to correct the situation with the buildings department. Yes, that's correct. Yes, I wanted to make sure coming to the meeting to make sure that was required. As far as I know, the liquor authority. Every time I go application, I double check the co I'll make sure that zoning is a problem for eating a drinking establishment, and I just wanted to confirm with your office as well. If that was appropriate before I submit the application, many restaurants, sometimes they have commercial store that is probably sewn for a restaurant. Sometimes we're not saying the CEO there's a restaurant, it's a commercial establishment, some sort like a store. In that particular case. I know there was like a furniture store garage just somewhere in the first floor, so yeah. So if that is that you'll require for me, ella know, I will do so next week when the apartment buildings to make those changes. Okay, also Barbara- I wanted to let you know. I did speak to the precinct about this establishment. There is no adverse history here, no 311 complaints and no issues from the district office. Writing this down. Okay, so that's Sandra! Right, yes, correct! Okay! Is there anything else? You want to tell us about your business. Well, pretty much, it's the first time he ever applied for a beyond one license. This is the type of venture that he dares to do because through the Kobe 19, he was trying to expand the business again with the beer. Wine is probably going to increase more his his business and more income wise. As far as I know having to bring wine, he can do it to go only for beer, and I know, though, there's going to be like indoor dining to be around 25% capacity, hopefully by September 30 by over and formal, but yes, we're going to keep a very familiar establishment, but they intend to close very early the hours that we stipulated on the application. There's going to be a colombian restaurant, very family oriented. As you know, there have been no complaint regarding noise, so we're not proposing that type of environment for the neighborhood, and we know there's a lot of houses around the block, so we're not intending to have that type of loud music or environment like that right. It's a residential block. Yes, anybody from the board anything you'd like to say: ask question: no okay, saying that yes, Ruth yeah: what is the capacity? We only have two tables eight chairs and three employees. I would say the capacitor is less than 10 people inside yeah. The CEO is between 15 and 20 people. That can, you know, be standing in there, but it's very displacement. Anyone else. Okay, hearing there is no other questions sandra Likey, our last establishment. We basically present the recommendation of the board in form of a negative okay. We will deny the application unless you will agree and of course, Josephine will contact you to sign off on the following stipulations. Okay and yours are basically the same as the last except for the letter from the department of buildings. Correct now, I'm going to say propose a motion to the board that we deny this application. Unless the owner Stipula agrees to the following stipulations, the premises will operate as a restaurant, with a certificate of occupancy be acquired and then a letter of no objection from the department of buildings be approved. The owner or manager will be on site during all hours of operation and the hours of operation are the following: 8 A.M to 8 P.M Monday through Friday 8 A.M, to 9:00 P.M Saturday, and on Sunday it's 9 A.M to 9:00 p.m. The applicant will not supply the premise. The doors and windows are to remain closed in coordination with any amplified music. The background recorded music remain below the level permitted by the New York City Noise Code. There will be no music on the outside of the premises. The licensee shall not have or use any promoter or promoted events. There will be no smoking permitted and the applicant agrees that, should it change its method of operation, it will give notice and meet with the community boarding committee at least 45 days in advance of any such change. Will you agree to that sandra? Yes, I agree, and also can I ask you a question regarding the letter, no objections. You may be aware once I request it might take about two months to get approval. Can I just submit that I submitted and paid the fee to the permanent building that I requested. It josephine, you would not know more than I would think yeah. That's I mean that's fine, I'm sure the process is going to take that long, but SLA and you're going to require it anyway. So just when you get it just let us know. Yes, that's correct! Okay, great! Okay! Thank you! Yeah! Okay, great! Thank you! Okay. So, with that motion on the floor, I asked someone from the board to second that motion. I'm getting this ruth. I see roots hands first, so we'll put Ruth down so I'll call the roll now Barbara Velucci, yes, Chris Ellison, yes, Michael Festa, yes, Jill, Hajjar, Marty Lentz, yes, Nick Leonardos, yes, Ryan Mahoney, yes, Ruth, Mazer, yeah yep! I see how yes, okay, Susan Pulaski Susan, your yes! Okay! Now do I have anyone else, that's not on that. I did not call that's on the call now. Okay, hearing, none Barbara I'll turn it back to you. Motion, passes motion, both motions pass and we just invite Sandra also to be present at the Zoom meeting for the from the entire board on what is that Monday, the 21st Monday, the 24th at seven? Okay, excuse me, did you say 24, you say: is it the twenty? I'm sorry, the 21st, the 21st Monday, the 21st, the 21st? I'm sorry, thank you ruth the 21st yeah. You should call Neil and also tell him that he actually had. He has it's in the letter, but I will call him tomorrow. It's the 21st, it's a Monday at 7, P.M, perfect! Thank you so much. Thank you hearing that Sandra you can go now if you'd like, since that's passed and you'll Josephine will write up the stipulations and you shall call you in to sign. Okay. Thank you, okay, thank you! So much bye- bye! Thank you. Thank you Josephine! I just have some. You know just a question regarding you know all of the I hate to bring this up all the crime and on it our neighborhood is there anything that we should be doing or anything that we should know about. Well, I think that certainly you know in the last week has been very telling you know very trying. We've gotten a lot of calls in the district office concerns about certainly the murder, the robbery on 86th street, and today there was a carjacking on 67th street. When I spoke to Michael, he did not have much updated information for me, but what I can say is that we have invited the commanding officer to come and address the board on Monday. To kind of give us updates. The Good News is that there were swift arrests made in both instances. You know the horrific murder that took place in our hearts really go out to the family, but arrests have been made and, speaking to the captain he's addressed, you know a lot of the concerns that we had raised. The district's office he's kept the lines of communication open, and I hope that you know. Maybe we could talk a little bit more. Is there something that we can do? You know you know what are the what's the situation with personnel in our command? Have there been changes? I spoke to councilman Brandon and he mentioned to me that the crime team is back. The explain that to me so the anti- crime right. So the anti- crime officers in recent you know in recent months were pulled right and they are now coming back in uniform they've changed it. I do not know you know only what I've known in the newspaper. So I think I have a lot of questions. I have not spoken to the captain directly since the murder, but I did today did you know, made a formal request to for him to attend the board meeting on Monday, and I think these are things that we should talk about as a board as a committee, because it's on the minds of everyone, public safety, I think, is at the forefront and we've always been a safe community, we're the safest. We have not had a shooting in two years, but it's rattling, and it really is upsetting to so many it just it just shakes us all in all right. I look forward to our next meeting. Okay, if there's nothing else from our committee I'll say. Thank you so much and we'll get to the 21st wait. I have a question. Yes, just a general question: did we get a listing of the board meetings for the year again you should have, but if you did not I'll make sure they send out tomorrow, we did that Earl. You know at the beginning of the year. We typically do it we're working on next year's schedule, but I will send it out now. I think it's better if you do it in September, in September, okay, for the goodness, oh right, but probably was sent out in January right, yeah, January, but I'll send it out yeah. I do think it's fair to say we'll probably be on zoom for the remainder of the year. Yes, okay, all right! Everyone. Thank you. So much. Thank you guys. Welcome! Thank you! Okay and happy healthy new year to everybody. Thank you. Everyone take care bye. Thank you.
