What's happening now, I have no light up here. Okay, so we're going start. The meeting now and I would like to start the meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance behind me hold on one second I'm gonna mute everybody, but a few people. So just give me a second hey: can everyone hear me yeah, alright, good I got the I got the north's out hey, it's I can't tell you how wonderful it is to see so many of your faces, I hope your family, your loved ones, are staying. Strong staying, healthy I will certainly respect to two minutes. Josephine, it's great to see you first of all to Andrew and Justin, who I know are also on the on the call amazing job. You know tremendous leaders, everything you've been doing we're blessed to have you as in office. That's why law, enforcement and just everybody else they can throw your courage. You showed recently I just came off to two weeks or so of National Guard service on Staten Island across there across the bridge, at our testing site, as well as at a hospital that we were standing up to see the incredible courage from our medical professionals. It gives me a lot of hope that we're going to get out of this want to just give you a few quick items. First, as trash off the press, we were able to get Linko labs in Bensonhurst the authorization from the FDA to do antibody testing and all the equipment necessary to initiate any capacity. The first labs not only New York City and New York State, but in the country right here in South Brooklyn to be initiating these testing stuff we're not it's never gonna be enough. It's a start. The my offices put out I think a wonderful resource guide, centered around all the financial and economic assistance being offered. We've all seen in the news, the small what's happening with the PPP road. We have to get that thing. Replenished I'll be driving down to Washington DC this week. Fingers crossed to vote to authorize that impeachment we've been resolute. That's not the only thing that we should be doing. We don't get out of this pandemic. We stand on Charlie with no chance of getting out of this economic crisis, because this is ultimately an economic crisis that was catalyzed by a pandemic. So our hospitals are an incredible financial distress throughout New, York City. We have to get them more capital. We have to get more PPE to our from my medical professionals, people who we now call essential workers. They were always asset and we're gonna keep on fighting for more and more and more economic assistance until we're out of this, you know the ultimately I think the pathway is a gradual opening of the economy alongside continuing to build our health care infrastructure, so we can allow for testing and contact tracing, while also making sure that people aren't going through economic distress, even more so than they already are now my office stands ready willing to assist anybody. Many of you have my personal cell phone. If you do not it's nine one, seven, five, zero, two zero one to eight. Again, that's nine one: seven, five, zero, two zero one to eight! That's this guy right here, I'm here day and night, whatever I can do we're family we're in this together to close out this disease, this virus, it doesn't see race or creed or political affiliation and I'm, proud to say that we're uniting around defeating it and IIIi believe more so now than ever. This is the greatest city greatest country. You know the greatest state in history in the world. It's just a real honor to be here with you all and to see you all stay safe, stay healthy and my love to you and your family. God bless it's great to see everyone here on the screen, don't be together. You know we're all apart. You know, there's a full coordination with Justin's to really help a bunch of resource guy, so the family resources, the restaurants that are still open and delivering food. The pharmacies that are delivering medicine for people we partner with Bay Ridge, cares to do a volunteer operation to help deliver food, groceries and medicine to people who can't leave their homes. So there's a lot of things going on. You can go everything's right on our website. It's Senate organ artist, NYC forward, slash coronavirus and we have tons of resources there that you can share with everyone in the community, not just in Bay Ridge, but across all the neighborhoods and southern Brooklyn. We've done a number of town halls, general response to the virus. We did a town hall and mental health last week with Justin we're gonna do one on schools and education the next weeks as well. So there's a lot of things happening on the response front. You know very concerned were seeing with some of the nursing homes in our area, huh in Bensonhurst, in Sheepshead, Bay, Brooklyn, really trying to elevate the attention that's being given to nursing homes and some of the stories we're hearing and seeing it it's frustrating because they call us whenever they need masks and then, when we call that's the question, it's like they forget who we are and I know. A number of people on this call feel the same way. We've all been commiserating over that. So that's going to be a big focus and push in the weeks ahead. My office is going hundreds of thousands of unemployment insurance issues with New York State's Department of Labor. Just last week we put four additional bills that I hope will address some of the gaps and the unemployment system that we've seen this crisis kind of show people not being told that they're eligible to file for unemployment people being put on 0 hours. You know things like that, so, hopefully we can fill in some of the gaps that have been exposed in the unemployment safety net and then, lastly, I'm also working on legislation that is not ripe yet, but when we get through this, the big concerns going to be. What would we do for the frontline workers on both the public sector and private sector who have been exposed to the virus who have been sick with passed away? Proper death benefits, proper health benefits, creating presumptions and workers, comp changes, and things like that. So as chairman of the Civil Service Committee, this is like this. We are very eager to get to work on, but I'm lining. You know max has the ability to go down to DC. We have not been given the clearance to go back to Albany here, I publicly called for us to go back to Albany we're still waiting, there's a lot more. That has to get done and you know we just the halfway point of the crisis, so my office is here to be a resource, be of assistance. Anything you guys need local maxes comments, I'm here to help anything you guys need, and then one of Nan virus related news. I want to wish all of you a happy Constitution day today, April 20th, 1777, New York State ratified its first constitution, so here's of New York state history of New York, just to echo what my colleagues that know by now I think we all know someone who is sick or someone who's died from the virus and it's awful there's no way to sugarcoat. What's happening right now we seem to be down the other side of the mountain. The virus does seem to be slowing, but it's important to note that we're not out of the woods yet. You know there's a lot of talk about the data around testing. I think a couple assumptions that we can make, which is there's more people sick than we think and more people died from this driver who thinks you really do have to continue seriously, even if the weather is nice and you're feeling. Ok, this is not a time to resume your normal life, I think most New Yorkers. Certainly everyone on this caucus. This meeting is doing the right thing and taking this the threat of this virus very seriously, and it's because of you because of me, the politicians or the doctors, it's because of you, the public, the people that we are turning the page and doing the right thing and hoping hopefully coming down the other side here, yeah I, think New Yorkers are famous for right. I. Think we often always had to take things in stride. You know staying inside and hiding. Is that it's not our thing right, it's not in our DNA. It goes against all our instincts, so I think it hasn't been easy for anyone, especially for those who don't have the luxury of staying home and staying inside our first responders. Our cops are firemen, our EMTs, certainly our health care workers. Our nurses are our hospital ward staff, grocery workers, everyone who's now, an essential worker. You know a lot of people became essential, but they didn't right so they're out there every day, I think about them every single day towards getting out of this thing, there's a lot of people who are getting frustrated a lot of people who are getting tired of the social distancing measures, especially if you're feeling healthy and it's a nice day outside, but social distancing has, without a doubt prevented deaths. I mean there's no other way to put it and we're all in this together right. It shouldn't have taken a virus for us to see that we're all bound in this thing together, but that's where we are right now and it is what it is so my office is there for you, we're working around the clock, delivering masks and gloves to people on the front lines, helping people with unemployment. You know all the stuff that the senator and the congressman said just trying to stick together. It's so great to see all you guys, it's like a family reunion and I look forward to when we can all be hanging out again in person. So thank you guys. God bless you. It's good to see a lot of faces that I haven't seen in a long time like I, saw on the news today that the first case of the virus in New, York City, was 51 days ago. So that's a long time going on crime wise in Beijing right now. We crime is pretty much at this point, although overall for the year, we are up in crime roughly four percent for the year, but right now the current day period we're right where we were last year. We're actually down a few crimes, but the trend is going in the wrong direction and what we are saying is the biggest thing that we were. We were concerned with once they want to shut down the city. Break-Ins commercial, storefront break-ins has become a big problem and the recent period you know, if you think, about Bay Bridge and like we probably have over a thousand commercial locations, the ones that are being targeted, the most are the ones that do not have the roll down gates so we're seeing a spike in these kind of crimes. When we retrieve video more likely than not the perp is covered, they have a surgical, face, mask Cody ain't lumps we have made at least one arrest. We all having problems, keeping these perps in them. It's not just in bigger vegetable, also seeing this problem in our neighboring precincts, 72 priests and a six experience so we're all working together. We're looking at. We find it's the same groups of perps people with substance, abuse problems they looking for a quick score, they'll break the glass and they get the easy score. We are working with many of the business owners, we're telling them, you know, don't keep money in the business, especially if you close for a while and stuff like that. You know if they have video cameras, you know it's bigger the borrowed the overhead command and that oversees Brooklyn South. They have given us extra resources to patrol at night, so I do have more mark police cars and also unlock these cars and we're putting them onto commercial strips hoping to prevent and or cats the guys doing this. We are also seeing Spike's in lofts news of autos and I got to tell you that more than half of the cars being taken or cars being left running unattended, and this problem is probably due to the new technology. Now what people have the key fobs and they leave the car running. You know when they go into the stores or whatnot and then finally package theft we're seeing a lot of package theft inside of the apartment buildings throughout the precinct. You know this is a very hard problem for the NYPD to combat, considering the fact that it's indoors in these buildings, one thing that we got a stress to people is in this day and age. You really have to try to you know, have your packages sent to someone whose homes or if you order to Amazon, there's many places we can use the Amazon, lockers and stuff, but you know I do understand like this. You know, especially the older population may not understand fully how that works, but package theft is a big problem and even after the virus is long gone. This is not a problem. That's going to go away, the good news is violent. Crime was seeing less robberies on the street. We are seeing less felony assaults, even though that was something I was concerned about I was concerned. We were going to see more domestic violence. We're holding steady in that in that department and I hope to you know, hope we maintain that okay. Thank you very much, captain tom. Well, we will now move on to our public hearing. I just want to note before we move on to the public hearing controller Scott stringer. The office did reach out to us for the public session, whoever they submitted written submissions to us, which will be sent out with the minute to the board members afterwards. So now, I'd like to move on to the public hearing session. The first item is a renewal application for an enclosed sidewalk cafe at the kettle black, so darkness crews are chair for zoning and you will be reporting on this all right. Okay, the committee met in quorum. The committee met in quorum. This is ready to go for an existing sidewalk campaign. There have been no issues and it was unanimous excellent. So it's the committee's recommendation to approve the renewal application for the sidewalk cafe. Is there any questions or comments on this? Okay, anyone with a virtual hand up so I will call the question we have to do a roll call vote: okay, Michael Santa, my okay. Oh you have to unmute Michael you're, muted. There you go I made a mistake. Sorry Larry! No! This is consumer offense, yes, yeah! Any other questions. Okay, discussion. Call the question: again: we have to do roll call vote, so okay, I mean so hold on everybody's, going to be unmuted. So just wait until you hear your name vote and then mute yourself. Okay, this is Joseph. You call the roll in favor Michael divine to be in favor Harmon Feliciano in favor. Yes, I am guinardó in favor, Duty, Grimaldi I, don't think she's here, okay, Steve Harrison in favor, in favor, in favor, dandy, valid in favor in favor. Add you in favor! Thank you. That concludes college is on the line. Excuse me, okay, I'm, sorry, to see you I'll, add you to the roll call. This is underlined. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you stellar. Thank you, I've added you, okay! Thank you. The next item on the agenda is a new application to operate in close sidewalk cafe at one zero one, eight fourth Avenue for a Positano, okay, darn yep. The committee met virtually via zoom on the evening of April, 2nd 2020. The committee met in quorum I want to thank our chair, Laurie for encouraging the board and the committee to work virtually and thanks to Jesse Beckman and Dorothy Caruso, for coordinating training on Zoom and for the committee and all the attendant. The first item on the agenda was for unenclosed FA for Austria Positano LLC, doing business as Positano located at 100 118 4th Avenue, which is at the corner of 101st Street and 4th Avenue for 19 tables and 38 seats. It's application number one: 0 8, -, 9, -, 2, 0, 9, a SP. You see also in attendance or Joseph DeLuca, a 50% owner per the application and his attorney Michael Kelly. Many concerns were raised. Who would the least efficient sidewards sidewalk space? They were concerned about sidewalk crowding the application currency has the license mr. LaRocca, at peak times the restaurant will employ come forward. They will the owners in the past operated and unenclosed cafe without a license, and they continue to operate it. Knowing that this was not, they also operated an enclosed cyber cafe without a license for two winters. Mr. LaRocca claimed that, at the time of the those offences his partner was operating the restaurant- he was not the operator, it was not his fault. He says that now he's the sole operator and now is requesting a license for the enclosed. Cafe. Look Cafe Mitteleuropa stated at the meeting that in 2019 he was a sole operator of the restaurant in 2020 he was a sole. The application for the sidewalk cafe will be glass and metal and was in his roots in the Department of Consumer Affairs guidelines. This structure raises other concerns. The current cloth awning is a section that can open to allow access to the fire escape the applicant, and his attorney said that there are modifications that can be made to the fire escape to allow access. There are also other concerns about access to the cellar doors on 4th Avenue. The enclosed structure would prevent access to the cellar from the street. These two safety concerns were prime concern for the committee. Again, safety of the residents of 343, one, the building that houses the restaurant was the prime concern. The motion was made to approve the application with the provision with following provision pending approval by the Department of Buildings regarding fire escape access and so asked access. Any new structure must ensure the safety of all residents. The motion was seconded before we proceed with any further discussion, and voting I would like to add some information that was not covered during the meeting, while the F conceded that he was now. That's the application showed joint ownership. Just a tremendous Andrew Beckman reach out to the applicants attorney Eternity advised that they will be amending the application to so shows, as the current ownership is a sole ownership. This was the first virtual meeting. A roll call was requested it. The district office has the role the details of the roll call vote. The motion was approved, so we have a second. So we have a motion on the floor. Any discussion just so I understand that we'll also include the we saying that's going to be safe, but is there anything specific both in the fireplace and to the cellar openings? I will reread the motion as I wrote it down. A motion was made to approve the application with the provision that it is pending. Approval by the Department of Buildings require access to the fire escape and the cellar any new structure must include the safety of all residents, and this includes safety, and this includes access to the fire escape, and the cell, ok I'm still wondering about the fact that he told us that there was no partner, but now there's a partner. This concerns me it's the opposite. In the original application. He had a partner when he spoke to us. He said he no longer has a partner josephine reached out to him, and he responded to her over the weekend and said they were in the process of amending. They will be amending the application to show that he has sole ownership, agree to amend the application to show the current ownership. I think that the motion should absolutely show this. The current ownership and I'm a little bit concerned he's making an application. He told us that even this way, he told us now that there was two people now he's telling us this. One person is there to be a shadow here somewhere change its application to reflect the current ownership. Is that your suggestion, honest with you? It's not so much? My suggestion is I'm listening to it and I'm not really inclined to vote for it under the circumstances, because I don't understand why we weren't told this, and it makes me very nervous and I think we should have them back in well. I, just wanna I just want to clarify those feeds. The initial application that was submitted to us and was submitted by the applicant was made in 2019, okay and the michael kelly. His representative said it was really just the paperwork out error. He says he was told that there was a change and he neglected to make that change on the application he was going to make it I just want you to know that bit of information. Okay, why can't he get to make the change and understand she wants what she wants to do without why he neglected why he did not accept to change the application page now he submitted the application in 2019. It's a very long for the agency. The Department of City Planning and Consumer Affairs to process the application. It was during that time that the change in partnership with named okay I think we need to know who the ownership is before we go forward and I support. Steve's suggestion for amendment and I think that should be a priority, an amendment that our approval is subject to changing the application to show the current ownership. He did not reject that. If someone wanted to make that door is suggesting I've never made a recommendation to a committee, I would have someone else, make a recommendation and another committee member or member. So a good point, your emotion! That's fine! The committee votes fans, but those people would you be making that motion I make that motion? Yes, thank you. Do I have a second okay. So now the motion is on the floor to amend the Committee's recommendation to include that the application would have to be amended to show the correct ownership. Yes, okay, so can we have a vote on the amendment? Okay, thank you. Thank you in favor, Diane, Grenada, [Applause], Anthony Marino in favor motion is. The motion is to approve the application, with the submission of a new application of amended application, showing the current ownership to building access, kappa, surely 10 Colin I to be Emilio in favor Richard de Michael Dean in Berlin, in favor, in favor, in favor, Leonardo, Anthony Marino in favor, asking in favor Stephanie Mahaney, asking in favor in favor and even in favor Street.

This blaze verbally told us that the hours of operation are Monday through Sunday 11 a.m. through 4:00 a.m. this new application did indicate that there was no license outdoor area. There has been an adverse history connected to this establishment regarding the use of the yard associated with this address and the two neighboring yards, both miss blaze and mr. Gentilly, signed and agreed to stipulations. Regarding the renewal of the SLA license as recent as March 2018 in September of 2018, miss Beckman wrote to mr. Bradley from the New York State Liquor Authority, regarding the fact that Miss blaze and mr. Gentilly are not abiding to the stipulation agreement signed in March. This agreement, addressed over 128 noise complains to 315 calls to 911 disorderly groups. The 3-1-1 calls they were 74 2017 39 for 2018 12 for 2019 and 8 for 2020 mind you. This meeting was held on March 9th two calls to 9-1-1 in 2020. We established for this continuing to use its rear yard and had expanded its business into at least two abutting yards. These yards included a mounted TV outdoor music alcohol is served. Then smoking goes on in all three of these yards, which is a violation of its SLA on premise license. There were large fights and disorderly conduct reports outside of the establishment. This meeting March 9th they were residents present. Gentlemen stated there has been an improvement. The noise and use of the yard is miss blazing mr. Gentilly claim the art is no longer being used. Mr. Gentilly suggested that the noise is coming from neighbors using fire escapes. This second gentleman showed us pictures from the back of the property, as he faced is the yard. As of this state, there is a canopy tarp tending the yard, so that you cannot see in is mr. Gentilly. If he would take the tent down, he stated that he cannot afford to do this. We have pictures of the yard decorated for this year. Super Bowl is mrs. Gentilly. Why would he decorate in the yard if it was not being used, and there is a stipulation for the doors to remain shut? He said that the decorations were for aesthetics, in fact, miss blaze, Facebook page On, February, 2 2020 clearly shows the yard in use and the person recording the Super Bowl party, stating that she is recording a video from the yard and proceeds to recorded video through the inside of the bar. This resident also showed us additional pictures of the yard, capturing tremendous amounts of tree debris and what appears to be hundreds of black bags of garbage. Mr. Gentilly stated that he cannot afford the carting company. He also stated that he gets rid of garbage, as he shows me a picture on his cell phone of an overlook flowing dumpster in front of this establishment. He said that picture was from a few months ago, and this, as you would know, is a violation. This resident also said that there is much noise emanating from the main dining room. Miss blaze stated that the front door is always closed, except when a person who was handicapped needs to enter the premise one committee member passed by the establishment on his way home from this meeting and took a picture of the garage door that was wide open. Mr. Valles, a member of this board also showed us a video of the members of the Lonestar establishment carrying several dozen black garbage bags to his property across the street during the night. He has several sanitation violations because of this. Miss blaze at mr. Gentilly have disregarded all prior stipulation agreements, but they have made with the truth and have failed to abide by SLA regulations. The blatant violations continue from approximately 2010 in light of the facts that the recent application was incomplete. The rear Iran's continued to be used as an extension of the restaurant, where the violation abuse smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages continue, but numerous calls to 3-1-1 and 911 regarding noise complaints and fighting. It was also a very serious fight there. This past May of 2019, the serious Health Department series Department of Health / sanitation violations regarding the hoarding of garbage on the property instead of contracting a private Cardigan company, as all establishments are required to do. This committee voted 6 to 1 to deny this SLA renewal license and therefore the committee requests a motion and approval from this board to accept this recommendation of denial. Thank you. Ok. So the motion is on the floor. To deny the renewal station. Are there any questions or comments? I'm, sorry, I. We never love this liquor license. Are there any questions or comment Nick metropolis? What's the process assuming we deny and can they still get the liquor license if we deny Wow Josie? Do you want to think about? Don't speak to that Nick? I did look at the SLA website and it is noted that mr. Gentilly has already received his renewables [Laughter]. There are several outstanding violations on his license that we are waiting, Jude occation of those violations for the fight in May, as well as SLA violations issued for violating the extending his premises in the backyard okay. What does a resident in the surrounding property? Do they have to it's a very small process? We have been I think we have to stay on top of him and demand from the State Liquor Authority that they adjudicate these violations and I. Think that's all we can do at this point as a board. You know I was terribly committee Nick. You know you on the committee as well. I think you know the SLA came out. They issued violation. The communication process takes a very long time and he, you know, they're not going to pull his license or take any action for that matter until those violations are adjudicated. The residents who have shown up in the past have call 3-1-1. They called you know about noise, complaints, etc. They were building Department violation and it's just you know. Everything takes a very long time to adjudicate and except for the SLA violation, the fact that he is using Rebeck yards, which are not part of his likeness premises. Not none of the other violations were rose to the level of where you know they would shut down and establishment for those types of violations. So we, the halay and all we can do- is keep asking what's going on. Obviously, in this climate, it's more difficult, you know to get progress right now, while New York is on hope. So I'm gonna stand with the same exact thought process, as we did with one of the recent karaoke bars because of serious safety concerns for life and the city becomes reactive instead of proactive I want to make it loud and clear about our voice against this, because it's only a matter of time until something catastrophic happens and then we're gonna look back and the city is going to jump on there at that point, so you know again I'm in favor of the chair. The committee vote. Okay, anyway, would like to speak on this motion. Yeah. Are they operating right now during this virus? Actually, I am open, but I do believe that Iowa Police Department is out an establishment that would be open in violation of the current executive orders would be shut so I have no have you heard anything no I have not. We could absolutely do that. Doris I just wanted to let you know that we did notice for our department, sanitation violations were issued, Department of Buildings has issued violations and I believe a resident has made an additional complaint there as well, but we will, we will add the fire department 2018. One of the things that concern. Many people was the fact that there was no egress from the backyard, the backyard pretty horrified when we found yes hold on please glory. Can we do this in order? Because, if I have about five hands up, okay, Julie, yes, I was wondering I mean I have not encountered this before, and you know since I'm, one of the newer people on the board. How is it that the SLA does not take into account any of the other issues with this establishment, and also when did they did they actually issue the license, and when did they do it? Did they do it in the last week or when did that happen? Yes, they issued a renewal within the last two weeks, April 1st April 1st, when okay, so we weren't under where we already are in the quarantine I, don't so, yes, they have the ability, the ability to issue a license. Knowing all this was wrong in this situation, it makes no sense whatsoever and then a further question I would say: is you know what do we have as the community board? What are we going to be powerless in this or you know, is this superfluous? What we're discussing here? What are we going to be able to do something? Okay, I, don't ever think it. You know we are an advisory body, but what we are good at doing is reaching out to the various agencies and letting them know what's going on and having them come in and enforce their specific areas of enforcement. So, for example, Department of Sanitation gave some violations. The SLA did come out. Gosh I, don't remember how long as Josephine sir, that the three years we are yards were being used with no license. They did issue a violation, but historically the FL is very slow to hear these things and here at the matter and bring it to fruition. There were Department of Buildings violations which at past meetings you know members were very concerned about and what we could do is just again try to seek enforcement. I think we had done a couple of multi agency requests for enforcement in the past. Didn't we Joe? Yes, we did and we have one pending now, but with the coronavirus with Colvin I mean certainly I, don't believe they're operating when they may be operating now, just as delivery, but in the May there was a may large fight. They were also to several arrests that were made in May at the establishment. So we continue to seek enforcement and it is frustrating it's insanely frustrating how long this has gone on and I do. Share this nickel Opelousas concern anybody else. Wavy SLA is handled things that someone to pass if they're, not probably the best and best of our good graces and I wonder, is it time to send a letter to our partners in state government, Andrew, Matilda and micro, sorry, her name to actually write a calling Oversight Committee for the SLA to look into their practices and how they're actually reacting to this things to see, if there's something better that they can be done because, unless looks into they're handling this nothing's gonna change. Well, we have many times actually just again, you know because the issue did come up again now with the renewal. Just before we are, you know, hold we were in touch and speaking with counsel and Brandon's office about it and the middle a violation they did actually go there. They viewed the condition and issued the violation. It's a question of how long it takes them to have the hearings to you know. Actually you know to the extent we can get oversight on that I'm. Not quite sure we could inquire about and I think. This is something that they can do and just say how disappointed I am that the SLA issued this license before hearing from the community board, and they did it during the covered 19 outbreak when the city is virtually shut down, but they found the time to issue a license. The person that does not care about his neighbor's does not care about any law regarding any city agency, because you heard every city and the SLA just does not care. If there is a committee formed, I would like to stay and sit on it. This gentleman does not deserve to be in business I'm all for business I'm all for giving people the benefit of doubt, but this guy is just rubbing his nose, every city agency and this community board as well and I'm, just very disappointed at the disregard that this establishment and the city has for the citizens of the city of New York. Anybody, Julie I, just had one more quick question: are there any Board of Health violations? You know I, don't know that answer Julie I'll find out for you, because maybe we could get the Board of Health to close them down at this point was that this license came up for renewal, so it was not an initial incision and really those things are fairly pro forma with the SLA. Unless there is, you know, significant adverse history, a community opposition because it did coincide with you- know our operation being shut down because of Kovach 19. The office did send a letter, however, to the SLA. You know just setting forth the prior history so that they would, you know, be aware of it and at least have it on record, despite the fact that we could not. You know, get a board vote going on the renewal, but I do think that you know, including all of your comments and a response to the SLA, would be a good idea. So if there are there any other questions or comments on this motion, which was the motion on the floor to the recommendation of the committee to disapprove this annual application, can we attach a potato somebody? Oh yeah I would like to go on record to please if we can do, as you said when they commit, it will send a letter to the SLA authority demanding that we should be consulted before any renewal or any license would be issued in our neighbourhood. I would recommend that very hard. Okay, thank you. So do we have any other questions or comments? Would you like to call we're gonna call the question and the Committee's recommendation to disapprove this application, even though we know now that this was granted. I would like to make an amendment offer an amendment for that motion that disapproval and I would also like to suggest that a letter go along with it to the SLA setting forth the things that we have documented that have gone on even since the committee's meeting Thank You Doris any more further I sent it in the chat I just asked if we could attach a petition to that letter. Thank you of board members, or maybe people in the surrounding area. Sandy Valles obviously is one of the people very concerned. It's a board member and he has property there. So you know I, don't know, but I just thought might. Maybe that would make it more effective because you would have to wait to go out and get a petition signed in a situation. I don't know right now it could be put on because II emailed or you know, on committee, you know later on hi. This is Judy. I, think what you might be behind. You is a except with the denial it's cusp. Can we do a report? Firstly, would add a report within the record. Comments would go into it Julie so we would be able to send in is that we deny and send a strongly worded letter to the SLA outlining the history, and the objections that have all been discussed this evening is that okay, we would need a motion on that Judy you're, making that motion someone seconding that Joe will Richard a favor in favor in favor, Leonardo, Nick Nicholas indicated Suzanne Polanski in October Maui, yes, and saver, asking in favor Henry Stuart, Oh, D tau alina tell Julie thumb in favor, absolutely in favor you in favor Thank You Josephine. Thank you so much Barbara. Thank you, and so we had some zoning and land use subcommittee report that will be distributed with the minute I just wanted to mention. There was traffic and transportation, eight reports, zoning and land use and some other that were sent out from the March meeting and those were distributed to you. They were all informational, but please do take a look to keep up and I want to thank everyone so much for them. This was fantastic. Everyone coming together, brian has his hand up Brian we on old business, new business. Where are we dad? Brian? Don't know nothing, hello, nothing! Okay! It's been lowered. Okay, so we have old business meeting. Anyone to bring up for oldest anybody. Do we have any hands up? Mark I can't see okay, new business. Let me that still gonna be suspended until April, 28th, okay and then there's because I mean the some of them does get a pretty fun of a garbage. We are getting complaints about that, but right now is suspended till April 28th. You will share those complaints, however, with Sanitation organic and yard waste collection, as a gardening cleanup to get done, get it done before May 4th. So it goes in the place I wanted to find out. If, when we send out the newsletter, if there could be some clarity about having you know wearing a mask, because when I'm on 5th avenue taking my books, some stores will say you can't enter without a mask and then other stores don't have it. But I still see a lot of young people so in print the poster on the website themselves. Judy that's correct until May 4th, because they are printing posters to put them up for the mask. The mask is mandatory to get in because of the people inside. So nobody gets infected and that's I think by the mere mask. It's just amazing. It's a constant battle with people, not following that arguing with customers almost every day. You know, and in the midst of struggling to keep our doors open and making payroll that argue with some people about simple things. We could put all the signs we want, but the people it's right, I agree with to Nick. We were digging out, masks, we're giving out masks for those and they still don't. No, you know instructed that everyone has everyone else, any other hands up.
