Now the motion is on the floor to amend the Committee's recommendation to include that the application would have to be amended to show the correct ownership.
That really do mean a lot like reaching out to people we know and offering whatever support.

This blaze verbally told us that the hours of operation are Monday through Sunday 11 a.m. through 4:00 a.m. this new application did indicate that there was no license outdoor area.
One committee member passed by the establishment on his way home from this meeting and took a picture of the garage door that was wide open.
This committee, voted 6 to 1 to deny this SLA renewal license and therefore the committee requests a motion and approval from this board to accept this recommendation of denial.
