The first is an application for a new liquor license for cider, which was submitted for Luann's coffee bar Inc, located on the first floor of 7405 Third Avenue.
There was no image of what this establishment would look like as a finished product New York, City Building inspectors responded to a complaint in September 2019 houses, Sound Board was being installed without a permit.
It is noted that a resident reported that the board was- was assumed to prevent anyone from looking into the establishment from the outside New York City building inspectors attempted to gain acts to the premises, again: On, February, 25th and February 28th 2020.
There is adverse history for this premise: The New York City Open Data with three one phone calls from 2010 to the present.
The present inspected the business and found a fully stacked bar the owner, failed to produce receipts and records for the alcohol.
The application of submission has not included the New York City's, building inspectors resolution to the construction without a permit from this February.
The disregard of the numerous 3- 1- 1 phone calls for the repeated complaints for noise for over a year and a half with no remedy and the knowing illegal use of a premise as a bar with the continued sale of alcohol without a license.
It leads me to have to bring this to the committee in serious consideration for us recommending this premise: Louann's coffee bar to be approved for a liquor license so I open this up.
The music won't be that loud, like we had before, Second, Maurice board, was from September correct, yes, okay, but that's when these phone calls begin right.
May I asked the board what they would like to see a consideration that we do not have photographs of what the assemblage will look like that the application did not include the New York City Building inspectors resolution for the construction without a permit phone calls for the repeated complaints for noise over a year and a half with.
The Garcias are responsible and stop in and knowing illegal use of a premise as a bar/ light club, with the continued sales of alcohol with a license, and also that it was sublet to several different persons.
Ahead, Sin I'd like to make a motion denying the application for this establishment based on the adverse history and the actions of the applicant IIIi. Do not think that they learned about business that well.
Thank you for coming and as part of the recommendation of this committee, this SLA lane license has been denied, so the Garcias, if they like their part of the meeting, is complete and they can sign out if they choose located.
Only, three one New York City open data, the Community Board office up until I believe this evening, or this afternoon, had not heard from the representative.
