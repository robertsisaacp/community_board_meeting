Happy that we have a column and I also see that we have our captain Tolson new to the six eighth precinct, welcome to Bay Ridge. We have two applications present this evening. The first is an application for a new liquor license for cider, which was submitted for Luann's coffee bar Inc, located on the first floor of 7405 Third Avenue. The attorney is Anthony Caraballo from 111 electic avenue in Brooklyn. The principles for this establishment are Louis, a Garcia Maldonado vice- president and Brigitte Garcia. The applicant. The hours of operation are listed Monday through Wednesday 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. for this Monday and Wednesday. If music is from 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. the kitchen is from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. Thursday, 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. music from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. the kitchen from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. music from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. now. That may have been an era, since the music will outlast the designated hours of operation, the kitchen from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday, 8:00 a.m. to 2 a.m. music from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. the kitchen from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. you know, I'm just going to pause for a moment, because I believe that the owners are present Josephine. True, yes, ok and do we have any residents present also Microphone? Thank you. It will be a DJ music used. There will be no outdoor space used. In addition, the application states that it acknowledges that the doors and windows need to be remain closed while the music is on and they need to follow the New, York City noise regulations, photos of the Interior were included and showed tables and chairs, which was stacked, counter Tops bear and several photos of doors and hallways with several places under repair and painting. There was no image of what this establishment would look like as a finished product New York, City Building inspectors responded to a complaint in September 2019 houses, Sound Board was being installed without a permit. No violation was found as a permit was not needed for this work. It is noted that a resident reported that the board was- was assumed to prevent anyone from looking into the establishment from the outside New York City building inspectors attempted to gain acts to the premises again: On February 25th and February 28th 2020. Regarding the lack of a building permit for construction, they could not gain access. There is no certificate of occupancy included. It is stated that this mixed- use building does not have one now. I know that the police captain is here and I'm sure he'd like to give a report. There is adverse history for this premise: the New York City Open Data with three one phone calls from 2010 to the present. There was one phone call in 2011 for double parking. There have been 20 calls from this past September 2019, so January 31st 2020. Some calls are numerous on the same evening and for all I know it could be from the same person. I do not know for all of these calls. The complaint is loud, music and partying. Some of these calls are made as late as 1237 am now. My new Luanne is a coffee bar. This is after the Sound Board installation inspection, which is also provided to us from the captain of the six eighth precinct. Captain Kahn well email from this captain dated January 3rd 2020. The christen conducted two visits there observing alcohol on both occasions. The present inspected the business and found a fully stacked bar the owner failed to produce receipts and records for the alcohol. Our police captain informed us that this is a storefront operating as a bar unlawfully selling alcohol and the party hall, mostly on weekends. It's considered an illegal nightclub by the way it appears. This establishment is not license by the SLA January 3rd 2020 is the date of the letter, and it was also the date of the second inspection multiple summonses were issued regarding unlawful dealings with alcohol and much alcohol was destroyed by law enforcement. He also provided us with additional adverse incidents. Regarding this premise: On February 1 2020. There were two arrests following a serious physical altercation between patrons at this unlicensed premise upon police arrival, it was evident that alcohol was being sold, minors were consuming alcohol, thereby endangering the welfare of-. There were no receipts or records of the business for inspection. There is no assembly license that was repeated again. The use of Marijuana was witnessed and a Taser and pepper spray were both recovered. The owner, Mr. Garcia and the patron were arrested. Now that portion was from I just summarized the official police complaints which you could see some of it posted right now on the PowerPoint in some in consideration of the fact that there is no CFO for this building that we do not have photographs of what the actual establishment will look like that. The application of submission has not included the New York City's, building inspectors resolution to the construction without a permit from this February. The disregard of the numerous 3- 1- 1 phone calls for the repeated complaints for noise for over a year and a half with no remedy and the knowing illegal use of a premise as a bar with the continued sale of alcohol without a license. It leads me to have to bring this to the committee in serious consideration for us recommending this premise: Louann's coffee bar to be approved for a liquor license so I open this up. Now the committee for any discussion or questions to Josephine and to the owners I see that bridget is here. Well, the police captain yeah the police captain. If he wants to comment first sure, absolutely captain we have to unmute captain what's going on, obviously running after their one of those was accurate. Embellish I did not change anything because I will have to give a report to the official board at the official meeting, which will probably go over on Channel 1 or whatever I do not want any mistakes. So thank you ask a question and you can also address the applicants. Ask a question to the officer or to the applicants was open. Last week. Sandwiches Bridget would you like to just see Bridget? He did not even know anything so now we just recently did weeks ago. We just decide to open to make some like she said. Like the police said, some sandwich have dogs hamburgers. Some doing right now see we're going to make some comfort, but we have not been making anything at all very difficult right now. You also understand that is subletting your business and these people performing illegal activity by the very least of having alcohol, let alone being served to minors, the use of Marijuana within which leads to fights. That's all something that you were responsible for some people over there. So he had to go straight to the local to see what was going on over there when he went there. He saw a lot of young people, so he had some responsibility actually because he's the one who's managing right now the business. For me, the landlord, you are renting the store, correct you do not you do not own this building exactly. There were at least 23 1:1 phone calls from September regarding the noise and disruptions together. The music won't be that loud, like we had before, like I said now, we know already, what's going on just one. Second, Maurice board was from September correct, yes, okay, but that's when these phone calls begin right after the noise Boyd was put up. That's a problem. You are responsible every single day, every single night you are responsible, it was not the one day event Andrian backwards. You know on this committee. I do not know if you know the work of the Community Board, none of us here to this evening, I'm on this committee, except for the police and Josephine. None of us get paid for this. We are residents of the neighborhood they're, probably just like you are, and one of the things that we do is to make sure that every single business and business owner is a responsible person understands of the most and respects our neighbors, and so that we do nothing but quality of life. You know person who has to run this meeting and I'm going to leave this open to the rest of the committee. It's very distressing to hear these things, so my crashing would be. Is why would I want to trust you with a liquor license? Well, you have not shown in the past where you did not have a license that you could not be responsible when you're someone else almost two or three months. This was your responsibility and you know speaking for them, but they are going to speak. We are very leery of you know, passing this on to someone who could not take responsibility for something they had control and probably wanting to get an SLA license. Perhaps you should have looked into the rules and regulations before you know. You know before this, so that business has been terrible, but we have to maintain the quality of life in to make sure that everyone knows what you need to do before it happens, and not after big mistake, trusting some of the people that we should not trust. Sometimes we never know. Did you ever go back to check I'm sure you were told about the. We could not do anything about it, because it was a committee to speak on this sandy high sanding tenants. The applicants did your. Did your landlord know that you sublet it the permission to sublet the premises this third party? Yes, during all these complaints, was it the same person that you sublet it-, or do you sublet the different people? It was different people. It was different people. Well that will does not help the case. I mean you sublet, the one person that gives you a problem, but now, but now you submerge the different people and you had problems with different people. That does not help your situation here, because you have a very extensive business open if you want showing on you, they are going to have liquor and they are going to have DJ music, which tends to get pretty loud and that could cause another problem here, notice that the DJ establishment very disruptive to nearby neighbors and community, it's okay. Everything has been closed from March 17, so we're talking about five about five or six weeks before the shutdown yes I'll. Take a member of the community. I do not see I do not know who you are. One of the time you can was one person speaks. You can unmute yourself and speak. That's me: can you guys hear me I can see you if I could hear you, what is your name Nicole Schneider I'm, a resident I've been resident since 2001 and I live next to the coffee bar and I am definitely responsible for two of those three one complaints one was on December 7th at 2:40 a.m. not 2 a.m. 2:40 a.m. that we had a call and for noise, and we also called on January 25th at 1:12 in the morning for loud noise. I know that there's been karaoke, very loud music there's been fights and my I have. My understanding is that there's been lap dancing at the at the location and then you can not see inside the location, which has always been a concern for me once I saw it open. Is that the board? That's there that blocks the view, but all the boards and even the windows you can't see through the door nothing the only way I could see inside when they had the door open at one point: I walked by and I saw the door open. That's the only way I could see inside of that facility right next door, some up and down this block every day, and we just we feel that, because they've been irresponsible in the past that giving them a liquor license will allow them to continue to be irresponsible and have loud parties and keeping up at 3 o'clock in the morning. So and I just do not want that. I have to go to work. I just want to note for the record that this person was not the person who wrote to the councilmen with the extensive letter, suggesting that the Sound board was a really a barrier so that you can not see him. That was not the same person. Okay, I'd like to speak singing there are none. May I asked the board what they would like to see a consideration that we do not have photographs of what the assemblage will look like that the application did not include the New York City Building inspectors resolution for the construction without a permit phone calls for the repeated complaints for noise over a year and a half with. No, whether or not it was sublet. The Garcias are responsible and stop in and knowing illegal use of a premise as a bar/ light club, with the continued sales of alcohol with a license, and also that it was sublet to several different persons. Yes, the committee's recommendation in foremost, regarding this application for a liquor license. If I may I'd like to make a motion, go ahead, sin I'd like to make a motion denying the application for this establishment based on the adverse history and the actions of the applicant IIIi, do not think that they learned about business that well and I, say I think days. They will be a problem and I would like to send the letters into the SLA outlining all the adverse history, and why would you line this application, so my motion is to deny the application I. Second, the motion? Okay. Okay, thank you. So much. That concludes. Where is the night? The night of the official Community Board meeting the entire board is okay. Thank you for coming and as part of the recommendation of this committee, this SLA lane license has been denied, so the Garcias, if they like their part of the meeting, is complete and they can sign out if they choose located 89 to third Avenue. It has applied for an alteration to the already existing liquor beer, wine and cider license that is already in operation. The establishments Corporation name is o Sullivan's Pub& Grub LLC, the president is Burdette O'sullivan, and the attorney representing this establishment is Mr. Terence Flynn Jr. from for- for- for Beach, one hundred and twenty Ninth Street in Bell Harbor. This establishment is known as a bar tavern and the application for construction because they are doing construction in changing the configuration of their establishment, was filed on February 7th 2020 closed due to an inactivity on April 7th 2020. This project consists of an interior renovation of the bar restaurant area and the residential unions. On the second floor, the mobile replacement of all bar counters to its same location, alignment, the floors and ceiling height, new Roof, hatch and skylight. No change is proposed to the building use occupancy broke or footprint. The box was checked off, certifying that all construction documents related to this application do not require a new or amended certificate of occupancy, as there is no use in it's no change in its use, exits or occupancy. This application was incomplete and it's entirely basically no photos. No menu, no CFO, no floor plan, no certificate of public assembly in the method of operation. You did note that there is the use of video, arcade, jukebox and security. They noted that the business area is on the main floor in the basement and no outdoor use. There are no excuse me. There are no complaints. Only three one New York City open data, the Community Board office up until I believe this evening or this afternoon had not heard from the representative. Regarding this alteration, the board did send returned. We see notification to the attorney on March 9th stating that unless they complete the application and attend a hearing, this application today or follow- up duration application. I can tell you what the construction is. We have plans. I, do not know, did not get them, but I do have floor plans. I could shoot them over to somebody if you'd like right now, we did not put them in with the Buildings Department. We have the whole PAA set up in order to submit. We just did not want to submit it, and you know until we spoke to you guys and get the okay Matthew Bell I'm the contractor, and that would be working on this. The establishment, my name is Annie O'sullivan, I, think Josephine that you had been in contact with my mom. Yes, so basically, what we're doing is. We are Renault the apartments upstairs they had not been lived in a long time, so basically we're going to give that a facelift. Everything is pretty much staying where it is. The two apartments are remaining the same. The only difference that we're doing is there is a stairwell which goes what cuts the bar and the restaurant in half. It does not give a good flow, it does not. It just does not accrue the price. We propose to move the stairwell, that's sitting in the middle of the bar and the restaurant more towards the back of the restaurant it'll, give an open feel you could actually see into the restaurant from the bar and vice versa. Just we feel like it'll, just create a happier. You know the business remain the same. We might be able to gain some more tables because now we're going to have that open, so we could bring it down the runway. It's all in our proposed plans, like I, said that I could send you guys and we have full drawings. I have a whole Pa Doc, it's a you know, demo plans everything we I when I came on earlier. I was asking, should I send them out to you guys do not know why you guys did not get them. That was totally a lapse from me yeah. So we were scared, obviously, like everybody else, because of the coronavirus right. So we were nervous. We work. We have not been able to make money and we're starting to reopen. So that was originally. We were like, oh my god. What? If we do not reopen again we're really going to be stuck, you wind up dumping, all this money into it, and then we can make it back focus on some reopen and we see businesses are starting to get back on their feet. We think the construction to could take anywhere from five to six months, so I think that we'll be okay by the time that we, you know all of New York opens up. It should be five to six months, hopefully that everything gets back to normal I prayed and by that time we should be able to just step right back into business has been around. Obviously you guys know us all. This has been there any how long since I, just had yes, okay, so we've been around so I think sorry, Matt to cut you off I think there was a little bit of miscommunication between our lawyer and us. So we were hoping tonight that if you guys could see the plans, you know being aware that you guys do not meet in the month of July. Our hope was that we could hand the plans over to you guys and get it approved before September, just so that we do not lose out on that time of construction, because everything is still so up in the air right now. That I feel like now is, prime time to start the construction Matt. Would you agree with that? Yes, basically, construction just started just opened up last Tuesday so before that construction could not have even started. So we were what it's going to take six months like I said, hopefully, by the time everything starts up again, we'll be ready to go so that was out. That was our hope. Today, I actually had reached out to Annie today and I'm like what's going on, and then she had got a phone call. Many of us have gone to O'sullivan's because it is a very well- established business with really no adverse history. At all. My question to the committee and to Josephine is that this application really was not filled out. You know every time you apply, you need pictures, you need to see a vote. You need menus. Nothing of that was in there at all. Okay, you know like to see the floor plan and menu just to give it a once- over I think so we can without a doubt before Monday get that over to you guys for sure. Okay. So, let's just say that we have that that's all the application has been talk. First form is being converted into a wine bar. What is the possibility or the truth, the veracity of that person 0%, because Josephine Beckman has also heard this. The renovation was going to include the idea that another person, perhaps coming in as a partner, perhaps coming in as a separate entity, was coming up to use the next floor as a wine bar I also heard that it might be rooftop if I could share with you guys to think my family's owned it for 94 years and the things that I myself have heard. I'm like I would love to know where that came from ok, and this was five months ago and Josephine heard it a couple of weeks ago. That's not true, ok committee. Anyone have any extra questions for these owners and construction worker. That's why I asked because I mean being that this has been around for over 90 years history. It seems that we just did not get the so hard doing these meetings when you're, not with the people at another table. What do you want to do, as we usually do we're, considering that we would have the application in its completeness by Friday that we deny the application unless the following stipulations? We do with every application. I would agree with that: Barbara, okay, so Annie. This is what we usually do, because we're going to you're going to be coming in to see Josephine whenever it's safe to do so to sign elections saying the following, so we're going to deny the application unless you agree to the following stipulations, and there are formula that we give to just about most places. Some are much more extensive, okay, so on the record, I'm going to say that the Community Board denies the application to the SLA application to O'sullivan's Pub& grub. Unless the owners agree to the following stipulations, the premises will operate as a restaurant. The certificate of occupancy will be acquired and/or. A letter of no objection will be the only one manager will be on- site during all hours of operation and then will have the hours of operation listed. The applicant will not sublet the premise remain closed in coordination with any amplified music. The background recorded music remained below the level permitted by the New York City noise Code there will be no music on the outside of the premises. Their licensing will shall not use any promoter or have promoted events, there'll be no smoking, and the applicant agrees that should it change its method of operation, Susan Pulaski, I'm Santi Palace. Thank you, okay. So with that, our meeting is on June, 15th and hope to see you all, then thank you so much for participating and to Annie. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Can I just ask you one question. Just so I'm clear go ahead, the meeting that you guys have June 15. We do not need to be present. That's Europe! Maybe do not need you do not need to be present. You guys need the seat of all the plans in the menu I. Just can I just I'm sure I have it, but just to be safe. The email address again I'm. Sorry, thank you. Thank you. If you'd like you're, welcome to join us in that zoom, but you do not have to okay, let's keep the support with this denial with the stipulations and that you have agreed to the stipulations yes, and that was Buddy Brothers Corporation, it's the N B and M deli, 6752. Fourth Avenue! So we're not doing that one. This evening, you.
