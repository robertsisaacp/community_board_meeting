Everyone community board, 10 Brooklyn, general meeting, October, 19th, Thank, you and now I would like to call for an adoption of the agenda.
Hey, guys, hey Justin, how's everybody doing thanks for having me a couple of things going on so first early voting , Starts this Saturday October 24th.
I, just posted some information on social media channels for most of us in Bay Ridge, the early voting site is going to be Fort, Hamilton, High School, but there's all sorts of links and stuff that I can send out to folks.
Then you have the opportunity of voting early and that starts on Saturday, but the polling place is likely going to be different from where your normal polling place is obviously wanted to mention the incident that happened on Thursday, where we had an unfortunate and horrific attempted sexual assault of a senior on 94th street near Marine Avenue, the the NYPD made a very swift arrest and the suspect is now being held on two hundred thousand dollars.
And I'm working very closely with a local 6a precinct as well as I had a meeting last two weeks ago with police commissioner Shea and I requested additional patrols in the area.
Bay, Ridge and dyker heights are still by far two of the safest neighborhoods in the entire city of New. But I understand that recent events certainly have folks concerned and me included, and I also understand that, regardless of what the statistics say, more of a police presence will certainly make people feel safer.
And you know we continue to work closely with the district attorney's office and with our partners in law enforcement here to make sure that everybody's, safe, I mean public safety is always going to be.
Everything else comes second to that, so so I just wanted to pop by and say hello, make sure that you knew that we're on top of this and working closely with our local cops to keep us safe, and I will send out the information about the early voting just so.
Our early voting starts on Saturday October 24th, until November 1st , if you're in Bay, Ridge, there's only one location for you and that's the Fort Hamilton High School, So be sure that you have that hung up on your refrigerator and spread.
We want to remind people to drive slave safely to slow down and to stop drag racing in the community.
Anyone has any questions for me, but everybody here tonight should know that we moved about two months ago, so you have not been to my office right now on 93rd street right, off, Third, Avenue, literally acrosss the street from the Prince hotel, and we have a mask and hand sanitizer distribution this week we're going to release the flyer tomorrow, but it's this Thursday at three o'clock in front of my Bay Ridge office , It's this Thursday from four to five in front of our Bay Ridge Office And, we'll share the flyer on social media.
Thank you very much and now we have state Senator, Andrew, Gonardis, , We all know that we're going through a bit of a spike right now in southern Brooklyn, about half of my district is in a red or orange zone, which is obviously concerning we've seen some good downward trajectory of those numbers, but still not enough.
You know this has caused a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety and consternation about businesses and especially schools, because there are a number of schools which are in the yellow zone which remain closed, even though they are otherwise permissible to be open, really trying to push the governor's office to release a reopening strategy for these schools and for the businesses.
So I know, this is a significant quality of life concern that people are frustrated by Hopefully, we'll have some good news for your report on that.
And I just want to thank Community, Board, 10 and all its members for this invitation to quickly introduce myself, I'm the new commander for Fort Hamilton, along with command Star major Mccabe.
The great staff here in the leadership has worked hard to record a number of videos and create a number of information points that will be located on the Us Army Garrison, our Usag Fort Hamilton, Facebook page, as well as our youtube channel, and we've posted a number of videos with information from acrosss the directorates on the post that speak to what what we can do to help support our retirees and so that will be up and going beginning on.
We want to make sure we do not forget how important our retirees are and that they are service members for life Covid-19 going on, but this is a great city and we're My family is really enjoying our time.
We have sanitary items to help you with, and I just want to tell everybody, be safe, and I look forward to hearing the rest of the meeting and thank You. Thank you very much, and now we have with us nancy lulu from the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
I'd also like to say thank you to our executive committee for its work on the capital and budget priorities that we voted.
Over, the past month, I attended several budget consultation meetings with agencies of the city of New York to discuss overall budgetary needs, which were reflected in our priority list that were voted upon.
And, finally, I just want to share with board members, as has been our tradition and since we're not meeting in person, the board will be collecting food and loving memory of our late community board.
And, we just want to thank St Vincent to Paul on their resource to this district office and to the community board for their work at the food pantry and for St Patrick's church for continued distribution of thanksgiving food, baskets.
Our next General Board meeting will take place on Monday November 16th via zoom, and I'm, also going to be sharing the early voting information via our newsletter, as well as an email to board members.
Meetings are still a little new, so it was decided to have an informational meeting for the committee, which was also live streamed and is available on Youtube District Office did a mailing of over 2500 residents and businesses in the immediate area.
I know that the board has had some familiarity with this and so that we, because of the zoom platform, we broke it up committee meeting Then we will have the public.
It was our first meeting of the year and it was nice to greet new community committee members among them.
The goal of the meeting was to go over recommendations to the Office of Management and budget to expense, priorities for capital and other improvements needed in our district.
This meeting, a representative for the Brooklyn public library, was brought in to give updates to the libraries due to the Covid-19 situations going on in the schools right now, a representative from the DOE was not available.
Let us know when the next book drive is and another question was: What ways can people volunteer to help the library or virtual support?
This committee report is respectfully submitted by community board 10 youth, Services Chair, anthony on Monday October, 19th, 2020.
Thank, you very much anthony good job, and now we have a report from the Environmental Committee Question Foreign Dean In fact, the people creating the content, the virtual content.
In addition to this, the main proposed solution was to have volunteers girl scouts to be more specific following social distancing requirements come to help clean the corner basins in the community.
Do not think it may not be in time for this year, but I draw a comment and what Josephine said where beverage or our Community board district already has too many trees, and this is a problem parks.
