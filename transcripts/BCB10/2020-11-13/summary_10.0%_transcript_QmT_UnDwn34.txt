We want to just make sure that we know what's happening in the community and keep our ears open to know what we can do with some of the issues going.
The owner, Robert Ziati, who is here with us tonight, is taking over the adjacent premises, formerly known as Kimchi restaurant, on the corner of Third Avenue.
So I open this right now to the committee for any questions that we can ask Mr Robert, Zioni.
We are fully going to be taking advantage of the outdoor, dining New, York, City.
If anybody's ever opened up a restaurant you'll know it.
I, think Mr Ziadi answered my question regarding food and I.
How the committee works is that we say that we, the committee, moves to deny this application unless the owner agrees to the following stipulations and basically for this premises.
So I'm, going to move that we deny this application unless the owner agrees to the following stipulations: that the premises will continue to operate as a restaurant, that there will be no sale or consumption of alcohol on the premises until appropriate.
But the sound level will remain below the level permitted by the New York City Noise Code that there will be no use or music on the outside of the premises that the licensee shall not use any promoter or have promoted events that there will be no smoking permitted and that the applicant agrees that.
God knows when we'll get back to that, but I would I mean the bar on its own, like we're not going to have people cooking until 12, 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning on your application, I believe said.
A a mixology cocktail bar and one is going to be essentially a ramen noodle bar, and you know how do you work with this.
The interesting thing is the bar does not open until 6 pm, but I think it has to start changing to 11.
This item was added to the agenda following a resident who spoke in public session about concern about you, know, e-bikes and mopeds and motorized scooters riding during open.
All right, I think the next few weeks they will be legal like as bicycles are they have to follow the same rules as bikes.
I know, there's a lot of them on the road right now, but they're, almost essential.
You really do not hear them coming, you know, but on the sidewalk you're talking about right on the side like walking the streets, like.
We are like I said we did initially essay 25 was written, we're going to continue enforcing this.
The City Council has just passed recently passed legislation, so I think that's a legislative issue as far as their legalization and on the state level.
I mean there's new state and city regulations that have been passed and maybe something our Tnt committee could take a look at because right now the registration I believe is not required.
And they're going to classify themselves bicycles, not as like a moped or a motorcycle.
Is it a question of people, not knowing the law, or is it a question of sort of willful disregard or being under pressure to get the food out fast from the restaurant or why are so many people getting summonses.
With these bikes, you know, I mean which makes sense, given that everybody wants their food five minutes, ago.
You know you put it on the register like the restaurants that they have to instruct these.
I think it's not a bad idea, because we, you know on my way here there were two mopeds on the bike that did not appear to be restaurants.
So I think you know some education, maybe something we could tackle.
Even if somebody riding one of these bikes wanted to know what the state of the law is and what their requirements were, it would be hard to know.
People right, but I also think that the city has to maybe put something on the news you know and hit also the small cable stations in different languages, because there are people who are not associated with restaurants.
You know offices, whatever you can do to make this safer for all of us, the pedestrians, the other bike, the bicyclists and the cars.
But I think we need to maybe have a meeting with maybe our councilman to find out what's going on with at City Council, because the these these motorized bicycles are not considered motor vehicles they're not being registered, they do not have plates what happens if, if there's an accident with a with a pedestrian and somebody gets hurt.
We should have a meeting with the city Council, because my first question you know, involved the same issue.
You you're not going to continue that after Covid-19 is over no okay and there will be only background, recorded music.
Is we send up a motion to deny the application, unless, under the pretense that you will agree to the following stipulations and those stipulations are basically the same as the prior restaurant, I'm going to read them so right.
Unless the owner agrees to the following stipulations, but the premises will operate as a restaurant.
