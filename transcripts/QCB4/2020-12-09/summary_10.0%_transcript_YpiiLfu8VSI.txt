I. Don't know when we will have a regular board meeting again where we sit in a room with each other, perhaps sometime next year or the year after, and at that time things will seem somewhat more normal than what we have had.
They stopped at Yellowstone Boulevard on Queensborough, and I'm, not surprised by that because I just couldn't imagine those bike lanes going through Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, gobbling up parking spaces as it would have, and that would have been the end of that.
That's my big gripe with the DOT the way they claimed that you know this thing was going to work out and the best thing for everyone.
You guys know me, I, like to report throughout the night as items pop up tonight will be one of the first nights that the board is seeking an actual formalized vote on some items.
It's our first time trying something like this, Guys, again I'd much rather report throughout the night versus an actual report to bog down the meeting and again Luke again just above without just thank you for all the use that you've given us all right.
Members and I'll read your name and you can unmute them Christina, as you know that they're there Scully not here, okay, here, Mr Chine, you're, unmuted, Oh, I'm, sorry.
And I may be able to get you something, And I, don't know if it'll come from just one source, you know I think between breaking ground and homeless services and hope.
The last thing is an observation, looks like sanitation is getting their trucks out and making sure that their work in working order, because I passed two salt spreaders today and they're all with they with their plows on the front and everything.
I want to join people in thanking Lou for his service.
I, hope everyone's gonna, you know, be safe and enjoy the season, and thank you to Lou. Thank you for all your years of service.
We have a lot of knowledge behind those years and even though I I've, you know me, I've always wanted you to stay.
And I do believe that there are times we have to move forward, but just remember, Our knowledge could be of great help to all those that are coming in now that don't know the history that you and I went through.
So I, hope you think about that and stay with us a little longer as a board member I appreciate all the work and patience you had all these years.
Each person can just celebrate somebody's service that they saw in the coming in the past month, just as a way of highlighting the great things that happen in our neighborhoods.
You know, for instance, Today, again, I want to celebrate Greg and Christian for just walking the streets and checking out what's happening in terms of the homeless, condition.
So, just things like that, you know just I celebrate the community fridges that are popping up in Elmhurst and Corona, where people can freely drop off food and people can freely pick up food if there are 30 people on this call.
Everyone for your service to this board, I'm honored, to serve as your parks chair and on the executive board for another term here and have a happy holidays and a joyful new year, Thank you, Gregory Dewan Tariq, not Missy, I, don't think so.
Don't wish everyone a happy holiday and stay safe and healthy, I hope to see you guys next year in person, I, really looking forward to it.
Anyone here representing him, no Lou I, should also let you know that Jessica Gonzalez Rojas the assembly member Elect, is in the meeting at the moment.
Don't have too much to report, but I just want to announce that on Thursday, maybe a flu shot, that's going to be happening at the office flu shot drive sorry between 10 and 12.
We're going to continue the community cleanups starting sometime in January, Most likely and we're wrapping up a resume building drafting project where we solicited volunteers to help members of the community be able to build their resumes while we're we are wrapping up.
Secondly, just wanted to highlight that we've seen an increase in clothing, 19 cases and hospitalizations throughout New, York City, When we were in the higher midst of the pandemic.
The Department of Health, commissioner, had issued an advisory that adults over 65 and people with underlying health conditions should limit their activities outside the home and avoid public spaces gatherings this, as we are now looking at what is presumably the last tail end of this pandemic.
We, expect the first Pfizer shipment as early as December 15th, and if Moderna also is approved, That shipment will be a week later on the 22nd, So we're working on focusing on the populations with the greatest need, including high-risk health care, workers, nursing, home residents, People who work in our nursing homes, the 27 neighborhoods that were most deeply affected by the Chronovirus, including Corona and folks who live in public housing.
We've been figuring out kind of the different infrastructure pieces that we'll be using to support that effort, including the city-wide immunization registry, to monitor, inventory and administration, to make sure that everyone gets both doses, administered and I would just like to wish everybody a happy holiday, but ask that please not travel as we are asking that.
Yes, Is it true that New York City will not demand that its employees of various agencies, such as the police, department, Ems, the fire and so sport, and so on, will not demand that they take the vaccine once it is available at this time.
We actually had a tree-lining ceremony with Al partner, the President of 110th Community Council, and this past weekend we had the unveiling of our winter installation, which was created by local artists, Jason Kaye, the ecuadorian Civic Committee of New York.
It's not going to take a long time, but the survey will definitely allow us to understand how New Yorkers relationship to work and family are changing, because Covid-19 has upended experience of work.
Thank you from the New York City Public Advocates, Office, Jimani Williams, or his representative.
I'd like to turn the meeting over to you at this time, so that the presenters can come on and at some point, Obviously, you might have to interrupt so that the president can speak.
I, Don't know if there's any particular order that we're gonna be following, but all presenters have the ability to share their screens, So we'll just go in the order that you guys want to go in, but Christina and I are ready or whether I'll say Christina.
We have an application with the border standards and appeals for a gas station at 80 to 11 Queens boulevard we'd like to convert the auto repair shop into a convenience, store, we're going to be making a lot of changes to the site.
We haven't received any opposition to the proposal, so it looked like a straightforward, application, I, think.
This proposal builds on two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods, recover and rebuild, and since then, Dcps conducted research and outreach with many, which revealed many issues that communities are still facing as they try to prepare their buildings for flooding and other future risks.
Second, There's a set of provisions for buildings to be constructed to resilience, resiliency standards that go beyond the current level of flood risk, such as constructing their occupiable spaces at a higher elevation and third we're proposing options for property owners in the flood plain to invest in small changes to their building over time, like raising mechanical equipment out of the basement, without being required to raise or fully floodproof the structure which can be very expensive and finally, There's a set of there's a goal set of providing provisions that apply to the entire city.
The proposal would allow power systems, and that includes generate generators, batteries and fuel cells and other, Like energy storage, systems, to be considered, permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts to facilitate their installment and not have property owners bumping into zoning constraints, When they're doing this, and the zoning relief enacted after Hurricane Sandy called the 2013 flood text allowed some homes in the high-risk floodplain to place generators in their yards as permitted obstructions, and now this text of supposing to allow buildings across the city to do this so long as the power generators would meet the limits the size and location, including that they must be located at least five feet from lot lines and can't exceed a height of 15 or sorry, 10:15 or 23 feet, and that all depends on the zoning district.
The proposal would classify both ramps and lifts as permitted obstructions and all required open areas to facilitate these accessible designs, And another important issue is how disasters, especially those that require the evacuation of residents, impact, vulnerable populations, So, looking at the sighting of nursing homes to address this concern.
Considering the situation that we're going through right now with Covid-19, the proposal would include an enabling two sets of rules to help support more predictable, long-term recovery, efforts.
If they're closed for two years, basically, will the this text would allow that use to come back, so the city's specifically using these items for the Covid-19 pandemic, the mayor's executive order for recovery for the pandemic.
So for this text amendment in terms of next steps, This is being referred out to all community boards for presidents and to the city council in this Euler process.
Community boards are being asked to submit the recommendations, the city planning commission by December 28th of this year.
Your stress levels have increased, certainly in certain times cheering the community board, but I want to thank you for your service to this board to Christian as well, and I also want to welcome the New Board.
That I think would be helpful to our community, So I look forward to the work ahead with you on that I'll.
She really was the boa president and worked extremely hard to ensure that our communities, in that our borough could move forward and also I want to say that it's been a seamless transition.
We worked very closely to make sure that you know the functions of the office would not be interrupted during the transition.
You know the community boards are charter mandated function, And I want to make sure that we're serving you and being helpful in the areas you may feel weak, and you should help me in the areas that you think I'm weak.
This is a non-euler, but it is still referred out to community boards, So. I mean I think, obviously in districts that are much more heavily affected by coastal floods and disasters of that sort.
The board can certainly vote on this and submit that I think there was some talk about providing a letter that would be fun.
I'm only mad to marilyna, You know we can go the actual about each person, one by one, yes, no, whatever it may be, or as I explained to Kathy, We could do something where we can say something on write, a letter to say you know, While the board did not give a formalized vote, the following questions and or concerns were brought up, and we just leave it at that.
Okay, All right I mean that would affect several items that we have going on tonight, because we have items that require an actual vote, but.
The zoning district that you're in it would depend it doesn't preclude that you know they wouldn't be able to do these things.
I. Guess the recommendation, because we don't have a board vote, today, unfortunately, but thank you so much.
And I'm, the senior director for government and community relations at the New York City School construction, authority.
Thank you for having us here tonight, so that we can discuss a proposed amendment to the city maps, to accommodate the two public schools Ps315 and is 311 that were constructed in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
The schools were constructed to address the capacity needs at the primary and intermediate school levels in district 24, specifically in the Corona area, The schools were constructed on city-owned land, which included parts of the 44th Avenue on the city map identified, but never built out as a street.
The city map amendment will reconfigure 44th Avenue to remove the street designation from the areas within which the schools and other buildings are located and conform.
So we're going to be doing Christina, Ropal, okay, all right, Alex, Owens, I, guess two simplified is steam mapping just removing it from the city.
The city map change will not affect zoning in any way all right.
Okay, So it's not going to like you're, not going to be planning to build more schools, so the school's open, they've been open since I believe 2015 and 2016.
I would just urge city planning to take a look at the length of the avenue all the way to 114th street.
When Transportation committee looked at the bus plan a year ago that came from the transit authority, They were turning buses onto 40, 44th, Avenue, 43rd, Avenue, I, think based on the map, not knowing how narrow the actual street is.
I think that this is really a true one-off, in that it was city-owned land already, and it was reassigned for construction of very much needed, Schools and.
There's, a ton of noise outside my window, thanks to Con Edisonison in their monopoly, so Parks Committee, report, I'll, just lead up with a few things that were passed along from Janice Melnack, related to question that has grown apart when I asked for more transparency, since we never find out about things until the groundbreaking or the day of so this one was, you know in the news, but just as a for those that didn't see it, they did complete phase one of the Fatman Affairs capital, project.
Thank you to the board members on my committee that showed up to that meeting.
I really appreciate that, as well as several people from the community that came to the Parks Committee meeting in advance of that we talked a lot about.
You know at the onset of the disconnect happening between city agencies and the public and working very hard to get answers on that, and you know I'm not afraid to ask the tough questions as it relates to why we're not getting answers.
As, you guys will know, We have two very active community garden, both of them in Corona.
Comes people can come by grab some compost take some leaves home, While I am on the subject of community gardens and, as you said, Gregory lack of response on behalf of the Parks Department, You guys will know that we've been talking about the garden, also in Corona down on Vancleep and West Side Avenue here in Corona, And I call it a garden because it's set to be one years, back.
Our committee, you know, met with or heard one of the community members who proposed it.
I. Think to our satisfactory and our committee again voted and to recommend the approval of this renewal, and essentially they already do already have a license, but they were just moving locations and so going through.
He's asking for additional contacts around concerns and I was going to suggest that if we could form a small working group, maybe in the next meeting, anyone who would like to join Gregory certainly.
Let you know that the Sur teams throughout the city were distributing PPE at the orange and yellow zoned areas and are continuing to do.
I asked a few questions of from the officers and they said they sent me this because they couldn't make it to our meeting, but I asked if any of the officers or staff has come down with Covid-19 being that we're going into our second phase.
Those, who know that we're trying to push like for a graffiti replacement project instead of the community board, giving paint to the precinct every year for them to put up a canvas more graffiti to go up, which is going to try to have a replace with graffiti there's.
You know, Maybe it's a good thing to get a working group or something like this as well.
Okay, So then we're looking for a letter of recommendation for the four items mention this week.
I think I just want to you know.
You know anything, somebody who's better by all within the next week or two I believe, but everything else is questionable and can go.
If, it's not going to count, You know why I make a recommendation, but anything that has to be voted on.
Somehow, you guys want to hang like I, said, I, can't really say much to that.
You know we're not worrying about a big building going up and such so I would like to state on file that we should write a letter and go from there.
You want you know, We could do the letter.
The Covid-19 maintenance, right, because, If you think about it, next, could have this issue so want to.
Okay, so I would definitely say on the zoning for flooding and 44th Avenue D mapping, We could do a letter of recommendation.
We can say yes, if the epic, if it doesn't work, then the applicant can come back and say: they're gonna have to wait until the next board.
I, wouldn't rush, it, I, would, I, don't even know if the City council, voted, I, believe.
