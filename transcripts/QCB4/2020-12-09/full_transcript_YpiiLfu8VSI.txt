If we did, that would be. This would be the first time since Covid-19 that we actually did the golden events. Okay, so fine, we'll skip that part and we'll get right to the cheer praises report and I'll say that good evening again to everyone- and thank you for coming to the meeting- and this is my last meeting as cheer person I will remain on the board till the end of my current term and then I'll decide what I will do after that. I would like to say it's been a long time longer than I thought. It would have been I thought two years ago. My term had ended, and that was going to be that. But things came up and here I am again, but this is the last time that I will definitely be cheer on this board. It is certainly time for some fresh ideas, new ideas- some may be better, some may not be, but it is time for change and Marilina will do an excellent job. This chair, I'm sure and her executive board, will help her and I hope they do help her as much as they can, because it is important that you get a an executive board that will support you in your adventures. I don't know when we will have a regular board meeting again where we sit in a room with each other, perhaps sometime next year or the year after, and at that time things will seem somewhat more normal than what we have had. I would like to say that out of all the city agencies that I've dealt with the one agency, that seems to bother me the most is the department of traffic and I'll. Tell you why, aside from the bike lanes, which I still don't think they are in the right places where they should be and I don't think, they're used nearly enough for what they said. They were going to be used for. We have motorized bikes now which, and we have motorized scooters and other things which I guess will use those bike lanes at some point now. But when I objected to the bike lanes on Queens Boulevard I was told that those bike lanes would be going all the way up: Queens Boulevard to Hillside Avenue. Those bike lanes do not do that. They stopped at Yellowstone Boulevard on Queensborough, and I'm not surprised by that because I just couldn't imagine those bike lanes going through Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, gobbling up parking spaces as it would have, and that would have been the end of that. Well, it's not the end of that and from the plans that I have seen. The bike lanes will never go through Queens boulevard through those community boards that I just mentioned. They will have bike lanes, but they won't be on Queens boulevard in some cases at least that's the current plan, so I know some of the bike advocates are insane. Where are those bike lanes that are supposed to grow, Queens boulevard wealth, but what I've seen that may never happen. So that's my big gripe with the DOT the way they claimed that you know this thing was going to work out and the best thing for everyone and it was gonna, go where it should have gone. Maybe or it's not gonna go but other than that. That's the only thing I have to say tonight here and we will continue the meeting with Christian. Are you ready, I guess Christian's, not ready, you're, muted, question, you're, muted, oh mute me! No Christian was muted, oh he's! Okay! No! All right! Okay, he's just arranging yeah he's just throwing genius yeah! Sorry about that. I'm here, yeah I, I'm using my phone instead of my laptops and I'm sorry about that. I'm doing the same thing. You're doing, yeah I! Think a lot of us so yeah I'm good to go. If that's okay, so good evening. Excuse me good evening: everybody I'll start, of course by reflecting who said Lou I got I, can't see you right now, but if I had you in front of me, I would say you know what I thank you so much for all the years that work with you have a lot of years of doing this together, I haven't worked with the chair as much to have with you lots of up and downs ups and downs rather, but you did bring up a very good point in that there is a very strong executive committee behind you, or rather behind Maryland, as it was behind you, the executive me has remained exactly the same. It's not so much about how strong the chair is. It's about the chair, the vice chair of the second place, it's the full committee and you guys have an excellent slate. I've heard some of the ideas. There were a lot of ideas that we've been trying to get moved on for the last couple of years and we haven't been able to for several reasons, but you know the idea is that this is. It is it's a very active committee. It's a very proactive committee, a lot of positive ideas and they've been very supportive of everything. We've done thus far and I think that tradition will continue so Congrats to the new committee to Marilyna, as our new chair and I believe she's going to be chairing at least half of this meeting and Lou really on behalf of myself and the staff we already spoke about this. Just really thank you for all the years that tb4 could not be where it was today without you, and really thank you for that. So now, as far as CB4 reports yeah, it's been somewhat of it. That month, I have to admit we had a couple of tree: lightings I, won't I will discuss every single one of them, because I'm pretty sure the elected officials will join us at some point to do that on their own behalf, I was fortunate enough. I was unfortunate to not be able to attend all of them, but actually my cold, because I just came issue. Excuse me, I, just read the word issue of my screen. I just came in from the almost tree lighting, which is actually very well attended. Congratulations to the Amherst crew for yet again bringing a wonderful tree light and the ambulance goes there. We were honored by Catalina Cruz, who also joined, and several committee members James Mcinerney was there. We did the usual reading of the night before Christmas lots going on socially distant, and it was an excellent event for what it was. I mean it's we're hanging in there, there's not really much going on with the board guys. I'm sorry, I'm kidding, but yeah I. As you guys know me, I like to report throughout the night as items pop up tonight will be one of the first nights that the board is seeking an actual formalized vote on some items. Up until now, we've been just kind of getting away with just giving advisory, not necessarily doing formal votes but God willing. If we have a forum tonight, it'll be the first time that we'll actually have a formula as well so bear with us. It's our first time trying something like this and yeah guys again I'd much rather report throughout the night versus an actual report to bog down the meeting and again Luke again just above without just thank you for all the use that you've given us all right. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Christian and with that I will open session one there's nothing for me to read: I, don't think and if there was I couldn't see it anyway. Now I'm not on my computer, but I will start with the board. Members and I'll read your name and you can unmute them Christina, as you know that they're there Scully not here, okay, here Mr Chine, you're, unmuted yeah. Oh I'm, sorry! No! You can speak now, Mr Chan! You can speak now, yeah! It's now he said I can see it. Yes, do you have anything you want to say to the board yeah just say everybody keep safe and be happy and do whatever you want to do. Okay! Thank you, Mr Kim! Thank you. Let's move on to Yi Chin! Yes, he's here, Andy! Yes, I'm here hi, guys, there's nothing to report. Just you know: try to have everybody, you know stay safe, be a second wave for Covid-19 is coming back and you know stay safe, stay healthy! That's what I'm trying to say and you know happy holidays to everybody. Thank you. David Chung, good evening. Everyone wishing everyone a warm and pleasant holidays. Okay, thank you! Linda Corral, yes, Linda is here hi there happy holidays to everyone. Okay, thank you! Lorena Diaz, Good evening, everybody happy holidays. Thank you, Michelle Dunstan. She was here earlier. If I don't see her now: okay, Aria Estonia. Oh sorry, happy holidays. Everyone I just want to thank Lou Walker. Thank you, Mr chairman, for doing all you do I've known you since I've started my career and it was a pleasure serving the board while you were there so happy holidays. Everyone. Thank you now, hi everyone. Yes, I'm here, I just want to say, happy holidays to everyone, Merry Christmas, problem celebrate and happy new year. Hopefully you all have a nice healthy new year coming up and also Lou. This is your last meeting, so I hope you have a good time and we thank you all for your service to this board and we'll see you, of course, you know as a regular board member but we're going to miss you as our chairperson, thanks Lou. Thank you, Christina Gonzalez, no I, don't believe Kristen is here Christian. Sorry, let's go now. Lord seller, no he's not here: okay, James Lisa, no Salvatore, Lombardo, no Carol Mucholski, yes, she's on via telephone. Give me one. Second and I will unmute her carol, you're unmuted, okay, good evening. Everyone I have a question and then an observation I'd like to know if we have any stats on homeless persons residing in our district. Do we silence I? Guess the answer is no well, I'm not sure I'll be honest with you good question, I'm not sure they're, probably I, don't know we would probably have to find them. Yes, I've seen go ahead. This summer, I did see one man that was literally camped out for quite a while on a fire hydrant at 57th, Avenue and 9th Street 99th Street, and then he was gone. So I guess somebody came and moved to Mel Square there's also been someone using a doorway on the wall of the Walgreens. That's located at Broadway and Corona Avenue I thought there was somebody living in a pop-up tent in that doorway. It turned out that it was a storage, a pop-up storage facility, because someone opened it up and scattered everything on the sidewalk, and that made me think about do how many homeless do we have residing in our district. So what I can answer? Is this really quickly? Is that while I may not be able to get them specifically for this district around this time every year, it's usually actually around I want to say like mid to end of January there's something called the hope count, and that's the homeless population like that, and that's that that's due now. You could certainly check the results for the Hope Council, the 2020, but the 2021 obviously hasn't taken place. Yet I can certainly try to find out how many we have without district and I'm guessing. Those numbers would not necessarily come from department of services, but perhaps some breaking grounds breaking ground. They have their own operation going and we have a very good relationship with Alejandra Magana over there who maybe Gregory can speak to us. We did a recent walk of the entire of a pretty heavy section of Elmhurst and we were devastated over just how much was out there, but I can't give you exact numbers, but I certainly feel those numbers can be here. Even the guesstimate would be fine. I'm like I said I only noticed because I really haven't gone into subways since my accident, and there used to be at least two men living in the subway on Grand, Avenue, I, don't know what the story is now, but it's seeing the other evidence of homeless people in that I've passed. I wondered what the how many there are in the district are we are they just invisible and we only see evidence of their carts or what not piled up in one place. It was just a thought that was dealing with everything. I will certainly put every effort, I have I, don't think this would be a very difficult thing to do. The truth is either the number exists or it doesn't and we're definitely good at finding numbers. That's for sure, so I don't want to put a time for a minute, but give me at least until the end of the week. Maybe it's easier searching tomorrow and I may be able to get you something and I don't know if it'll come from just one source, you know I think between breaking ground and homeless services and hope count. We can come up with something, but I'll certainly send something. Okay, the other. The last thing is an observation, looks like sanitation is getting their trucks out and making sure that their work in working order, because I passed two salt spreaders today and they're all with they with their plows on the front and everything so I guess they're doing a run through, which is fine, I'm all in favor of the equipment being in working order when we do get a snowstorm and that's all I have to say at the moment. Thank you. Carol I will say that there are definitely hundreds, possibly could be a thousand in this whole area because remember, the district has at least 150 plus thousand people, so I would say at least hundred for sure. I've seen many myself so I've counted, but yeah there are quite a few more than maybe people think there are put it that way. Then I guess I'm at go ahead. Maybe I'm at a part of the district that doesn't see many of them. Maybe they'll congregate more toward the northern part of the district. That's quite possible! Yes, all right! Next Sunil Mahat, please, no I, don't see him on okay, Patricia Martin, no Sylvia Martin, no Matthew knock on Roy. Yes, Matt is on okay, Matt you're unmuted thanks Chris I want to join people in thanking Lou for his service. I, greatly appreciate any anyone who can run a tight meeting in Lou does I also agree with Lou on a bike question which I hope Lou is sitting down. I also feel strongly say that again Lou, I'm sorry, no I didn't say anything. I actually laughed and I am sitting down, but we can certainly agree on some things. Go ahead. I just I agree that the Bible should go on to Hillside Avenue to be on that, nothing to say, happy holidays to everybody and Ravinia whom I phoned earlier is not feeling well and not joining us tonight, but told me to say to everybody happy holidays, I'm out. Thank you, Matt thank you and I will go to Edgar Moyer next, let me see he did say he was going to be calling in. Let me see if he's called in yet no he's, not in yet okay, Ruby Muhammad, no Michelle Dunstan is him. Now, though, if you want to go back to Michelle real quick, oh yes, Michelle Dunstan is here you say yes, okay, let's go back to Michelle I heard y' all calling my name, and you could not hear me so I'm so thankful, I wish I sat under you a little longer, but I had been coming to the meetings many years before, I was able to be a part of the board for, and we will miss you and thank you for your service, happy holidays to everyone. God Bless be safe. Thank you, Ruby Muhammad, no, okay, Sandra, Munoz, no good, Oliver, no I, don't see her Alexander Owen, yeah I, don't have much to say, but everybody happy holidays and thank you for your service. It's been a pleasure working with you these past few years. Thank you. Luke can I just jump in really quickly how many years exactly have you been on? 21 no I mean that's chair, probably 14 of the last 18. Something like that. Okay, that's what I thought! Thank you cool! Thank you all right, Alexa punch, I, don't think. I saw her. No Rapinderaj, no Ashley Reed. Yes, Ashley is here Ashley you're on muted, thank you Christina, and you know just to echo what everyone else said: happy holidays to everyone, I hope everyone's gonna, you know, be safe and enjoy the season and thank you to Lou. Thank you for all your years of service. Thank you for your guidance. Thank you for the wisdom that you imparted on all of us and we will miss you. Thank you for what you've done. Thank you ask for real I. Don't think. I saw him. No okay, Neil Roman, no Kristen Romero, yes, I did see Christian you're unmuted. Thank you, Christina hi, everyone good evening. Nothing major to report. I wish everyone a happy new year thanks! Thank you! Ruiz, no Clara, Salad, yes, I did see. Yes, we can hear you happy holidays for everyone. Happy new year I know we are going to lose your literacy, that's what you are you're all about to visit. Thank you for all this years of service. Okay, thank you. Clara Lucy, Chilero, yes, Lucy is on give me one second Lucy you're, unmuted, okay, Hilo! It's I just want to say that we go back. Many years and we have a lot of knowledge behind those years and even though I I've, you know me, I've always wanted you to stay on and I do believe that there are times we have to move forward, but just remember, our knowledge could be of great help to all those that are coming in now that don't know the history that you and I went through. So I hope you think about that and stay with us a little longer as a board member I appreciate all the work and patience you had all these years. It takes a lot to do that when you are a chair and for everyone else, happy holidays and may the new year bring the best for all of us. That's it. Thank you, Lucy a Red Sevilla. Yes, the red is on thanks, Christina Happy holidays to everybody. Hope you guys have a good one in the coming weeks. Do I want to add to some of the sentiment that was already offered. Thank you for the service that a community really appreciate all the energy that you put in, especially the use of that gavel. If there's a, if there's one thing I, if there's one thing I took comfort in Lou, is that you will not let a meeting get out of hand and there's a comfort in that. You know knowing that there is a strong presence that can keep things going so I wanted to. Thank you just for the service that you've demonstrated toward Corona. So thank you and then just an observation and a suggestion. For me, an observation is that we no longer start off with crime statistics which I think is fantastic. I was never a fan of starting off with crime. Statistics I think that's backward. A suggestion is that maybe in the coming months we can start off with service statistics. You know if each of us gets a chance to just share a little bit. Maybe each person can just celebrate somebody's service that they saw in the coming in the past month, just as a way of highlighting the great things that happen in our neighborhoods. You know, for instance, today again, I want to celebrate Greg and Christian for just walking the streets and checking out what's happening in terms of the homeless condition. So just things like that, you know just I celebrate the community fridges that are popping up in Elmhurst and Corona, where people can freely drop off food and people can freely pick up food if there are 30 people on this call. Imagine 30 highlights of the past month about the neighborhood that we're in so just a suggestion. Again, God bless you guys, happy holidays. Thank you. Reg Alton, Derek, Smith, hello, everyone and Happy holidays a little bit so much into what you do until things just doesn't seem to be enough. I think we read was saying a celebration in what you have done and God bless you and your new endeavors and we'll talk later. Thank you, Gregory. So I'll take the teacher's approach here by sandwiching the disappointing news in between two good things. So, first off to echo everyone's sentiment here, Lou thank you for your service and for leading this board. Definitely not an easy job and you did it with style and grace. So thank you. My disappointing news is I continue to see a massive disconnect between city agencies and the community board and I'll speak more to the parks related issues for my committee report. But, to cite something recently, you know is related to what Lou was saying about the bike lanes. I actually see pedestrian safety is something that's a huge concern for me now that my two and a half year old Austin is walking and largely running everywhere. So you know, I brought up this intersection, that's right by the hospital, which obviously is seeing more and more. You know traffic in terms of people at the hospital people lined up for the hospital for Covid-19 tests, but the intersection you know of 79th street and 41St Avenue. There there's really no clear signage on what cars are supposed to do, and you know to cite a few examples. This was a few years ago, but my wife is almost killed by a car when she was pregnant that same intersection has now you know almost three years later, nothing has been done and you know the response that we keep hearing on certain things is, you know we'll look into it, we'll find something, and you know we need answers sooner. So that's all I'll say about that and, lastly, thank you. Everyone for your service to this board, I'm honored to serve as your parks chair and on the executive board for another term here and have a happy holidays and a joyful new year. Thank you, Gregory Dewan Tariq, not Missy, I, don't think so. No he's not on my cello tester, no she's, not on Linwen Yang, yes, she's on meanwhile you're unmuted, okay, don't wish everyone a happy holiday and stay safe and healthy, I hope to see you guys next year in person, I really looking forward to it. Okay, thank you. Minwin. We will continue the meeting with the elected officials. I will start with the U.S Senate Charles e Schumer. Anyone here representing him, no Lou I, should also let you know that Jessica Gonzalez Rojas the assembly member Elect, is in the meeting at the moment. Okay, thank you. Kristen Gillibrand, no okay from the House of Representative Representatives, Grace, Mink, yeah Christian is here Christian you're on neuter. Thank you again, Christina hello, everyone again not much to report on behalf of the Congresswomans and she did ask me to wish everyone happy holidays. A happy new year remind everyone that we will always be available as the cases around the state and the country continue to go up. We remain easily accessible, I hope by now. I trust. By now, everyone has my direct number but feel free to reach out. If you don't, if you have any questions concerns, if you see something if you're unsure, please just let us know we're happy to help we're happy to point you in the right direction. So on behalf of the Congresswoman Happy Holidays Happy New year, and thank you okay, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez! Oh, let me see. No I don't see her usual person. If anyone is representing Lux official. Please message me in the chat so I can know you're here. I do not see her usual right. Okay, thank you. We will move on and come back to the Rep if they come. Brian Barnwell I should first announce the New York State Assembly Brian Barnwell, no okay, Michael Dendeka, no okay. At this time we will let the elected person who is taking his place, speak hi, everyone. My name is Jessica Gonzalez Rojas, I'm excited to be the member elect for the 34th Assembly district, which includes the neighborhood of Jackson, Heights, East, Elmhurst, Corona and Woodside. So I'm just want to send greetings. Wishing everyone a happy holidays, I start officially on January 6 and I'm building a team and I'll look forward to working very closely with this board in order to make sure that we have folks that will work very closely with the members and be part of any activities that you require our presence. So I'm super excited to partner and look forward to working together. Thank you, Jeffrey for your tenure and congratulations to Christian for his leadership. Okay, thank you. Jeffrey on Aubry, now Catalina Crew, Alex I. Don't have too much to report, but I just want to announce that on Thursday, maybe a flu shot, that's going to be happening at the office flu shot drive sorry between 10 and 12, we're going to continue the community cleanups starting sometime in January, most likely and we're wrapping up a resume building drafting project where we solicited volunteers to help members of the community be able to build their resumes while we're we are wrapping up. If there are people who need resumes drafted, feel free to call Owens a NY, Assembly.Gov and we'd be happy to help happy, have a safe and happy holidays. Thank you from the New York State Senate Michael Janares, no Jessica Ramo, not that I can see Toby and Stavisky no okay from the New York from the mayor's office. Jessica. Yes, she is here, give me one second to add her in okay, Jessica you're in hi folks I have a couple of things to highlight. One. The mayor announced the NYC Lmi storefront loan via the department of small business services. This is targeting certain zip codes low to moderate income, zip codes, including for phase two of this program, one three, six, eight and Corona, and one three, seven. Three and Elmer's. The applications can be submitted, starting December 14th for those zip codes, and what this includes is the eligibility to apply for a zero interest loan up to a hundred thousand dollars and the criteria for these businesses is that they employ between two and ninety nine employees and have had business operations since or before January, 1st 2018 and again specifying those two zip 11368-11373 for more information. You can go to Nyc.Gov Storefront loan. Secondly, just wanted to highlight that we've seen an increase in clothing, 19 cases and hospitalizations throughout New, York City, when we were in the higher midst of the pandemic. Over the summer, the city had announced its plan to maintain a 90-day stockpile of PPE, and we have now amassed 150 pieces of that personal protective equipment to maintain that stockpile. The Department of Health commissioner had issued an advisory that adults over 65 and people with underlying health conditions should limit their activities outside the home and avoid public spaces gatherings this, as we are now looking at what is presumably the last tail end of this pandemic. We've been working with the state in discussions of how we're going to roll out the coding 19 vaccines, which have now been approved by the FDA. We expect the first Pfizer shipment as early as December 15th and if Moderna also is approved, that shipment will be a week later on the 22nd, so we're working on focusing on the populations with the greatest need, including high-risk health care workers, nursing home residents, people who work in our nursing homes, the 27 neighborhoods that were most deeply affected by the Chronovirus, including Corona and folks who live in public housing. We've been building out capacity for ultra cold storage and special freezers that will be needed as infrastructure to support the vaccine. Rollout and we've been figuring out kind of the different infrastructure pieces that we'll be using to support that effort, including the city-wide immunization registry, to monitor, inventory and administration to make sure that everyone gets both doses, administered and I would just like to wish everybody a happy holiday, but ask that please not travel as we are asking that. Let's not travel this holiday season to minimize the spread. Thank you. Jessica I have a question for you. Yes, is it true that New York City will not demand that its employees of various agencies, such as the police department, Ems, the fire and so sport, and so on, will not demand that they take the vaccine once it is available at this time? No okay! Thank you. The New York City Council Francisco Moya. Yes, there is one person here, give me one. Second, Ernie you're unmuted hi good evening: everyone, it's byronie! So I'm just going to talk a little bit about past events, so on November 21st, our office kicked off a turkey giveaway that it was in East elmers, and it was the first one. We collaborated with multiple organizations both at the local and city level. In total we had around four events and we gave around 1,000 turkeys, so that was fantastic. We also had flu shot event with Elmer's hospital and First Baptist church. Yesterday we actually had a tree-lining ceremony with Al partner, the President of 110th Community Council, and this past weekend we had the unveiling of our winter installation, which was created by local artists, Jason Kaye, the ecuadorian Civic Committee of New York. It was located at William, F, Moore Park. Unfortunately, I don't like to use this word. It was vandalized over the weekend, however, it's currently being fixed, so hopefully we'll post soon on social media, once it's back up and open to the public, where people can take pictures safely. As the council member likes to say it's better than Rockefeller Center, it's truly a wonderful spectacle to see so we do have upcoming events. We will have upcoming toy distribution events. We are always, of course, currently finalizing the details for the flyers, so please check our social media regularly and look out for the flyer with the information. As always, if you have questions or concerns, please feel free to call our office at thank 718-651-1917 you're welcome, Daniel Drumm. Yes, we have Kelly Woo Kelly you're unmuted. Thank you good evening. Everyone. So, like Christian said earlier, our office hosted a cheerleading event earlier today, when partnership with assembly member Karolina, Kuzofus I wasn't at the event. But I heard that Christian said it has a good turnout which is good and then for from our office. There's no much update. We continue to provide legal services, a current service for the community. We provide general legal service and immigration. We will have next section for general and immigration. Next Wednesday and Thursday. We still have appointments available.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out our office. Phone number is 718-8036373. That's the thing from me: I wish everyone a happy holiday, Merry, Christmas and Happy new year. Thank you from the new Queensborough President Donovan Richards. Is there anyone here representing him pro President Richards will be joining us in about 10 minutes? Okay, fine! Thank you will come back to him, then from the New York City Comptroller's office, Scott Stringer or his representative. Yes, we have Elaine Sam she's on the phone Elaine you're unmuted. Thank you. Can you hear me? Okay? Yes, we can hear you. Okay, thank you, hello. Everyone I just want to say to you that the controller's office and a better balance or it's a group- are surveying New Yorkers about flexibility in their workplaces, and this I think we're going to close out the survey very soon the service available in English and hispanic as on the controller's website. So our office send a survey to Committee, Board, 4 and all other committee boards in Queens. I would like to kindly ask the board to maybe send out the survey again to everyone, but you can also go onto the controller's website and just fill it out. It's not going to take a long time, but the survey will definitely allow us to understand how New Yorkers relationship to work and family are changing, because Covid-19 has upended experience of work and we're also tracking the outcomes of new protections codified in city and state law. So the survey data is really important. It will help us identify policy recommendations. Thank you all very much and happy holidays. Thank you from the New York City Public Advocates, Office, Jimani Williams or his representative. No one has identified themselves from his office, so I don't believe so. Okay, we'll go on to the queen's Va. If anyone here from the queen's Va's office, no, it doesn't appear so. Okay, so Mr Richards is not ready. Quite yet correct. Yes, okay, we'll come back to him. I would just like to wish everybody a happy Hanukkah, a Merry, Christmas, Happy, Kwanzaa Happy New year and any other holiday that you might be celebrating wish you the best I will say that is it. I will wait for the bro president to come and then I will be partying. Thank you. I have to go okay, and someone just contacted me. They are here from the Da's office. We have Elizabeth, so I'm gonna add her in a second okay, Elizabeth you're unmuted hi good evening. Everyone this is Elizabeth, I'm representing Christie, Melinda, Cass office and I. Just have a couple of things to report on this. On the past, Saturday Queen's d8 joined by the NYPD to sponsor the gun bike back program at Astoria, so we took 45Guns off the streets and secondly- and we know during the pandemics, the domestic violence, we heard a lot of complaints.

If I may, if I can entertain really quick but I actually received a I, can't hear you who's that screaming back so yeah I actually have an update from Michelle over at Ocasio-Cortez's office. That I like to read, I'm sorry I was just settling in, but I'm officially in now. So that's okay. I'd like to take the time now until we wait for our borough, president I can read that on there. Okay, so just bear with me hold on here. We go all right so good evening. Members and leadership of Community Board for Congresswoman, Cortez and Iraq, sending you all season greetings and wishing you and your loved one to joyous holiday season. As for community updates, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez hosted her monthly town hall on November 12th. She shared the most recent guidance of the city and state on Kovid19 and took questions and const, and we took questions from constituents. If you missed the event, you can watch the recording on our YouTube page at Rep Aoc, and there is a link there and I'll share that with you guys, if not tonight, at the very least by tomorrow, our December town hall, the final town, Hall 4 of the first term, will be on December 17th at 6:30 p.m. We will offer a term in review and then Congresswoman will take questions from participants to join the upcoming town hall. You can register here and again that's a link that we'll share with you guys prior to Thanksgiving. Excuse me the congresswoman recognized on the floor of Congress, the centennial of the jewish center of Jackson Heights. We are proud of their long history of service to our jewish Americans and wider queen's community. If you'd like to see her remarks, you may see them on YouTube at Rep Aoc again we'll share that link this week. She is expected to honor the queen's County Council of veterans of foreign war for the centennial. If you know of other institutions or individuals that recommend for recognition, please reach out via email at michellediane.com at mail, DOT house, DOT, J, DOT, Gov and again I will share that with you guys, a legislative update. Last week, a bipartisan group of senators released a new Covid-19 relief package which speaker, Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Schumer, have since endorsed. It includes an additional 300 per week in unemployment benefits, small business aid and funding for local governments and vaccine distribution. Last week in a financial service committee hearing, the Congresswoman also urged Secretary Munchen to re. Excuse me: yeah mission to release 175 billion in relief loan Congress has already approved small businesses and estates and again I will share those remarks for the remainder of the legislation. Session of this legislative session, Congress will be focused on passing a defense spending bill and government funding bill. As for constituent services, and this is their final statement, our office continues to assist constituents with federal casework. Our staff continues to work from home and we continue to accept cases at our website, Ocasio-Cortez DOT house, DOT Gov or over the phone at seven 718-662-5970. We will send out notifications about upcoming events through our mailing list. If you aren't already signed up for our mailing list, you can do so at the link below that will share in the chat in either English Spanish and again. I will get that all to you guys very soon and that's it. No more updates on my side as far as Cortez's office goes thank you got it. Okay, you're waiting for the borough. President yeah, we had earlier told him eight o'clock, but so he should be on, hopefully in the next three minutes or so. Okay, all right. Oh here's, an actual specific time, I didn't know yeah. Okay, did anybody come in that you saw Christina from our board members that hadn't spoken? Yes, there's? Actually a few Pat Martin is one Lucy Ceravo Scully is another. We actually have Tristan Christina yeah, Kristen Gonzalez, also all right. Well, let's start with Luffy there's a scully. She can speak okay, Lucy, you're, unmuted! Sorry, thank you! Lou, I'm gonna, miss you and I concur with Red's comment on the gavel loved it. Thank you. So much for your service, I, have to say I learned a lot from you and it was an honor to serve with you on this board. You, okay, going down the list. Kristen Gonzalez I! Guess this b-neck all right! Kristen hi! Can you guys hear splash see me yeah? Okay, awesome, hi, everyone! It's all! It's really good to see everyone's faces! I just want to echo Lou, especially you know. Having completed my first term on the board, it's been so great learning from you and being a part of the board and seeing your leadership. So thank you so much and I'm definitely like I hope that you still come around and see all of us I will. Thank you. That's good to hear I think my computer is also freezing a little bit. So apologies, if maybe there's a lag on my end but I'll head back to you Lucy all right. You said Pat, Martin, I, think you said it's here too now: yeah, okay, Patricia Martin, hi Martin. We can hear you well! You know I've been trying to get on for almost a half over half an hour for some reason that Webnet would not let me on but I get on and I'm in shock, because when I think of the board, it's you Lou. So I'm stunned that as I'm turning on there, everybody is saying goodbye. I'm stunned I can't believe it, but your service I remember when I first came on the board, it was a fiery board, I mean it was arguments and you were banging down the gavel and calling for order, and then I've seen over the years it's mellow, but it will never mellow enough that we will not miss you. So I'm sorry to hear that you're leaving but I know that you've given the greatest service to the board that any leader could so I'm wishing you the best God bless and in peace. Thank you. Is there anybody else? No, not that I saw it's eight o'clock. Ladies and gentlemen, I. I'm sorry for the delay, we're waiting for the bro president to come on and we can move on from there. I, don't want to stop the sensation and then have it interrupted if we can avoid that, but we will give him another four minutes so 805 and then we will start the presentations and I guess as he comes in. Unfortunately, we will have to interrupt the presenters, hey Lou, it's Gregory since Christian made mention of the breaking ground and the question about the homeless can I just speak for a minute on that, just to shed some light on what we saw on the ground sure go right ahead thanks, so Christian and I did a walk through with Alejandra Magana who's, our liaison for breaking ground. If you're unfamiliar with that organization, I highly recommend, you know, learning more about them and the incredible work they do. One thing that was eye-opening for me is: they do not refer to the homeless population as homeless. They refer to them as their clients, and you know, following in what red was saying about, you know how we talk about things and how we address things. I. Think that really sets the tone as a helping and a you know, problem-solving mentality, which is totally what they are all about, and you know me personally: that's the way I like to approach it. So we did, you know, walk around the district, largely focusing on you know, parks related issues, because at the time when we did this Cc Moore Park was not open. Yet there was construction, fencing and, as people probably observed there was, you know, a large amount of clients. You know around the park there on the south side of Cc, Moore Park and then numerous other parks in the area they just to give. You know the dedication that the organization has to these individuals. They told us that they had one particular individual and there were countless other cases of this that they had worked with for 10 years and finally found that person housing. You know we have a very serious confluence of events right now, obviously in the pandemic, and that has been sped up and exacerbated with rising. You know cost of living, the legislation being in limbo, related to evictions, and then, of course, you know the pandemic and as that relates to unemployment, and you know, assistance with unemployment. So you know basically, my two cents would be just approach this from a an attitude of learning more before you know you pass judgment on these individuals, because this is something that you know very easily could afflict any of us on the board. Here, thanks, thank you is the president around yet Christina Lou I, I'm sorry Christina. Your brother I just spoke to Joe, I'm texting him, but he said that they're trying their best to get him here, he's running a little late. What do is continue with the meeting Marilina I'd like to turn the meeting over to you at this time, so that the presenters can come on and at some point, obviously you might have to interrupt so that the president can speak. Thank you so much Lou thank you and good night everyone and be safe. So christian we're gonna go with the presenters yep, absolutely yeah, I, don't know if there's any particular order that we're gonna be following, but all presenters have the ability to share their screens, so we'll just go in the order that you guys want to go in, but Christina and I are ready or whether I'll say Christina Christine is ready to just switch it over to whoever wants to present so I, don't even know what the order is. If we follow the order on the agenda, we could just do that play and keep it clean. That's Christina! You got that. Okay, do you? Have the agenda open? I'd? Actually, don't have it open at the moment. We just had it a second ago hold on. Let's just close it well I. Have you here? Well you're gonna get a quick sidebar I'll, tell you what we're gonna all miss Luke, but Blue's, not gonna, miss the jabs that he gets in his ribs of the elbowing throughout the meeting the whole time. So I'm gonna get ready for those things. I'm like just constantly. Okay, so first is Monsieur Canzada Consulting engineers, so I will make them presenters good evening is here. My name is Diwali Nancy Lee Paul we're working with this here. So we'll just share our screen. Okay, everyone can see the presentation okay. So we are. We have an application with the border standards and appeals for a gas station at 80 to 11 Queens boulevard we'd like to convert the auto repair shop into a convenience, store we're going to be making a lot of changes to the site and we want to get a new certificate of occupancy. So what we'd like to do at the site? Right now, the building is an auto repair shop. We want to cut back the building and change it from the into a convenience store right now. There are two dispensers we want to put in a new dispenser layout with a total of four dispensers. We want to take out the old tanks and put in new underground gasoline storage tanks want to install a new canopy, there's no canopy at the site. Right now, we wanna we're gonna, put up signs on the side of the canopy in the front of the store and we're gonna change the time. The sign pull that's at the corner of the lot near Queens, Boulevard and 51St Avenue, and we're going to put in new planting areas, one new and blind pole, as well as two planting areas on the side sides of the building. So this is the proposed layout for the new convenience for the convenience store and as well as the front elevation, it will be open. It's gonna, the building is gonna, be a little bit larger than the existing building. It will probably be open, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and so just to go over those changes. Again. We're going to convert the auto repair shop into a convenience store and get a new certificate of occupancy, we're going to take out the three underground four thousand gallon tanks and install three new ten thousand gallon tanks. We're gonna replace the two dispensers with four new dispensers we're going to take out the kiosk. That's currently at the site we're going to install a new canopy and put in new signage and we're going to have three new planting areas. Are there any questions? Christian, do you want to just go down the order of board members, yeah I. Think I certainly would absolutely yeah all right, so I'll just call out names and then unmute yeah, that's the best way. I mean we can get it to the point where borders can you know if you guys can raise your hands on the function, but there are several members who are on the phone in camp. So we'll just do like a quick one question per person and just for sake of keeping it because we do have several presentations. Okay, so first Alex Owens Alex, it's pretty straightforward, nothing to say, Alex! Okay, do you have any questions and it might save us time but that'll and there's more for you, if you think that'll help we'll go with that. If what members know how to use it to say you're, not you don't have a question just skip over here. Yeah I think that's a great idea. Okay, perfect! So board members, if you know how to use the zoom- and you know your name- is going to be called and you don't have too much if you want to be called just mainly in the chat. No thank you and we'll just go right over here. You might cut the time. Try that maybe yeah I know one okay, no from Ahri, no from Ashley, all right and I. Add the Euler. Committee did see this proposal and I know. Alton's gonna go down a list later of all the things that we got in Euber committee. We had a few questions, but it's pretty straightforward. This application- and it's just it- looks like a good thing for the community. We weren't able to vote. We didn't have a forum, but we all in agreeance that it looks like a good thing for the community. So if that helps anyone, okay, great so Chris you get it we're getting a lot of names here and there you want I'm managing listen, but we have at least a good, maybe seven or eight people or not we're looking not to be called so yeah I saw them. I'm gonna go to Austin. Okay, often, do you welcome? Do you have anything right? This application is pretty straightforward in terms of violations. There was the current application is to renew the permit that had expired, but that was the only item that was pending in terms of violations they had sent out notices to the community. We haven't received any opposition to the proposal, so it looked like a straightforward application. I think yeah I think this is pretty clear, but if there's any questions for anyone to ask, definitely disagree the time to ask if there are any questions, but it's pretty straightforward all right. Thank you, Alton all right. So next, Mr Chen, do you have any questions about this presentation that we just saw yeah, I'm okay, also, everybody agrees. I have no opinion. Okay, great! Thank you all right! So Clara do you have any questions? Okay did Gregory say no questions. No Gregory did not say no questions. Okay, Gregory! Do you have any questions regarding this presentation? I was actually trying to put my question into the chat, but that earlier the Q&A. Rather so, my question was just mainly because there's the difference in gallons, you know replacing with 30,000 gallons versus the 12,000 existing. Is there an any environmental impact of that? Obviously, anything underground, you know, causes some environmental concern, but I don't know because I'm not in the gas industry. So these are double new double walled, fiberglass tanks that have a sensor in between the two walls that give an alarm if there's leakage from the inside tank into that space, that's one warning there and there are a number of things that are built into the whole system now for the environmental impact and I'm hoping they're fully. It's fully approved system through the department of environmental conservation and also the fire department. Okay, one of the reasons for doing a large tanks, one we're having more dispensers and two having trucks, big trucks having to unload multiple times with smaller tanks, just obstructs the whole site and just makes things more difficult makes sense. Okay, great next, we have Lucy Chalero Lucy. Do you have any questions? Yes, I? Do? Is this these same owners I? Remember the owners a few years back. Is it the same people or new people that have taken over this location? It's just I think it's the same owners, they've owned it for at least 10 years. It's a download, trophy Chelsea. Thank you very much all right. Next, we have Marlena. Do you have any questions? Yeah? Okay, you know from that: okay, Michelle Dunstan. Do you have any questions, no questions, just that it would be a great improvement. Okay, great Minwen. Do you have any questions? Oh no I. Don't know right. Do you have any questions? Oh no, I! Don't! Okay! Samia! Do you have any questions regarding this presentation? No questions! Okay! Thank you! Okay! That's it for our board members! Okay! So let's move on to the next presentation. Thank you, okay. So the next presentation will be Kathy Cove from the Department of City planning regarding zoning for coastal flood resiliency plan and Kathy. Give me one second and I will make you a presenter all right, Kathy, your presenter, Shada Great. Thank you so much Christina and thank you for having me present tonight on this proposal. I hope everyone's been doing well in these trying times and I'm gonna start sharing my screen and if someone can just confirm that they see the presentation when I go full screen. Okay, perfect! Thank you! Cassidy! Sorry, okay I was trying to turn off my video just to preserve my bandwidth. Oh there it is okay, so I'm just going to turn off the video while I present to preserve my bandwidth and I'll, come back once I'm done with the presentation, so yeah zoning for coastal flood resiliency is a proposal that updates the zoning resolution, in particular article six chapter four, and while the bulk of the zoning text would apply only in the city's current and future floodplain, one central goal of this is to address resilience. Resiliency and recovery needs citywide and there's a set of provisions that would apply to all community districts. So those are the provisions I'm going to focus on today, since CB4 is pretty landlocked and largely does not exist within the floodplain. So I'll focus on those provisions that really impact citywide after I give a little bit of a background on the overall project as well. So while there are many sources of flooding that pose issues in the city, coastal floods of coastal storms actually present the most significant flood risk in terms of compromising human safety, property damage and business disruption. So, while we're analyzing, the city's coastal risk, we're focusing on the area that FEMA designates as the high-risk flood zone and that's the area that has a 1 chance of being flooded every year in 2012, Hurricane Sandy showed a more widespread event that went well beyond the one percent chance. Risk of flooding and close to half of those properties are technically classified at a moderate risk of flooding or having a 0.2 percent chance of flooding and with climate change. The floodplain will continue to expand by the 2050s, as you can see in this map, all the way to the right here. Today's moderate risk flood zone will likely be high risk for flooding, and that area today is home to almost a million New Yorkers. So this proposal builds on two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild, and since then Dcps conducted research and outreach with many, which revealed many issues that communities are still facing as they try to prepare their buildings for flooding and other future risks. So the current proposal includes provisions that would make the zoning relief granted to coastal communities after sandy permanent, but it also expands these allowances and offers additional relief to communities further inland. So the proposal addresses four overarching goals for long-term resiliency that came out of Dcp's outreach and research, and that's identified here in these illustrations. So first there is an expansion of the applicable applicability of zoning relief options to buildings that are not only in the high flood risk zone, but also in the moderate risk flood zone, as shown in the previous slide, and this expansion would reach the neighborhoods where higher flood risk is expected in the future. Second, there's a set of provisions for buildings to be constructed to resilience, resiliency standards that go beyond the current level of flood risk, such as constructing their occupiable spaces at a higher elevation and third we're proposing options for property owners in the flood plain to invest in small changes to their building over time, like raising mechanical equipment out of the basement, without being required to raise or fully floodproof the structure which can be very expensive and finally, there's a set of there's a goal set of providing provisions that apply to the entire city. That would help us recover more efficiently than the city was able to after Hurricane Sandy, and it would be no matter what type of disaster we're dealing with or the parts of the city that it hits. So those are the provisions that I'm going to go through now again that is goal four within the goal of reducing regulatory obstacles for future recovery. There's four issues in this proposed: the proposal targets that being power or energy systems, building accessibility, helping vulnerable populations and aiding in future disaster recovery again, since CB4 is largely outside of the 1 and 0.2 floodplains. We're going to mostly talk about this tonight and just to show that applicability within CB4. Again you can see it is pretty landlocked district and the shaded areas here do not necessarily reflect developable land. It's just land, that's within the flood plain so and with that said, I guess you can see. You know this isn't within the district, but that area just north east above the northernmost point. Obviously, that's not developable and that's land, that's just under the grand central Parkway and there is a very small portion of a block on the very southeastern tip of Cd4's boundaries at the corner of Horus Harding Expressway and Corona Avenue I took a look on the map that is around this developed a few two-story attached homes, I believe, there's also a surface parking lot and possibly a portion of the Madison York assisted Living facility. So Sandy showed us how a storm's effects can go beyond the flood plain, especially across our energy grid. The proposal would allow power systems, and that includes generate generators, batteries and fuel cells and other, like energy storage systems, to be considered, permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts to facilitate their installment and not have property owners bumping into zoning constraints. When they're doing this and the zoning relief enacted after Hurricane Sandy called the 2013 flood text allowed some homes in the high-risk floodplain to place generators in their yards as permitted obstructions, and now this text of supposing to allow buildings across the city to do this so long as the power generators would meet the limits the size and location, including that they must be located at least five feet from lot lines and can't exceed a height of 15 or sorry, 10:15 or 23 feet, and that all depends on the zoning district. That's aligned to the zoning resolution, in addition to ensure that all areas of the city can provide easily provide ADA access. The proposal would classify both ramps and lifts as permitted obstructions and all required open areas to facilitate these accessible designs, and another important issue is how disasters, especially those that require the evacuation of residents, impact vulnerable populations. So looking at the sighting of nursing homes to address this concern- and you know, nursing homes have populations that require continual medical care, and research shows that this dependency can be strained when nursing homes, shelter in place or when they have to evacuate prior to the storm. So the city believes it'd be appropriate to limit the growth of nursing homes in high-risk areas, to lessen the health consequences and all the logistical challenges of evacuating residents in these facilities. So the proposal would prohibit the development of new nursing homes within the high-risk. That's the one percent chance flood plain and other selected geographies. That would have limited vehicular access during a storm event, so existing facilities in those areas would still be able to conduct enlargements for modest improvements, especially those that help with resiliency nursing homes located outside of the high-risk floodplain or the designated areas that wouldn't be affected and new nursing homes could be still permitted in lower risk areas, and you know here in within Cd4's boundary I think the DOT that we're seeing here is exactly where we that portion of Corona that we saw before and there's the Madison York living, assisted living facility and I believe there's another there's a castle height senior living facility. But again those are that one especially is just right outside of the floodplain and sorry. So. Lastly, Sandy showed us that a lengthy process to update zoning resolution regulations can slow the response needed for a disaster. So this proposal would make certain recovery provisions available to be used quickly following future disasters, and some of these provisions would be implemented now to address the coven-19 pandemic and its associated economic effects. So, currently, immediately following a disaster, the mayor can issue an emergency order to temporarily remove certain obstacles to facilitate the recovery efforts that are needed, but that process is limited. Sorry, yeah. That process can be limited depending on the type of disaster which may not be enough time to address the regulations that hinder. You know long-term recovery, so the proposal would include a series of disaster recovery provisions that could be made available through a text amendment when a disaster occurs so applicable. Recovery provisions would be selected based on the issues caused by the disaster and would be available for a time set at the time of the tax amendment. So the provisions could be limited to designated recovery areas based on the disasters, impacts and recovery plans. Plainly put, it could be more tailored specific to that particular disaster, so the set of provisions that could be made available or drawn from lessons learned from Sandy, as well as the current pandemic and on the left here, are a relief that was put in place temporarily after Sandy and on the right. Is the current proposed menu of relief options for future disasters? So examples of rules in this menu include modifications to the damage and destruction thresholds to allow the reconstruction of non-complying buildings and non-conforming uses and rules that could allow uses in zoning districts that were that weren't typically permitted on a temporary basis. So considering the situation that we're going through right now with Covid-19, the proposal would include an enabling two sets of rules to help support more predictable, long-term recovery efforts. So the first one would give property owners who hold special permits and authorizations and additional terms, so they can complete their original plan of construction on a longer term timeline since that was disrupted earlier on in the pandemic. The second would support businesses that do not conform with zoning use regulations by allowing them more than two years, which is the current limit of this continuance to return to operation. So if they're closed for two years, basically, will the this text would allow that use to come back, so the city's specifically using these items for the Covid-19 pandemic, the mayor's executive order for recovery for the pandemic? These are the ones that are checked off so again. This is an example of how the menu of disaster relief can be tailorable to the specificity of that disaster. So for this text amendment in terms of next steps, this is being referred out to all community boards for presidents and to the city council in this Euler process. Community boards are being asked to submit the recommendations- the city planning commission by December 28th of this year- and you know, there's more information about the project, as well as an annotated version of the proposed zoning text on our website and I'm happy to provide this presentation to the board, as well as any helpful additional documents, summary faq and etc, to help with the board's decision. So thank you again for allowing me time to summarize this update and I'm happy to take any questions if there are any. Thank you so much Kathy. This is very interesting and great for the city we're going to have to interrupt for a few minutes. We are going to introduce the new Borough President Donald Richards Kathy. Would you be able to stay on and we go right back to you yeah? Definitely, thank you. So much. Sorry. Thank you so much you hear me. Yes, we can hear you. Okay, perfect I will be brief because it's a very important subject, but it's an honor to be here. Thank you so much for having me and before I begin. I first want to acknowledge Lou, Walker and all the great work he did. I know that you know being the chair could be such a thankless job. Probably your stress levels have increased, certainly in certain times cheering the community board, but I want to thank you for your service to this board to Christian as well, and I also want to welcome the New Board. So congratulations to chair, I'm I want to make sure I'm saying this right. Mario Lena did I say it right all right, Marilina, okay, got it. Sorry, I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna get there. Thank you Ashley as well. Thank you, happy holidays to everyone. I, don't have to tell you about the year we've had and I know. We all are looking forward God willing to a better 2021, but in all honesty you know we still have a lot of challenges we have to address across this world when we look at the disparities in particular that have really drove Covid-19 and exacerbated this issue in communities of color. Primarily, you know we have a lot of work to do. I think I'll be at Elmhurst hospital tomorrow, I'll be touring a few hospitals. Tomorrow, I've been in close touch already: we've hit the ground running to make sure that our hospitals and institutions have the PPE they need and everything- and you know we're gonna, not just talk about it. You know whatever capital money and things that you know are that are accessible to us. You know we want to really utilize to strengthen our institutions across Queens and we're gonna look to do that in an equitable way, as we move forward. So I look forward to the strong partnership with each and every one of you doesn't mean that we're going to see eye to eye on a thousand percent of the things happening in communities but, most importantly, we should be able to talk and sit at a table and figure out a path forward. That I think would be helpful to our community, so I look forward to the work ahead with you on that I'll. Just lastly, add you know there are a few things going on tomorrow: we're having a job fair. This is the 12th one and I want to thank Sharon Lee, who obviously was acting borough president, but really never acted. She really was the boa president and worked extremely hard to ensure that our communities, in that our borough could move forward and also I want to say that it's been a seamless transition. I mean you know there were a lot of things put in place. We worked very closely to make sure that you know the functions of the office would not be interrupted during the transition. So I'm very grateful to her for that and I'll. Also, oh so I'll just get back to the job for you tomorrow at 2 p.m. You do have to rsvp at queensvp.org, so let me say that again, queensbp.org I would urge you to do that tonight. Don't wait until tomorrow. I know after you get through the presentation and I've sat through this presentation before you may feel sleepy after this meeting, but get as much information as you can I know. Zona is the chair. The Zoning committee in the council could be overwhelming, sometimes, but really take this information in and God willing. You make the right decisions as we move forward and I think. That's it. I'm not gonna, because you're in the middle of a presentation, I think it's that's more important, but I just wanted to stop it. More importantly, say if there are things that you think the office can do better we're here to partner with you. Please do not be shy. If you need to critique me, I'm not looking for yes people, you know the community boards are charter mandated function and I want to make sure that we're serving you and being helpful in the areas you may feel weak, and you should help me in the areas that you think I'm weak and that's how we build a stronger borough. So I'm grateful I'm honored to be your borough president. Really it's an honor I look forward to the work ahead. There's a lot of work to do and may we all do it together. So thank you. So much I don't know if you anybody wants. If you want me to answer one or two questions I can, but if not I will see you all in the new year and I pray that you all have a blessed holiday season. Thank you so much for President Richards we're happy to have you. Congratulations to you and we're going to be very close, working together on all sorts of issues, and we can't wait. Thank you so much. Thank you. God bless you all God Bless and good luck. Thank you! Okay. So that was borough. President Richards, thank you so much for him. Coming on and introducing himself I'm going to go back to if Kathy's on here, I think she's still here, I guess we can do the same thing. If anyone has any questions, if you know obviously we're gonna go through the list. If you don't have any questions, please write in the chat box that you have no questions, so we can skip. You just make this a little bit faster Marilyn. If it's okay with you a board members, please disregard that. It turns doing it. That way. Writing the questions that they don't question. It's actually more difficult for us, because we have to go to the list twice. We thought it would work, but it did not work. Yeah, I, don't know that we feel confident enough that board members could raise their hands because not everybody has access to it. So we may have to go this route and but before we do that, I do have one question in particular, and this goes towards Kathy as to what our role on this is to be very clear on it. Kathy, if you can just take like a really brief, maybe like 30 seconds, to explain with regards to this as far as a vote, our obligation is this a recommendation. Where is this just explain to us? Where do we stand on this item and what we're supposed to do as a board for this, whether you know, please sure yeah. So this is a non-euler, but it is still referred out to community boards, so yeah I mean I think obviously in districts that are much more heavily affected by coastal floods and disasters of that sort. We're very strongly recommending they submit a vote, but with that said, there are city-wide implications of this proposed text. So yeah the board can certainly vote on this and submit that I think there was some talk about providing a letter that would be fun, I mean from CB4 I. Think you mentioned possibly going that route. That would be fine too. I spoke to our resiliency team about that they said that would be appropriate. So I think it's really up to you. How you want to express your vote? Okay, so I mean and guys again, I. I'm only mad to marilyna, you know we can go the actual about each person, one by one, yes, no whatever it may be, or as I explained to Kathy, we could do something where we can say something on write, a letter to say you know, while the board did not give a formalized vote, the following questions and or concerns were brought up, and we just leave it at that again. Those are options because it is something that was allowed. We can just acknowledge every question that was asked tonight or any even and even support. We can say you know several concerns were brought up. Several supportive things were brought up. We can try that route, but we can just go with the yes or no, so we do have that option. Early and I want to be clear. However, you guys want to handle it. I just want to jump in one. Second, being that Lou left, we no longer have a quorum okay. So that's your answer. Christian we're gonna have to go with that round. Okay, all right I mean that would affect several items that we have going on tonight, because we have items that require an actual vote, but I mean this is no different than a regular board meeting. If we have a chrome, we don't have a quorum. It is what it is. Oh, okay, all right, so that's it then I guess just proceed as you were. That's definitely take questions from members who may have them please all right. So then I'm going to go down the list. Then yes, please, okay, all right! So first up is Alex Owens Alex. Any questions, no questions. Okay, often any questions, no questions. This isn't an application that we was able to view fully under Europe. Unfortunately, by the time you receive it, you can have enough time to see the full presentation, but so far from what I have seen it seems to be straightforward by the yeah. I'm sorry. What is your question? What effect does this have, if any upon the Flushing of your part, I think we have mentioned this, that it may or may not? So, if that's something that you potentially you asking, if this has any impact on flashing Meadows Corona park- yes, no, it doesn't because this these provisions largely affect buildings and or permitted obstructions, or recovery relief, regulatory hurdles, around recovery relief. So, okay, no there's really no I mean the park is in the flood zone. But this is this: wouldn't impact any infection or anything like that happening in the park. Okay, great! Thank you sure. Okay, that's it! Thank you all right! Thank you, Alton, all right. Next, Ari, any questions, no questions all right. Thank you, Ashley. Any questions, no questions from me: okay, Mr Chen, any questions! No, all right! Thank you, Clara. Any questions, no questions. Thank you. David Chong, any questions, no questions. Thank you, Gregory. Any questions. No all right! Thank you, Kristen. Any questions, no questions for me. Thanks Lorena, any questions. No! Thank you. Okay, Lucy Chalero, any questions, no questions, okay, Linda! Any questions, no questions: okay, Matt, any questions, one for Kathy, just to clarify for me the changes to build regs that allow power, storage, units of a moderate size and also the found as non-obstructive ramps and lifts- do those apply only in the floodplain or the one or zero 0.2% danger area, or is that city-wide that would affect properties in two percent flood plain that wouldn't be allowed to do so today. But these are all optional. No one is obligated to make these changes, but if you're in outside the floodplain entirely, are you able to avail yourself of those provisions yeah? It would I mean it depends on the zoning regulation. You know I'm sorry, the zoning district that you're in it would depend it doesn't preclude that you know they wouldn't be able to do these things. It's I don't have a simple answer for that, because it does depend on the district that they're in, but what this test text does is basically allow for more flexibility and the capability of doing so. If you can't right now, depending on the district. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, Next Michelle Dunstan Michelle D Michelle. Do you have any questions? No questions, okay, min one, any questions: okay! Thank you, pat Martin, any questions, no questions, okay, Brad! Any questions nope! Thank you! Okay! Thank you, vanilla. Any questions, no question: okay, Carol any questions which Carroll yeah, Karma, Hulsey. Okay, no I, don't have any questions. Okay, great! All right! That's all the board! Members! Okay, great! Thank you Christina! So if we went through all the questions, what we're going to do now is we're going to wait until we get to the Euler Committee. When Alton does his report we're going to go through all the applications we today and then we're going to do the I guess the recommendation, because we don't have a board vote today, unfortunately, but thank you so much Kathy and we're going to go on to the next presentation. Christina. Yes, that's the 44th Avenue D mapping and we have Philip Montgomery and Gail Mandaro. I'm gonna transfer presentership over okay Phillip, I'm transferring presentership over to you Phillip. Yes, can you help me get great? Yes, we can hear you now. I believe Gail needs to be. Is Gail going to be sharing? I'm sorry, I'm not sharing my screen, though Philip I thought you were yes. I will be sharing my screen right now. Thank you. Okay! Hang on just a second, oh you know, folks, I'm sorry, I'm having technical difficulties here. I apologize, I'm sorry! It's okay! Phillip! It happens to all of us. Bro take a good time. Please nobody's rushing you because we'd all be doing the same thing. Hmm I was actually going to advise if at all possible and Kathy, just texted me on it. Phillip Kathy everybody, maybe Kathy Kathy's, just offered to and I was gonna and Kathy. You she'll share the screen and then Philip you can go based on. That is that okay, we'll have somebody while you speak all right, yes and Phil, just say when you want me to click on to the I'll. Do the same thing but Kathy jumped in and did it before. I did so by all means. Let's just go with that. If that's okay! Thank you all right! So I'll switch presenter over to Kathy. Okay, please thank you and Phillip Man! Don't worry about it. Believe me I. It happens to me every time, please thank you all right, Kathy, you're, fat, okay and thanks Kathy, no problem, okay and it's full screen. It's all good! Yes, bro, good, okay, great, okay! Thank you! So much folks, we appreciate it. My name is Gail Mandero and I'm the senior director for government and community relations at the New York City School construction authority. Thank you for having us here tonight so that we can discuss a proposed amendment to the city maps, to accommodate the two public schools Ps315 and is 311 that were constructed in 2015 and 2016 respectively. The two schools are located in the Corona community, along 44th Avenue between Junction Boulevard and National Street. There are approximately six blocks. I'm sorry! Next screen they're approximately six blocks from south of the MTA 7 train and about one block north of the long island railroad. The two schools were constructed under the Department of Education's five-year capital plan for fiscal years, 2010 to 2014 the schools were constructed to address the capacity needs at the primary and intermediate school levels in district 24, specifically in the Corona area, the schools were constructed on city-owned land, which included parts of the 44th Avenue on the city map identified, but never built out as a street. Several other buildings constructed before the schools are also built within the mapped areas and the undeveloped portions of 44th Avenue. The city map amendment will reconfigure 44th Avenue to remove the street designation from the areas within which the schools and other buildings are located and conform. The city map to the long-standing existing conditions I will now turn this presentation over to my colleague, Bill Montgomery chief engineer at the Department of City planning, who will describe the more technical aspects of the city map Amendment. Thank you, Gail and good evening. Community board members and I apologize for the earlier technical difficulties. So the please, the subject portion of 44th Avenue was officially mapped in or around 1910 and as noted before, it was never built to its fully mapped width to 45 feet. It is currently built with an 18 foot, wide travel way, a 10 foot wide sidewalk of the north side and no sidewalk on the south side, which it butts a retaining wall for the long island railroad when the schools were constructed, the sidewalk in front of them were actually widened from 5 feet to its current 10 foot. Width Street is open to one-way westbound traffic and has curbside parking on the north. While the street is built to only 28 feet, it is shown in the city map. It has 45 feet wide in this action. The 45 foot map dimension, but not would be narrowed to 30 feet, but no change in the built condition along this street is proposed. This action only makes the city map match the current built condition. Next select please. So this is a photo looking west on 44th Avenue with Is-311 on the right please. This is looking east on 44th Avenue between the two schools. Please this is again looking west on 44th Avenue towards Junction Boulevard from Ps315. Please- and this is looking east up, 44th Avenue from Junction Boulevard and that's the end of the presentation and be happy to take any questions. Thank you, Phillip and Gail. So we're going to be doing Christina, Ropal, okay, all right, Alex, Owens, I, guess two simplified is steam mapping just removing it from the city map? Or can you go into that again? Yes, it's just removing the map straight lines from the city map. You know it was mapped at one with it was never built to that width and we're just removing just narrowing and removing those lines from the city map and making it match the built condition. Okay, I think no other questions, except will it have an implication on parking at all? No, the map change is we're only changing the map to match the existing conditions that are in place now. Okay, that's it! Okay, Alton any questions. Oh no questions. I just wanted to say that again. This is one that not that did not come before Europe for us to completely view, but basically again it does look straightforward, it's taking something that was there and it's at least in 1910, and bringing up to what's currently there now. So this seems to be a straightforward application and yeah. So with that said, that's it. That's the end of my questions and statement. Thank you all right. Thank you. Alton Andy, no questions, okay, Ari, any questions, no questions, Ashley, any questions. No, it's pretty straightforward! No questions, okay, Mr Chen! Any questions, I, don't think he's at his computer, Christina, okay, Clara, any questions, no questions, Christina! Thank you. Okay, David! Any questions, no questions, Gregory! Any questions, no questions, thanks, Lorena! Any questions, no questions. Thank you. Lucy. Sorry, any questions, I know no questions. Okay! Thank you. Lucy Schulero, any questions. Yes, I have a question: will this future demapping affect zoning in that area? Hello? No! The city map change will not affect zoning in any way all right. Thank you. Okay, Linda, any questions. Yes, what kind of impact will this d mapping have on traffic? It should really have no impact, as it's just correcting to an as-built condition. It's not changing the condition. It's just codifying it on the city maps, so there isn't any construction that will occur to change that street in any way. No, it's just correcting amending the map to reflect the current as built conditions. Okay, thank you, okay, my Elena, do you have any questions? Yes, I have one question: I was just wondering I understand why you're doing the application, but why wasn't it done prior like? What's the reason for doing it now? As of doing it like when this was built, I can only speak to what I can piece together, because it predates my time at the SCA. It appears that there may have been some misunderstandings of where the mapped lines lied at the time. We did, of course go through public review before we constructed the two buildings, and it just seems as if all parties assumed, since it was the owned land, originally that it was all part and parcel of the same development sites and just I believe missed it one way or another and we're just correcting it. Now, to ensure that we have accurate records in the city files, okay, so this is something that the city was basically like recommending to do yeah. It was city owned land that they assigned jurisdiction to the school construction authority, to construct two very needed schools at the time and I just think that it was an oversight, people presumed at the time. Again, I'm only going off of what I could piece together, but it seems as if everyone just assumed that this street had been already mapped and in fact we learned after the fact that it wasn't and we're trying to correct that situation. Now. Okay, so it's not going to like you're, not going to be planning to build more schools, so the school's open, they've been open since I believe 2015 and 2016. no yeah I mean like in the future like. Is that like a plan, maybe or it's just a map? It's not in my current plan and we're not making this application to enable any development we're simply making this application so that we can close out and finalize both schools and get our final close-up documentation from the department of buildings and our clients at city planning. Where are here to help us finish, that process and close it out. Okay, so you're gonna close the applications. Okay, thank you for clarifying you're welcome. Okay. Next, we have Matt questions, a quick, no questions, quick comment. It seems like a fine idea if we were voting I'd be in favor of it. I would just urge city planning to take a look at the length of the avenue all the way to 114th street. When Transportation committee looked at the bus plan a year ago that came from the transit authority, they were turning buses onto 40, 44th, Avenue, 43rd, Avenue, I, think based on the map, not knowing how narrow the actual street is. So maybe you guys, if you had the opportunity, could correct the map all the way to 114th street? That's it! Thank you. I'm out all right! Thank you, Matt all right! Next, Michelle, no questions, okay, min what any questions your question. Thank you Martin. Any questions, no questions, okay, rad, any questions. Yeah does this I mean this is I mean I'm obviously for the schools, but I'm just wondering: does this set some kind of negative precedent for uncon conscientious builders to just build something according to how they see fit, how they want and then d-map as needed later on to fit actual conditions? I would like to believe that is not the case. I think that this is really a true one-off, in that it was city-owned land already, and it was reassigned for construction of very much needed. Schools and I think it was just a miscommunication amongst the various parties. You know. Obviously it wasn't private citizens. It was all city agencies involved here, and we are now coming to you to try to correct what we thought had already been corrected: yeah I guess it means it's well, because it's not going to revert back to original. So if everybody says no, this can't happen. Then it just remains an inconsistency between reality and city mapping. That's true! It also would prevent us from closing out the project which we, you know being that we educate children. We like to DOT our eyes cross our t's, get all pyramids in a row and close out our projects so that they are nice and healthy. Thank you that's helpful. Thank you. Okay, Sunil any questions, no question. Okay, Carol! Any questions, no questions! Okay! Thank you all right! That's all of the board members one board member did ask if we could get a copy of their presentation, a digital copy to be distributed to the board members later Gail or Philip. Would that be okay? Phillip? It's your document, so I don't want to speak for you. No, that's! Fine! Okay, perfect! We also have another question here. Maybe Gail or Philip can answer. Linda Carmel said that if you're de-mapping the entire street, will this affect other properties on that street that are not city owned? To do, construction, I, guess is allowed more than there is now I'm Phillip. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the application is only really covering the as-built conditions of the two schools and I. Think a few other buildings that predate the construction of the schools. Yes, there are seven other private property owners that the mapped Horseman street encroaches on their private property. So it removes the cloud from their property because they could no longer like expand into it. So this is a benefit for them as well. Okay, all right! Thank you for that. Okay, so I believe we're done with questions we're going to. Thank you, Gail. Thank you, Phillip we're going to be moving on and we're going to. Thank you for your time this evening. Thank you all to be addressing this in Europe committee a little later. Okay. So now we're actually going to be going on to committee reports, so we're going to be going with consumer affairs. Okay, that's Alex! Nothing to report! Okay, Environmental Oscar is not on okay he's not here and Health Committee Ashley. Yes, we met. Last week we had a presentation from the New York City test and trace Corps, and we learned about the different methods of testing and the testing options that are available here, and we also learned how we can get involved if we ever decided to run our own testing site in the future and all members were all members attended. The meeting, thank you in part, okay, Gregory Greg. Are you there? Can you hear me now there you go sorry, there's a ton of noise outside my window, thanks to Con Edisonison in their monopoly, so Parks Committee report, I'll just lead up with a few things that were passed along from Janice Melnack, related to question that has grown apart when I asked for more transparency, since we never find out about things until the groundbreaking or the day of so this one was, you know in the news, but just as a for those that didn't see it, they did complete phase one of the Fatman Affairs capital project. They adaptively turned the reflecting pool into this fountain. Unfortunately, they've winterized it right now, so we have that to look forward to in the spring of 2021. I, don't know if Christian will be speaking about more details of this, because I have a little bit of info, but there's going to be a leaf. Giveaway compost, demo on December, 19th, Letitia, Williams and Christian spoke about. He can fill in some of the gaps. But you know that's been something that you know is has long been something we've pushed for in terms of both environmental education and you know, connection to community gardens and there's a whole host of things that you know really feel that's a strong positive for our neighborhood in terms of getting people to understand composting and why it's important- and there are continued stewardship events happening this winter. So you can go to alliancerfmcp.org to find out about that. I'll. Just give a recap, briefly of the latest community advisory board meeting for flesh from the United Star Special. Thank you to the board members on my committee that showed up to that meeting. I really appreciate that, as well as several people from the community that came to the Parks Committee meeting in advance of that we talked a lot about. You know, issues that are in the park and how to address those again getting back to what I was saying. You know at the onset of the disconnect happening between city agencies and the public and working very hard to get answers on that, and you know I'm not afraid to ask the tough questions as it relates to why we're not getting answers. Obviously, the parks are seeing a lot of tree lightings right now, so please go support those in a socially distant manner and, of course, wear your mask. I will say on the subject of masks: I still see people coming to the park with their children and not wearing masks and as adults you know we have to be the example. I can attest that it's not easy to get kids to wear masks, but they do it. You know with a lot of persistence, so we need to be setting the example. Just because you're outside doesn't mean you're immune to the virus, and I will be looking to have a parks meeting at some point, December. That makes it a little challenging with the holidays, but more on that to come thanks. Thank you, Gregory, so Marilyna, if I may just jump in so Greg elaborate a little bit more on what we discovered. What you mentioned about the leaf composting thing. So it's a twofold thing. The first thing is Latisha Williams was one of the managers of social media around the park. There's one thing that social media has plenty of: it's leaves. Obviously you can give the amount of trees that they have down there. So what they'd like to do is do a composting event where all those leaves can be used for something positive. So what they'd like to do is take a substantial amount of these leaves and drop them off at all the local community, gardens with the intention of teaching the public a community on how to compost how to use leaves for compost. As you guys will know, we have two very active community garden, both of them in Corona. The first one is the Corona taxpayers garden on 102nd and I'm on 52nd Ave and the other one. Is the sparrow's nest community going down by Lewis Simeone Park about a one second, and something along I can't give you the exact address. So the idea is right. Now we are tentatively, although it seems somewhat firmly set for December 19th. The event again tentatively is set for somewhere between eleven and two and there's not really much to it. X. Amount of leaves, along with bags, will be dropped off of each one of the gardens, both of them and we'll be handing out pamphlets as well as a small demonstration for anybody. Comes people can come by grab some compost take some leaves home. This is what you do with it and that's the general plan. While I am on the subject of community gardens and as you said, Gregory lack of response on behalf of the Parks Department, you guys will know that we've been talking about the garden, also in Corona down on Vancleep and West Side Avenue here in Corona and I call it a garden because it's set to be one years back. We actually co-sponsored and we coast on the application to make that property into community garden. It was identified by a local community group. It is decast property, it's owned by D.O.T, but the property is somewhat small and there's very little that can actually be built on it. We began the process, it didn't really get very far and it was just me: it got very foreign that was approved and it did meet all the parameters. Green thumb was working with us and then I want to say cove it happened and since then the response from parks has been somewhat dormant. We reached out to the commissioner, we reached out to green thumb and we're not getting anything and I softly and I. Don't want to use the word, but we threatened to just take over the garden once and for all the land is there. Everybody knows that a lot of community gardens are built just like that. You find a piece of bacon city land. We do something on it. Eventually, the city will want this property back, but until then it's still up for grabs. So with that being said, we are staging at the very least, we'll use the term very loosely we're state we're staging a soft takeover of the property. There is a piece of land there. It is fenced off. It is very small, again, nothing will be built on it. The community wants it. We already have our name on it. Their name is on it. We just need the parks to get past all the red tape and the admin portion of things. So there's nothing to stop us and local community groups are willing to do the work to get out there at the very least start leveling. It I've already spoken to some of our city agencies. We've spoken several volunteer groups. It is building up a lot of steam. It all goes well, I can get it done as early as this Saturday and the reason I'm bringing that up now is because we also would like that some of those leaves be dropped off at that soon to be garden as well on the 19th, the leaves will get dropped over there. We'll cover with a tarp we'll put a sign on it. Saying do not touch nothing. Anybody will but do not touch. These are our leaves for the future community garden coming over here and at the very least, we put a shovel into the ground, so to speak until the parks comes through and if the park doesn't come through will still continue. They'll have property back from us eventually, so the property is in Corona. It's on Van Cleef, on West, Side Avenue, it's a small, almost unmapped street of Corona behind empanIDAS Del Parque, just off of Vancleeve Street and again once I have the information on both events, a quote-unquote takeover of this property, as well as the accomplishing event of the 19th I'll reach out to you all, but as of right now, you guys are free on both saturdays. This one and the next coming, you know by all means: please keep us in mind because we'd love to have the help and put some shovels into the ground to start leveling this thing, so we can have hopefully have it open by earth day, as you guys know, I take seriously and I'd love to do it. Thank you guys. Thank you. Christian Next, Stop transportation, okay Linda. The transportation Committee met on this week to discuss two things. The first thing was the co-naming on for in honor of Jim Galloway I, believe it was 57th, Avenue and 99th street Christian can correct me. If that's not right. Our committee, you know, met with or heard one of the community members who proposed it. You know talk through. You know some of the history and the community. You know activism that Jim Galloway was involved in and we did have a vote and agreed that our committee would recommend the co-naming of the street. That was the first item. The second item was related to the renewal of the taxi livery company called NY Mexicana, and they completed our survey, answered our questions. I think to our satisfactory and our committee again voted and to recommend the approval of this renewal, and essentially they already do already have a license, but they were just moving locations and so going through I think the formality of the process. So those are the two new items. The by way of update I wanted to get back to some of the comments that Gregory made earlier about I, believe 41St, Avenue and 78th street. We did get a response back from D.O.T and if I could just read it quickly, they did have their pedestrian projects group out and they conducted an analysis of both areas with regard to 41St Avenue in 78th street. He says this location is an always stop and seems rather standard. The crash data was low here and the intersection is very basic standard t plus a driveway. The markings are in good condition and the signs are relatively new here. He's asking for additional contacts around concerns and I was going to suggest that if we could form a small working group, maybe in the next meeting, anyone who would like to join Gregory certainly- and we could discuss further about how to continue the conversation with D.O.T. He goes on to say, design-wise. It appears to work fine if there's illegal parking or non-compliance with the stop regulations that should go right. That should be routed to the police department, the second intersection that they analyze Whitney, Avenue and Judge Street. He says another standard intersection, but with the school safety crosswalk on the northeast leg, this crossing could probably be upgraded to be on both legs of the intersection or removed entirely I would obviously push for both sides having crosswalks the location has the correct signage on it, which is in good condition, as are the markings. The pedestrian ramps here are were recently upgraded and are in good condition. Since those ramps are ADA compliant, it might be a light fit to install the signage and markings if school safety wanted to and he will follow up with them. The presence of the fire hydrant means that we wouldn't even need to remove parking for one of the daylighting treatments. The counts might be a challenge to get, though, as it's pretty low traffic intersection. There isn't a super logic, logical pattern of people, turning off on 43rd avenue on to judge and then continuing West. Otherwise, both locations are 90 degree intersections, which is ideal and are not complex in any way. The streets themselves are on the narrow side. Essentially, we probably wouldn't make adjustments with these and he'll follow up with school safety about Whitney and judge and see what they think about adding the crosswalk by the park so again. So this is something that we could have continued conversations about at our next meeting, probably sometime in January or February I. Don't think I have any other updates. I don't know if Matt wants to add anything I would the only thing I might add is it sounds from what Gregory said at the top of the meeting that his concern is 79th street and D.O.T is looking at 78th street, so I think the idea that we get together and have a little chat or Linda and Gregory for sure I'd be happy to be in it and maybe go back to D.O.T sounds like a reasonable thing to do, but I think it's a conversation should take place not in the meeting here, but just in a smaller group. Thank you anything else, Linda or Matt, or that's it for transportation. I. Think that's it! Thank you. Okay! Thank you! So much Linda, okay! Next up public safety, okay, Lucy, you're, unmuted, okay, we had our meeting. You said I'm very proud of all the members that made it that evening. I just want to let you know that the Sur teams throughout the city were distributing PPE at the orange and yellow zoned areas and are continuing to do so. Now. I asked a few questions of from the officers and they said they sent me this because they couldn't make it to our meeting, but I asked if any of the officers or staff has come down with Covid-19 being that we're going into our second phase. As of now, there is none so I hope it stays that way. I also got some reports we had filed in to the police department locations that we know were not keeping with the covered rules and the sheriff's departments, and it was in the news already for cocoa restaurant, which is 4015 Junction boulevard in Corona, and the Muser Box at 74th street in Elmhurst. We're both closed by the sheriff's depart for overcrowded people that were sharing beers, sharing, marijuana and especially sharing hookahs their the capacity was over 75 people when they closed them down. Unfortunately, they may have to be open again. As you know, they'll may pay the fines they may not, but they're fighting this now, but at least we can take some control over those that are not calling the Covid-19 rules. I asked about the Roosevelt Avenue Task force. They worked jointly at 82nd, Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Some of the problematic problems are prostitution, and that was one thing that you just recently handled. I'm hoping they'll cover other areas along Roosevelt that I gave them and we'll see where it goes. I also asked about the amount what it costs to give out summonses like how much is it for social, distancing or noise, and they really were very vague about it. They normally add it as a small amount when they work with SLA the health Department consumer affairs. My next question will be for the next month. Are they paying the summonses? We give out all the summonses? We ask them to go to court, but are they really paying? Sometimes I go to court and I'll notice they're, not that high? They fight them on this on the price and meanwhile they wind up doing the same thing all over again. So that's something we'll discuss in the future meetings. The next thing I asked was about the graffiti materials. They are so low on material for graffiti and they're, asking our help again or if any of the politicians are hearing tonight. They are desperately in need of that, as you can tell, the Mary is growing with graffiti I have to say I thank Christian again. We've been asking about murals and I have to thank Klaus South, because she pushed for the idea and he's working with the artist about putting these murals up, which is a great idea, but in the interim being was so large. We could use some extra funding for the precinct to get some material to fight graffiti. We also asked about getting the highway safety unit in about e-bikes, which are going to be pretty much covering our streets and I asked about the enforcement. They haven't gotten all the details yet, but hopefully, at their next meeting, we can discuss that. And after this we went into the liquor licenses, I'm hoping that when they start opening up their outdoor cafe they'll understand that they can't break the rule when it comes to Covid-19. There are some that have we emphasized again that they have to think about the community that they're working in we're predominantly a residential community, and it's the complaints for noise and non-compliance is still high. So they said they will work with us. I hope they do and that's the end of my commitment to this liquor license. Thank you. So much Lucy Marilynna can I just get like that. 30 seconds really quickly, yeah, so I'll go on what Lucy was saying. Yes, Lucy, we do know the precinct needs money, or rather the prison needs to be, and we will be using some of the funds that we have to give to the precinct for this. Those who know that we're trying to push like for a graffiti replacement project instead of the community board, giving paint to the precinct every year for them to put up a canvas more graffiti to go up, which is going to try to have a replace with graffiti there's. One thing we have plenty of is graffiti and artists, so the current one right now is hello. Okay, someone's not muted! Please mute yourself if you're, not speaking, thank you yeah, but yeah. That's it guys! I, don't want it back to the meeting. I really don't want to get to the 9:30 range, but you know we are working the precinct. The mirror project is continuing. We ran into a small issue and that some of the items are back ordered, but the truth is the artist is actually in school right now and she said that she wasn't ready to start until she ended, which hopefully, everything goes well should be. This week, we've already reached out to the art supply store to give us a couple of what's the one, I'm looking for replacements to the items that were unavailable, but we're really we're very much good to go with that mural and once that one begins, this will be the beginning of the CB4 quote-Unquote mirror replacement project which I like to make more official. You know, maybe it's a good thing to get a working group or something like this as well, but the truth is rest comforted that the precinct has already been reached out to and I'm just waiting for a list of supplies that they need. So we can get them some paint and start getting some graffiti cleanups done thanks. Thank you, Christian, okay, next Stop, Euler, Alton I, know we're gonna, be we can't vote. We don't have a quorum, but I know we can I, guess make a recommendation. So Alton take the floor. Okay! Well, we all see that we have three applications they straight forward, but there's also the fourth item that the table for my last meeting and that's the landmark status application for Wanna Velocity host that something that you can talk about with us, because we also need a letter of recommendation for that as well, yeah sure so the Yanta Posinsky residents in Elmhurst, that's something that came to the border believe two months ago for street code naming and we gave a recommendation to Coney in the street for Alexander and Valentina Yanta Plushinsky. They are two polish nationals who are world two heroes and Valentina. She was actually. She was ahead of her time as a woman, I would call her a woman hero. She saved so many lives by announcing to Poland about the consultation camps. So it's a very important historic site to the polish american community, but as polish history- and we don't have a landmark in New, York City, that's directly related to the holocaust. So we, you know Elmhurst history and preservation, cemeteries, society, they put a landmark application in and basically are asking for support to support this landmark application. That's basically it. If anyone has any questions. Of course I can answer. Does anyone have any questions? Okay, so then we're looking for a letter of recommendation for the four items mention this week. The three presentations earlier I think they straightforward, I. Believe four questions was asked about that I think I just want to you know: do we need to take a vote or is this a letter, a recommendation, question yeah I mean again no quorum. I, don't know guys it's a gray area. I, don't know we can stay and again the only way you can get away with this and let and it's if we ask the borders right now. If you have any questions or concerns and again the letter will just be something like that we can say. While there was no forum, those present were in favor of it. But again it's a very great argument. I, don't know, but the lack of quorum is a real issue for us on this one and all our items for them, because we can't even formally vote on the street coding for George for Jim Galloway. Excuse me Christian. Is there any way any of these items can be moved to the next meeting or any of them have a time frame all right. So, with the exception of the 44th Avenue mapping, everything on to the next meeting, the sequel name can come at any time. The Jim Galloway the City Council votes twice per year, once I believe I could be wrong in this. I know that one of them I believe April, the other one may be December Christina. If you know anything, somebody who's better by all within the next week or two I believe, but everything else is questionable and can go far. We do have a deadline on the application that was presented tonight, except for BSA requires some something from us, because that application can not move forward with the BSA unless the board gives give the advocates something to take with yesterday. Oh no thank you for the correction. Again, I guess I believe that once the forum isn't there, it's not to be acknowledged, but at the very least we did our due diligence and not you know not to what's the word, I'm looking for, I'm not going to say just, but not to not acknowledge the poorest of the members that are here. You guys should be acknowledging your opinion shouldn't matter. We can certainly give a letter of recommendation, but it'll be very clearly stated without a quorum and that those presidents had opposition or did not have any position or that the following concerns were brought up and that you guys may proceed as planned to take ourselves into consideration. It's not a legit legal response as is needed, but it's something at least it shows that it was presented to us that we facilitated by so yeah it's a gray area, but we can certainly do a recommendation. So often we can table the anything that I guess we can go. You know bring over to the next meeting like the Yanta House. If it's not going to count, you know why I make a recommendation, but anything that has to be voted on tonight. I think we should do a recommendation at least okay, that we can do but the other items. We definitely need something and I think Kristin, you're very clear about that. The letter recommendation, including the state that we didn't, have to quote like this code, aiming we can say the board, didn't, have a quorum, but the committee did have a quorum and the committee did meet and again the committee would be speaking having behalf of the entire board. Slash from Enrico is still a great area, but if we put in there that the committee put a recommendation in addition to a soft board recommendation without a quorum, it might hold more weight but again guys we're treading on gray area here. Just I'm just it's. The best I can advise you, okay, Alton, so I guess we'll go back to Linda in a bit, but also what do you want to do with your committee? I would say we can wait for Java House for next month, since that's not something that we're looking at in terms of deadline, but in terms of the other items we could do a letter of recommendation for the 82-11 they would need something for BSA would need something. I, don't know how BSA would look at a letter of from us that doesn't have a quorum. That applicants could definitely contact us and let us know that they willing to wait until there's a full quorum and we could then give a full documented letter upon it with if that makes sense. So that's for 80 to 11. right, yeah, no I think they left. Okay, all right, never mind yeah, they laughed we already did we didn't do a roll call vote so to speak, but we did ask questions for excuse me. We didn't ask questions from board members without any questions. I don't know if and then the second vote is necessary to do the letter recommendation again we're shredding on different moon waters here. Somehow you guys want to hang like I said. I can't really say much to that. Oh Lucy has something to say: she's raising her hand, I would write the letter because we'll be at this all night write a letter tell them that we know the situation. You know yeah. We unfortunately was a long night or whatever, but the majority that was present was in favor of it. Can they? You know just draft it in a way that explains what we're up against, but the majority which it is. We had a lot of people here tonight and I would just draft a letter and I'm sure they'll take it. You know this is not a major problem. It's imposing a lot on the community. That's all the projects tonight, you know we're not worrying about a big building going up and such so I would like to state on file that we should write a letter and go from there. Alton I mean all four items. If you want you know, we could do the letter. Just a recommendation like Lucy was saying, which is a good idea. It's your committee, so I think it's a good idea because we're under the deadline there's nothing else that we can do. We explain what the situation is and we're working on the Covid-19 maintenance right, because, if you think about it, next could have this issue so want to. You know: we've discussed everything tonight. If you want to go ahead, you know call and I'm okay with it. Okay, so I would definitely say on the zoning for flooding and 44th Avenue D mapping, we could do a letter of recommendation. Yes, a again that would be left up to I'm thinking that would be referral to the applicant. We can say yes, if the epic, if it doesn't work, then the applicant can come back and say: they're gonna have to wait until the next board. Meeting. Okay, that's fine, okay, and if you want to do the same thing for the Yonko House, that's fine too yeah. Yes, all right, perfect! Okay! That works yeah that works I mean, like you said. If they have anything, they can always come back to us and we would have to bring so that's fine. Okay, all right! Thank you, Alton and then Christian. Do you want to do the same thing with Linda? Or do you want to ask Linda? Oh you're on you, Christian, you're, muted. We can't hear you I'm sorry there you go okay, cool yeah. It was on the delay, no it Linda's item and again the Georgia one. Alright soupy, the Jim Galloway item is not something that has to be rushed. I wouldn't rush, it I would I, don't even know if the City council voted. Yet, if not look guys, the truth is that's true. I believe yeah I believe it happened either in October or November. So we're going to be waiting for the spring for the next one. So we're fine with that exactly usually April and October. There you go. Okay, I'm sorry I thought December. So it's April October. We are good so long as we have it before. April we're okay, and that gives us some money time. So we're good with that. Okay, so yeah moving on I think Marilyn just got I think something happened, yeah I think so too. Yeah look! So for what it's worth. We are running a little bit like pretty late on this one. So once she gets back I think we should look to wrap up. We just got a text of you know, asking to adjourn I think it's time to kind of end. The meeting soon give it like another minute or two until Marilyna comes back and if not Ashley you may take over and just continued it. That's okay. As a matter of fact Ashley. You know what let's just take over right away: let's not even wait a minute Ashley. Can you please close off the meeting or at least continue to where we were Marilyn? I'm actually are you? Do you hear me? Okay, yeah I, don't know! What's going on acting so weird tonight, okay, so we're done with youth everything's done. Youth! Isn't youth is not here. They have nothing going on. They did meet we're trying to bring that artist group to the community to bring like some therapeutic heart camps. We already met wonderful presentations by this group called us making changes, we're just waiting to hear from them to see when we can get a nice workshop going for therapeutic art capture, so I think Marilyna come out again. Okay, hear me now or no yeah, we hear you anything else, I, don't think so. No, okay, so we're all set. Thank you. Everyone, sorry. We ran over tonight. We had a lot to go over happy hop. Alright, everyone, okay, guys, we'll see you in January thanks for everything. Thanks for all you do, you guys are the best.
