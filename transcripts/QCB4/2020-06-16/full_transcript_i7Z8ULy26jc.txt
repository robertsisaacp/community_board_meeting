I'm not doing this to it good evening. Everybody. Thank you for coming I. Guess we had a little technical thing. I, don't know what it was, but something didn't quite work like tonight. Okay, I gotta, pull up the agenda on my other screen, cuz I'm, not where I'm supposed to be then go for it. You now my dog is gonna, stop moving! Okay, all out a call to order you're doing chip prisons report, which I guess I need to do now and I need to read. John Wang's up meeting notice that came in this afternoon, Christian catch. You should read that Oh hold on Lou how to access you got to give me a second hold up hold on. You got to give me you, okay, here we go so this is a statement from John Wang. You guys know him as the director from the night, the Queen's night market DFC before. As you probably know, the Queen's night market has been postponed indefinitely until it's safe to open. Up again, we publish our cookbook called world eats here, which features recipes and personal stories from over 50 Queens night market vendors representing over 40 countries. The timing was a little ironic and bittersweet. In addition to that, we've been keeping busy, mostly with our field of frontlines initiatives, feel the frontlines is a collaborative sudeerneer collaboration with the queen borough president and the Queen's Economic Development Corporation, the program hires Queensland market vendors and local food businesses to feed health care workers on the front lines who are risking their lives to keep us safe and healthy. The project started seven weeks ago and has raised $100,000 and provide nearly 15,000 meals to health care workers at all, nine Queens hospitals and seventh Queens EMS stations. Anyone interested in donating to the cause can do so by going to Queens NY DOT org or by contacting me directly in other news. I've recently joined the Covid-19 to response Coalition for Koronadal nursed, as well as the steering committee for the Coalition for NYC hospitality and tourism recovery I'd be happy to discuss those initiatives with anyone who is interested. I miss you all and hope to see you all again in person soon. Until then, please stay safe and healthy, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help turn these trying times. Leave okay, I! Guess we go to the open session / to board members. Now, let's do that you're unable to see the who is actually in the meeting, not correct so I guess: you'll have to go through each one and we'll unmute them as you call their names for a few seconds. Okay, the board number list, I, guess the last time changing these differently, I, don't have it off a better plate. Okay, I'm just gonna read the different names and you can unmute the person as I call them. Okay, we're going to start anything you'd like to say, because afterwards, Michelle Dunstan, no she's not down on bleachers yeah, now really quickly. If I could just really just remind everybody that if you are a community board member and you have dialed in via phone or if you have dialed in your phone, you will not be able to speak tonight. We are only giving speaking I'm. Sorry so again, I want to reinforce the community important members. Specifically, if you are calling in via phone, you will not be able to speak tonight. We will not be a muting. The mics to appease only so just want to be clear on that. You were here just for just for a hearing all right, Lou I'm Dustin is not it moving on. Oh hi, everybody I hope everyone, fine, like I, am want him to do some. Thank you. I've been around Catalina Chris I'm only around the block from her office, Cali Cruz, where Jessica Ramos and Moyers and drummers office I'm very proud of all of them, they're doing a phenomenal job reaching out to everybody, especially the Catalina Cruz every day, she's giving it food it's. The neighbors are not very proud of her and for everyone else, and I just want to give an attaboy to some of the cb4 members do want Erika lacell of michelle austyn and Alex all once I call that they too have been wonderful, going out there and giving them themselves. I will later in. My in my report will talk about our searching great work. They've been doing you don't know how proud I am of our community right now, so I just have to say that I'm also going to ask for some help. I represent many of the owners that are not rich. Our money is mostly in our homes and I had a very hard time. Apryl paying the real estate tax I was wondering if any of our coaches are looking at helping people like ourselves who are not working and who or have homes or people have homes, and they also have tenants, are not working, if maybe not, that we're saying we're asking for a handout, but if we can pay installments for July's payment being added to October's real estate statement, yes, maybe and not be charged the interest which is an 18% compound daily and then no penalty. That would help I, don't know. Hopefully the you come will pick up that we won't have to go that way. But it's something I would like to know if they are thinking about for people like myself and others and again I just want to say Ellen for Christian -. We did some great work as well. Throughout this whole time, so I just had a state that so thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, Thank You Lucy. Thank you. Okay, Alexander Owens. It was the second real milk everyone for it. On my report, that's the only thing: I'll be reporting, anyways level. Okay, oh just briefly announce that we've been working hard on setting up our first food pantry. Then this Thursday we'll be giving out the six hundred meals plus some canned items. Things will finally come together, we're working with well and we hope to continue. This is a pilot, as so many had mentioned, the need for food and insecurity, food insecurity and facing a like, so yeah provide the details a little later on. Thank you. Okay, Oscar reals, you Oh Oscar. Yes, anything to report. Remember this is not a committee report. This is just a public session. Any questions are concerned. You happy oh yeah. A few concerns. I know that I've been for the past couple weeks. I believe our homeless increased, especially on Broadway I mean like in one block. You could see at least, and these people exceed like on a sidewalk and stuff. So I mean that's it I'm, hoping that we're doing something I, don't know, I mean I, don't know like what's the plan exactly when it comes to a homeless on Broadway. Thank you, okay! Thank you. No you're good to go. Yo Roman, the second little dog, no go. Okay, actually read Ashley they're in hi good evening. Everybody, no questions or comments for me right now: okay, David Chang evening. No questions or comments for me: oh yeah, for now No God, we Spock well that he is here. Just we immune agree on you just you know. My comment is sort of a personal one set loves my wife's grandmother passed away from the virus this past week. So really you know, the biggest thing you can do is listen to everything. That's being said, you know, don't make unnecessary trips. Don't you know, ignore social distancing guidelines I, just there's a lot about how would the weather very nice people are starting to sort of relax? So just you know take care of yourselves and each other very sorry for your loss. Man really my condolences to you and your family I'm. Very sorry, hello-hello you're in vinegar, man I, want to take the time to thank each and every board member of C before for their outstanding work. It's a complete honor to be part of such a caring, a wonderful community board. A few notes: I want to speak with Gregory and Lucy I'm gonna be securing about roughly 5,000 face. Myths. I have a plan that I'd like to hand them out of talks to de-escalate the situation between the police department and the general public. Also I want to announce mr. Perron or who lost his father is also coming back and opening up the ambulance base. We're gonna be starting a once a week, food pantry which will be operating starting the next two weeks and we hope to be running it every week and just thank you to Catalina Francisco and Jennifer Jessica Rommels for all they did and God bless. All of you. That's it. Thank you. Thank you very great news, men. As always you those are long. No Karen, a blue. No sir Ruby Mohammed No get it king. The ruler is yours, give a second hold on mr. new ruler, you're on yes, I'm on it evening, everybody and take care of them, but I want to tell you that last week we also they're sending a mail to the North Shore Hospital about more than 300 meals. So still we are working on it, our foundation reunited, say still they are supplying the food to that church and other people's. Thank you, okay, Alice. Just one good sign light fellowship, please, committee house I'm, dad the great I surrender, Lauria and arena also or helping up with food pantries way under many fish videos that I haven't forgiven for me and they're having fun to help the boxes of food every other week. Thank you so much for the work you do. Thank you. Thank you. The lawn tarik yes here hold on one good evening. Yes, I good evening board members. Thank you and respected elected officials I'm going to try and keep this as brief as possible. First just wanted to express my gratitude. You know for continue to have these board meetings virtually it's not the same. I would prefer in person with all of you. This will have to do. In the interim. The most recent food bank, the Catholic Charities brooklyn-queens, hosted, was this past Friday at st. Bartholomew's. We served approximately 1,700. Full shopping cart worth of groceries. Unfortunately, this Friday there will not be an activation in either Elmhurst or Corona. Unfortunately, the in-house staff at Catholic Charities will because, due to Memorial weekend, I would like to apologize on that note. However, the two nearest food pantry locations for any families that would be interested in the confines of cb4 would be right outside see before actually in what side, st. Theresa, 502, o45 Street as well as BVM, st. Mary, Winfield 703, one for eighth Avenue I'll, be happy to send that by an email to the board to distribute. So that was point one and I just have three points or two more points. If we I very much one respect decrease by the governor and the mayor and, of course, that our council members, as well as assembly members present here, are working with our two representatives. You know, while we want to be reasonable in our expectations of how much social distancing and restrictions were replacing, if we can also bring our attention to the crime statistics that are being reported on 110 precinct, specifically, the increases in domestic violence, child abuse directly correlating with the increased stay at home orders, and that are you know, depending on who you ask bordering on house arrest. However, I'm not going to take that leap just yet, there's also been an increase in homicides, petty and grand larceny, as well as suicides. When this is all set and over you know there won't be a virus will live on for unfortunately, forever that that's how viruses work. Maybe we can all also take into consideration how much damage we're doing in the short term, and also in the interim and long term, how much blowback this will have, and the third item that, if I may, on Lucy's points about consideration for some exemptions or possible considerations of the release attack. That's a very reasonable request. If I may some of these other proposals that some of the local activists and community groups have proposed about rent striking while simultaneously receiving unemployment for those that receive unemployment as well as stimulus money, you know one could take a leap and say that's a slap in the face to property owners. There's continued to pay property taxes, continuing to pay the banks continuing to meet their mortgage insurance obligations. So we want to try and balance a reasonable approach to the best of our abilities for all, not just select for you, that's something we can all consider it might in the short term. We can all get to this just a little bit better. That's all! Thank you very much for your time. It's almost the one well spoken. Thank you Linda is she is in the meeting, but she is she's not able to speak right now. Thank you. Okay, James Lisa, sir you yeah hold on. He is actually here: Matt you're unmuted. How are you, sir I'm? Well, you Christian I, hope I hope. Everybody is well nothing to say here report, it's a tough little theory going through, but a lot of people that happen a lot worse have a good night. Everybody thank you. Thank you. Lina McGowan for okay, Alton, Derek, Smeath, no okay, Mara, Lena, GMP, no, sir unable to attend Sandra. She is here just bear with us. While we are mute, saundra good evening, you're, a muted. How are you evening? Everyone it's good to see everybody I agree. This is not the same as being in person, but it is the second best very briefly. I want to thank each and every one of you for continuing to care for our community. All our elected officials, Jessica Francisco and gutta Nina for an outstanding jobs. I see them constantly in social media, with his sleeves rolled up and really helping our communities and I also want to give a special shout out and thank you tarik for being involved with Saint Bartholomew, with the Catholic Charities and thinking of st. Bartholomew - st. Bartholomew, for we you know for giving to the community for being a part. Even though that you know the parishioners are not there, if the churches are empty, it continues to serve its community, and one thing also Ellmers is the epicenter of the epicenter on my block. I have many neighbors that have lost their lives to this disease. It is a disease of the poor. Basically I mean I know a lot of people are getting hit with this, but the majority it statistically. It's the black brown people and poor people, and you know that this community is filled with many immigrants, do not get the benefits that documented individuals do so in any way that we can help. I Vincent, thank you very much. Please send an email. I have a lot of students. I teach Sunday school I have a lot of whose parents are just do not have enough, and so if that would be great, if we could get emails about any anything, that's out there that you all hear about, because I sent all my parents to the different of food pantries and wherever there's available food, because that's what they're in need the most. So that's, basically you didn't thank you. Thank You Sandra red Sevilla, no, sir, okay million yen. You hear me Susan, yes minhwan. How are you doing this? Is me one and the my office receive a lot of phone calls about the unemployment insurance application. So we help a lot of cases on that. Just wanted people to know that if you need some help, if you live in our district attorney, you need help to apply for UI and you can contact our office. Thank you. So much ma'am, okay, I, like jump on Alexa, is here just hold on I, have nothing to report and no concerns at this time. So much Alexa for sure, okay, Christian Gonzalez. She is nothing kikyo Martin, sir she'll be a month. She'll be a Martin. Sir Romero is in just bear with us. You hear me good evening, good evening, Christian Thank You mr. chair, nothing! Much from my personal end, I'm happy to hear everyone. My condolences to Gregory and your family I have some updates for deewan and Lucy. Then maybe I can such a little more on later on. When I do my report for representative mang, but that's it for my in here, Thank You Christian Thank You testa. Do you think me? Thank you see Yuma Scully. She is not in we're young gamora. He is in just listening, but he is he's unable to speak right. Fernando, Ruiz, Alberto Lombardo, no, sir. Okay, anybody see I think even if you did we reach. Everybody was in the panel right now so you're good to go. We can move on to the next item. Oliver there she goes Regina, sorry you're good to go. Oh good! Call it, but okay, in any case start with the elected officials now senator chowsie, schumer or representative christian. No, sir okay, the House of Representatives name hold on Christian. Can you hear me? Yes, sir? All right, hey everyone again, I'm just gonna switch hats for a second on behalf of congresswoman grace Meng, you know, hope everyone and all their all your families are all healthy and well, including everyone who's listening in the call. So just some updates as I'm sure there's a lot of things on everyone's mind now in regards to what Lucy and dawan were mentioning for homeowners completely agree. The congresswoman completely agrees. There's the heroes Act that she voted on Thursday and the heroes act. Amongst many things includes about 200 billion in renters and homeowners assistance, hazard, pay for all frontline workers, money for New, York, State and protections for our elections and the u.s. post office. So the bill is now in the hands of the United States Senate and the Senate pit. The Senate has to pass it. We will see how that goes and I'll keep everyone informed. As far as what sort of provisions are in the bill that will be helpful to our communities as Sandra mentioned communities, especially that have been hit hard minorities, black brown. All of these communities are most affected by this virus. I say that with all respect because I know the virus affects anyone regardless of class creed, color religion, but it is hitting our minority communities very hard other than that. I did want to touch on something mean when did touch on unemployment insurance. Our office does receive a lot of calls on unemployment. Insurance like her office does, but we are at the federal level, so it's not directly under our jurisdiction. We usually refer over to your state senator but recently, and by recently, I mean two hours ago, the congresswoman put out a press release that the Internal Revenue Services IRS established a special telephone line for taxpayers who have questions about their coronavirus relief payments. So if you haven't gotten your payment, if you haven't gotten your stimulus check payment, this is different from you. I, but if you haven't gotten your stimulus payment, because we also get a lot of calls regarding your economic impact naming or your stimulus check. If you haven't gotten a tour, it doesn't reflect on the website a correct status on your check. You can dial in this number I'm gonna say it here for anybody interested I'll. Give you a second to write it down. So the number from the IRS again, this is for the economic impact payment benefit. This is the stimulus check. That number is eight hundred nine one, nine eight three five, so this number is to check in on your check it answer any questions about if you're eligible, if you'll be getting it when you'll be getting it, the IRS has been rolling. These checks out and a lot of people still haven't received it, and if you are one of those people, I just want to assure you you're not alone. A lot of people are waiting for these checks and haven't received them. There is a talks about a second check. There is a second round of benefits that is included in the hero's bill, passed the house more details on that again. If it passes when it passes, I'll, let everyone know there might be some people waiting for two checks instead of one, but that's okay. If you have any questions, this is the number again 800, nine one, nine eight three five or you can call me or our office I'm, happy to help. Anybody and I think that's it for me. Thank you. What's ghostin appreciate it: okay, Alexandria Acacio Cortez hi everyone. This is Misha Hernandez from the office of congresswoman tabasco cortez. Some community updates we're hosting our next monthly townhall. This Thursday May 21st at 6:05 p.m. share a link in the chat box with the zoom registration, so this virtual Town Hall will be via zoom and we'll be joined in the assistant commissioner, at the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, as well as the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Sanitation and the COBIT 19 foods are, they will be opportunity for a Q&A during the Town Hall. As for legislative updates, Christian touched on a good chunk of it. I'll provide me with some additional bits of information, so this past Friday, the House voted on the harems Act, which is a treaty, a three trillion dollar legislative package designed to provide financial relief to communities and families, and it doesn't Oakland, as mentioned 175 billion in renting and housing assistance, funds to reduce incarceration and financial relief for immigrant communities, and we are putting out weekly kovat 19 newsletters. They go out in English and in Spanish and include resources and a frequent answers and questions, and the last bit of information that I wanted to share is about our census, so East, Elmhurst and Corona are reporting at just 30 percent, which is almost 30 points below the national average. Of course recognizing. These are also some of the most hit neighborhoods. But if you have the chance or you have you know, you're checking in with your neighbors and loved ones do mention the census to see if they can take a moment to fill that out. They'll play a huge role, as we think about recovery and relief from resiliency plans moving forward and as always, our office has been open and teleworking. So folks, we've been receiving and accepting cases and processing cases online on our website or via phone and, as I mentioned earlier, share the link in the chat box to registering for this week's virtual Town Hall.

Alex very quickly, guys I promise, I, don't have much to report as I told you before we're still functioning as well as we possibly can we're doing virtual meetings. Virtual committee meetings, we're still holding everything that we would normally hold say for the fact that you know your process and you know all that type of stuff, but to touch on Alex's announcement about the food pantry. So she approached me, of course, that's about a month or so ago saying that the hello that you know the month of ramadhan there just aren't enough halal meals being distributed. We know that the office of camelina, if something woman Cruz, is doing something, but we try to bring something to the Empress area. So we restart we're partners over at the st. James, Episcopal Church, 84th and Broadway, and they immediately opened the doors to what allows us to run a food pantry at this point. Just because we're it's our first time doing something like this and because we're still trying to rustle up volunteers get moving. It's only gonna be this week so far, but if all goes well with the proper manpower and the proper supplies, we might be able to run this. You know no more, you know permanent base for this presence so very quickly and Ania. It was down to the wire and best by the announcement is coming on such notice. What we did, nonetheless, it is, in fact a Ramadan halal meal and food distribution. A local organization it was the world seek. Parliament is actually providing us with 600 meals, along with some canned goods that we're going to be giving away to families on a first-come, first-served basis. Beef antenna take place this coming Thursday, it's from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. if you are a careering board member specifically, or anybody who would like to volunteer to join us. Please send an e-mail to the board office right away. It's Q and Legman C, 0, 4 @ CB da nyc.gov, while the event only takes place from 4 to 6 p.m. we have two. There is a half hour of break down as well as an hour so setup before we start I myself will be there around 2:30 3 o'clock, that'd be amazing, but I can't emphasize -. Please call before you come only because we may have too many volunteers and we don't want to already add more chaos -. What could already be a chaotic event? The NYPD is on board with us. They are helping us out, they'll, be there -, you know it for social distance. Again we will be sending you guys, a physical copy of not only this flyer but everything else that was discussed tonight. So you could expend any inboxes as early as tomorrow morning and yeah alex. Is there anything else you want to add to it or as their way, this good you pretty much covered? Every area has been it's like the most diverse region in the country, some of a lot of the mutual aid that's been going on, there's been some unique challenges and so I know between the multiple religions in the area. Buddhist Muslim Christian they in do so. The zombies needs when it comes to food. Pantries aren't being addressed as he approached in so this provides unique opportunity to be able to serve that population and that everybody who's being taken care of in the community. I also want to do a quick shout out, you know. Well, we will be providing our own PPE to the best of our abilities. Not only is the world State Parliament providing volunteers, but we also have congressman. Meng is going to be blessing us with some PPE for the volunteers. It was just an in-kind donation. Just amazing. Thank you so much for that. So yeah. If all goes well, we will be there Thursday from 4 to 6 and any volunteers. Again, I can't emphasize please pre-register I'll, be the one man that volunteers you can make my life a lot easier by just letting me know at a time if you'd like to join it's just about four hours. If you get turned down, please understand it does not mean that you know your help. Is it's not wanted? It's just that it's unneeded and it is a pretty small operation. Lift up I respond so well. We appreciate the help. If you get turned down best appointees- and that's my that's my only report, thank you, environmental, yes, hello, yes, okay to report, it's just that. You know like in March we made that great strives with I think the city up ban plastic bags, that was gonna start in March. Unfortunately, the whole corporate thing happened and we had to push everything back, I, believe they push everything back to May 15 I got a check, can I check the date again I believe he pushed it back again. Just that was it I mean it just. It was a shame because you know I was trying to. We were like fighting hard food for a long time to ban plastic bags, and we in for when we finally got it in watch. Unfortunately, I'm gonna push everything back again so saying it was. Unfortunately, that's all Thank, You, Oscar and I know you were being reported. That I remember those face, though so trust me Ashley's here, chairman hello, Thank You.

This Thursday May 21st at 11:00 a.m. they're, doing a virtual Memorial, Day commemoration and the reason I mention it is because we were actively involved in Elmhurst parks, Vietnam, Veterans Memorial, so that I understand there will be a live component with some of the veterans there.

We had a phone conference and I just want to state that I'm going to talk about search for a moment about volunteering. Their time just remember. This does not get compensation at all for all the work they do. We had a group of us at the very beginning of this shutdown in March up to now distributing boxes that weigh almost 25 to 30 pounds from my from a large delivery truck or from the airports to go into other vehicles that are spread out throughout Queens I'm, very proud of them. This is a very big and heavy job to do for those that are over 55 or 60. The NYC em provided other work for cert teams. They provided that we could call, or do a survey online to reach out to hotels and hostels, to look for a housing for the homeless and to look for those that may have to stay in quarantine due to the fact that they have CoV 19. Another thing we're doing is the buddy system pretty much with Ashley was talking about the insists that we reach out to our neighbors and have our neighbors reach out to neighbors families and friends, and as she stated, many people are very proud, don't want to say anything, don't even say that they have food I've been suggesting that they go to Catalina cruise and all these others not to be shy about it or proud about it. It's imperative that they stay healthy and well and that the whole purpose of this is to stay connected I'm, just letting you know that it's been very successful. As for people that are victims, we had a meeting about safe horizon coming and speaking to us about human trafficking, a lot that was brought up by Diwan about domestic violence, and it was also brought up at that meeting. It's a way of connecting with people knowing what to say how do we challenge them to allow them to feel free to speak to someone? We don't look like officers, so we found that that's a great bridge in which to help our community I reached out to the firehouse 280, not Ladder, Company 138. This is on 97th and 4-3 Avenue to find out how they're doing with the Colvin they had 15 members who came down with Covid-19, 19, I'm, very happy to say the rollback and working at the firehouse they've been busy with other things, such as over again as I stated over power surges and some people, forgetting that they're leaving things on top of the stove. So that's been part of their problem this month, as well as going to homes of those who they are trying to get to Elmhurst Hospital that may have Co VI D Co V 19 problems. The 110th precinct had from late March 30 officers out 612 were diagnosed with Co V 19, also I'm glad to report they're all back at the precinct and doing the angst about if they have enough PPE. They said at this time they have enough supplies to keep making that orders and if anybody wants to donate to the 110 they'll be grateful to that. I asked about the new guidelines under the shut down for nightclubs, restaurants and grocery stores and parks, they're very happy to say they haven't given out any summonses. The majority of our businesses and parks have been a hundred percent compliance to the shutdown rules. They are educating people as they go out to the streets near trains and then parks how to keep that so many distance away from each other and to wear masks it's imperative for that. So they work on that they're. Also, looking at 3 1 calls that come in for non-compliances, those that they feel our restaurants are open with an overcrowded group of people. They look into it and so far everyone's been working with the 110 on that I did bring up about a crime in the area. They did touch on domestic violence and such, but the big thing has been burglaries stores that are closed for a long time have been hit, as well as some people in homes. These are people, they watch very cases that you leave the house and the biggest thing has been vehicles such as trucks advance. So they have the anti-crime working on the early morning shift, let's say from 1 to 5 when these are very active. We talked also about the homeless, especially on Broadway for Oscar, who asked about that. They had a meeting with MTA and with breaking ground, and some churches are you here, I'm, not sure which ones those are I, believe it might be st. James work along the Roosevelt Avenue number, seven line, because they also look for places near stores that are known, so they can pack their belongings, and especially a Broadway is the biggest one so they're going to work on a something like a mate asked for it to see if they can get after that, I don't know when that's gonna be implemented, though, but they are working on it. Rafi T I'm very proud to say that we got an attaboy from the 110, because Christian made us look good by supplying paint so we'll be able to keep up with graffiti, so I. Thank him again on that now for the liquor licenses. I know the Christian explain to you what we're doing we're trying to be fair to all the businesses that Coen ideas that affect everyone, I, don't even know how many will be back up vanity had at seventy seven fourteen Queens Boulevard, a large list of problems. They've had a history of problems for a long time, a lot less than they usually have. So we sent a letter out to s the way that we're asking them to work on those problems, and hopefully, by next time they won't. They won't have as much as what we saw the night of the meeting and I. Think that's being fair at this point and that's my report. So anybody would like to say anything or ask any questions. He is here long, okay, youth services, Alexa. You are a miracle evening. Alexa went off okay, so just as Christians that in the last month's board meeting, we have officially canceled the Youth fair because of everything that's going on. It was very sad to do that officially, but I think that that's the best decision right now at this moment there is not another meeting day. However, I did email, the board members and anyone can feel free to email me with any concerns or any projects that you think that is appropriate for the youth services committee to take on in the future. But at this time there's no current meeting scheduled at this time and I guess we're gonna see what happens. Thank you so much alike, so appreciate it. Okay, Christian I, don't know if I really wanna go through this. No actually before you go anything else, we have to elected officials, just entered our first one there's so many woman Cruz has joined us and councilman Francisco Moya also joined, so we're gonna, mute them and I guess any. But if you want to go on, you want to state first Acosta. First, okay, that's this I guess I do state! Assemblywoman Cruz is live good evening, you're a little low, oh you're, sorry Catalina you're still a little too low as they maybe a little more. No you it's pretty bad! Maybe I don't know you're there, but should not quite like it's just a little. If you could just speak directly into the mic, I guess that'll make all the difference, but you are somewhat. Thank you. Thank you. Please do you got it I'll see you soon. Lou councilman Moyer is in there. He goes comes my Moyers in how are you man there? You go much clearer, yeah. No, the technology issues that I face here, but anyway, I want to be very quick. I know you guys have been on for a while thank you, Chris Thank, You Lou again, and thank you to all the board members for the wonderful work that you are all doing, especially during these tough times. You know the numbers that have come out yesterday in the zip codes of seeing the most deaths in the city of New York, one three, six, eight one, three, six, nine they're all in our communities right here. It's really showing the relational and economic disparity that we face here in this community. You know when you see these numbers, it just makes you want to want to cry. These are our neighbors. You know we lost a fellow board number. We've all been impacted by this. It's really difficult for me as someone who was born and raised in this community to see the suffering that's going on right now. You know it is critical that we get this administration, but you'll really start writing the ship on all of the inequalities that we have faced here, the zip codes, if they are in the financial district and in Battery Park, had zero deaths. Our folks, don't the second homes out in you know the Hamptons in upstate New York to go ride. This wave out we're here. We know that this is a working-class community, a lot of undocumented immigrants here, small business owners that are suffering here. You know they show why that there's a big racial disparity, the Latino and African Americans, the percentages of folks that could actually stay home and telecommute for the Latino community. It was only 16% and for the african-american community was only 24% in the city of New York. What does that say is that the majority of them are in the hospitality or service industry and they don't that are delivering the food to our homes. Well, we get to you know, stay here in quarantine and they're, the ones that are Manning the cash registers and stocking the aisles in our supermarkets so that we can get the food we need to keep going. We saw the number of deaths that have taken place. Reason why I was the first one to come out to really start an emergency burial fund. They would alleviate a lot of the pain that families were going through, especially here in this community there's a program through HRA that provides burial assistance. It doesn't provide for cremation they only or giving up to nine hundred dollars as a reimbursement and a fur for any burial quest. You needed a social security number a couple of things wrong there. We all know that the cost of a funeral to bury a loved one doesn't cost $900 number two. If you're, not working, if you pay the rent, how are you going to be able to put money up front and wait for a reimbursement that comes back later so myself and speak of Cory? Johnson were the first ones to actually talk about this. There was a number of articles that were written about this. We found got the mayor to move on this there's over 20 million dollar emergency fund that is now open to all New Yorkers that have suffered from kovat deaths. It doesn't matter your status, you can apply, there's going to be a list of local community-based organizations that will help administer the applications for the fund. So it's not just for burial costs. It actually goes to cremation. We've moved the needle so that it's not going to be $900. Now it's going to be up to three thousand five hundred dollars, which would help any family that is in need, or in assistance for this. We made that announcement about a week and a half ago and we're very excited to be the first ones rolling this out. So we have some positive news there, but also if people having problems paying their rent, they can reach out. It will be through this fund, where they will administer some assistance. Last week, unanimously passed a real, strong piece of legislation that goes to help our small business owners and, in particular our restaurants. It goes after the third-party apps like GrubHub. So if you have your, you know smartphone, and you want to order your food through this app. They were charging up to 30% of services that they weren't even providing to some of these for the restaurants here in the city of New York, they were charging for delivery service when they weren't even having anyone deliver the food. The restaurant was themselves the numbers in which they were charging for other expenses for processing fees for telephone calls. So if you call the restaurant and you were looking at their menu and they didn't have what you wanted and you didn't anything- the third-party app like GrubHub was still charging these restaurant owners with a fee for the phone call that when we looked and did the analysis of this, it was up to nine dollars for a phone call. That was less than two minutes. It's outrageous that they would be doing this in this time of an emergency here when our small businesses are suffering now we capped it so that they can't charge these restaurants more than 15%. They will not be charged for the four phone calls that aren't placed that aren't placing an order. We're really going after this to protect the small business owner, providing small business owners with zero interest loans. We've also seen just the incredible lines of people and I know I was I was on the line before and I was listening to folks about the food pantries. Just so you know I fund six food pantries in my council, Matic District. We have seen the need to expand that myself and the speaker announced 25 million dollars in emergency food relief to all of our pantries to the city and that's 25 million that is going to come directly to our communities. One of the reasons. Why is that we were seeing that if you were going through the food bank, they were just being completely overrun at this point, the shipments weren't coming in now we have been able to expand it to in a way in which all of the food pantries and anyone that is interested in helping deliver food. Please let my office know we have plenty of access to that. We will have pallets. We can have prepared boxed meals, especially for seniors. We've. Seen that a lot of our seniors in the community can't get out of their homes. We've signed up a lot of them for the emergency food relief fund. It provides them with non-perishable that one box itself has enough food for three days and we are continuing to do that throughout we're going to be doing several things. We've done a lot of partnering with our local labor unions that have come in to help and mostly I, think for us. It's just to hear from you I want to let you know that we are operating monthly, but we're here. My staff is here we are having a virtual Town Hall tomorrow with the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs in particular. What we're seeing now is a lot of scams that are happening phone calls that are coming in to people to seniors telling them you know they have. They can get coded 19 vaccine shots. All of these crazy nonsense that we see. We also know that there's been price gouging in our communities, that's something that we can't tolerate. I'm, really happy to be talking about some of these issues that will impact folks directly. You can go on my website, Facebook page Instagram. You can see all of the information for our town hall that will happen tomorrow and how you can log in it will be at 6:30. So we hope that you can all join us. We also did a live Telemundo, a town hall that dealt with issues with mental health, we're seeing that a lot of people in our community, especially the Latino community, don't have real access to mental health. Now we have the ability to make sure that we're reaching a broader audience, especially here in our district. A lot of people are suffering from either being at home for all this time or the pressures of being out of work not being able to pay the rent food scarcities. So it's really important that we provide the service and we can put up the numbers and give it a Christian to distribute people want to talk to professionals. You can do that, so you know, obviously it's anonymous if you want to not leave your name, but it's good for people to have these resources here and lastly, as you know, we were all quarantined at home. It doesn't mean that some of the criminal activity has stopped. We saw a lot of gang activity, that's been happening in the district gang tag. Zipping were going up, especially in the underpasses of the Long Island Railroad. Yesterday I went out with a couple of the officers officer, saponaria and officer Connor and removed a lot of the graffiti from underneath the underpasses and places that folks had a call to. Let me know about this. It's a I think it's important that we also show that we're not going to be intimidated by this. They we want to see our streets clean. We want to protect our community and when people decide that they wanted to face our neighborhood, we're gonna go right out there and we're going to take it down and demonstrate it. We're not going to take that I think it's really important that people know that we are going to continue to fight to maintain our community safe and free from that kind of Filth that we see there so with that chair. Thank you. So much for the opportunity. I hope that everyone is doing well. If there's anything I can do, please feel free to contact my office I'm, always available and I hope everyone stays healthy. Thank you. Thank you, a Christian, the other call of it yeah, okay, so right now sorry, I wasn't I was muted again, so Assemblywoman cruises has returned and she has headphones now. So hopefully that's that taken care of. So we come here right now and we also have James Monday Lu. So who was also unable to speak earlier from the controllers office, he'd like to make really quick about. After that we have a some people in Cruz, unmuted them a little bit better than before, Christian yeah, very clear goal: cookies, fantastic, alright, some hope, I'm hoping everybody's holding up well I'll, try to keep it short and sweet, because I know it's a little bit late in the evening I this week, so Christian. If our office to let Alex know we're happy to see, we can get you some extra masks or anything like that. You guys can give out we're happy to make sure that happens. I wanted to give a little bit of updates, because I haven't had the opportunity to join you guys and in a little while it's been really hectic. We actually basically from the first day that the stage declared a state of emergency with the governor. You declare state of emergency. We turned our office into a food pantry where we have been serving approximately 2,000 meals per day six days a week, so that's 12,000 meals, we're talking over 70,000 meals. So far, we also provide baby products and food staples. The way we've been able to do this is through donations and partnerships with nonprofits, as well as local restaurants, like Mama Catalina and in a couple of other ones in the neighborhood that have been really open to the idea of helping. Now they understand that, even if they're, not in the greatest of situations, neither are their neighbors, so they've been really good at helping us. We recently had an event it's outside of your district of the community boards district, but we serve about 250 families in the Muslim community, with staples of food, rice, oil etc, as well as military meals. To make sure that they had they needed during their holy one, we know it's not enough, so we're hoping to do one more event. We have been fortunate enough to receive donations from around the country of PPE, which was given to nonprofits out of our office, as well as through the hospital not only face masks but shields and other items that we've given directly to Elmhurst Hospital. One of the things that we do is when we give out meals in our office. We give out three masks two per person as well to make sure that people have what they need and we at the same time I'm not forgetting that our job is also to legislate, and we've proposed several pieces of legislation that we're hope are going to address the needs of our community during it's very difficult. One of them is the dignified burial Act, which seeks to provide people with the money that they need, regardless of immigration status and having it go directly to the funeral home so that they can speed up the process when their loved one dies. The last thing you should have to worry about is: where are you going to bury them and where is that money going to be going to come from? The other? One is in a tax incentive for businesses right now, many people have lost their jobs. Part of what we do is actually help, because there is apply for unemployment insurance, which has been a very difficult practice, but we've served probably more than 200 people. So far with this issue, and from that was born, the idea that we have a lot of local businesses who could use the tax incentives and that we want them to hire local folks. So, along with senator baby, we've introduced a piece of legislation that would give up to two years worth of tax credits for businesses, the hire workers who lost their jobs because of Coleman and excuse me and who live within 50 miles of the location of that business, so that it stays as local as possible, and the last piece of legislation just actually being introduced this week would allow small businesses who've had a very difficult time staying open to be able to use Kovan. As a way to either renegotiate their lease or that can go and do business elsewhere, we would of course want them to stay in our community, but we also don't want them to go completely broke. There's other pieces of legislation coming along the way. The hope is that, sometime in the next week or two, we can actually go back to the legislating piece which we're able to do in the same way that we're meeting the electronic needs. We can do that. We have to partner with amazing folks I want to give a shout out to the hundred and tenth priests in who has been fantastic for everything we needed from them, from responding to emergencies, to crowd control, to actually donating to our office food that they're able to collect from their own members from other places from other presents at least twice a week to come and bring us baby products as well as food. So we are extremely thankful for to the new Jewish commanding officer, as well as the community officers would just have been. I have to tell you one of our greatest partners in responding to the needs of the community. We are going to be having a will actually have been having a series of tumbles there, basically every Thursday, for about an hour, because we want to keep it short. When we provide information to our community on very specific issues related to Colvin. We did one on health care last week where we had Israel Rocha from Elmhurst Hospital. We did one on landlord tenant issues where we had someone from ami NHS and someone from legal services. We are having one on Thursday, where we are having Commissioner Lorelei solace from the city as well as an attorney for me, the role to talk about workplace issues in rights during the time of Kovac, and we had a small business one where we had the Commissioner of as V s, talk about the issues that are affecting small businesses, so we're trying to compare issues specific and just really bring you the kind of information that you need. We have all the leukocytes that our office, physically to the like, we are phone lines, are open. Every single day we've been able to help hundreds of constituents with whatever they need. Our office does remain open and will remain open as long as we're able to find tiny partners who help us provide people with the food that they need. We're open, Monday through Saturday at 12:30 to 3:30. If you come across any constituents, I do not care if they're outside of the 39th Assembly District I do not care, whether anything other than do. They have a need, send them I, wait. Sometimes I learn, sir extremely long. We want to help them. We provide pre-made health, fresh, healthy meals, every single day, along with whatever the donations we get so whether it's fries beans, canned food puts from a restaurant. We provide that as well and every Wednesday. We have a farmers market truck that actually comes and provides healthy vegetables for the community and up until last week, because, unfortunately, the need was so high and in folks wearing really listening to social distancing requirements. We were giving out every two weeks, baby out of diapers and in formula etc. We're going to do it by home an appointment only so if you know of anyone Vinita then in our way- and we also do emergency deliveries to homebound ears, did you have anyone who's, a homebound, senior and needs who delivery? What we do is not only do we deliver while any of the city services kicks in it, but we help expedite a connection for them to receive whether it's meals, a wheels or one of the other programs to make sure that everyone gets what they eat and we've been working really closely with the parents in the community to ensure that the DOA is providing everyone with the distance learning requirements, whether it's a computer, elective whatever it is, that they need we've been working with them, hasn't the easiest, but you know we're making sure that everybody can get that and I think that's about it. If anyone has any specific concerns, whether it's on small businesses, workers right on anything just feel free to call our office. Our team has been truly fantastic during this horrific time. I wouldn't be able to do what I do without the amazing team that really is holding it together, and so as much as you hear me doing all those things all these things. It's really been because of the team that I get to go I every day. I don't have the luxury to suffice, allayed, unfortunately, because it's for a long time there were no other food distribution opportunities. We were open even before the schools were open to give out food and we're going to continue to be open as long as people need us, and so thank you and let us know if there's anything, we can do for you, your loved ones, and if there's anyone who is either indeed who's, either watching this or from the board, who has lost a loved one. My sincere deepest condolences. We are here for you. Thank you. Thank you. So much sunny woman, so Lou finally, I mean as far as the elected officials go. We only have James modulo so from the controllers office, just a couple of leg and then James from the controller you here, yeah, okay, yeah, I'm, sorry that I couldn't make it earlier. I was actually covering community board 10 there in southwest Queens and modern community board. 14. A lot of board meetings are today hey when normally they would it be to save the best. For last, my walk exactly you guys are actually on the regular time right. Yes, sir okay, so I got four things I'm going to put all of them into the chat and I guess Christian you or someone else who's. Someone else can send them to all the attendees but Sir yeah. The first thing is the co vyd 19 resource guide, I talked about this last month. This is the guide that has a lot of information for people who are homeowners, independent contractors. You were on a non-profit of your senior small business if you're a tenant, you know there's specific information organized by those categories. The thing that's new about this one's compared to last ones is. We have a lot of new dates and we also have it available in traditional Chinese and Spanish. So I think that might help quite a few people who live in the Elmhurst and Corona and next week we will likely have it in Bengali, which probably could help few people in this district as well and French, which may be not as helpful here, but in some of the areas it is. We also I also want to announce I'll put the link in now, so you can start sending it second thing: we have a newsletter from the comptroller's office that just came out on the 18th. We're gonna try to put these out more frequently I'll paste it in for you. It's a message has a message from the Comptroller. It also outlines some of the issues that New York City will be facing economically, has a lot of information about the economy on the national level. Some of the trends that we're seeing it has some information. What the likely gaps will be in terms of the budget of in terms of revenue that will not be. We will not be getting as much revenue as you can obviously tell compared to what we were initially projecting and it talks about it's an update from the March 23rd letter, which I may have talked about last time. This one, this new update, shows that the gaps will be even larger. So if you're interested in some of those numbers, you can check it out, there's also some information about the summer youth programs. I know many people in community board, 4 and community board 3. All the community boards really are concerned about the loss or the potential loss of this program and there's some information about why it needs to be protected. So you can check that out as well. I'll put that into the I'll put that into the chat right now, and next thing is an initiative by the office to get unclaimed wages to people that deserve them. So if you know any people that worked on city contracts- and they might not even realize that they're owed money, so we announced a campaign a few weeks ago to get people there unclaimed prevailing wages, those who work, those are for workers who were cheated out of their pay, because contractors on city funded projects didn't pay the correct wage. So if you know anyone who may have worked on a project like this, you can go to our website. I'll put the link in there and you can search your name. If you were someone who worked on a project to see if you are owed money, a lot of people don't even realize that they didn't get the money that they deserved and there are quite a few people on our list that live in Corona and Elmhurst, or at least that was their last known address. So please, if you know anyone who's in this situation, please spread the word again. You can search your name there and I'll put that link in a few moments. There's 2.5 million dollars worth of unclaimed wages right now, so there's money out there that can really help people, especially during this crisis. The final thing I want to talk about is just quickly. We just our office just issued a special report on election day operations of the New York City Board of Elections, and the findings were not ideal. We basically found that the Biot we generally didn't comply with federal and state election law on election day procedures. So there was a report that outlines the issues that we found there and some of these. Some of these issues are things that people commonly report. So if you're interested in that I'll put the link in there as well again thanks for accommodating me, I'm sorry I wasn't able to be here on time and if you need you can always reach out to me. I know many of you have my phone number and email I can put it into the chat as well. Thank you thank you, James, and, to reiterate all the boomers who are joining we're came later on realized that you will receive everything that was discussed tonight. Minutes as well as any attachments or any Flyers, they can't await. Could you could expect them? That's copies thanks, James! Oh, look! Okay! Thank you! Everyone for calling in and videoing him and whatever else you might have done. Thank you for the information that was exchanged here. It's all very important and I wish everybody to be safe and we're not gonna have that last session cushion before you close that lien on this fine, that's fine! That's fine! I'm, okay, I'm, okay, I! Just speak to my - I got you: okay, I'm, okay, I'm! Okay! It's just reminded what remembers guys. Just please remember we! You will receive the flier first thing tomorrow morning, we're gonna finalize it tonight, I'm working on it right now, 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. st. James Church. This Thursday we're gonna, be giving away halal meals and honor Ramadan as well as some non perishables for four to six, but we could use the help as early as maybe 2:30 3 o'clock to the very end around 6:30. We have to clear the place so again, please don't throw up. We may end up. 20 volunteers hold the board office. Email, the board office hungry directly, if you can- and we will acknowledge you and we'll see if we can use your help, alright guys. Thank you so much and really Lucy very quickly. Something I want to be very clear: Christian did not necessarily give up until 110th precinct on the City Council did a while back. If you guys will know we receive a stipend from this account that allowed us to do several things for the community. One of the things that we did do was the precinct. The reason did ask for paint and I'm glad to report that it was a very easy thing: Thank You Lou for proving that he put it through. For us, it was a very small amount, but the effects that it had are gonna be great. It manages to do all four districts are sectors, a b c and d for the next two or three months, and that actually might hold us out for again a very nominal amount that you know the payback is just so much better than what we have, but then you just pumped a paper to the full board and to the city council, providing us with that money in the first place, alright, so Lou, that's it! You can. Thank you, okay! Thank you. Everyone and good night.
