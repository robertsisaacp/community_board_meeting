So I'll start with some of the bad news, because I know I've been getting a lot of questions about the impact of Covid-19 19 on the city's economy on the amount of money the city's going to be able to collect and on March 23rd Our office issued a report.
The estimate was that there'd be a loss as high as six billion dollars to the city, but based on fact that this endemic has continued and because the we don't know when we're gonna be able to stop the social distancing when will be safe to stop it and when the pause will end now, our office is estimating that it may be worse, but we don't have exact numbers That's enough of the bad news now for some of the good news I'm going to give you a link for the Comptroller's small business and MWBE webinar series So, that's a series of webinars via zoom, in which small business owners can join in and get information about money that's available to them through the government, but also ways to get private funding.

I will tell you, though, that I am balancing very carefully the danger to public and the danger to the inmates to make sure that you know we're doing the right thing for Queens in general, but there has been a very large push to see that we get people who are in danger.
That is counterintuitive to the fact that we are all social distancing in our home and we're sort of trapped in cell 14 Anybody who knows anything any of our members that know of people who have been victims of domestic violence who have reached out to your organization in the past, Remember that police are not doing home visits because of the quarantine orders you know, are the sheltering orders and that there is really no sort of physical check If you know, if someone who is at risk, please contact them, because we know that, even though the numbers have gone down, it's just not real , they can't be real, I've talked about it and we want to make sure that people know there is a hotline at the domestic at the Queen's, District Attorney's Office, that hotlines number is 722 I, don't know whether you only see my nose or my house, so the domestic violence hotline is seven one When.
