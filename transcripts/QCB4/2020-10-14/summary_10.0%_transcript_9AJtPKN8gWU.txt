We will be getting a flyer and it is still a Sunday woman, cruises office, doing the cleanup If anybody can see before would like to volunteer the time will come.
You, guys remember that last month, I had announced that there was a mural project we were working on and that actually it's been It's been successful in that we already received several entries, and anybody to know that tonight would have would have been the deadline and we would have opened it to a full public process and the one that got the most vote is the one that won.
Please check your emails, Daniel Drum's office reached out to us, and he does have a letter of support that you should have received requesting that the board review and hopefully approve a street codenaming coming up for and again, let me not get into details because I do not have the email directly in front of me, but please take a look at it, as you guys will.
The board wants to do that, but this right this, the email that you guys got just for the street code, naming I've been working with well , I've been actually doing a book swap every month, Once a month, the next one's coming, up, attentively, October, 29th, And I do take book.
Maybe there's two publication meetings coming, but now anyway, we still can ask about the like public safety, those things you remember last month not too long ago in Manhattan, Lexington avenue at 34 street, or something like that.
I enjoy it, and if you need me, let me know we got the voting coming.
I want to thank all the volunteers that came out to the two cleaning park, cleanings, one at Joseph, Campanity Park, and one at William, F Moore Park at the American Triangle Department of sanitation, The 110 precinct a couple of community board members.
We had a lot of children show up it's something that we could look forward to doing in the future, involving maybe students from the schools once everything goes back as the numbers creep up with Covid-19 I can't help but say in this neighborhood a lot of people with no masks.
I love to see when people get recognized for their hard work and anything that the community board needs a phone call away to help.
Give me one second I have no objection to the renaming of the street, and would you like to say something else: Actually I'm waiting for my assignment to a committee, So, while you'll get assigned you won't be going to a meeting like you normally would have by now in person What's with my computer, because when I attended the meeting that Mr Casino held for new members to talk about the how the office functions, I did not have a problem, and this is the second time in a row for a monthly meeting that my computer does not function.
That's, actually not a bad thing, considering Rego Park and Forest hills and Kew gardens or red zones, and that means that we just need to continue to practice the the protocols, the social distancing, washing your hands wearing masks.
Perhaps you know people are interested, they can find the petition and I'll say the rest of my comments for the my committee report.
I may want to add one thing, but I'll discuss that with you another time, again, good work to everybody and be safe.
Those are the three names, the rest of the names as I'll try to show you are still here in the hat, so we have to find people who will be on the nominating committee extremely randomly and what I want to say regarding that is just remember any one of you board members other than the new members who have not been here can put your name in for any office that you want, or actually I should not say, any single office.
You can't be elected to more than one office, so that might not be a very good idea to have the need to play with this, because if it comes up as a winner, it could cause a bit of a problem.
Everyone has been home for a long time and although some of the restrictions have lifted, as somebody else mentioned previously in the call we see cases going up And, we have to continue to be proactive, practice, social, distancing and listen to the experts who know what they're saying so from that, and nothing to report.
So we've been seeing how things turn out, but that decision was made by the Supreme Court this evening and the last two items that I will be sharing links with as well in the Chat box, is that our office is looking to honor those in our community who have been lost to the 19, as well as celebrate people in our neighborhood who are going above and beyond during this difficult time, and so.
If you know the neighbor or someone in the district or lost to over 19 or who has been really going out of their way to help the community during this hard time, it's going to be two separate links.
In, addressing, what's anticipated to possibly be a second wave, we're working to address the uptick in cases that we've seen in some parts of New York City by getting the word out about testing sites bringing out mobile sites, educating folks on wearing mass social distancing and just also encouraging people that you know you can't get your flu shot to protect your neighbors as well as to minimize symptoms.
For that last week we also had two food distributions, one with Corona ambulance We distribute fresh produce at Plaza Del Sol through the healthy bucks, Program Council member Francisco, Moya funded we've had several community cleanups, where we roll up our sleeves with our basic volunteers, we'd like to thank ace alongside city agencies such as sanitation and parks, department.
The, most recent event took place at William, Ethmoir, Park and up Corona avenue to I might say this wrong, it's committee park, so thank you, Vinnie, who provided breakfast and ari as well as 100, presents for joining us as well as The Volunteers Council member Francisco Moya allocated 160 thousand dollars in funding for DSNY in the ace program.
Any illegal dumping site feel free to reach out to our office, as we continue to work closely with the Sny and Ace to tackle these ongoing issues for people illegally dumping garbage a couple.
You would like to participate in one of our community cleanups or any of our upcoming events, I will be putting my information in the chat or you can feel free to call our office at 718, 651, 1917.
I will send christian a flyer to pass around to all of you, and hopefully you will be able to attend good to see you all be safe, be well see you in November You go regarding the early voting.
It's probably not your regular polling place is probably not where you go for early voting , I'm, getting community board nine and one headphone This is James Montaluso from the office of the New York City comptroller.
If you're interested in getting just you know some facts about what the recovery is, looking like, what the unemployment numbers and what the prospects are for the city in the future.
A lot of different informational tables with census, reps and volunteers, set up at different places on the district, to help people to sign up to the census and to you, know, hopefully negate some of the stigmas out there.
We, had, and I will name you guys, out, because you know it's really difficult to come out during Covid-19 times, especially to the Queen, Center mall, and especially on a weekend.
So and again, I've been in somewhat contact with Oscar on this, but you guys already know that in the Corona area, or actually our only two real community gardens are in the coronal area.
They were looking for the Community Board support on something like this.
We did sign our names onto it and we would be wanting to support whatever we can, because our other two gardens are anybody who knows they're my pride and joy, When I tell you Corona, we are producing our own honey.
As people have expressed to me, like Ashley, I will consult with Christian about putting together a meeting and letting the Parks Committee members know about that.
We had a long list of people from the liquor license, but I asked our officer to answer some questions from the community and he sent them to meet them.
The only thing that's up is grand largely of autos, so that seems to be still a problem with us, the homeless issue that was brought up for Whitney, Avenue and Broadway They're thinking of certain areas that keep coming back with the homeless of making like these mini task force, but they need the breaking ground and other not- for- profits to keep up with the situation they're working on this now with the NCO officer of a and B Graffiti, we asked about giving a 500 fine for those that commit the crime or 500 award, who can give us information who's doing the crime that is now being looked at by the police, department, vendors at 11Th street in 44Th, Avenue and 51St avenue they're going to check some of them and complain that they have licenses to be there they're going to check on that to see.
The request has been noted if you'd like to reach out to me or the board office that do not know where you'd like to see them.
Yes, I just want to say: Teamwork makes the dream work like Michelle always says everybody on this community board is wonderful.
Please know that just because you're outside does not make you immune to the virus, so I see a lot of mainly adults that are in parks and not wearing masks, please, for the sake of the children and the younger people that are using those parks, respect that rule and wear a mask at all times thanks and have a good night.
Everyone for coming good night and be safe, thanks.
