Often if you want to just mute yourself, real, quick, okay, perfect, okay, everyone thanks everyone for joining in, we finished with the the needs, the sorry fiscal, year, 2020 capital expense, early, so.
I know it said we were going to start the regular board meeting at 7:30, but we're starting out seven o'clock.
So right now, we're just going to start a regular November board meeting and thank you.
I want to say pretty firmly advised that this is not something that should be as openly widely shared and worked on with board members, as we did.
I do know that I tend to read and likely speak a little bit fast, so I'll just go through each statement, one by one.

Who is the outreach coordinator for the Ccrb, the civilian Complaint Review Board, also known as the Ccrb is a city agency independent from the New York Police Department that investigates and mediates complaints against NYPD officers in a neutral and unbiased manner.
Just a few minutes to request from members everybody to join me, many in our community of left right city and in Corona, and giving dual consideration to connecting 57th avenue or part of the surrounding street or Avenue in honor of Mr Jim Galloway.
You know why I choose to come before you with this request, with your support we can give due to this man whose dues are due posterity will never forget us for standing up for what is right, all things being equal.
While we do not necessarily have an actual way of voting in favor of the co-naming, one of the processes for going to street pool naming is that it goes to the board and then in turn the City council.
While no formalized vote can be taken, we might be able to take an opinion from board members and unless there's actual opposition, we can proceed with providing this letter.
Only thing we would need is a biography of Mr Galloway and that gets submitted eventually makes City Council, and hopefully we can get the street done in honor of the gallery.
We work to match small businesses and needs with qualified volunteers who have marketing finance operations and legal backgrounds to provide free, one-on-one support on topics such as understanding and applying for federal, funding, programs, financial planning, business operation, pivots, ecommerce campaigns and more to find out more information.

You guys know that you have the Corona ambulance, for this is by alfredo for many years now, and they are infamously known for giving back to the community Christmas events to working with the local precinct and tomorrow they're going to be honoring, veterans.
At, the ambulance corps located at 104-38, 45 47th Avenue, let's come together as a community to show support for our veterans.
Page, would be fully funded by the community board, the local City Council member Daniel, Drum and Assembly woman, cruz.
Yes, it's in the chat, and just so you guys know we had some very nice really nice pieces, some stood out some more than others, and ultimately the public did vote and the one with the most votes.
And I mean unless you guys really want to know.
Thank, you Christian, so I'm still filling in for Lou. He's, not here yet, but we're going to continue on to open session for board members.
You have any comments, questions concerns now's the time to speak, but this does not pertain to the the public hearing we just had on the the budget.
Everyone, good I, actually want to bring up the what you spoke about before Christian about starting a veteran like outreach or program, or so.
A little bit, get them to see before Swag and what we're all about, and one thing that we discussed is some of our new members are actually veterans and something that you guys know that I was a big fan, of, or rather a person.
He also had the youth cadets down in Corona, and the truth is that Community Board Ford does not have any actual committee that handles veteran affairs.
Hill, mahat, hey, guys, hi, hope, everyone, okay, good evening, first of all, happy veterans day right as a senior management, professional military, veteran myself.
What lorena mentioned earlier, which is good we have spoken to Christian earlier I, would definitely like to see a Veterans Committee or some sub subcommittee sometime soon within the CB4.
Tomorrow, I know there are still going to be some events.
We trust them, but maybe so nobody's taken care of taking the mailbox, but I wish someone would be able to let the postmaster know it by the Post office and 99-38 by 16Th Avenue.
Women are getting killed by their partners and I just ask that as an attorney who's actually working with a family justice center and safe horizon, there is a space you guys that look or family offense petitions for orders of protection.
I just wanted to share that, especially since what's been going on in the news and and basically that's it.
Christian and I are going to be doing a walkthrough tomorrow with breaking ground, to really actually understand the scenario with the homeless and begin to understand what these people need and actually start addressing it, because it's been ignored by city officials.
You know you can follow the transportation locations now, but I think there needs to be more urgency to this, because that's another problematic location in the sense that you have people speeding down.
There is right on judge and Whitney Avenue, with the the increase in the park you know being utilized as it should be, and the school there and the play street.
Okay, thank you, gregory, okay, so moving along Devon, Tariq I do not think he's here: Marcelo, testa, okay, marcelo, you're, unmuted, hello, everyone I, just got done to say just want to wish everybody happy, Veterans, Day and happy thanksgiving.
I wanted to touch on was something that a lot of folks in Corona Jackson heights and just honestly, all around Queens experienced last month, and that was that food pantries or community pantries, like La Jornada, were out of nowhere cut off from their funding.
If anybody hears anything or you see anything or there's an issue in the community, even if it's city or state or local, please feel free to reach out to me, reach out to our office.
P.M I will share the registration link in the Chat box and, if you're not able to join the event in person or at that time.
Since the last community Board meeting, the mayor announced the open storefronts program permitting storefront businesses to use a portion of their sidewalk to display merchandise, sell goods, complete transactions and provide queuing areas.
Distribution outside office with the organization met Council, and we actually gave out 400 food boxes to committee members from what I'm hearing it's greatly needed.
So I'm, going to talk about some upcoming events that we have this saturday and I will be providing the information and also be posting on the chat.
And I'm, hoping also that those of you in in power at different orgs can put this out on your social media mail it out in your newsletter, because we really want to get the best data possible to really understand what the challenges are for the working people in our city who have to balance work and family at a very uncertain time.
I have a lot of personal things to take care of this evening, but I do want to wish everybody happy.
I want to thank the committee for sitting through and coming up with ideas and just kind of brainstorming, so that we could just really pop out the needs.
We also held a workshop and social media marketing for small businesses and something that it kind of gave us an idea to try to include in the needs statement and try to get funding to continue stuff like that going forward.
We want to know how we could best support them and one of the best ways to do so through the business needs assessment and just kind of find out what people are struggling with, what their needs are and how we can make them successful in thriving business, and so that is it okay.
I, just I know how much to report I'm trying to get a meeting together, hopefully.
I really just want to sort of say that I think the future of the strength of this board is through our public members and public ownership of the issues in our community.
I still want to see commitment from board members on committees, but I also want to see my you know.
I do want to let you know that the park is going to be open.
You know in communicating to us because again, after all, the people that use the park are the people like the you and I and the public that are that.
Regarding that there is going to be a community advisory board meeting for Flushing meadows, Corona park.
Several people had received it from the alliance and others is that you know the alliance is really trying to distance themselves, I believe from the community.
Here, and so you know we with Christian and the office, they were able to send out mailings to the residents on Glean Street and.
Other thing I wanted to also follow up on with gregory's comments about the area around Elmhurst hospital on 41st, Avenue.
We actually, provided you know a small map of the area to D.O.T when we met with them last month.
If you guys want to check the chat and also gregory, if you can put the meeting date and time in the chat for everyone as well, and that's it so now we're going to be moving on to public safety, hi.
I feel, like the majority of us, know who Jim Galloway is, but while we do not have a biofilm, we do have enough information that shows what he has done within the sea before some time.
I know you talked about the budget, but are you going.
I'll see you're going to treat this, because the procedure is very simple: that any street code names come to the community board.
You know, would just read his own name and give his vote right.
You, know I'm going to say yes for both I just want to.
I think I'm good, but let me know.
