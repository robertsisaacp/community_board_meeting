Okay, that was quick that was quick yeah. So, okay, I'm going to wait. One more minute and hopefully I feel like more people are on now, which is good okay, so it's I think we're all good right yep often if you want to just mute yourself, real, quick, okay, perfect, okay, everyone thanks everyone for joining in, we finished with the the needs, the sorry fiscal year, 2020 capital expense early, so I know it said we were going to start the regular board meeting at 7:30, but we're starting out seven o'clock. We will be having an official vote on that later on in the meeting. So right now we're just going to start a regular November board meeting and thank you. Everyone for joining Lou is not going to be here right now. He will be joining us later, so I'm just filling in right now and- and we could start and I just want to hand it over to Christian for your district manager report. Okay, all right just bear with me, so excuse me hold on I'm coming back now. There we go all right guys, so I'll do the same thing in that in that again welcome. You know, as Marilina said, the public hearing portion of it did ends earlier than we expected. There were not very many edits, just a couple of very minor ones and again an enormous thank you to all the chairs. If you guys were all in the room right now, we'd do one of those applause and give yourselves a pat in the back, because you know, and I can go on a record in this night we were, we were somewhat advised. I want to say pretty firmly advised that this is not something that should be as openly widely shared and worked on with board members, as we did and I want to say it again. We did so a lot of you know we did it right. As you know, we worked on this very hard. A lot of the chairs, even logged in did their own edit. So thank you for that. I can not. Thank you enough. It's such an important document of the fact that we got that much participation, so I get paid to do this. You guys do not. You guys are volunteers, so kudos to you on that. As far as my report goes so I'll do a couple of things: I'll report on some minor mini board, stuff and then I just touched on any stuff that was sent to those flyers that were sent to us for the last couple days. I will do it via screen share, so you guys can keep up with me. I do know that I tend to read and likely speak a little bit fast, so I'll just go through each statement, one by one. It won't take very long and then we'll proceed with the rest of the agenda as as all right, so I'll just be sharing. My screen, I won't bear with me, and here we go all right, so it comes in a couple of we have a few things. The first one comes from a Sumitra Malhotra, the outfit coordinator for wick, and this email arrived this afternoon good afternoon. I hope this finds you well. Wick is a program of the New York State Department of Health, funded by the U.S Department of Agriculture. The Hs Wood program is the largest in New York state. We have nine conveniently located centers in Queens Brooklyn and the Bronx. Our centers are a one-stop shop with food stamp enroller and health insurance navigator, who are also providing services remotely I, have attached our wic flyer with locations and contact information. So what I'll say about the attachments? A I have told all the presenters or people who have sent in testimony that they can share the links for us over on the side, but also that we will excuse me that we will also share these links with you guys as part as we normally do after the meeting. Anything that was discussed tonight will be sent to you guys via one big attachment, so you'll be able to access everything so to continue our supplemental program for women. Infant and children continues to be to be of service to the families in need.

We are proud to be working with you and other community partners, and we ask that you continue to refer your clients to our wic centers as the best way to reach wic eligible families is by partnering with community organizations like yours, for any questions or for a week, one-on-one presentation, please reach Sunita Malhotra the week outreach coordinator at 646-619-6648 again Sunita. Thank you so much for joining us I'd, rather for sending in your literature. If you are with us right now by all means, please do share the chat box. That's perfectly okay! Otherwise we will forward all this to you, including any working links for everybody, who's attending the meeting and in our mailing within the next 24 to 48 hours. Our second piece of testimony comes from I'm. So sorry, if I missed production, we did speak earlier about that. Who is the outreach coordinator for the Ccrb, the civilian Complaint Review Board, also known as the Ccrb is a city agency independent from the New York Police Department that investigates and mediates complaints against NYPD officers in a neutral and unbiased manner. The ccrb investigates allegations of excessive force abuse of authority. Discourtesy and defensive language, we are excited to announce that the Ccrb's Youth Advisory council application is now open for youth ages, 10 to 18 years old. There is a link to apply that we will share to join the 2021 class. The U.S Advisory council, also known as the Yac, is a group of young new Yorkers who chance the Council of Ccrb and have fun innovative ways to bring young new yorkers into the narrative about civilian oversight of the NYPD in June. In 10, with the agency's release of a report on youth and the NYPD and the NYPD, the ccrp released a youth-focused public service announcement in 2019. The Yac plan speak up, speak out. A youth summit on policing in New York City, the Ccrb's first, ever full day conference focused on the relationship between young new yorkers and the NYPD to learn more about the biases visit. Nyc.Gov Ccrb, Youth, Council and I did see Marijuana. Thank you so much. The link is in the in the Chat box over on the right side. Guys again, if you have no access to it, the office will send this all to you in the next couple of days. The third piece comes from Georgia Norway, you guys remember. Joe Jonah is the former consumer. First chair of Community Board for many years. He was one of the board members who, after leaving the board, had perfect attendance. He never missed a single board meeting his entire time as the board of the biggest worthy notice, so he sent the following. Thank you both for responding back and check my respect regarding Jim Galloway, german Walker I. Salute you for your decades of service, our community and CB4. Thank you. The requests I wanted to make during the public forum is a simple, is simple. Just a few minutes to request from members everybody to join me, many in our community of left right city and in Corona, and giving dual consideration to connecting 57th avenue or part of the surrounding street or Avenue in honor of Mr Jim Galloway. As many of us know, Mr Jim Galloway played many pivotal roles to out to make our community a better place. His long list of selfless service run an entire damage. His impact range from organizing children programs after school program senior program, Margie, Riley, Memorial children's holiday tour. Excuse me: children, Holiday Hard drives Christmas Rockefeller Spectacular with kids Lavrex, the Tennis League Network City Merchant Association, and the president of Lefrak City Tenant Association, member of the 110 Precinct Community council, and attended meetings religiously. Until his health began to decline. His presence at Community board meetings was undeniable, as he sought to lend his voice on conversation to make our community better. Therefore not surprising coronal lines: Club Lasalle too late, Mr Jim Galloway, with Justice Philip, J, Chado's Community Service award last year, a testament to his contribution to his community and the annual left right. Children Halloween party, which he championed for years, did not happen this year because he was not with us to organize it. Unfortunately, my last minute attempt with Michelle excuse me with Miss Michelle Dunstan and Miss Sylvia Martin to quickly put one together. Navigating the challenges of Covid-19 did not make anything easier for us, but God willing, I hope. We can activate that wonderful program for the kids. In our community next year and moving forward, please I plan with your advice and guidance to make this call naming in memory of Mr Jim Galloway a reality. Many have approached me asking how we can keep the legacy. Excuse me the legacy of this selfless leader and organizer in our community to last through prosperity. Now you know why I choose to come before you with this request, with your support we can give due to this man whose dues are due posterity will never forget us for standing up for what is right, all things being equal I want to express my profound gratitude to those of you still serving our community. We appreciate you serving our community is a civic duty. We must embrace and not shrink from it sincerely Dr George O'nora, former CB4 member and Lefrak city resident. So while we do not necessarily have an actual way of voting in favor of the co-naming, one of the processes for going to street pool naming is that it goes to the board and then in turn the City council afterwards later on when chairman Walker enters, he joins our meeting. If he has not already will likely proceed the way we have in the past, while no formalized vote can be taken, we might be able to take an opinion from board members and unless there's actual opposition, we can proceed with providing this letter. The only thing we would need is a biography of Mr Galloway and that gets submitted eventually makes City Council, and hopefully we can get the street done in honor of the gallery. I'll move on to I believe we have maybe two small pieces left. The next one is from a janine raffio and she is from mainstreet relief and it is a group focused on helping small businesses across the Us, navigate through uncertain times created by the Covid-19 epidemic. We work to match small businesses and needs with qualified volunteers who have marketing finance operations and legal backgrounds to provide free, one-on-one support on topics such as understanding and applying for federal funding, programs, financial planning, business operation, pivots ecommerce campaigns and more to find out more information. You can contact janine, Marie Raffio at Jmraffio gmail.com, the next item on a report, as we have a couple of events coming up with Nhs neighborhood housing services. Unfortunately, she sent it to them to me pretty recently and I was unable to get them up to you in time for this meeting, but none of them happening tonight nor are happening tomorrow, but you'll certainly get them from us in the next again 24 to 48 hours. If there's anything time pressing in there. One more item, you guys know that you have the Corona ambulance for this is by alfredo for many years now, and they are infamously known for giving back to the community Christmas events to working with the local precinct and tomorrow they're going to be honoring veterans. So if you guys are not doing anything tomorrow and you want to visit the area of Corona, you should head out to the cornwall ambulance corps. There's a free community barbecue tomorrow in honor of veterans day between 12 and 2. At the ambulance corps located at 104-38, 45 47th Avenue, let's come together as a community to show support for our veterans. The event is sponsored by the Alpena Foundation kids, the coroner community ambulance corps and the 110 Precinct Council and Christina really quickly. I want to handle the issue with the mural that we have just so you guys know we ended our mural project. Ultimately, this is that began several months back. It was in conjunction with Councilman Daniel Drumm, an assembly woman, and the idea would have been that we were. You know: we've been working with the NYPD for quite some time now. We've been working with the NYPD for quite some time now to identify locations where Graffiti is rampant and what often happens is that Graffiti gets covered by the precinct a lot of times by paint allocated by local community groups such as the Community board, and only to create a canvas for others to go and plop up more and more graffiti, all over it. So, in an effort to combat that what we did was we worked with the precinct local businesses and some of our elected officials to identify locations where we have allocated pain in the past, but I continue to get Graffiti. So we held the full open casting call for three different students for several artists and then, ultimately, the one that got the most view. The most votes at the end of it, via both our instagram and facebook page, would be fully funded by the community board, the local City Council member Daniel, Drum and Assembly woman cruz. After two months of it, we ended up with three entries, all three solid, viable entries, and there was one clear winner and again, unless I'm able to share it right now, I'll do it at some point later on. Until we get the technology portion of things there, we go perfect, and this is the piece that won. Ultimately, it's the contest. We recognized very simply the only burgers that they had to have the word Elmer's strong in it and also had to have established at 1650. There are several locations both I will tomorrow or the day. I have to go with the precinct to verify the location, to see that they are still available, but I can assure you that they're all on very prominent locations, such as the corner of Utah, High, School or the corner of 82Nd and Broadway, and all the locations have been confirmed by the business owners, who are absolutely okay with the idea. So congratulations to the winner of the you know. I do not think it's the last time we're doing that. We're going to be doing this I do want to make it better in the future. Maybe we get more locations, get more funding and that's it from my side. As far as my report, hi Marilyna yeah Christina, what is it was down? Her name was a daisy, mendoza yeah I, just put it in the chat. Yes, it's in the chat, and just so you guys know we had some very nice really nice pieces, some stood out some more than others, and ultimately the public did vote and the one with the most votes, so I'll we'll reach out to Mrs mendoza. First thing tomorrow, let her know that it was decided that this was the final wins and I mean unless you guys really want to know. We give you exactly how many people voted on it, but it was. We did get a lot of votes. They did pick up a lot of traction, which is great because that means in the future. We can make it a lot bigger by getting hundreds of entries and maybe even more artists by expanding and yes red. We are indeed strong. So that's it guys. So that's my personal report. You know I'll just report as the night goes, if I'm needed for anything else and yeah I'll turn it forward. Thank you Marilyn. Thank you Christian, so I'm still filling in for Lou he's not here yet, but we're going to continue on to open session for board members. Many board members we'll go through the list of the board. Members present. If you have any comments, questions concerns now's the time to speak, but this does not pertain to the the public hearing we just had on the the budget. So that's going to be separate. We're going to hold that for later we're just going to talk about like our regular session for board members to speak. Okay, so we'll start now so do does Chris well, I guess, should I read the list of everyone questions yeah! Let's go that way. If you look at the participants, it shows who's there, but because phone numbers are in there also I'd rather go alphabetically and the second time around we'll okay sounds good. Okay, so Lucy scully, Mr, Chen you're unmuted good to go what should I say? Well, if you have nothing to say you do not watch the same story, I'm more interested in the public safety about the you know, citizen safety, so I emphasize. We need more planned, close policemen or uniforms. We have go to a subway platform. I do not want anything happen again. Okay! Now what we're talking about? You know the case, this young lady, getting raped publicly. We becoming the international disgrace and the joke. Okay. So that's what I want to emphasize. Thank you, Mr Chan! Thank you. So much. Thank you. Thank you. Yee chan, I, guess down here: David Chung, okay, David, you're, unmuted good evening. Everyone wishing everyone a warm and happy holidays. You Linda Corral Linda, you're, unmuted, hi, good evening. No comments at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Lorena Diaz, hello, everybody how's. Everyone, good I, actually want to bring up the what you spoke about before Christian about starting a veteran like outreach or program, or so. If we can discuss that. Maybe at some point that'd be great, of course, yeah. So to reference, those who do not know, and it's something that I do every year, I always have a sit down with our newest members. I welcome them to come. Give them like a shake them up a little bit, get them to see before Swag and what we're all about, and one thing that we discussed is some of our new members are actually veterans and something that you guys know that I was a big fan of, or rather a person. I was a huge friend and fan of was the late commander, Illyrio Argunia and Aliriordunya, who passed away suddenly a couple of years back was doing a lot for veterans his own time. He he also had the youth cadets down in Corona, and the truth is that Community Board Ford does not have any actual committee that handles veteran affairs. So I did discuss this with some of the new members who again some are in fact veterans, and it just happens that we're now in veterans today's fall. So it was discussed that we could either have a committee or a subcommittee or some kind, though so I do not resist it either. A committee or subcommittee to specifically handle veteran affairs, that's something we should certainly consider Lorena. Thank you so much and that's something we can discuss with the executive committee and there is you know we are under new championship and your administration come January of 21. So my guess is that nothing will happen until then, where new committees and everything is established, but rest for sure that it is considered and I. Thank you for that. Okay, thank you. Michelle Dunstan, can you hear me we can hear you everyone. Everything is going great and happy holidays to everyone and hope to see y' all tomorrow at the veterans, thing is I. Think it's a good thing that we continue that for our veterans. We appreciate them. Okay, thank you good evening. Everyone no comment at the moment. Happy holidays to everyone, happy Holidays, Adi! Thank you. Thank you too. Thank you, Kristin Gonzalez! No, I'm not sure. Yeah I spoke to her earlier says she was going to try but yeah I guess you're going to make it okay, Vincent Ocella, Vinnie, actually just texted. He actually had a small emergency and he won't be a pro attempt. So I'm assuming James Lisa is not. Here is Salvatore Lombardo on the phone by any chance. No okay, Carol Moshoosky yeah she's on the phone. Give me one second carol: you're unmuted, okay good evening: I do not have any of importance to really say: I do have a question, but it goes back to the capital and expense budget the and it has to do with the precinct. When I was reading the item for the precinct. Getting it renovated or a new facility altogether, it I thought about instead of going underground for a parking garage. What about overhead? But a lot depends upon the type of materials that are in the infrastructure and, of course, the age of the building, whether or not it would support an additional floor or two and I do not know. If that has ever been looked at well, I think Lucy would probably be the expert on that. I do not know you want to talk about that now or you want to wait, I mean I, think I think because it specifically hyperchanged the public hearing million I would personally wait, but that's entirely up to you. I mean we're flowing pretty fast and I. Do not think we've heard anything, but it's really good I think we'll move on we'll save it. For me, yeah Carol, we'll come back around to you and I'm sorry, but Carol. You said you had another item. Also. You said that also pertains to the capital expense. I'm sorry say it again. I'm sorry! You said that you had. There were two items. One of them was about. The precinct was the other item that you had to question, also having to do with the capital expense, no I. It was only one eye that I wanted to bring up about the precinct. Okay. Well, thank you. We'll certainly consider it. Thank you so much okay. So next up is Sun. Hill, mahat, hey guys, hi, hope everyone, okay good evening, first of all, happy veterans day right as a senior management, professional military, veteran myself. I've been a very engaged and active veteran here in New York City, not only in Elmhurst, not only in Corona, I'm talking entire New York City, I'm one of the veterans advocate right. What surprised me is I'm a fairly new member in CB4 I know that we have numerous numbers. Hundreds of veterans here in Queens and I have not seen a veterans Committee in within CB4. So what lorena mentioned earlier, which is good we have spoken to Christian earlier I, would definitely like to see a Veterans Committee or some sub subcommittee sometime soon within the CB4, if possible. With that being said, there is nothing else. I myself was a chief guest in couple of events in last year. Tomorrow, I know there are still going to be some events. If you are going to go, please maintain a distance where PPE be safe, but if you see a veteran thank him. Thank you for the service. That means a lot to him or her. That's it for him for right now. Thank you so now we'll afford it then Ceno. Thank you for your service yeah. Thank you, everyone! You thank you to all the veterans here. Thank you to all the veterans for your service, I'm so sorry that includes you, hey next Patricia Martin, pat you're unneeded you can go. Maybe she may have stepped away okay and Matthew Mcilroy there we go hi guys. I do not have anything to say, really happy veterans day, happy thanksgiving I do have ravinia on the phone who indicated earlier. She did have something to say so, convenient talk, and if you guys can't hear let us know. Okay, oh good afternoon, everybody I have a few things, but when I'm done I'd like to be take a excused and I've got to go to bed but anyway, this is the thing that I'm concerned about. One is the Underpass will jump in the hard part and West both ways: East West bound to everything, because the street is still clean and I know that we're in a bit of a pandemic but see if we can get something done about that, because eventually it will bring rolling into the neighborhood another thing about that is that there is a vendor that is so investable I think he doing I think the evidence is far between I do not know how to be able to get over this. I'm concerned about that. The other thing is that I guess I could say: I've been in this Mr Castro. This is about the post office. I, do not know whether or not we have a committee, but what we have a new postmonth he's: okay, Michael I think our biggest name is Michael. When he's off, you know pays off because whoever comes in to bring your mail, the mail is all over the floors and in the mail room, it's in the hallway and I guess we'll look at that. We trust them, but maybe so nobody's taken care of taking the mailbox, but I wish someone would be able to let the postmaster know it by the Post office and 99-38 by 16Th Avenue. The other thing is the overpass that is on the corner of Holly County and 99th street I got ta. Tell you I miss edna in the basket, because she would have the kids to come and clean that up. So maybe we have somebody to clean that up. The other thing is we the double talking on 5700 in the bike lane and outside the back lane, and the traffic is always backed up like that. I can see these things because I'm going to therapy. So there's nothing back to me, but it's not so much to affect me, but this has something to do with community, and the last thing is that the last thing was the report. I'd rather report and although I was really important to some other community supporters and I'm sure that we have a lot of problems and the city's trying to do something about that. So these are the issues that I'm concerned about, and some of my neighbors are also communicating back to the last thing is this after that. So what a couple of people spoken to me about this, the Bp gas station on harvest heart near Callaway and Otis and 99th street people said to me that they have a road problem. There and I said that I'm going to have a phone report and I think that's it and I need to go to bed. So I'm done! Thank you. Romania, I think Christian has got all those schools, okay, I, think Christian and Christina got those notes. Thank you. Next up, yes, I'm sorry hold on. Yes, I did get the notes Rovina. The only thing that I did I missed from you is. Can you just give me the vendor of that fruit vendor location? Again, please, if you can ravinia Christian is asking for the location of the fruit vendor. Would you repeat the location on junction at the corner of junction and horizon? Oh okay, thank you. Thank you and they're all they're, all! Actually, nothing! There is something we can't just handle with a couple of quick phone calls. So thank you. I do not know, but he has a very large fan there around that way. Right! Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay, so I do not think Edgar Moy is here, am I right, I think so no Sandra Munoz no Sandra's here, yeah hi, yes, I am hi. Everybody hi, so I do not really have much to say other than that. The issue of domestic violence. It seems to be really prevalent in the in the media in our in our community. Women are getting killed by their partners and I just ask that as an attorney who's actually working with a family justice center and safe horizon, there is a space you guys that look or family offense petitions for orders of protection. If someone does not want to report it to the police, they're afraid to do so, they can reach out to the family, justice Center or to the safe horizon. There's a 800 number. They can get online or family Justice Center in the county where they reside and they will connect them to an attorney and a counselor, and they can get an order protection as soon as the same day that they call. So that's I just wanted to share that, especially since what's been going on in the news and and basically that's it and just happy veterans day, my brother's a veteran. So that means a lot to me veterans day and happy thanksgiving to all. Thank you everybody. Thank you. So much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I'm not going anywhere, actually I said bye, but because I'm going to get signed off muted. Thank you. Just an fyi lulu just texted. He just called me he's actually I'm about signing in now, so we'll, hopefully have him pretty soon. Okay, perfect I, think he's here: Georgina Oliver, okay, Georgina, you're, muted, Georgina, okay, just flip the way, all right. Let's keep it okay, so Alexandra owens, I, believe she's. Here she was here. She said she would step out soon, but she is here, I believe we'll get you Alex hold on I'm here she's here there she goes cool, so I do not have much to say just happy veterans. Day! Thank you. Thank you. Alexa ponce hi everybody I do not have any comments right now. I just want to say good to see everybody. Thank you. Oscar Rios is next yes, he's here: you're unmuted, hi, guys how's it going hey, oscar, hey, I, guess another I could say happy thanksgiving. It's been a fast year. Last week we were all stressed out, I'm glad we got that out of the way. Hopefully we have a good deal and I will talk again. Hey thank you. Neil Roman, I, think he's here and next up is christian romero. Okay, Christian you're unmuted. Thank you, Christina! Thank you. Marilina hi, everybody! Nothing major to report from my end yep! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Christina. Thank you for hearing me. Yes, we can yes laura. How are you good evening? Fine I know I do not have anything to say and I just wish everyone happy healthy. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Next up, Lucy Chalero hi everyone, I'm I'll, answer Carol's question at the budget hearing later in the meeting. I just want to say now to everybody hope you can enjoy whatever the holidays can give to us during this time and I'll talk to you later. Thank you. Okay! Next, stop a red, sevilla. Everyone good to see everyone I just wanted to quickly use my time to celebrate a few folks just to express appreciation. Christian. Thank you for that work with the mural. It's always great to see public art something definitely needed in Elmhurst Corona. In my opinion, gregory man. Thanks for that, thanks for that update about Flushing Meadow park and the board, my goodness I mean fight the power bro. Please do not give up thanks for representing us. Well, I mean there's really I mean it sounds like a bunch of shady stuffs happening there very opaque, not very transparent. So thank you. Thank you for that. Also Wanna just appreciate the poll workers in Elmhurst Corona, you know of all the controversy I did not hear much about the long shifts that they put in so just want to celebrate those folks. I know that a number of you served as well also want to appreciate you and then just. Lastly, as you enjoy really good food, this thanksgiving, please do not forget the homeless in the community, especially the number of encampments that have risen in the neighborhood. That's all thank you, Brad that was wonderful. Okay, next up, Alton, Dart Smith, often you're, muted, okay, hello, everyone I just want to give a shout out to the veterans president and parents and wish everyone. Thank you. Walton Gregory, Spock I will save my parks. Gossip. Thank you, banking, on what said for my sparks report, but just two things again: sort of following up with what Red said, Christian and I are going to be doing a walkthrough tomorrow with breaking ground, to really actually understand the scenario with the homeless and begin to understand what these people need and actually start addressing it because it's been ignored by city officials. It's been chastised by people that do not understand what it means to be homeless, so it's a very multi-layered thing, so I want to start understanding that from a human level, the other thing I want to bring up. I did bring this up to the transportation committee two locations, one of which they recently had a you know: scope meeting on the redesign, but the Manuel de Dios triangle- that's you know, culminates sort of at the end of baxter Avenue there, the plan that I saw and maybe spread more on. This- does not really address the fact that the jaywalking that occurs basically across Baxter Avenue right where that new loading dock is and as someone who, as a young child, that whole intersection really needs to be completely. You know redesigned rather than just putting in two crosswalks, which is what I saw in their plans. The other one I brought up to them was 41st avenue right behind the hospital there I follow all of these. You know you can follow the transportation locations now, but I think there needs to be more urgency to this, because that's another problematic location in the sense that you have people speeding down 41st avenue. You have people crossing from the hospital which, as you know, people are either you know coming out in a wheelchair or with children or and there's no stop sign. I've almost been killed myself multiple times, so there really needs to be an immediately there and, lastly, the third location, which has been a pet project of mine, because it is right next to the park. There is right on judge and Whitney Avenue with the the increase in the park you know being utilized as it should be, and the school there and the play street we really need a safer, crosswalk and or stoplight or traffic calming measure more than just the speed bump that largely gets sort of ignored at a high speed. So thank you and Happy Veterans Day, oh alton! Can you just please quickly just in case yourself there we go we're good, that's it! Thank you! So much we're getting a little bit of feedback and I know where it's coming from just in case. Thank you, gregory. Okay, thank you, gregory, okay, so moving along Devon, Tariq I do not think he's here: Marcelo, testa, okay, marcelo, you're, unmuted, hello, everyone I just got done to say just want to wish everybody happy, Veterans, Day and happy thanksgiving thanks much hello! Thank you. Okay! Is that a vodka, not here, okay, Lewis Walker, he's on his way. Is he here yet or no? Not yet Rosa Wong? No, not here, okay and she did write a message. I do not know if she's able to go on the phone yeah. She said she was on the train, so she won't be able to talk okay, so she said Happy veterans, Day and happy thanksgiving. Well, thank you min wine. Okay, so we are done with that. All right, that's Lou! I'm going to step off for half a second excuse me: okay, no problem! Okay! So we're going to to go to our elected officials. Okay, so starting from the Senate, is anyone here for representing anybody from the Senate or no okay, so that next stop House of Representatives Grace Ming yeah. That would be christian romero, all right, Christian you're unmuted! Thank you christine again. Thank you. Marilyn again on behalf of the congresswoman happy early veterans day to everybody. I just wanted to go through some quick updates. So last month the House of Representatives passed the heroes 2.0 packet, it's a packet that included 2.2 trillion in support for american families and businesses. Some of the things that were included were a second round of stimulus check, restoring the pandemic unemployment benefits that was the 600 a week and increasing snap benefits by 15 relief for restaurants, etc. So that was great. Unfortunately, it is stuck in the Senate currently, so the Senate has not made any progress to pass heroes, 2.0 and that's been very unfortunate for millions of Americans who are looking for some events from the government from the federal government. The other point I wanted to touch on was something that a lot of folks in Corona Jackson heights and just honestly, all around Queens experienced last month, and that was that food pantries or community pantries, like La Jornada, were out of nowhere cut off from their funding. So just to fill everybody in about this. That happened because a critical U.S Department of agriculture program that had been providing food from farms to pantries during Covid-19 due to an unacceptable and unexplained program changes. They had vendors, that supplied food to Queens, were changed and just cut out and that left our community pantries without food to serve so Usda's. New requirements for sourcing boxes that mix dairy produce and meat also meant that kosher pantries could no longer use these programs. Representative Meng worked closely with the city to ensure that some of the gap in the supply was would continue going and I. Would I'm happy to announce that recently? What happened is that earlier this month, actually November 2nd the usda started a new round of their program, so they reversed the policies that cut off La Jornada because of the congresswoman's work. But there, but we are continuing to work with them and monitor them closely, to make sure that nothing like this happens again. So I just wanted to update everybody on that and again, if anybody hears anything or you see anything or there's an issue in the community, even if it's city or state or local, please feel free to reach out to me, reach out to our office, we're happy to work with anybody to get it sort of resolved and get the ball rolling to help our communities. That's it for me. Thank you. Thank you. Okay! Next up, Alexandria ocasio-cortez. Anyone from the office- yes, someone is here, give me one. Second: okay, Michelle hi everyone. This is Michelle Hernandez and I'm a field representative and caseworker for the Office of Congresswoman Caso Cortez. Thank you for having me tonight. The congresswoman is hosting her next virtual town hall this week on Thursday, which is November 12th at 6:30. P.M I will share the registration link in the Chat box and, if you're not able to join the event in person or at that time, you can also watch it on the YouTube chat page, which I will also share a link to and if you'd, like notifications for our upcoming events. Since we host town halls, monthly I will share links to sign up for our newsletter, which we have in English and in spanish for legislative updates. As Christian mentioned, we unfortunately do not have any updates on a new public stimulus package. There is renewed entrance by Senate Majority leader chuck Schumer to get a deal done before the end of the year, and so we're hopeful that the discussion will continue and last week, the congresswoman, the public banking bill, which would provide federal charters for public lending banks, as well as provide public banks, a pathway to membership at the Federal Reserve, which would allow public banks more access to capital and loans. And last thing that I'll note is that our office continues to assist folks with federal case work just feel free to reach out to our office, either via phone or via our website, and we will be able to assist you just as well as we've been able to in person, and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. I will again be sharing links to the noted events in the Chat box. Thank you all have a great night, happy veterans Day and have a great thanksgiving. Thank you. So much Michelle appreciate it any electeds here from the New York State, Assembly, okay, so ai, not no one here, no representative from Brian! Well, no, I'm not that I can see any representative from Michael Dunn Decker, no okay, Jeffrey on Aubry No and Catalina Cruz, yes, Alex yeah! So first of all, I want to say happy early diwali, which is going to be celebrated. This Saturday we've had a rough year, so diwali is a celebration of coming out of bringing light out of darkness. So hopefully this will be a renewal of the rough time that we've been having this past year, so food distribution speaking of breath times the distribution that we've been holding since March ended a couple weeks ago, as Christian and Michelle had mentioned, their funding across most boards of food banks has been severely cut, Wck was donation based and in the beginning of the pandemic they had received a large number of donations and then, as a pandemic kind of continued and those donations started to dwindle, so they had to wind down their operations in Queens. We are looking for other solutions to be able to continue since food and security in the neighborhood, as you guys know, is severely the severe problem. Over the past couple. Over the past month, we held three community cleanups in Jackson, Heights, Crown and Elmhurst community board. 4 was a partner, so we want to thank you guys for partnering and participating we're going to be holding a second series sometime in the next month. So keep your eyes out for that and then in the next couple of weeks, we'll be holding a number of we're preparing for some thanksgiving activities. Just keep an eye out on your social media for that and again we're taking constituent appointments by appointment. Only eight five, three 718-458-536 seven, if you guys have any issues that you need to work out concerning housing, unemployment etc. And lastly, we held a our second immigration: what's it called citizen, drive citizenship drive and we'll be finishing that up at the end of the week. Okay, thank you so much. Okay. So moving on now to New York State Senate are any electeds from there tonight. Oh okay, so any representative from Office of Michael Janaris, no okay, Jessica Ramos, no okay, tobian zavitsky, no okay! So moving along to the New York City Main office, Jessica Schabowski yeah give me one second: okay, Jessica you're unmuted! Thank you christine, hey folks. This is Jessica Schabowski Queensborough director for the mayor's office just want to highlight a couple announcements. One, the opt-in period for families to go from remote learning to blended learning is taking place now until November 15th families can go to schools.nyc.gov return to school, 2020 and I. Just like to note. This is the only opt-in period being offered at this time in order to provide greater stability and programming and for the school experience. Secondly, since the last community Board meeting, the mayor announced the open storefronts program permitting storefront businesses to use a portion of their sidewalk to display merchandise, sell goods, complete transactions and provide queuing areas. The program began October 30th and will run until December 31st we're encouraging all new yorkers to shop locally this holiday season and support our small businesses as part of our vision, zero initiative, the city's launched the fifth annual dusk and darkness campaign, reminding motorists how dangerous fall and winter evenings are for pedestrians and cyclists, especially after clocks fall back for the end of daylight savings time. There's also a similar education and enforcement effort taking place around the new state laws that require all motor vehicle passengers to wear seat belts and, lastly, just to highlight. We've had the cover 19 case numbers going up across the city more generally, so we again remind folks to please get a Covid-19 test if you have not in a long while or ever, and you can go to Nyc.Gov Covid-19 test for nearby testing sites. We also just encourage folks to continue wearing masks, practicing social distancing and especially this holiday season, to not travel outside of the state, if possible, wishing everybody a happy veterans day, happy diwali and a happy thanksgiving.

A lot of people came out, so we are thankful and grateful. So on November 2nd, we actually did a food box. Distribution outside office with the organization met Council, and we actually gave out 400 food boxes to committee members from what I'm hearing it's greatly needed.

The last event that we have upcoming is the final free driving movie as part of the Sunday Night Movie Series, a free screening, that's presented by the council member. It's actually one of my favorite movies, which is the nightmare before Christmas, which we'll be playing on Sunday from 6 to 9.

Thank you for your service. Thank you folks. Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Thank you. Joe you're welcome, okay. So next up is James Mongaluzo from New York City Controller Office, Scott, Stringer, hi everybody. This is James from the comptroller's office. I have a few announcements for you today. First, I'm going to mention our press release from earlier today. Hopefully, some of you heard a little bit about it. Our office is calling for the restart of lagging capital improvement projects, so we're looking at a lot of projects that have stopped due to the pandemic and we're looking at those that make the most sense to restart, because we feel like this will help the city's overall economy in this pandemic. So I'm going to put the I'll put the link into the chat, so you can check that out later, and the next thing I want to talk about is our economic newsletter. Our fiscal and economic newsletter that we've been doing since the early part of the pandemic, I'm going to put the link into the chat as well, and what you can do is click on it and you can read the newsletter of course, if you wish, but on the right side, there's a button labeled subscribe. If you click on that, you can punch your email in and you'll get a weekly update on the economic and fiscal conditions of our city. Every week we highlight a different topic: sometimes it's subway and bus ridership. Sometimes it's more about the actual infection rate and all sorts of economic and health indicators are in there. Lastly, I want to mention that our office is now beginning to conduct a survey. It's a survey on work and family, so we realize now that many people have children, I mean they've always had children, but many people have children and now they're being asked to go back to work, and there are some deadlines now around the DOE and whether when you and deadlines to Opt-out of in-person learning, so we know that there might be some difficulties for people who maybe do not know what their work situation is. Yet so we've started a survey and what we'd really like to do is get as many people as possible to complete the survey. So the survey can be as representative as possible, we're obviously not doing random samplings we're just giving the survey out and then people can fill it out. So I'm hoping that everyone on this call right now, whether you be a board member or not, I, really hope that you can complete the survey and then spread it to your network. Your friends, your family, if you are a leader of a civic group, if you are involved in the cec and the precinct council, whatever institutions that we have here in Elmhurst and in the this section of Corona, that the board represents and beyond, we really need people to fill this out like currently, the survey is I say the responses are tilted towards the wealthier parts of the city, especially the parts that are in Manhattan and the adjacent parts along the East river in Brooklyn. So we really need some more representation from communities away from the downtown and Midtown part of our city. So we're really hoping that people here can fill it out. I'm going to put the link out there and I'm hoping also that those of you in in power at different orgs can put this out on your social media mail it out in your newsletter, because we really want to get the best data possible to really understand what the challenges are for the working people in our city who have to balance work and family at a very uncertain time. So please fill that out when you get the chance all right, happy thanksgiving and Happy veterans day to everyone and I hope. You I hope to hear from some of you soon bye. Thank you, James, okay! So next up anyone here from the Office of New York, City, Public, Advocate, Jumani, Williams, no, okay! So that concludes the legislator. So Marilyn Lou is here with us. He is unmuted so lou. If you're here, I'm just letting you hear me: yes, Sir, okay, good evening, everyone, sorry I'm a little bit late and I won't be staying. Long. I have a lot of personal things to take care of this evening, but I do want to wish everybody happy thanksgiving, a happy diwali and our veterans. We salute you and on that note, I would just like to say I'm going to give you the result of the election. Of course, our chairperson will be Marilina. Gm Pino, the first vice chair will be Ashley reed. The second vice chair will be christian Romero, the secretary will be Duwan Tariq, the treasurer will be Lucy Schuler and the at-large directors will be Kristen. Gonzalez Gregory Spock, Alexa, Pont and Linda Corral I wish everybody well in the future, and I will be cheering the December meeting and that's it. Thank you very much have a good evening. Okay, thank you. Okay, so I guess, that's it from Lou tonight. He has some personal issues to take care of. So moving on we're going to be going now to the committee reports, First Committee, the Census Committee Christian's, not here you're, not here, okay, and to be honest with you, the Census Committee, I'm not I'm not necessarily sure that it's actually fully functioning post census, I think it was a temporary committee, but that's something we'll discuss offline. That is a good point. Okay, yeah thank you and consumer affairs. Okay, so we met last month to go through the needs statement and come up with everything that you saw in the report today. I want to thank the committee for sitting through and coming up with ideas and just kind of brainstorming, so that we could just really pop out the needs statement. We also held a workshop and social media marketing for small businesses and something that it kind of gave us an idea to try to include in the needs statement and try to get funding to continue stuff like that going forward. However, if we want to do something to a larger board, my friend is happy to do so, and one of the ideas that we also came up with. If we do not get funding, it could be a fun project to work on it's to conduct a business needs assessment for a number of different corridors within the Community board. Ezcovid has really devastated a lot of small businesses. We want to know how we could best support them and one of the best ways to do so through the business needs assessment and just kind of find out what people are struggling with, what their needs are and how we can make them successful in thriving business, and so that is it okay. Thank you, Alex environmental, yep, you're meter right. Thank you know. I just I know how much to report I'm trying to get a meeting together, hopefully, but next month I will have more to report. That's what I have. Thank you good night, hey! Thank you. Thank you help. Thank you. I just want to say thank you to my committee. We met a few weeks ago to go over our needs statement. So I want to thank everyone for showing up and submitting their input and congrats to all the chairs who worked on this. We were able to put this together so congrats to everybody and I'm looking to meet later on this month and just stay posted for details. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ashley Parks hi good evening. Everyone, so I will try to keep this to the Cliff Notes version, because there's a lot to sort of unpack that I'm still learning but echoing what Ashley said congrats to my committee and also comment congrats to the public that were involved, I met a lot of people after our last meeting, so I really just want to sort of say that I think the future of the strength of this board is through our public members and public ownership of the issues in our community. You know I still want to see commitment from board members on committees, but I also want to see my you know. Committee members out there recruiting and getting other people involved, because the strength in what we can do as it relates to parks and their vitalness to our community is really in the public, because those are the people that use the parks. You've seen that you know with things as large as Flushing meadows Corona park and on down to smaller parks like Cc Moore Park, which, on that subject I do want to let you know that the park is going to be open. That's the park. That's on broadway, you know right between 82nd 81st right around there. That park is going to be open on Thursday of this week. That information really was largely christian and I, pulling teeth, asking for updates constantly and then basically giving us that information. You know in a short email I do not feel that things have to be. You know complete fanfare, but I do think there still has to be transparency from the upper levels of the Parks City agency. You know in communicating to us because again, after all, the people that use the park are the people like the you and I and the public that are that. Are you know on this call as well? We some other updates regarding that there is going to be a community advisory board meeting for Flushing meadows Corona park. Let me just pull up the date here, so you have, it is Wednesday November at 7 pm it will be done via zoom, so I would encourage you, as I always do to come out to that meeting. You know I'm based on the last conversation and the letter that I wrote, I'm not going anywhere. You know you have me, as your advocate I am now just more fired up to fight harder to have transparency from the alliance, so nothing will change there. The only thing I want to say finally on that is the follow-up to sort of my letter. After you know, several people had received it from the alliance and others is that you know the alliance is really trying to distance themselves, I believe from the community level. They have basically voiced that they want to see the Community advisory board no longer be advisory. They want to see it more as a council as a community council and as we know, that's not okay, I mean the public are the people that use the park they're the people that should be telling the alliance how to fundraise and what to fundraise for and I feel really strongly about that. So join me on the 18th, so we can discuss that further and thank you so much. Thank you. Gregory transportation, yeah Linda hi, everyone hi. The transportation committee met last month on some proposed changes with DOT on baxter and 82Nd Street through Glean Street Christina. I'm not sure if I'm able to share a document yeah I'm going to make you a presenter right now. Thank you. So what I'm going to put in the chat is, you may have noticed a survey link that was sent out along with the agenda and within this link, we're asking you to review the documents that we also received from DOT regarding these proposed changes and also provide your feedback, we're hoping to then compile this feedback and share it with DOT. So our understanding is that these are proposed changes and that these are they're still in the study phase and they have not finalized these changes. Yet so let me go ahead and see if I can try to share this with you now. Okay, so I'll just walk through very quickly the changes that they're proposing. So in this area here you can see that they're adding crosswalk markings in this area here, which you know, seems sensible and I'm going to just scroll up and you'll, see this in the survey as well. These documents are attached there as images so that you can take a look at them at your leisure and in more detail. This is another area here that they're looking to extend this curb here and add these crosswalk markings here to allow for pedestrians to cross safely here and what I want to bring to your attention and which was I guess what we felt was the most concerning was the changes that they're proposing here and not just you know these elaine markings and you know the direction of the lanes of traffic, but the biggest change here is that traffic will no longer be, and this is a proposed change. Traffic will no longer be able to make a left turn from Roosevelt onto Glean Street going in this direction here, and so you know we with Christian and the office, they were able to send out mailings to the residents on Glean Street and we're hoping to receive additional feedback from those residents, as they will be the most impacted- and you know- hopefully you know we'll see some of that start to come in soon. So those are the three areas that I wanted to point out and again, if you would include that any feedback that you have in the survey that would be appreciated. The other thing I wanted to also follow up on with gregory's comments about the area around Elmhurst hospital on 41st, Avenue and I believe it was 78th street if I'm not mistaken, 78th, 79th and 80th on 41st Avenue, and so we did bring that up. We actually provided you know a small map of the area to D.O.T when we met with them last month, and we explained the concerns that many of you have raised and although they were not ready to have the discussion around those concerns on the day that we met, they did say that they would. You know, circle back with us and you know so. That's you know something on our pending list to review with them further, as well as updates that we still have not received around any permits that may have been approved or that are still pending for the casino buses around I, believe Moore, Park, and so those two things we are still waiting for responses on from got and I think that's all I have for now. Okay, thank you Linda. Just to let everyone know. Lindo Linda put the the link for the transportation committee survey. So if you guys want to check the chat and also gregory, if you can put the meeting date and time in the chat for everyone as well, and that's it so now we're going to be moving on to public safety hi. Everyone I have to admit that our committee did a great job on the budget for our public safety and I have to thank Christian as well. We met and let me go start with our meeting- that soon happened after the budget hearing. Cert teams were on Standby again for the second wave of the Corona virus. A bunch of team members got together to go to Brooklyn to give out PPE for the area. That's most went up in the uptick for the Kona Iris 19. The fire department is concerned about the extended what you call extended, restaurants, that are going on along Roosevelt, Avenue and throughout the area here. Many of them have plastic up and being that they're putting more up to get more people to come to their restaurants during the winter they're concerned about the electric heaters. Some of them are not designed to take it but they're afraid if people drink a little bit, they may hit into it and cause a fire so they're. Looking into that further for our area. Another thing is, you know you have to bring your clocks back this past weekend and there want you to check your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. We had an upswing of carbon monoxide deaths within the city, and so they ask you please to recheck your carbon monoxide devices. As for the police report, I'm going to read you two incidences that happened in our area. David Saponir wants me to get this across to you and being that the holidays are coming in I. Do not really I'm really worried about that? This may expand so on on a Saturday 10:30 1 20, approximately 8:30 P.M. They received a 911 call about fire shots and a male being robbed. The officers met the male who started to translate and they had to get a translator to help him I believe in Spanish he was robbed at gunpoint by two male hispanics who fled the location at black infinity g37. The male said that, upon exiting 7901, Queens boulevard, two males we described as heavy and five and hispanic were wearing black with a black mask and the thinner one which was six one, was black all around and began to go through his pockets where he took two thousand four hundred dollars from him. During the commission of the robbery, a silver and black fire arm was pronounced and fired one round in the air. The perpetrators then entered their vehicle and fled northbound on Barnwell Avenue. They did see a 38 caliber shell casing at the scene on Sunday November, 1 2020, approximately 1:30 A.M on the corner of 81St, Street and Broadway. A male was shot in the chest while he was in the back of a tlc black cab, unknown perpetrator. At this point they have they're still investigating the detail was followed. They were flagged down by the tlc cab driver, who said he was traveling northbound on Broadway, Avenue and 81St street, while approaching the red light at 81st and Broadway two unknown males riding an Ebay E-bike did rock road up to the driver's side of the vehicle where the rear passenger was and proceeded to fire six rounds into the vehicle. The passenger was shot in the chest, the left side of the chest and was taken to Elmhurst hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:51 a pm. So he wanted me to get that to you. Okay, the next thing we brought up was the if drugs and prostitution has risen. Since the time of the Covid-19, there has been a slight upswing on it around Corona, plaza at 108Th, Street and then 41st injunction. Both have are being looked into by the NCO officers and even the commander knows about it and they're looking into how they can combat it. At this time, non-compliance was a big thing with us. Noise, no mass social distancing is still a major problem with all the restaurants. They are going to do a swing where they're going to go talk to them about the noise, especially that they have to follow the social distancing they have been given summonses I. Think there's sea summonses at this point, they're going to get back to me about how many they gave out graffiti. We asked if most of the Griefy was gang-related. They said. Yes, most of them are and I asked about getting a 500 reward for those that could catch these graffitis either by film and such and there's a long legal process with it. They'll look into it, but they feel at this time. It will take some time to put that into effect. The illegal vendors that have been asked about through the community at 11Th, Street, 45Th Avenue to 56th avenue. Most of them do have licenses to be vendors, but for health reasons they do not have the department of health licenses updated, so they're going to do a thing on that. The next thing that was brought up was about the laws on seat belts. It's imperative that you wear your seat belts in the back of a tlc driver's cabs and such because you will get summons. If you do not I mentioned, which happened to me where one was not working, you could still get a light summons for that. So these are things that we have to look into, and hopefully we can complain to the tlc on that and that's about it. We had our liquor licenses. We every member that we called from all the restaurants on our list did come. We did bring up to them that were very angry about the non-compliances and that they should keep the noise down, make every effort to wear a mask and have their customers social distance, and they said they will so the we're going to be sending some strong letters out to all those restaurants that have been summonses for that. So hopefully they will keep that up and that's pretty much our report so again, that's it! Thank you. Okay, yeah you're, welcome alton for you. Larp results still here. Oh yes! Well for the Europe meeting, we met this basically two items. Main item is a BSA application, known as gas cell there's an application for renewal of the variants that was once given there back in 1947, since they did not expend it in time. The BSA is now requiring them to do a new application, and with that new application, the owners of the gas station is looking to change it. That's essentially what to bring it up. Today we decided to table it until next month's meeting, because the presenter had a lot of details and I did not think we'd be able to cover during this meeting. So we can look forward to seeing the details and I think Kristin will be able to in the chat put the put the links, so you can download the application to see what the application is about. Basically, it does look like it's an improvement because that gas station doing it for years and look like it's getting in for a very long time. So it looks like it's going to be an improvement, so that's something that they're going to take you until December marilyna brought us up to date. Regarding the preservations of the one house and African-american fairground, we look into the recommendations, but again we are thinking that will be something that we do in December. It would probably be probably provided us a little bit more time to do so, and that concludes the report. Okay, thank you often so alton. If it's okay with you, I can't put it in the link right now, but I feel like it may be more effective. Okay. So the last committee report, youth actually do not see her. No I got her there. You go okay, cool alexa, yes, hello, alexa, oh dude I was just speaking. Did anyone hear any of that? Well, we heard you say yeah so you're good. So far, oh okay! Well, then, hello! Congratulations to everyone from the election and just a quick youth announcement. We will be having our first youth services committee meeting November 17th, that's a Tuesday at 7 pm. I'm really excited to see everyone again on November 17th, and that is awesome. Thank you. Alexa you're welcome bye-bye. Okay. So now we're going to be going into the final comment period for the board members. So we're going to be concentrating on basically voting on the capital expense budget. So Christian should we do any comments, concerns or just strictly yeah. So, as we already know, the testimony that we received earlier board members is, it was I mean I'll, so I again, there was no particular format because we are in like code time. So there is this just bear with us as far as the rules over here. But the way we'll do it is I'll announce what that one change is. That's the only one so far and any board members just want to comment on that change or, at the very least, make what I want to call a minor edit I do not know if there are many changes or many edits to be done, because I feel that many of us have already been vocal about it, but just have a copy of your needs statement with you and if there's any one item that you want to question say you know. Why is this item there? Where did the support for this come from? What exactly does this mean now's your chance to do so? But what I'll do is again in the meantime, as mentioned, I'll share, my screen with you and I'll show you the one change that we have to add and that's something that can add as early as tonight or maybe tomorrow, and we should have it out by then. So, let's go in alphabetical order, melon as you did earlier, and if anybody wants to comment on that, one change that I have, or rather one thing that change has been requested by a member of the public or make any again minor edits on your own. Please do so yeah now's your chance, okay, so I'm going to go alphabetically and if someone was not here before, I'm not going to say their name, but if anything changes let me know yes, do you have any comments or you're? Okay with the budget? I'm okay, perfect! Thank you! Yi Chen! Not here, okay, David Chong, I approve I'm for it. Just a quick question: are we still voting on the street renaming or is that later so David? The way we're going to handle the street renaming I think is going to be very similar. As a matter of fact, maybe and again, I'm not sure in this meeting so I do not want to tell you guys how to run it Marilyna. Maybe you can do a twofer. You know a you can comment on the budget and b. You can comment on anything for the street naming and again we can do it that way, if you have any opposition or anything in favor of it. I do not know how you guys feel about that. You can do it in two separate rounds, but I think maybe at the same time that might work better yeah I think we should do it at the same time. I'm sorry I, misunderstood I thought we needed more information for the street naming, but we do not no I mean look again. That's entirely up to you guys. If it's your turn to speak, and you feel that you would prefer to have a biography first before we proceed, then by all means we can do that and we'll just bring up the December meeting. The truth is this: that street code names are only done at very specific times of the year. I do not know if it would make a difference if we vote on it during this month or the following month, but you guys have the option of saying to proceed as it is. I feel, like the majority of us know who Jim Galloway is, but while we do not have a biofilm, we do have enough information that shows what he has done within the sea before some time. I think George comes in a very short amount of time. He did a good job of getting those. So it's entirely up to you guys. You can say I do not feel comfortable right now. I want a bio, bring it back in December. We can do that or you can say it's okay. We trust you know what the community is has written so far and I think it really is entirely up to you guys, there's no actual form of it. Okay, no I think it makes sense to do as we call everyone's name to do a for the budget and then b for the street code, naming okay and while I have you over here. If you notice on my screen that I am sharing. This is this is the major change and it's asking the board to expand the needs statement to include the need for the city to develop a plan to ensure all students receive meal in the event of school closure. I do not know that it's necessarily a difficult thing to put onto the needs statement. There are a lot of categories we can choose to at least get close to that, but it's not a bad thing and if we can't I just want the permission or at the very least, I'm not even permission. I will just put it into the narrative over the youth over the low income section to add how we have a need for this all right. Okay, I do apologize. So then, are we voting on accepting this amendment or are, or is this amendment already accepted and we're voting on? The amendment has not been accepted and you are going. You are voting to make the amendment to add this item, which is students who receive meals for closure. Thank you, Christian. So a I vote in favor of adding this amendment to the motion, the main motion and secondly, I'm in favor of the street code, aiming thank you so much James David. Thank you. I'm just going to go back to Mr Chen Mr, Chendi I know you talked about the budget, but are you going? You have any comments about the streetcar naming we may only suggest I do not know. I'll see you're going to treat this, because the procedure is very simple: that any street code names come to the community board. Are there they're given to the community board? They then go to the City Council and the City council ultimately decides based on community support. This is the first step, it's not about what we can do. What our power is. It's a matter of. Do we think that or do we feel that Mr Galloway is worthy of a street name in his honor and then we'll handle we'll handle it from this point forward? So it's just a basic yes or no in favor or against the speaker. Yes, I said they can hear what I said that that's fine. Okay! Thank you, Mr Chen. Thank you. Okay, Linda Corral, I'm in support of adding the text to the needs statement and in terms of the Konimi I would just say it's not a matter of trust, but I would say a matter of formality to just have the bio shared with the entire board understood. Thank you. Thank you. Next stop. Lorena Diaz I am in favor of both. Thank you Christina. Are you keeping just really quickly on an admin level? Kristin? Are you keeping tabs on where we are with who's, saying yes and no yeah? Thank you so much appreciate Michelle Dunstan Okay Michelle. Did you hear me I'm in favor? Okay, thank you, you're thinking, myself, arya Espinol, I'm in favor of both okay. Thank you thank you Ari. This might be silly Christian. So for me, do I have to answer now for myself or I mean I, never said it before just go in order as if we were at the meeting. Yes, you know, would just read his own name and give his vote right there and then so, if you want to follow in his footsteps by all means go for it. Okay, so I'm really in a gym. You know I'm going to say yes for both I just want to. Maybe when we get the bio, so we could share it. You know with the rest of the board. Okay, you can do that. Okay, so savage my lombardo, no, not here, okay, Carol Machinski, I'm in favor of both thank you soon, hi, yes, my thumbs up for the amendment and as far as Mr Galloway I did not know much, but based on what I heard and see on the text. I have no objection, but it would be advisable wise to share his bio to the board. That's just a recommendation, but I have no objection. Thank you, Patricia Martin. She said that her Mic was not working pat. Can you comment in the chat? Okay? So hopefully we can hear from her Matthew Mcelroy, I'm in favor of the language and the needs statement. I, unfortunately, I do not I did not know. Mr Galloway I guess I would prefer to see the Bio, but I'm certainly do not object to the containing okay. Thank you, I'm Matt. Do you, romania, by any chance? Is she going to say anything? No. She was not feeling well and left the meeting. Oh okay, thank you. Sandra Muniz, Georgina, Oliver Georgina. You should be unmuted okay, so she might not be able to speak or something Alexandra. Owens Alex text me saying that she was some place where I was in the movie and she won't be able to speak. She probably does not know yeah just mirror just meter. Okay, that's because I think that sounds like something speaking so we'll move on alexa hi. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you so yes for the needs, statement and I would need I would prefer to have the bio okay. Thank you. You're awesome, Ashley, reed yeah, really quickly. If I may, just jump in and I feel like it's just because again it's not something we normally do guys. So just bear with me. Christina just did a review of the bylaws, and the truth is that really streetcar naming should go to committee first, so we may just have to disable everything every vote thus far. Let me go to the committee and let have the committee report on that. If that's all right so yeah, let's just let's just I, would I would just for sake of protecting ourselves and going proper procedure. Let's bring it to a committee. First, have the committee review it and then have the committee report it to the full board in December, so my apologies and those who voted in favor of it. You will have the bio, but it should be reviewed by its reflective committee first before it makes it forward all right. It's just it's just a procedural thing. We can likely get away with it because it happens a lot of times. There's fecal namings, just for sticking as close to the rules as we possibly can I'd. Rather we stick to it. So, let's no longer for the rest of the night, I'd rather progress. That's waiting, not vote on the Bio. Excuse me on the streetcar naming we'll get it to you guys and it will be presented just for sticking to the rules. Okay, sorry, for the confusion, guys all right so now we're just going to be commenting and approving the text, the amendment to the to the budget so Ashley. Yes, I'm in favor of adding the amendment to the statement. Okay, thank you. Oscar wheels. Give me one. Second I'll show you I'm muted, yes, I will say: I will approve. Okay, thank you! Mr Romero hi, I'm still here, yes, I vote on an approval of the amendment. Thank you, Clara salas. How are you unmuted it? Yes, thank you, hello, baby, okay, Lucy, oh Oscar rios. Can you put your phone on you? Thank you. Yes, please also add your comment about the the 110 presents. Yes, I'd like that. Yes, I'm in favor of the amendment as to the 110 precinct that was discussed years ago about putting it on top of the precinct it would. It requires winning change, but, more importantly, as of now being the structure has been under a lot of stress, it would literally have to gut it and go up the underground at this time seems more feasible, but we can still discuss it when money comes in and that's the best way to answer for now. Okay, thank you. Lucy you're, welcome! You read sevilla, yes yesterday! Thank you, Alton Dirksman! Yes, thank you! Alton Gregory Spa! Yes, I'm in favor! Thank you, Innovation Lou is not here anymore. Yes to the amendment. Okay, thank you and oh did. I miss my child test. Professor I'm sorry, oh I can't hear you yeah. Okay, thank you. Thank you.
