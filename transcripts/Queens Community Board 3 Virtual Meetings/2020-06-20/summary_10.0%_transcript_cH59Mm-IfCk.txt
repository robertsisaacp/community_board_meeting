People would mute everybody until it's time for us to talk background noise is that you Hamlet all right, hi Dorothy.
I only have the folder that has the business echo report, district manager or no, let me send everybody the folder again, all right, so I'm going to be email.
Okay, we're ready to do all right, all right, everybody so because, as you probably heard about five minutes ago or so when everyone was not on mute, there was a ton of feedback coming back from all of our respective environments.
I'm gonna, unmute everybody and let's just see how many of us know.

My name is Renetta English I'm, chair of Queens community, for a number like to welcome you to our since March 18 and I'm happy to see a lot of our board.
So as Kevin explained, if we hear that we are going to mute everyone and we're only going to have your speaking and after the presenter is finished, then if you have any questions when it's time to ask questions, then we'll unmute, everyone but we'll see I won't trouble that, but we prefer, if you have any questions, please type it in the chat box and I do not end.
The folder is only for board members all right thanks Martha, if you can do that too, if you can respond to folks in the chat box, Kevin and I are busy doing other things.
Secretary Panetta asked me to say a few words about the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the lgbtq+ community, now being protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it's great that it coincides with June, which most of you hold on I'm, getting a lot of feedback, so I I'm, gonna mute everyone.
So we all know that our borough is the most diverse in the whole world, the most languages, and there are a lot of community organizations that need help with translation, to be able to reach a broader audience here and there's also a lot of youth that are growing up bilingual here.
Everybody, let me know if you would like to partner I, would love to provide this for the youth in our community to do something good this summer.
Yes, how is everyone very good and if they'd like to see you can click on view who's talking everyone, so you can see our Queens District Attorney as she gives a presentation.
The families deserve to know who took their loved ones from them, but we also need to make sure that the conviction, Integrity Unit, is empowered and works very hard.
We immediately send an ad a down to the site so that we are a large apart, a huge part of the investigation on what happened at the site, and that is a bureau that has been developed over the last month, and we want to make sure that if you have issues there, you really contact us, because this is extremely important for my administration.
At the same time, though, we're working toward social programs to make sure the young people are places to go, that there is no market for guns so that we get cured violence, groups and drug rehabilitation, programs and workforce development programs as part of the DA's office, which it has not been in the past.
I saw the scene I wanted to make sure that I actually saw it for myself, and you know there's still tragedies that are going on.
Just let them ask their question: Dorothy Phelan Balin and will unmute her please Kevin Dorothy, yes, I wondered if the district attorney could elaborate on the new Bureau that will address housing and homeowner issues.
I wanted to make sure there and we're in the process now of doing it or forming a hotline so that if we can see a trend, that's going on in one community where someone is trying to buy out houses, and we can see that that's happening, and they do that in order to disrupt the fiber of a neighborhood, so that people sell easier so that we had a hotline to keep track of those cases to make sure that we can actually get to those who are trying to disturb the neighborhoods.
Thank you and da cat's-eye I just wanted to share a thought that many of the crimes that affect our quality of life, like people, steal stealing the rear view mirrors of cars breaking into cars breaking in through a window and stealing a computer.
The problem you have right now is that there's no help for anyone is going through these types of issues, so you can't put them in a workforce development program because they're stealing, you know the mirrors because they can't get a job and so we're working towards that.
But the new law is to take into account recidivists that continue to steal and we're just basically, you know traveling through the system like just going revolving system, and so we should have a little more power, but what's going to really change the game is when we get rid of the bill and put a lot of more of these supervised release programs in place, so someone gets arrested.
Okay, that's been distributed to us and maybe people are interested in seeing how they've changed all right.
Their goal is to find the traffickers of these guns and also to find the gang members, and we want to make sure that we get to the top right.
You know I believe that if we get the traffickers, where we don't limit the market, that we don't have these programs to make sure that people aren't making the market for the guns, it's only one prong and we're not gonna be able to solve the issue.
You know it could be a long time, but it could be a day right depending on with what the world that they're coming out of they're trying but I will say this, though the gang members who have turned their life around, we would love to work with them and in your capacity, if you ever come across we'd love to work with them to go into schools, to talk to young people to become part of mentorship programs.
They want to bring back information to bring back questions either on ongoing cases as much as we can comment, but also idea and issues in the community.
I'd also like to thank miss Melton from your office who participated earlier in the year in our human trafficking forum, and she was very informative.
Thank you like to welcome our Queens borough, president Sharon Lee. She has done a phenomenal job since January and she's been receptive to Queens community board number three and we appreciate the relationship that we built over the last few months, Green's row President Lee good evening.
Everyone thank you for the invitation to come by and say hello, I know, I don't come to the community boards.
We love to see you here and you'll be hearing from her shortly and her expertise, and she certainly has a tremendous amount of expertise and also vision for her organization and how it may serve all of New York State, but in particular in Queens, but as the DA mentioned census, if you haven't already I urge you of course, you're going to pay attention throughout the community board meeting.
We should be celebrating our victories, even though there's plenty of work to, but today's ruling certainly keeps young immigrants out of the shadows and that's certainly important in a borough like Queens, we are the most diverse County in the continental US in a particular bar three one of the most diverse boards community districts.
Community board 3 not with them, is certainly one of them, so Thank You, chair English, for indulging and for the invitation to come address the board I'm happy to take questions, but you probably just want me out of the way, because your next speaker is dynamic way.
I would like ask President Lee of question that I'm afraid of a big homeless problem coming and I'm just wondering what help is available safe for people.
Will we start seeing a lot of homeless people and you know for the benefit of the community they're best left in place.
I know it all just seems like it's around the corner, but there are a lot of discussions on how to whether it's a matter of extending, but also, if you think about it, there's a there's, a ripple effect of extending the moratorium as well on landlords, and things like that.
dana colin than the and the now president of the New York association of black psychologists and I just want to start by saying that I feel really honored and currently be doing with you tonight community dialogue, one of my favorite, the user-agent, because we can really learn a lot from each other.
I want to focus my comments tonight on the idea of coming together for healing, because there is a lot to you right now.
Excuse me, I, think my connection is okay, so when I am when a community is facing a massive trauma such as you know, the effects of Koba, 19 or racial violence there's often a shared emotional bond amongst people in the community and that's a powerful thing if you heard that collective trauma hurts, but on the other hand, that shared experience of shared thoughts and feelings mean that I mean they mean that nobody is alone.
Any crisis that is really important during crises like the one where the several crises were experiencing now feelings of stress hopelessness, confusion can sometimes turn people against each other, but on the other hand, a crisis also provides an opportunity for coming together and that's really what I want to encourage everyone to do come together.
Well, we're in a great place to do it now, with this community board talking about what our strengths are and what our challenges are just having the dialogues are so important and these kinds of conversations can help us to discover our shared values, because, even though we might come from different places have different customs, we can find that we have some shared values and shared goals, things that we all want, and it's really important to get on the same page about that.
We need to identify what resources and strengths we have and, along with that, reflect on areas that might need strengthening and talk about how we can strengthen the things like that, need that it's also important to discuss responsibility, and that means identifying community leaders, agencies and organizations and learning what their role is, what they are doing, what they're supposed to be doing and talking about how to hold people accountable, but the things that they have been called to do so, there's a lot that can be gained from building community and joining together in solidarity.
Talk with each other start with the dialogue, see what you have in common see what your strengths are continue to attend this and other community meetings encourage others to come.
Collins berry for taking the time out to speak with us, and yes, it's very important that we all do come together and that's the one thing that I love about Queens community board number three.
Well, you know, let me check all right.
At the Department of Social Services and just recently with and limit that we've been dealing with the blossom, ministration asked me to come on as a chief equity officer to be part of the test and trace corpse that New York City has put together to deal with the Cova ninety pandemic that we have faced for the last few months, and so in this role.
In this capacity, I am working with a dynamic team of individuals focused on that we can get New, York City back a safe and healthy place, and so we know that we've heard a lot about what's going on with this pandemic, and we wanted to make sure that, as far as the test and trace corpse that one of the key components of our program is to make sure that folks are interested.
Our mission is, like I, said, to exam to be village in testing tool to make sure that we're tracing and they were supporting communities by offering places where they can safely separate, should they need to from their families and we're doing that by offering hotels at the interface want of reopening your city, we need the help of our community members.
Individuals like yourself to help spread the word about the critical part of the program that we're doing, and that is testing right.
We want to make sure again that we are reaching everything that we can specially in those communities that were mostly affected by this by this pandemic and we're doing that by offering the free testing by making sure than anyone with the virus receives care, and anyone who chooses who need to isolate can do so safely to prevent to prevent the spread, and so we were doing that by I mean you know we put together a group of workers who we refer to as contact tracers, who will be proactively reaching out to individuals, acts encourage them to be attested and then I'm continuing to make sure that we do follow through in case, we need to trace anyone.
I'm, sorry, I'm, sorry, Jessica, I'm, sorry, miss English I would be remiss if I didn't mention this important piece of information about our program and is we understand, especially you know, underserved communities and communities that have been hit the hardest that we deal with.
Annabelle thanks MA, so I want to start by wishing everybody a happy Pride Month.
It's going to create a new and streamlined application process to allow restaurants to expand capacity outdoors, so restaurants at any bars cafes that serve food, will have five options to mix and match between curb Lane seating, that's being piloted through Labor Day sidewalk seating, which is going through the end of October backyard and patio seating, which will be ongoing, open street seating, which will go nights and weekends beginning in July, and then bid that manage pedestrian plazas will work with d-o-t to help restaurant set up seating.

These are the plainclothes officers in an orientation toward neighborhood policing and making sure that we build that neighborhood and community relationship with our officers and, lastly, an increased time limit with our disciplinary system, where incidents with substantial bodily injury will result in the police, commissioner, making a determination within 48 hours of the incident, whether the officer on modified duty or suspension and NYPD will conclude those investigations within two weeks, more transparent discipline, we're all trial decisions or settlements going forward will be posted online and body camera footage policy we're all video and audio footage must be released within 30 days when an officer discharges, a firearm that hits or could hit someone an officer discharges a Taser in a way that could result in death or substantial bodily harm, or an officer's use of force, results in death or great bodily harm.
Can you just quickly just clarify what you're talking about so what I'm saying that during the shutdown I saw some cop told I, don't know how you're gonna deal with it and the other question was I thought ruling New, York, City disparity crime branch there with a crime branch being dismantled, officers can use an ounce to that I.
We can't hear you, okay, we'll come back to you, but we can't hear you right now because, even though your mic is on, we cannot hear you.
We will we also deploy those mobile units accordingly, to make sure that we are hitting every community all right and besides the true P that Jessica just said were stood up.

The other previous months of from April to May was very high, but we made some good arrests and that's come back down and now that businesses are starting to open back up, you know it's looking better with that was our main problem doing Colvin.
Come in to our precinct, where there's lots of public urination public drinking public defecation, like the mess on the streets on the side of our precinct, is very great, so I'd love to ask for your officers to do a little bit more patrolling on our blocks and for them to not just cut it all off.
No problem all right, so the only other thing I'd like today, Kovac related, is on.
