Okay, if you need, if you're a caller hmm, you know what let me bring in Renetta Giovanna, there's really no way for the people that are on that are calling in for them to communicate with me that they need to say something.
and we wanted to make sure please community ward, number three minutes or March We will have committee meetings at home, so I want everyone, cabinets, gonna, open up the lines but, as you know, there's about how many people on the line here right now, thirty of us.
Massey had a great vision of creating a global health department, recognizing that some of the concerns healthcare in the future are not bound by border but are actually a global condition, and so we wanted to make sure that we were keeping our eye on the ball and being able to be prepared for a situation, unfortunately, that we find ourselves in today, where pathogens and disease and illness and trans send the entire globe and how we can work together to get partners and how we can be able to orally go ahead.
It gives them welcome him to our conversation and to be able to discuss the issues, but also I would have this opportunity before he presents to answer any questions that the board may have Elmer's hospitals here, we're ready to serve reusing and working with our staff to be here at this time of importance for our whole community and we're making sure that we have all the resources available to treat and serve the greater Queens community.
They had over 700 million people under some kind of restriction for about a month, particularly in the area right around Wuhan, and they brought their outbreak, at least in reported cases under dramatic control.
They had very early availability of rapid testing for this and they quarantine people on site within hours of identifying them and Singapore has had a very successful approach to their outbreak, and it is nearly under control This week, though, cases in Seoul for the first time exceeded the cases in those regions, and that is a nominal sign.
In a little while home isolation should be concerned, I should be considered, for people were thought to have this infection, even if it isn't proven, and that will minimize the exposure of health care workers.
We don't want to keep repeatedly exposing health care workers by having people who are minimally symptomatic come to the hospital for treatment.
In case, we are have early signs of the infection, but we have to be careful that we don't use up all the surgical masks by people using them in the community who don't really need them if you've returned recently within 14 days from a country where there is a lot of this infection, and that's the type of advice that they need just to cover their cloth and remain as far away from people as they can over the next 14 days in the hospital every patient who's under investigation.
These have to be fit tested, and we do this as an exercise every year for all the healthcare workers who take care of patients in our Hospital, the mask fits tightly and it is to protect the wearer from infection.
Guess one of my first questions It would have been just a handful currently in the hospital because of the problem in getting test results which is on the verge of being solved, but since they can take several days, we have both confirmed cases and people under investigation, the confirmed cases we have about 25 or 30 in the hospital right now.
That will make things much more simple for us and, as this outbreak converts into a very large-scale outbreak nationally, we will see much more of attention much more attention over toward treatment of hospitalized patients, because there will be so many and away from community testing which has taken up a lot of our resources so far, so Coronavirus is listed on the Lysol sanitizer right; we just say while you're asking your second question.
You all have a lot more health care and kind of the medical and science related questions, so I just want to pop in and let you all know just give you a quick update.
and so I think it's really important that we reiterate that it's not a time to panic and in fact again it can make it worse, because if you are sniffling or have a cough and run to the hospital at very mild symptoms, we're gonna make the situation worse for everybody, because we need to free up the hospitals for the doctors and nurses and health care providers so that they can treat people that are in critical condition.
So right now you know federally and legislatively we've introduced bills on things like postal banking and expanding essential services for the post office, but in the meantime there are things we can do a meaty immediately in our community and I think bringing in your local postal worker as part of your mutual aid network.
and you want to make sure that people in your community are taken care of talk to your postal worker and just ask them say: hey is there anyone that you know of that?
and this is kind of what I was also I- alluded to this earlier in that I'm, trying to make sure that all of our federal policy also includes gig workers hourly contract workers, because this is where they put in all of these loopholes where they say: oh, we'll, expand unemployment, insurance or right now, for example, the state has paid leave for all workers, but it requires you to be an employer and, more and more recently, a lot of these big companies, whether it's uber or whether it's you know shipped or GrubHub. has to do with universal basic income, so we're trying to get cash assistance to everybody, no matter what you do, who you work for or what your status is.
You know: we've had the World Health Organization offer testing protocols, and so what happened was that the Trump administration did not take up those offers early enough So, as a consequence nationally, we have not had enough tests and that now that's resulted in what you're, seeing in that kind of wealthy and powerful people seem to be able to access a test like if you're, a sports star.
We are really working hard to ramp up the testing in the state and we are testing more and more people every day, and so the good news is that the numbers are starting to really tick up on the tests right now in the state of New York and we're working with our neighbors with new jury, Pennsylvania Connecticut and making sure that everyone around us is getting their testing up soon.
I think it's very important that if you have no symptoms of this coming to be tested to any site like that is going to potentially put you on a long line where you would be exposed to the public and if you were testing negative, keep in mind.
That does not mean that you will be negative next week, I think as we roll out testing, it really should be concentrated on people who have at least mild symptoms or a known contact with a case and I.
and you get cured, would you get immune and my second part of the question was more food slick likely for the congresswoman, but you've been talking about it, but every gathering has been canceled like in stadiums any place that gathered a lot of people is, being you know, top being close, but they don't say nothing about churches They Pentecostal Church, there's a lot of Pentecostal church, all over New York City, where they gather 40, 50 people and I'm sure, they're, gonna get together and concern me because the more people get sick, the more chances you got to become sick by then to by getting you know close to them, which I tried to stay away, but is heart, you're, absolutely right, I think right now the state is recommending that groups any bigger than 10 or 15 people are dangerous.
As more and more people are identified as having the infection, that's going to become a more and more difficult process, but that's why we have a Public, Health, Department I think we have to be careful not to assume hospitals can do more than they're going to be doing anyway, just taking care of their very sick.
But I do think that what we're going to find in the next couple of weeks is that the as the number of very sick people, rapidly Rises and hospitals are increasingly busy taking care of them that the entire issue of testing will have to be on the back burner somewhat.
Doctors I do well Renetta, wanted me to open the floor to some of the callers, the people that were calling in My question to him is: has this hospital put into any supply from the Army Corps of Engineers such as these ventilators and mask the things that they need?
We, you know we're working on several strategies to provide testing so that people wouldn't have to come through the emergency department course.
We don't want to overload the testing capacity, it's been delicate to begin with, it'll expand eventually, but, as I said a little while ago, I think a couple of weeks from now we're going to be soaked and absolutely consumed with taking care of people who actually are sick.
The state the city health department has, should you actually be tested and I would refer you to those websites and I've listed a couple of them at the end of my lecture, Thank You Reverend Peter heron get in that the employee population Savion the guarantee cause of have you seen any patients arm or what is done for the homeless shelters or for those people who are home on the streets.
We will be sending out information from the public advocate's office on our social medias, so that people can know when they can call in and which number to call for different religions.
well, we didn't know this for sure, but there are 240 bars within our community board and obviously many of them are on Roosevelt Avenue If they say that a restaurant he makes sure that there's a chef on duty when they say they closed and, as you know, not vote on any bar restaurant that is open until 4:00 a.m. in the morning that that's not a restaurant The Committee recommends approval of the application.
We hold on one second I'm gonna mute everyone, okay, Renetta your life, yes, I know: I, said this chair, that youth services planning committee and a number of our young people that are expecting to walk for graduation.
