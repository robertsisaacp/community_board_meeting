and I know you have a big agenda, but I wanted to come on and just talk to you for a minute or two about some of the things we're seeing in this new world.
and I think that's what's bringing the whole city together, but I want you to know that part of the work that our office is doing is to bring about a real discussion about why some communities, mostly communities of color, are being hit extra hard by the virus as opposed to other communities, and it really goes to the health disparities that have existed for many years and we're seeing that everywhere we go when my mom was in the hospital in the Bronx, because she's a Bronx woman from back in the day.
You know we're not just seeing 80 year olds in the hospital, but in the Bronx were seeing people who were 50 and 60 and they have type 2 diabetes and there's pre-existing conditions, and it starts at an early age with you know: pollution plants and obesity issues and overcrowding in our communities Send the committee board a number of reports.
Unlike other offices, we don't give out money to watch the money, but that doesn't mean that we can't work with community-based organizations and partner with Jessica Ramos and Catalina Cruz congresswoman, Picasso, Cortez and James is representing me tonight at the board and if we can get your information, I can try to help.
ma'am any, have you all started some kind of like secondary location for testing here and the community board 3 area?
As my understanding and that's the end, gonna be key to bringing people back into the community back into the job market, first and foremost for the doctor, but there are two key tests that could really help shape and you know I'm getting up to speed in that disruptive economic perspective, but also what we have to do mentally people who may have the antibody that may not get it again for some time.
It's important to have that information, so people could certainly go back without fear of infection again Are there going to be practice in New York, because I heard we have lost from our community 150 people and most of them are asking me one that those who have little symptom without a big s, er hassle, that can make public test possible?
Community has to know about who to contact what help is available to people, whether you're, immigrants or others battle the coronavirus, though James will make sure the committee board members get this and the elected officials what is what do you see as a financial impact right now, since we're a lot of the businesses are closed up and down our major thoroughfares?
, I've always believed mmunity is the local community boards you represent over 100,000 people and I know how important it is to get information to all of you.
I have the city's first chief diversity officer years ago , she's now working to get all diverse businesses to the table and by foot we have a family get this in 12 languages, so I am dead serious to get small businesses, especially equipment Minari own businesses, the help they need because they don't have the Economic Security, meaning they don't got a big bank now they've been struggling before Corona and we want to make sure that your rapids, not the business, never get federal and local program.
You can't cancel contract or fail to register contract in the middle of a spend, because you got to reimburse the money that they're not for- The job is to he's not for profits running it all cost doctor shut them down because they're, the ones that are least likely to be able to open when we think about what we're going through- and let me just say, I like to look at New, York City with the glass half full, but we're gonna have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we slowly turn on the economic spigot.
So I'm going to talk a lot more about this in the city, but I do think that the economy for people we care about really starts with our not-for-profits all right.
This is very serious, because depression can negatively impact your job performance as well as obviously your quality of life, and then we also saw that a 30 percent we're reporting symptoms of insomnia, meaning their sleep was disrupted How important sleep is to really maintaining your mental health, especially in this time.
It's one of those basic building blocks of mental health that is so important and then 71 percent reported distress from the situation, so maybe not specifically to pressure insomnia, but they were just stressed, maybe experiencing anxiety or anger, or frustration about how everything was going with the coronavirus.
So one thing that we've seen is that we some hotlines, such as the National Alliance on Mental Health hotline, has had an all-time high number of calls in March, and that is of the whole time it's been running, so definitely more people are reaching out to mental health services than would in the past, and the director of community engagement on Brown said that of the callers who talked about the coronavirus.
We don't know if we can get tested if we need to Besides, going to the people who are in power and saying we want to be able to be tested, I know that one good thing that's happening at new york-presbyterian is that they are working on making their own tests to really try to up the capacity of tests that they have, instead of waiting to get them from somewhere else.
Definitely an impact that we're seeing on health providers we've set up at New, York emergency and a psychologist psychiatrist to every department in the hospital, so that doctors and nurses and support staff and transport workers and everyone who works at the hospital and pretty much anytime or within a few hours.
If it would be helpful to you and still and others that we can definitely add on the community board side, we're getting a lot of information from some of our representatives and we can share what we know in regards to testing and where people can go and so on and so forth.
You know why don't we are in good shape to donate and we would love to, but they won't let us because they won't test us I have a lot of rich friends who live on Manhattan on the Upper East Side and their doctors have two tests and they're paying five hundred dollars in their getting tested thanks all right.
Yes, I am we have food, the restaurant on Wickham, and so a lot of people want to get some They ask for celebration, and the first thing they ask is some greens some contain the most popular content like margarita mojito for us is Anglia.
We've already been approved once and now we're going through the whole process again, and we had to present seven times before our first approval I was a chef at the Canadian ambassador, the American community ambassador Danish, ambassador dance clubs down on New Zealand Vassar, soda Republican Ireland Speaking on behalf of my father, Juan Romero of cafe, Rubio, we are a family-owned restaurant specializing in Latin food we've been operating for 19 years and proud to say that we have established a restaurant in this community to everyone in our community and especially for people outside of our community, and we hope to continue our services and duty for our community Member, do you have any questions or community the lines are open.
So a yes vote is a yes AM Brown, so I like to welcome everyone again to our Queens community board number three and my boo from the chairs.
I want to let you know that the community board office is still operating.
Yes, the medical exam, the coroner's office, one of the things that I'm noticing in the community and other people have called me they're taking up the two days to come, get dead bodies.
The body leaves if somebody comes and replaces them if they go for lunch or whatever, and it was two and a half actual days and the family would want to be in the house with the body I also know that there were some articles that mentioned that a lot of people who live in our area actually work, probably in Manhattan, but in certain services, where they would have come into contact with a lot of people.
I mean certainly, there's got to be a lot of different reasons that are playing into this, but I, don't like many people do work in Manhattan, so just using mass transit.
I, remember: I just saw the woman when I went to go, vote and you know they didn't- have three conditions and they were all under 40 and that's another thing that they were saying that it's only Boulder this at all ages, even maybe even young people, so It was March 19, sorry that the bang of the society is the largest Bangladesh organization like 28,000 member here, and all society passed away by the coroner and I started the second of the Bangladesh right now, because I was the senior basis then and I we have many people died here and Okay now I know the letter to our local councilman of his Daniel's office, John Doe, fish and marrow fish and borough president of fish about the temporary hospital in Queens, because the Queens is overloaded the capacity and then let me know that tannic center will be the temporary hospital ice.
Yesterday on Facebook live our district joins together for a community check-in with key stakeholders to discuss koba 19, ongoing impact with concerns ranging from on the coil more about testing sites from closure, health care, small businesses and other koba 19 related issues that are happening here to New York.
First, if you have any specific questions about a situation, you may have, if you're not sure if you'll be eligible or you're a little concerned about where you are in the process, One thing something I saw I was hearing some echoing, but my personal work number is nine one, seven, eight three one, seven, six, five, eight He specifically asked about people making over a hundred thousand dollars and if they're qualified, to receive a stimulus check $0 fausto, no money!
Honestly, it's the most comprehensive thing, I've seen so far for New York City residents in terms of lumping together a bunch of a bunch of information about how people can be helped, whether it be tenants, property owners.
