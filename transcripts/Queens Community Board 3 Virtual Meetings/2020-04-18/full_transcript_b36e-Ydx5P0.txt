Don't think we need to really start recording until we take no time. This conference will now be recorded this conference. Well. This conference will now be recorded. Okay, very good, hello, everyone. My name is Renata English I'm, chair of Queens community board number three I'd like to welcome board members that are here today and I'd like to also welcome those from the community. Welcome to our second, our second teleconference meeting, and for the month of April hello. How are you doing I see I, see one of our speakers she's here all right. So what we're gonna do is we're going to begin with our roll call, and let me just see I just want to make sure it's see if miss Ruiz on it. So to begin with the roll call Kevin hold on Renata one second, okay, so I'm Kevin, oozma, boa I'm, the board secretary I just did a master mute all right, so that everybody's line is now muted from our end. But if you could all do the individual mute on your end, that way, when I do a master after like what just like what just happened, somebody unmuted their line and there was a lot of feedback it could enter. The speaker could interrupt the voting. So what we're gonna do is if everyone can mute their lines on their end and I'm, going to mute everyone on this end, when I unmute, only those that are going to be raising a question or saying you know here or voting or whatnot, will unmute on their end to vote or raise their question or say I'm here and then mute themselves, so that we can reduce the amount of feedback all right. In addition, if you are da, if you are here on the web, you have a chat box on the right side of your screen. Okay, that is where we will be asking people to pose their questions and I will be relaying all the questions from the chat box to the speakers, just in the essence of time and unmuting and muting. It lessens the amount of time. We will then, following that we will have a session where we will open the floor to the callers. So if you are a caller- and you don't have the option to do the chat box, we will unmute the lines. Hopefully, everyone else will still be on mute on their end. But if you have a question that you'd like to ask, you can use that opportunity to unmute and ask your question if somebody is already in the midst of asking their question, please wait until that person is done, asking their question and then unmute your line and ask your question: okay, all right! So I'm gonna, unmute everybody! So hopefully by now, everyone has gone and muted themselves on their end and I'm gonna do the roll call, and so when it comes to your turn, unmute yourself, so that you can say here and then go. Please go back onto mute, sound, good! Okay, all right here it goes unmute all okay! Now I am going to start with. The roll call amber. Ah miss Reed is on the line too.

Let's see yesterday, naina, yes happy to as well miss English I am Maggie Flanigan I'm, a resident Ida everybody I was really thrilled to see. Recently our police, sanitation and homeless services come together and one of the problems farts spots in our distress, which is particularly rough at this time, so I thought that might be news. Folks would be happy to hear. Thank you, nice that you were able to dial in Iran and China scary, hello, Janice. How are you doing I bet? How are you we are? So he was he and he was all of us and every day he was the same way so helpful, so kind he extended self to the fullest extent, as our other officers are other auxilary officers, the police officers are doing and he volunteered his time. Yes, it was very hurtful I'm, really yeah. What I heard about tears. Just came to my eyes: I mean cuz. I knew him well, you know, and it's hurtful because you know when people volunteer their services, nothing to say to me: what does it get Peter? Not you know so concerned about the community and helping the community. This is. The main thing is like in this pandemic is: where is it they still go out there and serve the community and put their lives in jeopardy? Yeah. Well, nice, seeing you Janice curry for speaking to you, I, don't know so James! Yes, okay, there you go there, you go welcome controller! Thank you very much and I know you have a big agenda, but I wanted to come on and just talk to you for a minute or two about some of the things we're seeing in this new world. We're living in and I know that this community has been hit very hard by kovat and I know that the struggle for our small businesses for people who are burying their parents and their grandparents. This has been something that nobody could have anticipated, but I know we're all in this. Together. Two weeks ago, I lost my own mother, there's terrible virus and there's very little closure, because you can't have a funeral, you can't mourn in the traditional way and I think that's what's bringing the whole city together, but I want you to know that part of the work that our office is doing is to bring about a real discussion about why some communities, mostly communities of color, are being hit extra hard by the virus as opposed to other communities, and it really goes to the health disparities that have existed for many years and we're seeing that everywhere we go when my mom was in the hospital in the Bronx, because she's a Bronx woman from back in the day. You know the doctors said to me. You know we're not just seeing 80 year olds in the hospital, but in the Bronx were seeing people who were 50 and 60 and they have type 2 diabetes and there's pre-existing conditions, and it starts at an early age with you know: pollution plants and obesity issues and overcrowding in our communities and I'm gonna. Send the committee board a number of reports. We've already done. One is on frontline workers, the other is on committees of colour that have been impacted, so I'm going to try to use this office to think about ways to finally end this inequality. At the same time, we fight the virus all right, and would you like? Would you like questions or would you if anyone would like to ask a question? - I know you have a busy agenda, but I know you have the time because we gave you if you would like to speak about anything else, but if you would like to feel some questions, that'll be good. You have to do the conversation can go that way, so I'm gonna everyone. How do you want to do this cab? Nobody expressed any questions in the chat box, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna. Ask everyone to please make sure your line is on mute and I'm gonna undo the master unmute on my end. Okay, so make sure your line is on mute and if you have a question, please feel free to unmute and ask the question, but please be respectful. If somebody else is asking a question to not interrupt their question. Okay, it's going to be one question for a person: okay, yes, 8 hello! It's me number one. If I have a turn to us, yes go ahead, baburaj. My question to Hamid, as for the I, am from the Nepalese community here in Jackson Heights, and we have a lot of folks, they are infected with a Cove is 19 and they are being lack of. Ppe is tough and predominantly the thermometers and the tylenol they are totally out of it. Do you think is office can provide anything to the community as a donation. Well, you know part of my office. Unlike other offices, we don't give out money to watch the money, but that doesn't mean that we can't work with community-based organizations and partner with Jessica Ramos and Catalina Cruz congresswoman, Picasso, Cortez and James is representing me tonight at the board and if we can get your information, I can try to help. The other thing I think people should know is, in addition to medical issues. We also are doing a lot for small business. We've now established a webinar, a webinar for small businesses, translated in twelve different languages and I'll make sure you have that at your disposal because we started it. Today we had over 300 small business owners on the call gotta get you information, so we can. We start onna me with that great. Thank you. There's a little burn. Nimmons I have a question. Yes, ma'am any, have you all started some kind of like secondary location for testing here and the community board 3 area? So what I mentioned earlier that the only place now that we have to go for testing is the hospital Elmhurst Hospital, and that is a little crazy. So has it! You know if there's been anything any other opportunities for people in committee board three but four to get testing. Look I. Think the testing procedure in the city and in the state is haphazard. I, don't know specifically the location, so I have James check on that, but we I do think that the mayor's called for 50,000 tests is ridiculously low. We're going to ramp up the economy I believe we need 500,000 tests at minimum in the city and massive increases in areas where people can go. You know not to go by car and bus, but you should have a testing site eventually down the block. This is going to be one of the key ways we jumpstart them like back to normal. We find a vaccine or an antiviral medication. So you'll get more from me at the coming days. I've been talking to scientists and experts of the field and the notion that we can't test on a large scale, really gonna come back to haunt death when you think about what they're doing in Germany and other nations, and we just continue to slog in place just a failure of the entire government. I am question tonight: can I just it's Stuart water here can I just make a comment on that last. That last point I'm, pretty sure that I already had it and just wonder what are the options for those of us that think they have it for antibody testing. Well, that is, that is about to come online. As my understanding and that's the end, gonna be key to bringing people back into the community back into the job market, first and foremost for the doctor, but there are two key tests that could really help shape and you know I'm getting up to speed in that disruptive economic perspective, but also what we have to do mentally people who may have the antibody that may not get it again for some time. It's important to have that information, so people could certainly go back without fear of infection again, I, don't think we are where we have to be in the city or the state, and that is something we're all. Gonna have to collectively ask questions about and push for. Okay, mr. Chowdhury, yes, thank you. I'm this machi Chaudhary from Bangladesh I have a question to our guest. Today, I was observing the president telling that in five minutes overtime we can make a test, for we have plenty of atenist sets. Are there going to be practice in New York, because I heard we have lost from our community 150 people and most of them are asking me one: can we make tests because without symptom they cannot make tests, but can you do something that those who have little symptom without a big s, er hassle, that can make public test possible? Well, this is what we have to builds towards. We have a lot of people who have the virus who may show little symptoms, but it makes sense that they know exactly where they stand. You know my own mother, you know we. She had some health issues when she went to the stop had trouble breathing. They brought her into the emergency room until she finally got tested. Nobody knew really what she had and, but it was very you know, obviously older with some health issues, but we also should be testing people for a system apps and symptomatic because you could become a carrier to the virus. Look I'm gonna. Do everything is controller to fight in the city budget, for a real campaign to bring resources into the city for massive expanded testing? In all of our communities, you know that in places in this criminal Ward district and in communes, the colorful people with different languages and different backgrounds, these are the communities that are being hurt, the most and yet the least amount of resources, testing and other engines are being given to the community. I'm gonna send the committee board the report we did on frontline workers. Do another report on the disparity study. We did and I'm also gonna, send you a brochure. That's online about law. Community has to know about who to contact what help is available to people, whether you're, immigrants or others battle the coronavirus, though James will make sure the committee board members get this and the elected officials I'm gonna partner, with all your elected officials in the coming weeks. I have time to take one more question: I love! You I'm, very sorry about your mother, my sympathies, but what is what do you see as a financial impact right now, since we're a lot of the businesses are closed up and down our major thoroughfares? There's no I don't know about how they gonna go in regards to the tax money being calculated. So what do you see in regards to the financial impact, though I didn't I a month ago? I did a the mayor's communities vulnerable, that's gonna be the budget bite, but at the end of the day we have to do everything and to get a better stimulus package. You know Maxine Waters, the congresswoman has it right. We have got to give people help with rent we've got to get cash to people who are struggling. The stimulus is nice. If you can get it, but a lot of our immigrants will not be eligible, so we've got to come up with a program to meet the needs of all our immigrant communities, so the budget battle is real. We've never had a budget crisis like this, not since the 1970s, when this video was on the edge of bankrupt, 8. The city as the chief financial perfect tell people who have the pensions that we are there, because pensions and making sure in anyway, and please you have any questions for the contact. Jane I wanted to come on tonight. Just let you know that I'm out here, I've always believed mmunity is the local community boards you represent over 100,000 people and I know how important it is to get information to all of you. Thank you, madam I. Look forward to working with I'll, be we will that mister I'm. Sorry. This is Kevin news Novoa. We actually have one last question. If you could indulge us, it was from the report. All right, I'll make this real fast. Marjorie Clark would like to know what them what the city is doing to streamline the paperwork, to access any of the support for small businesses like the ones who have less than ten people, nothing I'm. Sorry, nothing I! Think the I think the city has not enough to work with while businesses just because there's a federal program or there's an economic program that would help our business doesn't mean small business owners can access this. That is why I have set up MWBE University for women. Pandaria businesses, but I can get you the information at the hell getting through the bureaucracy. Oh, we are doing these webinars. We started today, record numbers of people came on to hear what we had to say: we're bringing in state federal local officials we're going to bring you know. I have the city's first chief diversity officer years ago, she's now working to get all diverse businesses to the table and by foot we have a family get this in 12 languages, so I am dead serious to get small businesses, especially equipment Minari own businesses, the help they need because they don't have the Economic Security, meaning they don't got a big bank now they've been struggling before Corona and we want to make sure that your rapids, not the business, never get federal and local program. Okay, great and we had. We had one compliment that again. Could you say that only again, I'm gonna, we have a compliment from Maggie Flanigan that smell that you you're working with the OMB I'm nonprofit contracts and to please continue the good work because nonprofit support our communities in so many ways. Well, let me let me say thank you. Thank you for that compliment. One of the things that we're telling the city and the heirs office is look. You can't cancel contract or fail to register contract in the middle of a spend, because you got to reimburse the money that they're not for-profit already put out, and this is not Lucien. The job is to he's not for profits running it all cost doctor shut them down because they're, the ones that are least likely to be able to open when we think about what we're going through- and let me just say, I like to look at New, York City with the glass half full, but we're gonna have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we slowly turn on the economic spigot. We don't want to go back to a social distancing issue, but we also have to think about. The communities that have traditionally been hurt. Went times are tough because you know what the budget cutters do they go after the summer jobs they go after the seniors. It's easy to collapse. Programs, it's a lot harder to have creativity to keep them open. So I'm going to talk a lot more about this in the city, but I do think that the economy for people we care about really starts with our not-for-profits all right. Thank you so much for joining us and answering all the questions and again our sympathies to you and your family. Thank you. So much and I look forward to seeing all of you in person, I promise to come to the committee board and stay for hours, because I want to get out of the house. I love my kids, but I want to get out of the house all right. Thank you so much right. So everyone we're going on to our next presenter, who is Kate, L, Hertz and she's from while Cornell and she's going to discuss. I'm gonna, give you presenter mode, Kate, okay, say and she's gonna talk about the impact of Kobe 19 on our mental health and I'm, putting our because I'm part of it also and I'm gonna make her a presenter and I know at the top of your screen. If you want to see who was presenting and click on that button and see who's talking. Do you see, is your screen up? Okay, very good, see you walking and see Kate, okay, hello, everybody, and thank you so much for having me tonight. I am a clinical psychologist and I work at New, York Presbyterian Hospital at the wild Cornell campus I'm going to be talking about how we know Koba 19 is affecting everybody's mental health and this really crazy time that we're all going through I have a brief presentation and then I also welcome questions. So we do have some preliminary data from China about how mental health was affected there. So far, it's their outbreak started, as you know earlier than ours, and in one study of over a thousand respondents from many cities over half of people, rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe so said. This has been incredibly distressing for about 16% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, meaning they were in a clinically significant major depressive episode and about a third reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. So this is much higher than normal rates of depression and anxiety in the community, and we also saw a small percentage. 8% are reporting pretty severe stress, but I'm really focused on the depression anxiety here, so those are significant disorders that require treatment. There are also some groups that we should be thinking about that such as healthcare workers, who are at more risk for mental health problems in from the corona virus outbreak. These groups also include people who are at higher risk, like the elderly people who have lost a loved one people who may be young children who have their routines disrupted. So when we look at the mental health of healthcare workers in China and look at again over a thousand respondents from a number of different hospitals, those numbers go way up for depression, 50% or fully half of the healthcare workers were in a were experiencing symptoms of depression. This is very serious, because depression can negatively impact your job performance as well as obviously your quality of life, and then we also saw that a 30 percent we're reporting symptoms of insomnia, meaning their sleep was disrupted and I'm going to talk about later. How important sleep is to really maintaining your mental health, especially in this time. It's one of those basic building blocks of mental health that is so important and then 71 percent reported distress from the situation, so maybe not specifically to pressure insomnia, but they were just stressed, maybe experiencing anxiety or anger, or frustration about how everything was going with the coronavirus. Now we have, we don't have as much data from New York, since this has been more recent here, but we do have some. So one thing that we've seen is that we some hotlines, such as the National Alliance on Mental Health hotline, has had an all-time high number of calls in March, and that is of the whole time it's been running, so definitely more people are reaching out to mental health services than would in the past, and the director of community engagement on Brown said that of the callers who talked about the coronavirus. More than 20% reported experiencing a high level of anxiety and I'm sure we can all relate to this. There's a lot of uncertainty that comes with the coronavirus uncertainty about. What's going to happen with my job am I going to stay healthy. Is my family going to stay healthy, and so that can all cause a lot of anxiety? We also saw an increased volume of calls texts and chats to NYC well, which is our specific mental health hotline this year versus last year, which the government is the city government is attributing to the city. Promoting NYC well, for people specifically are just stressed about the corona virus and the American Association of suicidology said that crisis centers nationally are experiencing dramatic increases in calls of people considering suicides. This is a very serious mental health epidemic that were experiencing simultaneously to the coronavirus epidemic. There certainly related. We also predict I, haven't seen a lot of good data about this. Yet we predict that there will be increases in domestic violence, as people are forced to quarantines together and that's something we're very concerned about we're also concerned about people who had been using groups like AAA to stay sober who no longer have access to those resources and who may be feeling more anxious or depressed, and so possibly that can make them also more likely to lose their sobriety. So those are two high risk groups that were particularly worried about now. Stress during this outbreak can cause, as we said, a lot of anxiety, so anxiety, my own health, the health of loved one's grief. If you lose a loved one's perfectly normal to experience, grief, low or feelings of depression, loneliness is coming up a lot because we are being told to socially isolate and that's the best thing we can do for our physical health, but it's very tough on our mental health. You might also experience financial insecurity if you lose your job, which can lead to food insecurity which both can lead to anxiety and depressive symptoms, we're seeing among my own patients I'm, seeing a lot of difficulty, sleeping and difficulty concentrating, and these are things the CDC also says we can expect during this outbreak. A lot of our routines are disrupted, we're not commuting to work every day, for example, and so that can definitely impact our sleep schedule and, in terms of difficulty, concentrating there's a lot competing for our attention right now. If you watch the news, you know what I'm talking about so that can be very difficult as well. Another high risk group is the group who already have chronic mental health problems, so we already have a group of people in the city, obviously like anywhere, who have pre-existing depression or anxiety or other mental health problems, and those can be exacerbated at this time. Many people are coping through increased use of alcohol and drugs, which is problematic for a number of reasons, but one of which is that alcohol and many drugs are actually depressants themselves. So well, you have a temporary increase in mood from them. You then it then contributes to disruption and sleep increased depressive symptoms, so we're worried about that as well and then finally, there's, as we said, increased susceptibility to domestic violence during quarantine. So what do we do about this? Because this is obviously a major problem that we need to pay attention to and address some things that you personally can do our check on each other connect with others connect with the people you care about. Do something nice for someone who is struggling. Look for the good news stories that can give you some ideas about how to do that, such as I've seen lots of stories about people doing by parades for someone whose birthday it is things like that which is very heartwarming and nice to see limit your news consumption. You really don't need to watch the news all day every day and watching it for 5 or 10 minutes in the morning it or at night is going or reading it with those times is going to give you everything you need to know and as we know, the news right now is very negative, and so, if you are engaging in it more than that, it can really bring down your mood and make it hard to concentrate some of the most basic things you can do. Are things that you should be doing all the time to help your mental health, so those are following a routine making sure that you're sleeping on a normal schedule, where you wake up at the same time every day go to bed around the same time. That's really important! If you get that sleep, then that's gonna help your mood throughout the rest of the day exercise regularly. I know. Exercise has become more difficult because you can't go outside with being around a lot of people. All the gyms are closed, but find ways that we're lucky to have the internet find online exercise classes that you can do find ways that you can just do some jumping jacks with your kids or something like that anyway, that you can exercise at home is good and that's also going to help your sleep, avoid alcohol and drugs and eat healthy, well-balanced meals. To the extent that you can that's also going to help regulate your mood and make sure that your body has what it needs to keep your mood in order. We know that when we're hungry or when our body isn't getting enough nutrition, then we tend to feel more negatively whether it's angry or anxious or whatever it is the next one I think, is really important, which is to normalize your feelings. This is an incredibly stressful situation for all of us and anything any emotional reaction that you're. Having is normal, really anything goes, there's no correct way to emotionally respond to a novel crisis like this, which we haven't seen in our lifetimes. So if you're feeling angry, that's, okay, if you're feeling sad, that's okay, you feeling anxious that's, okay, it's all normal and you should be able to reach out for help if you need it, but also know that emotions come and go there. They don't tend to last indefinitely so normalizing that okay, I'm feeling angry right now, that's okay and it will pass I'll feel better at some point today. Helping someone who is struggling is a good way to boost your own mood, as is doing gratitude practice and thinking of the things your life that you're thankful for continue to do, activities that you enjoy as much as you can so maybe you're someone who previously really enjoyed hanging out with friends will have a zoom party, maybe you're somebody who liked running races in Central Park. Well, you can still go running outside and that's important to still do the next one I find really helpful because we don't have an end date for this. Yet this will end at some point, but for now we need to take it one day at a time and if you get too caught in the future or thinking about the future and all the what-ifs and questions that are there, that can really bring you down so try to bring yourself back to the present moment and practice mindfulness, which just means being in the present moment as much as you can. These are some resources that I think are really helpful so, and each of these web pages has many other resources on it. So the first is from the Centers for Disease Control and prevent and Prevention's about mental health and coping during cope at 19. It has information for people at higher risk for parents of young kids. For really for all of us. That's really helpful. The next. The next ones are based in New York, so cope at 19 coping and emotional well-being from NYC health. This is a great resource. They have links to, for example, a domestic violence hotline that you can call a number that you hotline number that you can call things like that are all in the city and then there's a whole collection of digital mental health resources. That NYC well has put out that I highly recommend and NYC. Well is a hotline that you can text. You can chat online. You can call there a lot of ways to get connected with some counseling and support there. So that's a really great resource as well, and then for those of you who are parents. I know that there are a lot of unique concerns with that, come with parenting in this time and newer Presbyterian Hospital, the youth anxiety, Center, has put together a webinar series about parenting strategies for challenging times and that's available to watch at anytime at the link that I've provided so I encourage you to check that out. If you think that would be helpful. So these are just my references and I'm going to leave up the resources slide for a minute so that people have it I'm also happy to share these slides with Renetta. So that she can pass them on to all of you, that would be helpful and I'm happy to take any questions. You may have all right. Everyone, Kevin's, gonna, mute a mute everyone. If you have any questions, please ask dr. hurt if anybody you can unmute yourself and ask the question at this point, you have any questions in the chat box. Cab I only have some comments. Imma, let folks just see you then okay from Lisa masu, l'm board member. She had a comment about that. They're, only screening, if you had proof of having the virus, not if you probably had it and that there needs to be more screening and testing care to respond, yeah I mean I. Think that's really important and that's part of the anxiety that we're all feeling is. We don't know if we can get tested if we need to and I think that being anxious about that and worried about. That is very normal at this time and there's not a whole lot that we can do about it. Personally. Besides, going to the people who are in power and saying we want to be able to be tested, I know that one good thing that's happening at new york-presbyterian is that they are working on making their own tests to really try to up the capacity of tests that they have, instead of waiting to get them from somewhere else. So I know that that's a focus that the hospital system has, and we also know that because New York Presbyterian is such a big hospital system. They are trying to help other hospitals in the area, for example by taking overflow patients from other places, and so hopefully we'll be able to help the community at some point. But I know that it's a big source of anxiety that you can't always get tested now and the best thing that you can really do if you can't get tested is to act as though you do have the virus. If you think that you do and isolate and quarantine yourself, so that you're not putting other people at risk from Phillip Hoppus former board president, he complements you saying this is all very excellent info and Marilyn Bailey also wanted to add that Columbia is also conducting screenings. Yes, Colombia's part of our New York, Presbyterian, family and they're conducting screening and testing so is Cornell and I believe we have NY P in Queens as well, so I'm not sure what their testing capacity is, but that's a it's likely that they have some testing that they can do. Also. Okay, so I haven't heard anybody from the floor. That wants to ask a question. So there might be a technical issue, so I'm gonna unmute, all on my end, I'm pretty sure everybody's already unmuted on mine end, but just in case I'm, gonna unmute. And if you have a question, please feel free to ask dr. Hart what about the impact on health providers? Yes, there's. Definitely an impact that we're seeing on health providers we've set up at New, York emergency and a psychologist psychiatrist to every department in the hospital, so that doctors and nurses and support staff and transport workers and everyone who works at the hospital and pretty much anytime or within a few hours. So we're very concerned about that, and what I'm hearing from the doctors is. You know there is a lot of anxiety, just like any of us have cuz we're all human right, so something that's unique about this situation. Is that we're really all in it together, we're all going through it together? So the same worries that you guys have they have to, and so we're working really hard to try to support them and that's very important. I have a question. One of our Bangladesh community people were calling me. His mother was going to be transported to Alma's hospital, but due to the bad experiences and too much hazard there, he wanted to shift his mother to Presbyterian. Is it is there it could not do it? Is there any restriction for that? Can you please clarify so that I can give him answer? Yes, that's a good question. Unfortunately, that's not something that I'm knowledgeable about. It would be best to ask the treating physicians at Elmhurst if that's possible. No, it is only because of the ambulance. Do not take to the other hospitals except I, see so I suppose he could walk into the ER if he has a way to get there at Presbyterian. Great. Thank you. Great sorry did I. You can't just walk into an ER right now you have to go to a walk-in clinic, can be diagnosed and referred or be taken by ambulance. Okay, no, your doctor can write a script and if an ambulance is required to take you to the nearest hospital, however, if your doctor calls in they can dent, he can then have you taken to the hospital that he has. What do you call it right set my mother on call administrator for Queens general you're not supposed to show up at the hospitals and according to my mom and aunts, who are nurses if you're not really dying and you're? Okay, you really don't want to go there. Well, my friend pre-screened at a walking center, all right drive throughs now also to get my tests. Thank you for that information. That's very helpful. I think that this is a good example of how it can be incredible anxiety provoking at this time, and so I really encourage you all to lean on each other and to reach out to Reese to the resources that I've mentioned. If it would be helpful to you and still and others that we can definitely add on the community board side, we're getting a lot of information from some of our representatives and we can share what we know in regards to testing and where people can go and so on and so forth. But thank you so much I got thrown out. I mean my computer died. Okay, so I missed I missed this I'm sorry, but what I said had do with testing I meant the testing to see if you could donate plasma I registered on a few different sites. They all say the same thing unless you have proof that you had it. You cannot donate plasma at this time, so I wish they would change that, because the only people that were being tested and where we live were people that were of like almost dying or they died, and those people right now, probably don't have to believe me, so people myself and other people that I know that had it lightly. You know why don't we are in good shape to donate and we would love to, but they won't let us because they won't test us there's something wrong with that. Don't you, where is she left? No she's here? Okay, yes, it's very confusing economic I have a lot of rich friends who live on Manhattan on the Upper East Side and their doctors have two tests and they're paying five hundred dollars in their getting tested thanks all right. Okay, we have time for one more question. Anyone else. Thank you so much doctor heard you were very informative and thank my friend Shirley for hooking us up for you, so you could present today and you did a wonderful job. Thank you so much nice to see all of you taking care, yes and David clear all right. So now we're gonna go into our public hearings and I'd like our chair, Emin Rosenbaum.

For several years. There was an application approval on this premise in 2014 and unfortunately, the expediter that was handling this case cannot obtain a certificate of occupancy for the nearest liquor authorities, so they were, unfortunately they never picked up their license and they've been operating. Since then, without a license, we were able to obtain a Co recently through FOIA requests from that previous application. That was approved and chemical taco is a delicious Mexican family, restaurant, very low-key. They do a lot of takeout food and it's very authentic and delicious, and it's a great family working behind the scenes. We also.

You speak okay, we're applying because our restaurant Donna mr. kangh Rijo and right now we are blessing. Yes, I am we have food, the restaurant on Wickham, and so a lot of people want to get some no yeah no celebration inside. They ask for celebration, and the first thing they ask is some greens some contain the most popular content like margarita mojito for us is Anglia. That's why I basically sit for dust, what you've been doing over the past year, because you've had wine and beer and what makes your risk for and different? No sorry, no could take our Parranda por el ritmo sang a con convenience, a basic, a canvas of different okay within. We are very different here. We are very different here because it is now our full is our culture is our style. We are Colombian food, but our restaurant is specializing in sea. Oh Pacific cause food is the only one in New York people have expressed that they, like you very much and then and they drink the cartel they ask for us. The more popular all we have liquid is for Doug, where we are that different from them. We have different form for a car for four I style, because we play the music. The music, according with our culture, we are not giving our community of culture to questions, so everyone is unmuted right now, unless you have to does anyone have any questions? Can you hear me? Okay, I, have a question. Can you hear me hello, like what my question is about fire exit? You have a capacity of 45 people there and also have you obeyed the 500-foot rule as well. Are you able to hear me only for the Bosto and the and visit owner right now? Okay, what about what about the fire exit? Alright I know: I am not clear about all your exits, but it's a question she wants to know if there's a secondary egress, he slammed on you una Salida dinner, hey Mia, I'm, not understanding his answer. Okay within years, because a restaurant is small, it's pretty small, they are ten table and the basement and the acetal and all on the front is a window. It's a big window windows, the Whitburn LM. Sorry, is a bit old. Have we been the window in the same wall in front and restaurant? Is it's pretty still small, okay, entonces, no tiene ninguna tipo de salida adicional, so the you guys gonna happen, various additional egress accent: I, don't get it! What is his answer about the fire exit, I'm, gonna? Repeat the question: Salida they discovered a man hangs, you know, so you don't have any fire exits well see, then my question came up because Bennett the place is so small and you have 45 people in there. If something happens, there has to be a way for them to get out. Besides telling me about a big window, it's less than 75 feet. Deep. He doesn't need to excuse me. I was about who is asking this question. I have a question: Fastow. Can you please ask the son to speak up and repeat what he said. I'm saying I can get a report for my pizza again. Okay, also, the back of our lesson is part of the depth of the nest. The nest business. You gotta meet the discotheque close to us. It's like that, and the back of us is part of the discotheque -. We don't have more space. So let me be the judge of that yeah please do the occupancy is 45 of a second there. Egress is not a requirement. Thank you. Okay! Really! Okay, again, let me just repeat: the chair has the floor. Yes, but I. Please will ask you, sir, until it's your turn to speak and you will be addressed. Okay, thank you, 99.9%, so I think I've got the hang of it. That's! Okay! All right! Annette I have a question. All right: David go ahead! Well, I see! Actually, who are you wasting time talking about that? If the restaurant has got a exit, the ingress and egress Edmund suppose to know an answer, the question because he has the plan and even if Edward would see that they have not egress, they would not even put it on the list. We will not waste your time so we'll be on address by Edmund. Okay, - the place is small. That means it's tied up in there 45 people in it. You know I've been here for four years, so another five minutes isn't gonna. Kill me all right. That's fine way too much interruption. Here we need to get through this admit: Kevin, please, yes, okay, what do you need only want people and meet themselves? There are the questions. What is the certificate arrows application? The CFO would need to check that one. Second, all right are the low 74. It's an irregular lot regular space because, as he mentioned, there's an L shape and the Tollman it L fit or not. Plus this place is 199 see, oh right now, mr. Abel trying to fire I did one second, it's part of an altered building that has the address there in 79. Oh five pawns about the Avenue and I believe it has a vibe, a frequency just trying to see if there's a distinction between alteration of the property, because I do know, the alteration was approved when the building split coming up right now, all right, if it's gonna be some time to find it, then maybe we'll move on you, the whole thing's $2.99. My mistake all right, I'm in let's just move on I'm a litigation between the entire property being split okay, but we do know that it's permissible, because no other questions we'll move on yeah, okay, on Roosevelt Avenue, some of the locations do not have or are not required to have a second means of egress when the alterations application was approved. The Department of Buildings granted the approval, so it may not have a secondary means of Music's. We can further research a little later at a later date, but I don't believe that a secondary means of egress is an issue for this particular application. Okay, all right! Thank you. Miss Reed, all right, Edmund, Casa, rubia, breathe. Yes, sir Rubio, yes, is that you talking or is it besides I'm talking I thought. I was fourth on the agenda. Casa Rubio. If you look down in the list, I don't believe in list, but there's a lot of people that are listed as just caller. So I don't know, but is that what is the person's name? Edmond? Also Rubio on? What's up business owners? Name, quick, look through this I saw him before I. Look through it and see if you see hey Arthur, no, we're looking for the business owner, I think that I think the representatives last name was Romero. Mr. Romero I'm not seeing a mr. Romero in the list, and we called them very quickly because they were on the line right because we called out each one of the business owners, names and I. Remember each one of them did respond, correct, Edmund, all right. So if you want to move on to the next person and then go back if I was on the line, if someone can call them Paso Rubio I'm different - Claro text asking her to call cafe Rubio, but maybe we should we should move on to the next applicant.

Thank you very exciting meeting right so I like to welcome everyone again to our Queens community board number three and my boo from the chairs. There I'm gonna mix up a few updates in it I'm looking at it and basically I say whenever I travel and now a lot of my friends when they call me to wonder how am I doing, they said we're. Never, where do you live? I said: I live in the center of a national pandemic that has impacted our wonderful community of East, armours, Jackson, Heights and North Corona I have I, have personally lost family members and friends to cope at 19 and I know many of you have too, and we also know many that have recovered, but the precious lives that we have lost has been very painful so staying in our homes to protect ourselves wearing our gloves wearing our masts standing six feet away from each other. To try to flatten this curve has definitely been an experience for me personally. I know a lot of you I'd like to thank all of our essential workers who's on the front lines. Many of us are related to them: doctors or nurses, or first responders, those that are working emergency services or transit workers, those that are cleaning our buildings and the grocery stores the pharmacy workers. All of those that are central workers that have to go to work every day, I'm grateful that I can stay home and work from home, but it's not easy so and definitely I must thank all of our teachers who our board members that had to learn how to work online. You know, and especially our students that have to deal with not seeing their friends and using a new mode of Education, but I'd like to thank all of you board members for really being dedicated members answering the various emails participating in our meetings participating. Even our committee meetings, so you've really adapted to our videoconferencing. Our new method I know there's some hiccups, but we will get through it and please continue to keep yourself safe, I'd like to thank everyone that participated in our April first census day. Everyone, our numbers, are quite low in our area. Please encourage all of those in our area to fill out the census. It can be done online. As you know, at around this time, a lot of the census takers are supposed to go out to the homes that folks that didn't respond, but they can't because we're all in our home. So please encourage everyone. He had a wonderful of bed, we had a DJ, we did text off the count we text over. We sent out over three thousand messages to folks to remind them to fill out the census and in the, in my view, from the chair, there is a link where it shows you the census, map and lets. You see the response rate, so please encourage those to fill out the census as I have. In my, in my view from the chair, you will see a link where you can see information related to covert testing a testing online assessment from the state. So you can encourage folks to go to that link and hopefully that will help them in regards to finding where they can go. Get a test please, if you're not feeling well, please get yourself checked all right again: I did send out an email to remind everyone that the Queens borough, president Sharon Lee. She will be making appointments with terms to begin on May 31st. So a lot of you that have decided to roll off the board. I know that you're still participating, and we appreciate you still have 60 extra days on the board. So you will be hearing about appointments at the end of May. All right, I like to recognize Autism, Awareness, Month, Happy, Passover, I, know, Arthur joined the line and we have Lisa and Happy Easter to everyone. I know: Easter was celebrated a little differently this year. Happy Earth, Day and Ramadan is beginning soon. So thank you. Everyone thank you for your participation and I will turn it over. Do you have any questions for me all right turn it over to our district manager. Miss Reid is she on there yeah she is I. Just I might have to unmute her hold on one second I said to find her where'd. She go I think she disappeared. I'm, gonna, unmute, everyone. Just so, if she can pipe in if she's here yeah this is you wanna read everything yep okay, good evening, everyone, this is Giovanna reads first I'd like to thank you very much for your call hard for the passing of my brother I appreciate every single one of you and we'll appreciate your support. I also would like to give my condolences to TOI Washington recently. She also had a loss on our family as well. I want to let you know that the community board office is still operating. We are still responding to calls. While we are operating remotely. We are still up and running. So if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. In addition to that, we are continuing to conduct our committee meetings. As you know, so we will operate a little differently, but we are, we are still effective and moving during the day. I participate in a number of teleconferencing calls updates from the Department of Health, the mayor's office and other agencies and I have been advocating to get additional testing sites for our district. As you all know, community boy 3 was very early impacted by this crisis. So we continue to advocate for additional assistance. Kindly note that three closing permits for the month of May have been cancelled by the mayor's office and I'll. Keep you updated on any further changes. Also, we are still actively involved. There were some requests for four locations to slow down traffic. With my next report, I will give you those locations. We did get a couple of rules, one which will impact 93rd Street, so I will keep you posted on that again. Thank you very much, and this is the other thing that I want to say. While on. If you've listened to all the reports on television, it says, do not go to the hospitals, but I'm going to say this to you. If you are not feeling well call 9-1-1 call an ambulance go to the hospital. Unfortunately, there are residents in our community who did not call and unfortunately when they did seek assistance. It was too late. But if you are not feeling well, please go to the hospital. Please call 911 it's very important and again I. Thank you so much for your support and I am available to provide any assistance so that that's me thank you and yes, and as Miss Reed said, we have been on a number of calls and we have been advocating for our area, because Ellmers hospital should not be an option for our neighborhood to go to as a testing site only or the only option it should not be the young. It cannot be. The only operating can I say s, add something to what you just said there on Northern, Boulevard and 18th Street. Did you have a tent in the back where they test where it's the walked in place? I forgot the name of it. It's on northern the corner. You know it's Queens borough restaurant is it's right next door or two doors, all right, excellent and there's a tent in the back for Cova testing. It says a big sign, so yeah I mean that's recent very recent. We have to check that out this market. Is it in on the 8 and Northern Boulevard and 80th Street correct? Yes on the thank you. Thank you. I have a question. Go ahead. Is there any way being that our area, as everyone knows, is the center of the center of the pandemic, we're having disproportionate amounts of death? The morgue, not the morgue, whoo I forgot the name, the people that come pick up dead bodies, I can't remember the name Charlie. Yes, the medical exam, the coroner's office, one of the things that I'm noticing in the community and other people have called me they're taking up the two days to come, get dead bodies. Oh, that excuse me I'm. Sorry, I was just gonna, say Marlene they are they. This situation is very unusual. They are overtaxed they're doing the best that they can, unfortunately, they're not doing that right. I'm going to have to disagree with you. It is in every neighborhood. I had a similar experience so, but we are advocating and speaking with the agencies, which include the mayor's office and a medical examiner's office, we are advocating for them to get assistance, but that is the current. That's the that that's what's happening all over the city. The number of hours I've heard that yeah that the preset well, the police car, has to stay there to the car. No come to get. The body leaves if somebody comes and replaces them if they go for lunch or whatever, and it was two and a half actual days and the family would want to be in the house with the body and I know other families that have gone through that in the area. What is it about our neighborhood? What we have look at another article- they were saying: maybe things that are going on the train system- I, don't I. Also excuse me, mrs. fellow speaking. I also know that there were some articles that mentioned that a lot of people who live in our area actually work, probably in Manhattan, but in certain services, where they would have come into contact with a lot of people. I don't have any more details than that, but I mean certainly, there's got to be a lot of different reasons that are playing into this, but I, don't like many people do work in Manhattan, so just using mass transit. Even you know- and we are very densely populated area, so yeah with a lot of people, it's going from person, you understand. So it's absolutely and we have a lot of boarding houses in the in my near my house where 12 men sleep for one I mean you know: twelve men sleep for one ship and then another ship that the women clean and another ship comes in for another hours who drive the cabs and the crash houses. Well, the you know, I mean absolutely and you wouldn't even know it because they keep the placing outside very clean and tidy and they don't have 40 bags of garbage. But that's how many people are in the house. I don't know, but it just concerns me that it's you know every single day you hear about someone that you personally know, and they were fine last week and just like say, for example, the young lady that worked for Peralta, you know I, remember: I just saw the woman when I went to go, vote and she's gone. It's absolutely ridiculous. I don't know yeah, but she was helping out. You know, I lost for relatives. Last week- and you know they didn't- have three conditions and they were all under 40 and that's another thing that they were saying that it's only Boulder this at all ages, even maybe even young people, so I, don't know all right. So I guess we still have okay, let's go on anybody. Anything else, all right, so I call for a motion to adopt February 20th minutes. It was March 19, sorry that the bang of the society is the largest Bangladesh organization like 28,000 member here, and all society passed away by the coroner and I started the second of the Bangladesh right now, because I was the senior basis then and I we have many people died here and we have their grave ear and so far 72 bodies we buried there and I'm working like 24 hours a day whole day. I pick up the phone anybody pass play. You know, I contact with the funeral and I am doing their barriers. Okay now I know the letter to our local councilman of his Daniel's office, John Doe, fish and marrow fish and borough president of fish about the temporary hospital in Queens, because the Queens is overloaded the capacity and then let me know that tannic center will be the temporary hospital ice. I sent this operation to community both three also. So, if the finish center is this will give a temporary hospital. We know about that I mystery. Do you know how people get to those huh? Does anyone know on the line because I don't know how personally do the ambulance bring them directly there? Or can people just show up there for some reason, I don't know if people could just show up by that. Do you does anyone, know that or has anyone hurt or no and I went over there to the Tennis Center? Okay, so are you? Are you saying asking whether or not it is a testing site? No, that this is a temporary hospital, because the Manhattan have debit central Central Park is cheap. There. So I wrote a letter. We need a temporary hospital I sent to the board meeting. I'm going to have a briefing tomorrow and I will raise both those issues, one with the medical examiner's response and then also whether or not we have access to the temporary hospital and in the park and I will like will definitely report back to once. I get an answer. This is machi. Chaudhary I am supporting another's proposal because Elvis hospital is overcrowded and we have problems with Bangladeshi people to get admitted there to send them back home. So in this case, if there is a temporary hospital you know, quiz area will be benefited. Our community will be benefited. That is what rain all other is putting forward. Thank you can I say something: I, don't want you to feel that it's, the Bangladesh community I went to the hospital three times and they wouldn't keep me and I had a high fever. It's happening to everyone and I didn't go to Elmhurst I went to four Hospital along a Long Island different ones, so I'm just lucky normal adults being a president. He is struggling for the our people. We have lots of facilities and seek and fatalities. Please everyone. If you have any concerns or any questions, please email, the Board office and that's miss Reed mentioned she does have briefings with a city agency. So we can put this to the forefront, because this has definitely impacted us personally, because we are as far as I'm concerned the epicenter of this, and it's very it's a lot. So I call for adoption of the March 19th minute monthly meetings; I'm, sorry everything else here. So you still remember. The community committee reports see Vivian get to come back one again. Yes, I'm back my dear okay on April 2nd, we held our third meeting planning city's annual Leon bondholder Memorial HealthCare Expo 2020, to be held on Saturday June 13th at the corona health center located 3433 junction Boulevard Corona New York from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and enjoy outdoor event. This meeting was held via conference call. The participants in attendance were aboard chair, bernetta, english board members for sanjay gandhi, Kevin, Hughes, Martha, Leviton, bill Meehan, Lisa, Missoula, dr. Laverne, lemons, Philip, tapas, Edmund Rosenbaum and otto Tyler. We discussed the following topics: participant responses, dryer, distribution of volunteer assignments, donation forms, entertainment, refreshment, donation, raffle donations, giveaways for Boyd table donations and monetary donation. We're currently at a standstill. However, due to the Kovach 19 pandemic, we may need to post for postponed the event our next meeting to be scheduled. Thank, You, Vivian, doc, Thank, You, Vivian and, as you can see, our board are still operating. Our committee is still meeting, and so you will be hearing from me the other committee chairs, about scheduling your meetings and as Vivian mentioned, we understand still right now about our health sphere, because, as you know, we normally have it in front of the health center and we do not know what rules will be in place, how things are going to be changed in regards to gathering. So at this moment it's on a standstill. Bbn did not call my name and Vivian. Yes, you didn't call elbows at the meeting. So can you please update laughting? Oh okay, I'll buy I'm, sorry, I'm. Sorry, I lied your name! Okay! Thank you! All right parks. Okay. We had a meeting on Thursday March 26 it on the agenda was a presentation by the parks department on the World's Fair of Marina redesigned. They had come before the committee before and they had asked us for a letter of support which we did give them and then the World's Fair, marina redesign apparently changed and we asked them to come back to the committee to present it. We also asked them for some clarification on some items. I'm specifically, the entrance was being moved and we wanted to make sure that entrance remain in community board. Three. We did receive some additional information that will be reviewed and it is possible we will have another committee meeting. Other items that we discuss was that the parks are closed for all programming events. Dog runs have since closed. Playgrounds are closed, all basketball hoops have been removed and our beautification project is also on hold and that will be determined later on and our next meeting. We will get back to you on that. Thank you didn't need to get any sort of letter, or this ad that's has been put on a standstill right now. It mortar well I need for Giovanna to look at the email that they sent with the clarification, because all they were requesting was a list of our attendees from that committee meeting and that we saw the presentation they gave us and I. Don't think that was enough for those that were in attendance at that at that committee meeting, which was Giovanna yourself, Renetta myself, Hamlet ed, Wesley, David, Rosaire, Oh Dorothy, mr. Gideon Joyce, Julian, Vivienne, Elba and Lisa miss Yulan. So we will have to sit down and speak with Yvonne if we should have another committee meeting or if what they sent. This is satisfactory. Yes, because every one they asked- and it was reason at all- for they asked for a letter support, but we had a lot more questions but go ahead. Mr. e know the information that they submitted, in my view, is not sufficient. So I think that we should have another committee meeting and you know, take a closer look at it, because what they presented to us last year is very different than what we agreed to then so I think we have a little bit more time. Now to look at the project and the changes in its entirety, so we will schedule another committee meeting, okay committee referrals, I, know: Lisa had to drop off the call from the borough president's office, but I'd like everyone to know that the borough president was very impressed with our last month's meeting and she's. Very supportive and I know I have in your folder. There is a service prayer service. That's coming up! I! Let me go back to Martha, you have you have the folder open there? Let me see where it is and I have I have the folder open yeah. The event is a Queen's virtual interfaith vigil. It is on Tuesday, April, 21st 2020, beginning at 5 o'clock p.m. it says for the live broadcast information visit www.azpbs.org/collectibles to save each and every precious life. So if everyone, if you have time, please join the interphase event and it is in your folder and with all the dates and the times and is in the early afternoon evening, so we're gonna have our legislators reports that I'll just call out the names that I see in the order that I see it James. Thank you very much for scheduling the meeting with the Comptroller. Do you have anything else to say James, yes, I hear me yeah, so you have two minutes. Okay, so I am going to. We can't hear you I'm. Sorry. We can't hear you all right. Maybe we'll come back to you, James all right, Jacqueline hi. Can you hear me? Yes, I can perfect so good evening. Everyone trying to be brief. Just to introduce myself in case there are those who I have not yet had the opportunity to meet. My name is Jacqueline Rosado I'm here it's representative for state senator Jessica of Ramos. So, first and foremost on behalf of the state, senator I just want to express gratitude to cv3 and its leadership. We're really working diligently to successfully transition to this online digital system and continuing to service. You know our neighborhood that assistance or chronically thank you so much for that just to provide an overview of what we are doing as an office. Our office is continuing to monitor the koba 19 health crisis, currently impacting our state. As we announced online, our team is available to address ongoing concern. So while our physical office remains closed, we are still available to assist you during our usual office hours, which is from Monday through Friday 13 to 10 a.m. and even at 6 p.m. so we are really trying to utilize online platforms, digital communication and social media forms. We will continue to provide you with the most up-to-date information and resources that we hope will be useful, and we aim to do that really as nice instantly as possible, so by directly connecting experts to constituents so that they get the answers they need that fulfill. The concerns that we are all feeling so I'll just give an example. Yesterday on Facebook live our district joins together for a community check-in with key stakeholders to discuss koba 19, ongoing impact with concerns ranging from on the coil more about testing sites from closure, health care, small businesses and other koba 19 related issues that are happening here to New York. Additionally, our office is Kane special, close attention and collaborating with corresponding state agencies. The combat challenges we are seeing in regards to hospital housing, transportation, education, immigration, workforce and labor unemployment at small businesses. So our office high percentage native liaison for each of those area so, for example, I, will be the primary point of contact for small businesses, so it will feel free to contact us if there ever any concern in any of those areas. We are happy to receive feedback to. You know, gain more information on what's happening on the ground and collaborate whenever possible. You want to ask that everyone takes measures to stay informed and we are encouraging people to sign up for nightly updates from your state with the latest news on the government response to the pandemic, and they can do that by signing up online on the governor's executive website. So just to close, because I know it's late, we are open and available for everyone during sometimes crisis you'll freeze against context of me.

Once again, thank you so much for having me on this call and I'm going to turn it back to the chair all right. Thank you. So much Lily, can you hear me I can hear me? Yes, I can hear you I. Could everyone good evening, it's kind of great to see everyone kind of sorta just to let everyone know all right. Just so everyone know we are open our office in practicing our six foot distance because we're not letting anyone in, but you can reach us if you'd like to speak to someone live between the hours of 10:00 and 2:00 Monday to Friday the Assemblyman. It's got everyone in his heart and he prays for everyone's safety. All right. Thank you! So much Jessica hi everyone I, wanted to just highlight a couple of announcements from the mayor's office today. That I think will be relevant to this community board. First, we announced a partnership Open Society Foundations, which will establish the New York City Covid-19 19, immigrant emergency relief program, undocumented immigrants and immigrant families have largely been excluded from federal, Covid-19, 19 relief programs. So this program, which will be headed by the mayor's office of jurgen Affairs and the mayor's fund to advance New York City, will create a citywide network of community-based organizations that will provide direct one-time emergency relief payment to immigrant families and again this will include undocumented workers. These relief payments will be in the amounts of $400 for an individual $800 for a couple or a single parent, with children and $1,000 for families with multiple adults and children. Secondly, we're expanding our isolation, Hotel program. We will now be able to provide hotel rooms to all healthcare workers who are at risk of being exposed or contracting Kovan 19 at work and feel that they may be putting their families at risk by going home and in addition to that, community-based referrals will be such that new individuals can participate if they are unable to socially distance at home. So if there are more intergenerational families, where there's a grandparent parents and children and for the safety of minimizing spread, they wanted to isolate one family member who is sick. We will now be able to do that, and this outreach will be conducted by the Department of Health in areas with the highest rates of illness and death, and if anybody has any questions, I'm happy to answer them. Where are these hotels, Michelle there's some in our community for three area that are taking folks I, don't have a list of hotels right, Michelle, I, just see, Michelle she's gonna go next. Sorry, Jessica I apologize! It's an expanding program. I, don't think we have a list of hotels are working with, but I can either invoke. I can not have a day yeah should they. Let us know, because I know that we would like to know where they're placing folks and where they have so any pending one reaches out to the community board, they'd be able to say okay, you can go ABC here or there and I think mission to you on the phone and we had that call that testing in and we want to come. It's the first time, I've ever heard of this place on Northern Boulevard and 80th Street for colvett testing, but we need testing in our area right and I. Think I need help, explain it's contingent on us getting testing supplies so I wasn't I, wasn't satisfied with that responsibility, bus that they have a lot of them on the southern side, you're only just now able to organize to create those costing kids in New, York City, starting in May, something that we previously produced again. This is not only this country and all the different states fighting for these testing kits, but this is the whole world. So because we're ominous, you know rapidly evolving level. We are now starting to produce them in New, York, City and so hopefully we'll be able to expand that to a wider amount of testing every day. So whoever wants to get a test can but we're not a mellow right now, yeah, as one of our members said on the call we're the epicenter of the epicenter of the epicenter. So thank you. Michelle. Oh come on someone had a question who was the last girl over the last speaker from the mayor's office? No Lily, sorry, okay, miss Reed Lily from Assemblyman Aubrey's office. Thank you. Okay, we go back. Can we go back to Jessica for a moment? No problem, good Jessica, I, don't know if you heard the question about the response time for the medical examiner's office. Maybe you can briefly touch such on that sure, so that has been - to back up what you had said earlier. Giovanna that has been a citywide problem. Our system is just not did not anticipate that we would have this massive needs. So there have been expansions of hospital capacity to store bodies. There have been expansions of Funeral Homes to be able to hold bodies, but there are some delays and we did have some assistance coming from the federal government. So this is something that we're ever working on: okay and that, if we can also respond to the question regarding whether or not cb3 residents have access to the temporary hospital site in the park, so for anybody who the way you get into those hospital beds is that's an sort of like acting like as an overflow telomers hospital. So if somebody were to go to Elmer's hospital and doctors at Elmhurst, Hospital directed them to be sent to the Billie Jean King Center, that's under the directive, Elmhurst Hospital I will note that the bed count in that site was initially 350 and that's been expanded to 475 hi Jessica. This is Kevin Hughes niveau of the board secretary I have a question from one of the residents regarding the attention that agencies are giving to the homeless problem around the BQE and that it the work that these agencies must continue, because it's a recurring problem do you care to comment. I can certainly fly they're, not familiar with that specific case. So I can circle back with DHS and see if we can do anything there. Okay, Thank You Michele Hernandez, Thank, You, Jessica, Thank, You, Victor, hi, everyone. This is Michelle Hernandez from the office of Congress in Minooka, so Cortes. My heart goes out to all of you. I am cp3 resident, and so it is quite painful on to see what our community is going through. I like to share some updates on the work that our office is doing so on the legislative end, the care is active pass. Some of you might have perceived your stimulus check this week. I will include some comments in the comment box for the IRS portal around the status of your stimulus check. If you have not received it yet and I also wanted to give you all a sense of the timeline for receiving your stimulus check so folks have that rep deposit would be receiving it this week. If are you are a social security beneficiary? You don't? You didn't have to have filed your 2018-2019 taxes, normally don't if you don't need to file them, and so it's going to be received through your Social Security benefits until you'll be receiving those later on and beliefs. Starting next week, starting the week of April 26, the IRS will start issuing the paper checks to individuals and so they're going to be issuing them at a rate of 5 million checks per week. It's going to take around they say 20 weeks in total to get all of the paper text out. They will be starting with reverse adjusted gross income, so that means folks who have the lowest incomes will receive their check. First, if you have any specific questions about a situation, you may have, if you're not sure if you'll be eligible or you're a little concerned about where you are in the process, feel free to reach out to it. The office feel free to reach out to me, and we can look at your particular case and give you some insight, and we also want to give you information, a reoccurring information, so we're putting out these weekly copa90 newsletters. If you receive our newsletters and are on that list or if you should be receiving them, if you don't again, I will place a link in the chat box, so you can go ahead and sign up to receive them. We're sending them out at the end of the week, and we do want to remind everyone. I know it was mentioned earlier. Please fill out the census, encourage folks to fill out the census and our office is still assisting with casework. What you'll do is that you'll call the office and you can leave a message on the UM. You will leave a message and we will get back to you. Also in your in the voice. Note just make sure you say your name I do know - your phone number, because sometimes phone numbers are private and we don't see them. So we can't call you back so feel free to reach out to us throughout the day, and we do reach out to everyone who is seeking assistance and I. Believe y'all have my work number so I'll share that with you. Also, you can call me directly a zero sum. One thing something I saw I was hearing some echoing, but my personal work number is nine one, seven, eight three one, seven, six, five, eight and actually I will type that in as well clean. You just have all the information, six, five, eight and so what's on my end, I'm happy to answer any questions, the best of my ability and that y'all might have right now there was a question from board member Foster Rodriguez regarding the caps for salaries in the stimulus checks. He specifically asked about people making over a hundred thousand dollars and if they're qualified, to receive a stimulus check yeah. So it's typically, if for an individual, its grounding five thousand dollars for joint it can be up to around 150 thousand. There are specific scenarios where it can. It can differ a bit, but that's the that's the guideline $0 fausto, no money! You won't be getting anything if you make over $100,000. Thank you, okay, James did you did you have something to say: I know there was a problem and then, if not we'll move on to the next person yeah, let's see, can you hear me now? Oh, yes, we can hear you now James, fantastic, all right, so I just want to say yeah thanks for asking all the questions to control your stringer I know. Some of you probably didn't get to ask a question that you want wanted to ask. In fact, I already got one email from one of the board members up with a question. So if you have any other questions, you want to ask me, you can send it to my email. I can type it into the into the chat section. Also Navarro's I know you mentioned something. Please email that to me as well, so we can follow up on that issue that you asked comptroller, stringer I am going to send four links to the community board. The four things that comptroller stringer mentioned I'll make sure I send those out, so it can be distributed to the board members, but I do want to also mention the resource guide, the comptroller's office resource guide for Coppa 19, it's very comprehensive, I. Honestly, it's the most comprehensive thing, I've seen so far for New York City residents in terms of lumping together a bunch of a bunch of information about how people can be helped, whether it be tenants, property owners. You know various categories, there's a lot of information on ways you can get help. You can get assistance. You know get money things like that. So please check that out. That's on our website, I had previously pasted it into the chat, I think maybe around like 8:00 8:05 p.m. so. If you look at that time stamp, you can see it there somewhere in the center and I'm gonna. Send the last I'm gonna send a report to about the report on frontline workers and that category describes a lot of people in the area, especially around Jackson Heights, Elmhurst Corona, also East Elmhurst.
