If people are calling out when their name is not called all right, I'm just gonna go back may have dropped Margaret dossier, hey Renetta English is here We have a so welcome everyone to our May 21st community board virtual meeting and where we're going to do if you're online, you can view the speaker before speaking you're, going to put everyone on mute except who is speaking because we're getting some feedback in the back, but I just wanted to confirm there, but we had to community an organization and a resident that had sign up to talk was to talk in public participation Please ask your help to prevent something: I'm calling driver discrimination being meaning biased against my in our community on our local streets and I like biking and I use public transportation Drivers can sometimes be very false and we as public don't have time to believe that our questions the time I wanted to make sure that our community board members were aware of this, because your questions do take priority.
We will have a virtual statewide meeting tomorrow, the Assembly Democratic conference, to discuss that we have I believe the opportunity to look back at the quarterly projections that the we'll give us when we passed the budget in April we provided before and before we provided the governor, as you know, with emergency powers to extend certain kinds of controls over both how we spend and what are the financial projections when we started the year in April one, we were already six billion dollars in the red and it is estimated now that will be anywhere between that and sixty billion dollars, Clearly, if you follow and I'm sure you do, the pause is still in effect for New York City, even though different parts of my district another home, and we are hoping that New York based on statistics and numbers will be able to enter the first of the we're sending the pause schedules within the next month or two, but that is always going to depend on how the numbers of this pandemic play out has been the role that the governor has played, I thinking and correctly so for our community.
We know that we are in the heart of the pandemic in the city, we've lost any number of friends and neighbors to this disease and have extraordinarily high numbers of people who are tested positive, and so that is continues to be the challenge.
They open up six to seven hundred people a day coming in we've been partnering with the board presidents office who's helped us bring Fresh Direct to some of those sites and to some of the communities and particularly trying to make sure that homebound seniors get the kind of service they need.
We provided some halal meals along with the borough president at Elmhurst Hospital, on to thank workers there, as well as uber cards, that we've been able to distribute to the people who are doing the hardest work, trying to make sure that our community has as much as it needs in this time of need.
Are there have a few people are in them, but they're, not overcrowded they're, not putting themselves at risk However, my real hope is that there is a vaccine end or a cure found as soon as possible, because it's hard for me to imagine that we're going to be able to return to any normalcy until those things happen, particularly in communities as dense as ours and in a city as best as our unlike other parts of the state, which you know have lots of space and few people.
We've tried to help as people as best as can, and so those kinds of efforts will continue to go on But again, the cooperation of the people of this community has been great and I hope that, as you do your work at support as it is that those messages you're taking out, certainly for those who are in the thirty-fifth.
If you have any needs, please let me know we certainly have masks available as we speak, so that if there are places when you want to distribute mass on your block, please call your office that one eight four five, seven three six one five as well as for any other assistance that we can give you six feet away, mask and wash your hands as often as you can.
that's right and thanks for mentioning about the pantry's and board members folder local food pantries that are there please share with those in the community, and we do have the ones that you mentioned all right, This is commute Queens community board, three in New, York City.
The city has never rolled out a program like this before so we're open to making adjustments as needed, and we're currently working with community boards to fine-tune this process as we go along with the ultimate goal of reach 100 miles, we heard loud and clear from community before 3 we want to be in, but that they want to be involved more.
Do T is working closely with local precinct to support this program, but as we continue to roll out more open streets, we hope to reach unity partners such as bids local volunteers, block associations that can help us with implementation.
Cross streets will remain open, so on May 1st, as I mentioned previously, the first round of open streets were announced, as part of this announcement do t, send every community board and local elected official and Queens and email with the basic requirements for the open streets program, along with a forum link to collect them to collect recommendations.
The largest announcement of open streets and Queens happened recently actually last week of the 3rd round and that's when we expanded 34th Avenue from 7 th Street to also include 7, E, Street and junction Boulevard.
The city has never rolled out a program like this before and we're open to making adjustments as needed if something's not working, we're, certainly up to making those adjustments and or removing areas we're looking also for equitable distribution of locations across the borough, as well as in community, bore three cuz right now.
If the community board has any specific corridors or any businesses that they want to connect us with to start that conversation in an effort to begin this dialogue before the next round of open streets is open, because we want to actually work with business news and community boards to have a commercial corridors entered into the next round.
We want to have that conversation, but you guys know these commercial corridors better than we do, and so there might be some exciting opportunities, but we defer to you guys on some of that and as we hear from folks in the community via our website, we're gonna communicate that back team work with you guys on what works best and what's feasible for community board three, all right and Jason.
and then we're gonna be focusing on areas of the Bronx and then infill and CB one and then CB two before we get to see b3 but I'll work to share the last update about city bike expansion within Queens with you Renetta, so you can share with members of the board as well.
When your comment short things, you can also read it just says some of the open streets are crowded like by Travis Park, and it might help if folks follow traffic flow.
because collaborate, how much community groups are involved with involved with maintaining and monitoring the open street on 34th Avenue, if you can provide contact informations to the community board regarding those groups So, as we said earlier, the preaching has been coordinating with loads local volunteers, I'm, not aware of any larger group.
That's all I'm saying that's a concern So if you do one question about the cleanliness of the street I'm down the order, boy Martha go ahead: Given the high volume of traffic, individuals will soon probably go out and try and sell food and unfortunately, everyone, sometimes people just like to throw things in the street and with alternate side of the street parking being suspended for as long as it has been just wanted to know what efforts are.
If you want to cannula mentioned here that this number of volunteers is 34th, Avenue, open streets coalition has an abundance of volunteers and they working with over 10 community groups to volunteer Go ahead, Martha, Jason, I agree with Lorinda 114th Street needs to be looked at separately, because that area is highly trafficking and we have issues with the traffic and Martha The community gourd would definitely like to be part of that conversation, as he mentioned that we should all be working together Also look ahead, Marty good again, oh, but we do all need to be part of that conversation, because once this is over- I have to go out and clean every day, because I don't see things being cleaned and people are throwing everything into the streets and on the sidewalks from the mass to the gloves to everything.
, it's his question: actually, is there going to be a dedicated line, so our residents can call up and get somebody to answer that phone that we have a problem well depending on the problem, is an emergency that you always call 9-1-1, but on most of the volunteers in the area have a lot of straight open line of communication without with Adrian and Mario and again you can always call 3-1-1 we're always monitoring it on.
T things and Queens I wanted to just thank the community board three for allowing me to come and present the Queen's chambers been around since 1911 I'll be celebrating five years there.
We are home the seven colleges and universities and for the record I've reached out to every one of those presidents, whether they're interim or active presidents of those seven colleges we're having a call next week and how we can get folks that have been unemployed through no fault of their own job train for new opportunities and also make sure they're current students with over 90,000 students that are in those colleges and universities, have opportunities for internships and then You probably all know that our biggest segment of employment is health care transportation.
It's also important to note that one of our members, a fellow named James Hendon, just recently became the Commissioner of Veterans Affairs put up on the Small Business Administration right earlier this week and part of last week was the deadline for companies who received money and for whatever reason, public pressure places like Ruth's, Chris, Steakhouse, Harvard, University and those that got the money and said you know what this is not what I bargained for the government allowed them to give the money back and I can tell you right now that billions and billions of dollars has been returned that people can go apply for so if anybody on the call had any issues whatsoever about getting in the information I'm typing my email address as we speak, and you need help with the application.
We enter this space to fill a gap that what we were finding in the city were a lot of small businesses owned by spanish-speaking people who are not getting enough information.
It has information for people that are tenants for homeowners, for people that need food assistance, I think it's the most comprehensive set of information for New York City residents, so not only hasn't, been updated since I last spoke about it, it's also been translated into traditional Chinese and Spanish, and next week it will likely be translated into Bengali as well all languages.
In fact, the Community Board for district manager said that he punched some names and it found out that people he knew were actually owed money.
A lot of the people on that list, their last known address, was either in Jackson, Heights, Corona or East Elmhurst, and some of the other nearby areas - like Woodside in Elmhurst all right next thing we just did a special report on the Board of Elections.
So we're just going to continue the effort, asking questions, sending out information, sending out questionnaires and letters to principals and to parent coordinators to find out how we as a board, can support and assist and just make note just make known what the needs are for our children here in the city of New York.
I'm here on behalf of New York, State, Senator, Jessica, Ramos and, first and foremost, I just want to acknowledge Queens community board once again for the phenomenal leadership that you have exemplified throughout this time our office has been active and we've been responsive to the needs brought to our attention by residents within the community.
We always want to make sure that people know that our office is open and that our constituent services folks are available to help you with anything that you might need.
