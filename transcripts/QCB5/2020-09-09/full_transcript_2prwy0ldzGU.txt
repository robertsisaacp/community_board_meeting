Foreign Vinnie's still on Mute, I can't get the full screen for some reason hold on folks, okay, I'll, try again spot again, okay, open to me join me. I hate these things. Somebody needs to, I think, take over. We can see you benny, but I can't see anything on my screen. Okay, so if you could see me, we can hear you might, you might have minimized it. Look on the bottom of your screen. Maybe you accidentally minimized it because we can see and hear you well never mind not anymore gone he's gone, meaning adjourned, start all over. That's what I did reboot Foreign Vinnie, you muted all right! So welcome everyone to I'm looking at somebody that there must be something going on here. So harish. Would you put everybody on turn everybody off, except they please, on audio okay, now I lost the whole damn thing: okay, so welcome to Committee Board five monthly meeting for September 2020. I thank you all for attending the first order of business is the pledge of allegiance Donald. Can you do the put the flag up and do the pledge I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you all right. So the first order of business, then after that is the public hearing. Mr Giordano, are you out there? I am okay, so under the public hearing, you're on for the capital and expense budget for the board, okay, so we are mandated to have a hearing every year and, as I've said probably many times before a lot of projects got accomplished. We would have a budget hearing on a whole separate night every year in either August or early September, but we have a lot less speakers now that so many parts have gotten reconstructed and sewer projects have gotten built and roadways. Reconstructed and many of our top priorities have been accomplished from past years. The processes that we have a hearing tonight, the executive committee will meet next week, remotely they'll go over the capital budget priorities from last year that were that are agreed upon by the board. I think there's 34 items and the expense budget priorities as well and they'll, formulate a capital budget survey, then that'll be emailed to board members and board members will be asked to return it in about a week and a half. So please return your surveys do them as quickly as possible, because what often happens is that Laura has to get on the phone and get after a lot of different board members to return their survey when completing the survey sort of like golf, you are the lowest score, wins so you're. What you consider to be the most important budget priority you would list number one and so on to number 30 some odd. The purpose of the meeting tonight is to get input from the public. We only have two speakers and, as far as the expense budget priorities go the way, we'll probably do that is instead of sending a survey, we will email the board members the expense budget priorities from last year and ask them if they would like something moved and, of course, if you want something moved up, you have to, you should be recommending what could be moved down. Usually our number one priority historically has been police patrol. As far as the expense budget goes as far as capital goes, our number one priority are still sewer projects where we have had flooding conditions, and the most important item for us to accomplish is is in eastern Glendale or in Glendale, generally mainly from 76th street to 88th street. There is a capital project that is sort of earmarked at this point in time. I think it's number 877 I've been trying to follow it. They're in preliminary design, they've done some surveying, but with the budget conditions the way they are, we better make sure that we push those sewer projects so you'll be asked to return your capital budget survey and your comments on the expense budget. By in about a week and a half after they're sent out, I expect that they'll probably be sent out a week from Monday. That's pretty much the target date and then what will happen is the executive committee will either meet again or ask for their comments on the results and then we'll vote as a board with regard to the capital expense budget priorities at our October meeting at our October monthly meeting. So the first submission we have too is by Ted Rems or theodore Amrans, one of our top board. Members he's also a member of the executive committee, and he is the executive director of the myrtle Avenue Business improvement district and the Ridgewood local development corporation. So he's titled his testimony in support of new capital improvement project for Myrtle, Avenue and adjacent side streets in Ridgewood wholly within the boundaries of the myrtle Avenue Business Improvement district. Dear members of Community board five on behalf of the myrtle Avenue Business improvement district. We thank you for your support for a new capital improvement project for myrtle avenue in Ridgewood community board 5's number three priority for fiscal year 2021., the last time rental avenue in Ridgewood between Wyclof Avenue, Palmetto, Street and Fresh pond road was included for a major capital project was 1983- 1984. At that time. The project under the New York City Commercial Revitalization program included major improvements to the shopping corridor. Improvements include the following new concrete sidewalks and decorative brick pavers building line to curbside, one of which is Woodbine Street St Nicholas Avenue Myrtle Avenue Junction known as Vendetti Square named for Detective Anthony Van Diddy, who lost his life in the line of duty in January, 1986. Ridgewood memorial triangle named for the veterans of World War, one myrtle Avenue at Putnam Avenue and the junction of Cypress Avenue, and then the other triangle that was reconstructed back then in 83:84 is times triangle now known as clemens triangle named for the former owner of the widget times. Ted writes that over the years, other improvements included historic M polls, World fair benches along various curbside locations and in plaza areas, historic marker signs along the avenue and in plazas historic marker signs on M poles, a new plaza on 71St avenue at the Junction of Myrtle Avenue and Stephen Street, as well as a new raised planting area at the Northwest corner of Myrtle Avenue with Catalpa avenue over the years. Many of these improvements, particularly the brick pavers embedded in the sidewalk, have seriously deteriorated, causing tripping hazards and unsafe conditions for pedestrians. This has also resulted in a number of lawsuits in many cases, also naming the business improvement district, which has resulted in higher insurance premiums for the bid. While there are a number of very important projects for this board to support, we kindly ask for your continued support for this important improvement project. Myrtle, Avenue and Ridgewood is a major comparison, shopping corridor serving the greater Ridgewood area, including Ridgewood Glendale, middle village, massmuth and Queens and Ridgewood the Brooklyn part of Ridgewood and Bushwick and Brooklyn and beyond along this card are approximately 345 retail and service establishments. The improvements we are asking for may include, but are not limited to new sidewalks without brick, pavers new curbs new impulse on side streets within the boundaries of the business improvement, district removal of all belgian blocks from over 300 tree pits additional benches and other amenities. Since the last project only included a repaved street bed, it may be wise to consider a total reconstruction which includes new sewer and water and sewer lines, as well as upgrades to utilities and Mr Renz sums it up asking. Thank you for your support. The second person that submitted something for the budget hearing is derrick evers and he writes hello, Community Board, five, I'm writing to you as one of the newly elected democratic district leaders in assembly, district 37 and the only one located here in Ridgewood. First and foremost, I want to introduce myself to the board and any residents who may be watching on youtube. Please know you can always reach out to me directly via email at Derrick, J, Evers, F-, O-, r-, a- D-37B at gmail.com, which you can also find on the Queens County democratic website. Secondly, I'm writing to offer my testimony regarding talking. These are all. Secondly, I'm writing to offer my testimony regarding the fiscal year 2022 budget as it pertains to the Ridgewood mass with middle village and Glendale communities. When I was running for district leader, the biggest concern of the constituents I spoke with was the enormous NYPD budget and their continued presence in areas like schools, public transit, homelessness, outreach parks and traffic enforcement. The community's concerns have amplified in recent weeks as the quality of our parks and streets have been ravaged by cuts to the parks and sanitation department and acts of aggressive driving and accidents have increased dramatically time and again, they asked me why if the NYPD provides little enforcement of everyday quality of life crimes like littering or speeding or running red lights, can't we remove these duties from the hands of armed police and put them back into the hands of service- based departments like the parks or D.O.T. So our community can get the services we already pay for. They asked why, during Covid-19, when we're more dependent on our parks and playgrounds than ever before, should we expect the parks Department to cut their meager budget at a far greater percentage than the NYPD. They asked why, during a pandemic, would we consider laying off nearly 400 emergency medical technicians and more than 700 uniformed sanitation workers before asking the NYPD to make a few sacrifices? No department or union wants to face budget or staffing cuts, and I understand this is a polarizing topic that often falls along political lines, which is why it's important to remo, emotion and discuss the budget in unambiguous terms. The budget for the NYPD has increased more dramatically under Bill De Blasio's watch than any other city department. The NYPD is currently the third largest department by budget in all of New York City. I was happy to see our city councilman Bob, Holden, Sign, on to a letter calling to reallocate NYPD funds to the parks enforcement patrol and even Dermot Shea. The commissioner of the NYPD has been quoted as saying he could support a reallocation of funding to better community services. We've seen that a reduction in the daily services we rely on have done in a short time to our parks, roads and public transportation, and history has shown us that the safest community is a well- funded community for the sake of hours and on behalf of constituents who voted me into this position. I implore this board to take a stance of no new cuts to any service- based departments and instead ask the NYPD to make the necessary cuts to help balance the budget and he signs that Derrick J Evers Democratic, Assembly, District, Leader, Assembly, district 37 part b. Okay, thank you anything else, not for the budget. Hearing. Okay! So then we'll close, that portion of the excuse me meeting and we'll go to the public for Public forum. Do we have anything any speakers? Under the public forum, we received something from Crystal Wolf that she's resigning? Yes, that she is resigning and I'm not sure if she's moving out of New York City. She writes something very personal, but it is with regard to her being a recent victim of domestic violence and that's part of why she's leaving the city and resigning, and we wish her well thank her for her participation. Anything else. No sir, the borough president's Rep has something on the public forum or no. Yes, I, if you want me to go here, I'll, be very glad you might as well hello folks welcome back from your summer. I send my regards and well wishes. So does the borough president three quick items census it is getting down and dirty and the borough president is pushing and asks everyone to push. She is doing events pop- up events at six libraries three times a week and has for the last two weeks and will another week or so until we end her eighth Installment recruitment, Fair, which I understand, the numbers are going very well and numbers being people looking people hiring and results. Her eighth installment is Wednesday September 16th at 2 P.M, you jump on by going to the borough president's website and, last but not least, the borough president, every Wednesday and Vinnie and Gary I'll. Send you the flyer. I should have done it earlier I'll, send it to you tomorrow: every Wednesday free drive in movie night at the Hall of Science, every Wednesday through September 30th tonight. If you sneak out of this meeting, you can go see. Wally make a reservation because, obviously limited you go to the website. The Hall of Science is also having other drive- in movie nights. Those you pay for by the car. I think it's 30 bucks do not hold me to that, but the free sponsor. How much did you say? Oh I said 30 am I lying? No, it used to be five dollars when I went that's 1910 vinnie, so the borough presidents are Wednesday nights, they're free, and we thank her for that, and I thank you all, and that is it for me. Thank you. So, let's see, I do not know whether to do it under the no okay. So we'll go to the chairperson's report, and this is vincent R Curie, chairperson of Community Board, five I'd like to recognize some of the officials that sent in comments or statements. So we have something from the mayor's office Gary. Yes, please, okay, we received this from Jessica Schabowski and she is the representative for half of Queens for the mayor's Community affairs unit that when we all started many years ago with community Board five, they called the community assistance unit. But short for that is Cau entitled announcements from the mayor's office. Can you hear me vinnie? Yes, thank you all right. The mayor has been advocating for the federal government to provide a stimulus and for the state government to provide long- term borrowing authority. The pandemic's impact on the economy has created a nine billion dollar revenue loss in the city budget. The city had to make budget cuts, acrosss the board and is working to prevent the layoffs of 22,000 city workers. The test and trace corps has been working to get the word out on free resources to stop the pre, the spread of Covid-19 in New York City. If community organizations would like to partner in this effort, we have been organizing presentations from the team and distributing palm cards in multiple languages. We encourage all new yorkers to get a Covid-19 test to find a test site, including mobile testing sites. Please go to NYC DOT Gov Slash Covid-19 test. Please fill out your census, encourage your friends, family and neighbors to do so. At my 2020 Census.Gov, we have 21 days left to get an accurate account and this data will impact the city for the next 10 years. Last week the NYPD made 160 gun arrests. It is the most gun arrests. In a single week in 25 years, the city is working on deepening community policing in an effort to keep new Yorkers safe. As we address the perfect storm of challenges, more than 10,000 restaurants are now participating in New, York, City's outdoor dining initiative, open restaurants, open restaurants. In just over three months. This program has saved an estimated ninety thousand jobs acrosss the five boroughs. The mayor will announce a decision regarding indoor dining in the next few days. New York City care launched in Queens on September 1st new members will receive a primary care appointment within two weeks: a membership card, access to language interpretation services, expanded pharmacy hours within the New, York City, Health and hospitals system and a 24:7 customer assistance line. Those who are eligible and want to enroll in the program should call 646 NYC care for more information. Please go to NYC care, DOT NYC that might be.gov. I think she might have run out of space NYC care, DOT NYC, because there's a DOT after the NYC, so it might be gov on September 16 schools will begin engaging students in learning and orienting them to the new school year. Prior to the first in- person day on September 21st. The city's plan for reopening schools is the strongest in the country and among the most rigorous in the world, with its blended learning model socially distanced classrooms, mandatory mass, widely available testing and contact tracing program. The city will only open schools of transmission stays below 3 percent, exceeding the 5 standard set by the World Health Organization and New York State. Today, New York City malls are opening at 50 capacity and New York state casinos will open at 25% capacity. Then Jessica sent something on behalf of the mayor's office. A statement on return of indoor dining mayor, De Blasio today released the following statement on the return of indoor dining. We are continuing New, York, City's economic recovery by bringing back indoor dining working with the state and public health officials. We've achieved a plan that puts health and safety first by including strict capacity limits, a close monitoring of city-, wide positive testing rates and a coordinated inspection. Regimen science will guide our decision making, as we continue to monitor progress and health care indicators over the next three weeks to ensure safe reopening. This may not look like the indoor dining that we all know and love, but it is progress for restaurant workers and all new yorkers restaurants will be allowed to reopen on September 30th. They will be subject to rigorous inspection protocols and strict occupancy limits. Some requirements for restaurants include serve customers at a maximum of 25% capacity, conduct temperature checks at every front door, collect test and trace data from at least one customer at each table. Close bar tops for seating or for Covid-19 protections like PPE for employees, space tables six feet apart. If New York City hits two percent and Covid-19 positivity rates, the city will immediately reassess open restaurants, New York, City's outdoor dining program has already given the restaurant industry a lifeline more than 10,000 restaurants are participating in the program has saved an estimated 90,000 jobs. So that's from the mayor's office. Thank you laura. You had something your hand is up. Laura, Mulvahill, yes Vinny. I just wanted to remind you that we need to do attendance. Okay, we'll do that next. Thank you. So the next item- Gary, we got correspondence from the comptroller's office. Yes, okay, so there is a new wrap for the Controller's office assigned to our community board area. Probably all of Queens, I think, he's a deputy to the direct, the queen's director. His name is Harris Khan K- H- a- n, and he writes good evening. My name is Harris Khan. I I'm the new Con City Controller liaison for central Queens, including CB5. Our office manages the investment portfolio of New York City Retirement systems investigates and audits inefficiencies by city, Agencies, Reviews city contracts, assess and enforces prevailing wage laws, among other responsibilities, feel free to contact me if there is any way our office can assist. My number is 929- 512- 1946 and my email address is H k, H a n at comptroller, C, O, M, p, t r, o l e r, DOT N, Y c DOT g, o v. Looking he says, looking forward to working with you, we have correspondence from council member Holden. We do council, member Holden, writes hello, Neighbors, Community, Board, 5 members and fellow elected officials. I hope that you all enjoyed your summer while staying safe and healthy, and I thank you for your continued work and volunteerism as we navigate this challenging year together. Our city continues to make great progress during the cove at 19 pandemic, as the infection rate is approaching 30 days at below 1, and that is thanks to all of our collective efforts to practice. Social distancing. Wear mass and practice good hygiene. In recent weeks we have unfortunately heard reports of many troubling incidents surrounding the homeless, shelter at 7816 Cooper avenue in Glendale. We have also seen an increase in incidents of indecent exposure, drug use, harassment, trespassing attempted sexual assault and threats of violence against members of against members of our community. That may or may not be tied to residents of the shelter. However, the 104Th precinct has not been exercising its due diligence and filing reports for many of these incidents. I have been in touch with the police, commissioner and commander of patrol borough Queens north about this issue and will continue to work with the 104Th priest and to make sure it is adequately investigating these complaints with the current New York City budget being splashed by billions of dollars. Our sanitation and parts departments have been hit particularly hard because of this. I recently reallocated discretionary funds to the sanitation department to restore public waste basket collection, and I brought another non- profit sanitation company into our district to conduct more cleanups along our commercial strips. My office will also be leading a volunteer community cleanup on Saturday September 26th, and I welcome everyone who would like to help clean our communities together. We will be sending out more details about this soon. As chair of the City Council Committee on Technology, I led a hearing yesterday conduct oversight of the 3- 1- 1 and 9- 1- 1 systems related to the city's response to tropical storm Isaias, and we heard from several constituents who said they could not reach 9- 1- 1 operators during the storm. I will continue to work with the department of information technology and telecommunications, NYPD fire department and other agencies to bolster these systems, especially in times of need. Lastly, I have joined the call to bring back indoor dining in New York City, given our successful efforts to flatten the curve of the Corona virus, our restaurant owners, employees and their families are struggling and we must allow them to make a living again before it is too late. Nearly half of all small businesses that closed permanently during the pandemic were restaurants, as always feel free to contact my office with any of your questions or concerns. Thank you again for your continued dedication to our communities and I hope to see all of you in the near future. Sincerely Robert F, Holden, Council, member District, 30..

Is this the time to talk about the homeless, shelter, or should I wait until the end you want to do old and new business? Well, I'm asking you because I do not know right now. This is the we're doing the chairman's report and the district manager's report we're going to go to committees. Then we're going to go and hold the new business. Okay, so I'll wait till then thank you, okay, anything else for the chair and the district manager. If not excuse me, if not we'll, go to committee reports, Mr Vinnie right there, a few things we are now having resurfacing done in the board five area. I'm sorry, yes and most of the roadways are in middle village and mass, but I think last year most of the roadways were in Ridgewood and Glendale, but some of it was massed within middle village last year as well, because we got 69th street from Grand Avenue all the way to Calamus, and we got Metropolitan Avenue from Andrews Avenue in Massbutt all the way to pleasantview Street in middle village, I've been pushing for portions of Underdock Avenue and Woodward Avenue, which are pretty important secondary arteries in Ridgewood to get resurfaced, and I'm fairly hopeful that portions of underdog and woodward are going to get resurfaced this season, as I think a lot of you have heard, the sanitation commissioner has resigned. She was a very hands- on commissioner was one of the few commissioners that showed up at budget consultations with the queen's community boards. I found her to be real cooperative and I thought she did an excellent job with the sanitation department, especially with regard to getting them new equipment. She was very dogmatic at continuing pushing for to get them. You know new trucks and front- end loaders and what they need to do there to do their job well, and I think you all know that the infection rate in New York City for for Covid-19 or the coronavirus has been, I think, as councilman Holden pointed out below one percent for 30 days or so the sewer project in the penelope Avenue 74Th Street area is completed. I do not know of any outstanding items to speak of so that's good. The sewer project continues in the area of 70Th Street between Calamus Avenue and the L.I.E and they're, putting in an enormous new sewer in there. So hopefully that'll do even more than we've done so far to relieve flooding during potentially heavy rainstorms fire on Grand Avenue. The other day I think, Sunday the fire department seems to have done a tremendous job at getting that fire under control quickly. Marianne Latazier was good enough to call me with regard to it on Sunday, I'm not positive where it started yet, but it looks like it started near where the master theater used to be when I was a young boy in Las Vegas nearer to 69th place, because when I checked on it yesterday I saw that ivarone on the corner of Grand Avenue at 69Th, Street looked open, so thank God for the fire department and they're brave firefighters, and especially the fact that the engine company is right over there, and so is the hazmat unit virtually right next to Mass with federal savings. The one bad thing I have to talk about is you know: crime continues to be up locally and that's primarily burglaries and felonious assaults and those felonious assaults are primarily domestic violence or abuse, but Mary and Latanza will cover that in the public Safety Committee report they met last night. So that's basically what I have to report this evening. Thank you. So public safety then we'll go to committee reports, Public Safety, Marianne, hello, Marianne. No, I had to mute myself good evening. The public Safety committee met last night in September 8 2020, remotely by Webex in attendance from 104 prison was Deputy, Inspector, perry, Captain, Baran and officer Michael Barish. According to Deputy inspector perry, the crime rate year- to- date is up 13.8 percent in 104Th Precinct and in a 28-day period of 11 percent, but most of them being felony assaults, burglary and grand lost in the order. The felony assaults are mainly domestic violence. The burglary increase is commercial burglary. Grand lossy orders are mainly scooters. We are down in murder, which is zero. She said rape and robbery. There were no more. The increase in domestic violence is called the 19 related according to deputy inspector perry, with many people staying at home together for longer periods of time, it has added an increase in domestic violence. D.A Prairie stated that the 104 has a domestic violence unit. She say that 75 of the cases are closed with arrest. Deputy inspector also stated that the domestic violence unit makes house visits and phone calls to ensure the safety of the victims. There is also a the warranty that when a warrant is issued, they will make an arrest at a later date. D.A Perry stated in the last two weeks. There has been a decrease in the domestic violence and felony assaults. There was recently an incident in the Liberty park. Area of Glendale was put on social media, which the Deputy inspector said, hurt the investigation. She urges the community if they see something to please report it to the police and do not post it on social media. Put it on social media greatly hinders the investigation we just. We discussed security and crime issues in the homeless, shelter on Cooper Avenue in Glendale deputies, perry stated that the shelter does have private security and the police are not allowed to patrol inside the shelter. The police are responsible for the crime outside the shelter she stated. As of August 5th to 2020 11 people from the shelter have been arrested, officer, bearish stated since then two more arrests were included, a lewd act on a local park being making the total rest to 13 from the shelter. According to Officer Burris, there were approximately 100 men currently living in the shelter we discussed problems at the parks in 104.. This deputy inspector perry stated that Mcfarland Park two motorcycles been towed from the outside of the park, and the volleyball net has been taken down. She personally warned a woman, deep frying to stop and the person complied deputy perry stated that they are working with the parks Department to issue summonses for open flames. In the past social discipline in the parks are not handled by the police department. They have ambassadors handling that the auxiliary police of 104Th are handing out mass in the local parks. We discussed bail reform being one of the reasons for the increase in crime, not only in the 104th prison, but it is a city- wide problem. Deputy inspector perry agreed that the bail reform certainly seems to be the reason for increase in the burglaries. The committee discussed the topic of abandoned vehicles and the prolonged time of having these cars removed off the street. We wanted to know if there was any more road companies that were added to help with this problem. There are currently two companies used to tow these abandoned vehicles according to Officer Bavish, there was a long list and no room in the lot is the reason for the delay. The committee discussed issues of people disrespecting. The police, deputy inspector perry stated that in 104Th Precinct that the community is overwhelmingly supported of the police, disrespect of the police is a problem in other parts of the city in the USA committees discussed the Diaphragm law with deputy inspector perry. She said that you can not restrict breathing when making an arrest. She stated that is important and informs her officers to call for backup is important for officers to handcuff his purse when necessary. The committee discussed speeding and violations in the 104., the violation's up 59. According to captain baran, there were 912 speeding, summonses issued year- to- date. Captain moran stated we are currently having bicycle issues with cyclists, disobeying traffic laws and causing accidents. Captain varane stated that the 104 is modern monitoring, difficult intersections and had made initial reports to NYC D.O.T, especially because of Metropolitan Avenue and Myrtle Avenue. There have been numerous complaints of attractive trailers on 69Th Street and Elliott Avenue you're, going down towards special pond road from Elliot Avenue truck drivers need to know where they're allowed to go. 104Th will enforce the Rules Committee discussed Pedestrian safety, which is on the increase. Since 2018. we discussed making flies about pedestrian safety and handling that throughout the community. The committee discussed the increase in Graffiti in all of the 104Th precinct police officer. Ferris stated. The district attorney will not accept handwriting or tags as proof they have to actually see you do graffiti, which is a misdemeanor. The master's NCOS had a graffiti clean up day and have suggested that to sergeant Ryan that all NCOS have a cleanup day, and that is the end of my report. Thank you any questions or comments. If not we'll go to the next committee report, hello, can you have a question yeah? Why did the deputy inspector not want anything put on social media like the incident in Liberty park right? She said it happened, two blocks from me: that's right. She said it came in as a call as menacing, but the when you get on social media it hinders their investigation where they could go officer. Bearish. Can you are you there gary? What did you understand from that? I'm here you're good. You hear me official. Oh there you are so when the deputy inspectors followed the liberty park situation. So when the job comes over, it's originally classified each crime has a different classification, so medicine would be the classification for that crime and we're not going into too much detail too much information, because that is under investigation right now, when things go out on social media, classifying it in your own terms as a different crime. A defense attorney could use that against us and the D.A could use that to say well now we could drop we're going to drop these charges. So then, all the work that you know you did reported to us taking this individual off the street could all get washed away with false rumors on social media and things like that. All right, I just kind of get it. Yes, okay, good, so Mike, I'm sorry! I did not see you online, you wanted that's fine, I forgive you want to say anything I was but Marianne. We had a very thorough meeting last night once we all got on it was very. I thought it was a very good meeting. We were there, for you, know a pretty a long time. We covered a lot, as Marianne stated. One thing I will add is being that school starting next week or the week after 21st. I think we have. I went personally today to visit about the five or six schools in the area of the shelter so between Glendale middle village, and we have implemented a plan to have a police presence as much as we could. You know you have to understand. We are still short staffed and resources are limited, but for the arrival and dismissal of students in the local schools around the shelter area. I know this is you know a community that's known for walking to school, which is great because it's a beautiful area. So you know these schools are not too far from each other from where everyone lives. So we understand there'll be many children walking in you know to and from school. So we have a plan. It's called safe passage to have police out there at the arrival and dismissal time. You know monitoring this shelter at that time to be proactive and try to get ahead of anything and prevent any. You know unfortunate situation from taking place crime wise Marianne hit it. You know perfectly like last night. Felony assaults are up mainly due to Covid-19 everyone being in the house together, getting tired of each other and, like you said most of those are closed out to an arrest either by patrol officer when we report to the scene, our domestic team or a warrant's team that goes out to our detective squad that work hand in hand with the domestic violence officers, also grand Larceny of the autozoa. Please do not leave your keys or your t5 in your car, even if you're just running into the store real quick. I know this sounds silly to say, and you hear me say it all the time in our meetings but believe it or not. People do this and it's just an easy opportunity for a person looking to take a vehicle you're, pretty much handed it to him sounds silly like I said, but if you could help get that word out, something that could be prevented for everyone. I think that is that's it for now. Okay, so Mike. Today, the parochial and private schools started classes. Yes, school started yesterday, so they the schools, are, I guess, one- third of the schools are active in the community correct I went to which two started. I went to so many today. Sacred heart started today: yep and St Margaret's yeah, okay, and they said everything went off without a hitch. Everything was great. Public schools are still working on their plans and you know they definitely have their hands full. But I did this schedule for the 26th 21st, something one of those dates. First, okay 41st. I had a written down over there, so but the traffic they said it went off without a hitch. Everything went well. There was no issues. Just got this done. Getting used to. You know just becoming a new custom. So all right. Thank you. Yo Ipad 8, who is that you have your hand up hello? I ipad 8, you have your hand up. Yes, I do hold on hold on hold on. Is it related to this or something else? It's related to the homeless. Shelter? No save that for later, okay, but it's about the crime go ahead. Is that okay yeah? Do you know what the crimes are? No, but I would like to know how we can find out how many crimes are committed from the shelter if we are allowed to know that might so. I know everyone's concerned with the police presence there. Everyone, you see us there all the time multiple times a day, sometimes so we're there for many different reasons, aided cases you know someone having a seizure, someone not feeling well an emotionally disturbed person, you know someone mentally ill or a violation or a crime. Like Marian said the other day there was a gentleman from the shelter who was in pinocchio playground performing lewd acts, and we did make an arrest on that. Other types of things that go on has been assaults against each other resident to resident. There have been reports for harassments. There was a robbery that took place some two months ago, maybe now so the crimes vary and we're there for different reasons, and just one other thing who are they placing in there because it was supposed to be for working men, but I do not think there are working men in there now they look more like drug addicts and so on that question that question would have to be for the shelter directly. I could tell you that they're allowed to host up to 200 males right now. There are 100 males in there due to Covid-19, so the number is 200 right now and they could be level three offenders, so the committee- and that means what benny Mike what's a level three to be honest, I'd have to break it down differently. For you, a level three would be a tax offender. They are allowed to live there, but they're not registered as a level one or level two I'd have to give you what kind of offender a level three sex offender. Oh, so we have sex offenders between schools. So what I? What I was told is, I was never notified that there was a individual there. That's that has registered, so I can't confirm that I usually get a notification. I have not got a notification from my agency to notify me of that, but with a level three, I'm not, they may not have to notify you so to answer your question. Gary and Kathy Massey will be meeting with the operator to find out, what's actually going on there and correct that'd, be an issue for that. That'd be an issue for the shelter to answer directly. Oh, this is a police department. We, you know your call a thousand times we're going to respond a thousand times. You know we yeah, and we appreciate that all right, so we'll wait for Gary and Cathy to meet all right, Brian Dooley. What do you have to say? Hello, Ryan, you have your hand up yup, just taking myself off Mute. I had a question on the mary and about the graffiti. I think you mentioned that the D.A will not accept handwriting or examples tags anymore as evidence, and I seem to recall from years past that we had made a lot of progress in this community when we were able to. You know, prosecute the offenders based on their tags, so it just occurred to me. I think you said the Da won't accept it, and I thought that the new D a is Melinda Katz. So is there any way we can appeal to Melinda, since she was our borough president, that this was an effective way of reducing Graffiti in our community board. It just does not make sense to me that we reverse policies that actually work and make sense in terms of enforcement. I do not think it's a. I do not think it's anyone's privacy, if they're putting their mark on a public piece of property and they use the same mark every time. That's their calling card. There should be a way to prosecute them every time. You know what I agree with you Brian, I think using the tag is what they should do, but according to officer Bearish he's the one who said listen to no longer allowed to, but I think we should bring that up to Melinda cats and I think, okay, why do not you guys formulate something for us to present to the district attorney? Okay, thank you! So fred haller. What did you have? I want to thank the officer he responded. Last year we were at the home school meeting together when we had an almost incident really was an instant down sacred heart and they took a lot of heat and they did. They did a good job. So I was down there this morning, but I was kind of in and out of the school a bit. Well just give me a little description about what you expect to be doing in going. You know when to the school: how much time would it would a car be by the school or you know if we're going in at eight o'clock, but just give me a little description if you would thanks sure so from you know, one of the scrolls, obviously, as predicted everyone's arrival time is about the same. You know between seven and eight- ish 830. Maybe some schools have early drop- off the public. Schools are not doing any early programs or anything simply because they do not have the staff and the dismissal is around the same time also for everyone, two thirty three o'clock. Sometimes so we will have a car in the vicinity of the shelter Edo cooper down to seven three. You know whatever we could work with that day. I wish we in the deputy inspector wishes. We had a car to put at every school. Unfortunately, right now the resources and staff are very limited, we're losing people to retirement to protest, so we will monitor the shelter, the actual location as well as the surrounding areas. You know in a two three hour period from you know the arrival and the dismissal officers have been assigned for it again that that's what we to do right now. I wish we could do more and, as we get going we'll see how we could tweak it, we could add a car here. You know our NCOS will be involved, of course, our youth officers. So you know we. It is a plan that we, you know we will put into effect and that I'm sure some days we could add more some days, we're just not going to be able to and other resources we're going to have to reach out to pay attention to it. That's it so mike we have the vehicles, we do not know. We do not have the personnel yeah, we have. We have plenty of vehicles what they do mike, what they do in the suburbs and they occasionally park a vehicle at a location. Is that something we could think about? You know drop off vehicles at certain locations and that might be a deterrent. It's not a bad idea, but right now many of our vehicles have been dead in damage. You've seen what they've been doing at these protests, yeah, torturing them in flames and coming back with some nice, not kind words with spring paint on them. It's not a bad idea, I'll run it by the deputy inspector. If we have one we can, we can put out there for the time being pick it up later. You know it might work, move it from time to time. That's it definitely not going to run by maybe we'll try that all right kenny. What do you have yeah? There was something I think I read it on Facebook office about you. The 104 was hoping to work with the schools that getting some kind of staggered times for so it's not going to happen. Ken, it's yeah! We after me, knowing that today, it's not going to it's tough for them to stagger that's also with the amount of kids and who's they do not even have enough staff. One of the schools I forget, which one said they're down like 40, something teachers right. Okay, I have my hand raised again. Okay, thank you. One more time, you've been one more time, so, as a community board, there's nothing, we can do about sex offenders in the Cooper Avenue Shelter, with children walking back and forth to school. We're not clear whether it's level, one two or three- does it matter. Neither is the precinct clear on what's there, the condition is that the contract was never signed by the controller with the operator, West, Tab or Wes fab, whatever their name is, they should not even be in there. They should not be there, but the mayor has deemed it necessary to do that. They should not be living in dormitory style housing which are doing. If you drive past one of the arguments we placed against it was that it did not meet the building code, so they are currently installing a secondary means of egress on an outside stair tower, which would hopefully for them legalize the building. It's so it's illegal from the building department standards, there's no contract. They should not be there. But this is your great mayor and I like to congratulate all you democratic voters for what you put in office. I just certainly did not, but okay, congratulations to all those who did Brian Dooley one more and we have to get to the next subject. Brian. Now I can it's more for old and new business. I can hold it until then. So the next thanks mike you're, welcome, take care all right. Everyone have a good night, be careful next time. Business is transportation in public transit, John Meyer are you there? Anybody yeah go ahead. John wow we met at on Webex on Tuesday August 18th. We had a presentation from the folks at Nyct. Talking about the painting and repairs of the M- line system which were begun last year were supposed to have been finished in our board area by the end of the year last year and they're. Just now, roughly, I think at structural painting about 12 done and I believe yeah 12 done and 61 of their steel work is done. So they've still got a lot of steel repairs to do. They've been there for a while. I honestly think what happened is this started underway? They had so many issues with the seven line in Queens of things falling off falling through people's cars, their windows, etc. I just was under there last year at the beginning of the year of this year and all the scaffolding that they're starting to use on our line was over there. The other day I was under it at near Queens Boulevard and it's all been painted the same way that they're painting ours. So I have a feeling they kind of move things over out of scope and kind of started working on what they saw as an emergency issue, and then we of course had Covid-19. So that's been slowing things down, but they are now back at work. If people are using the M train, they're going to be seeing these groups of people either down in the ground or up above sometimes will disrupt service occasionally, but not in any major way. They do not have any scheduled shutdowns. They gave a pretty nice presentation of the work they're doing and how they're doing it. I know some folks that live near the setup and the construction sites have been experiencing some problems on the ground. Hopefully, they'll get better about this. We've been trying to bring this to their attention. They say they will follow on with it. We also discussed a little bit of the ongoing major capital projects, one of them being the Grand Street bridge, which is in design right now for reconstruction. We also talked a little bit about wyckoff avenue, which has been long on our list, but very short on information from DOT or the state for where that is in the project. Right now, we are, as Gary mentioned, we're in paving work right now, a lot of milled streets in our communities- hopefully they'll- be quicker about it, but they have just consistently had a lag time between milling, paving and marking. So please keep an eye. Let the board office know if you see some issues with the whole ongoing process, other than that, I think we're going to be having a meeting, probably via Webex again at the end of the month. Gary. If I could ask you to chime in, I do not know if we've picked a date or not 20 20. hold on well, it's either 22 or 29 yeah, so committee get back to Gary for 22 or 29 as soon as you can, because he's got to send out the information all right and as far as the Grant Street Bridge, we had a meeting gary right with the hold on a second. My phone came alive. The projection for replacing the existing swing bridge with a new swing bridge is completion by 2026.. No, that's the start. Then! Oh start, I'm sorry start 2026 and completion. Three years later, so your lips to God's ear. I may I may see a new bridge before I die. You know. So that's, okay, all right walter! You have something for this committee. Yes, I do. I have been exited about 69th roll for a few times and we have a problem between 80th and Coop on 69th road, all the way to 73rd place. I see that we're requesting the stop sign on 73rd place, because somebody recently got run over and killed over there, but just last week, last Thursday, another pedestrian was run over on 69th road in 75th street last week she was taken to the house. I do not know if she made it or not, so I just want to bring that up to the transportation committee that 69th road either. We need to put a four- way, stop sign, maybe like around 76 feet or add some speed bumps on that stretch, but people like to fly down 69th road and then they fly up 73rd place just to beat the traffic on Metropolitan all right, we'll ask the committee to look into it. Thank you. Thank you, kanga. What do you have my dear hello, everyone? I just would like to be marked present. I came in late. I'm sorry, oh that, okay, thank you. Laura will do that. Thank you, king. Okay, nothing else! On transportation, any other committees. I failed to recognize Walter. I believe he was going to talk about the Amazon site I do not have to if you guys do not want to land. Yes, go ahead, Walter! No! Thank you. Since we brought it up before about the fire. We have a pretty good article in the queen's ledger. Four firefighters were actually hurt all right, so you take a look at the article at the fire and mask last Sunday. I mean okay so and it started in the in the convenience store. It's spread upstairs a lot of boarded up windows, pretty horrible thing. So it's in the queen's legend, of course this week, but that's a commercial announcement here. You go, I'm going to talk about Amazon a bit, so we we're working with Amazon and I I'm going to tell you what's going on and then you'll have questions I'm going to give you kind of a full report about what Amazon is doing in the neighborhood and they're doing things as of right: okay, they're, not asking for anything they're, not asking for anything more than what zoning will allow. I guess they learn their lesson in long Island City and I think it's pretty commendable to Gary, you know and to vinnie that they want to talk to us and believe me, I, after getting off the phone with them the video conference, they really they want to talk to us. Let us know what's going on so everybody has the correct information, so the wrong information does not get out there and they ask our opinion on things and Vinnie asked for a master plan which we are going to be getting and he asked about traffic lights and traffic were concerned with that. So the site is at it's 5515, Grand Avenue, it's a million square feet, there's they're using 250,000 square feet on the first floor and then there's going to be three or four levels of parking for 300 vans. Okay, it is a what they call a last mile delivery station where they're going within 45 minutes to make those what they call the last mile delivery station. Now they have two other facilities in our area. We have one 2615 Brooklyn, Queens expressway, it's right off the expressway at 30Th Avenue and that's a last mile delivery station. They also have one on railroad, Avenue and 49th street. That's called an Amazon Xl bulk fulfillment center, where they will deliver from that spot on railroad avenue things like washers dryers, bigger bulky writings if you order a hot tub, all right vinnie. So when your hot tub comes, it's coming from that facility on railroad, Avenue and 49Th Street and so and they use box trucks to get out of there. Here, they're going to have 300 vans and they're going to be parked on site again when the workers, the people that take out those vans when they come in they're, going to take the parking spot next to the Van they're, going to take the Van out they're going to leave at 9:30 in the morning they say and they're going to make their deliveries all day long and then again within 45 minutes. So that could be anywhere. It could be the Bronx. So it's not really the last mile, but they call it the last mile, which is fine so and it's going to be five stories, so it'll be ready by 2023 and that's basically, we got the other one at Metro Mall. Well, we have the one at Metro Mall, which I believe was 70 vans. We talked about that. I believe once before yeah and we we looked at that site a couple of years ago and we made sure that they did not interfere with Metropolitan Avenue Street, that there was enough room on the inside, so the vans or the trucks could manipulate inside without flowing out to Metropolitan Avenue. I think that was a smart thing that we did and again they're going to be leaving with the 70 vans there at 9:30 in the morning, and you know kind of like if anybody's near 48th street, when the ups leaves you get a heck load of trucks that leave at 9:30 in the morning. You do not really see them. They all get back at maybe 6:30 7 o'clock at night. So I'm not trying to tell you to believe. Oh traffic's, going to be minimal, I mean there are Amazon vans. We see them all day on streets. I just have found. I do not believe, because I see it at ups- it's not busy in front of ups during the day because the trucks are out, so it does not really affect the traffic on 48th street. I'm not trying to convince you, I'm just saying what reality is. If you ever at 48Th, Street and Ups trucks are not there during the day, so there are going to be trucks delivering on our streets, Amazon vans. You see those sprinkler vans during the day and they're going to be completed in 2023 they're losing the property. It's a long lease and they're pulling at the last mile delivery station and that's basically it we are going to get a master plan when it comes out. It's a lot, a lot of space, a million square feet as you, as I said, and we're concerned about. You- know a traffic signal on the corner traffic light and basically it is at that time at 9:30 in the morning when they all leave. At the same time, I do not know how they do it. I mean it's how they do that you know making sure that they all leave at the same time. You know that's why they do it. So that was our phone call. I found them to be very upfront. We asked questions. We have a long term. We have a dialogue with them, which is very important. If something happens, you know we want to. Let them know- and I think they're going to be responsive to us and that's all we're supposed to do as a community board. If we could get these organizations these firms that have large lots of land. You know a lot of businesses in our community. If we can get them to be responsible to us, we win so basically how they operate, they call they have a fulfillment center. So all the miscellaneous pieces and parts get delivered to the fulfillment center and you place an order and they package them there and send them overnight during the night time, with the track Trellis to the distribution center, where they all get loaded into these prime vans that you see running around and then in the morning, as Walter said, the prime bands go out within 45 minute distribution space and deliver your packages. Then they go back and they're all locked in there. So I would assume the fulfillment center, wherever they are, the million square foot one and the others will have a large employment group so that there should be a lot of jobs at the fulfillment center. Well, that's in staten island. That's in staten, island, again, distribution, centers! It's an individual driver in a Van does his deli his or her deliveries and that's it and we see them now all over the place and they just won't be traveling as far or as long as they do. They'll be able to travel, shorter distance, less hours, and hopefully it's good for the community. So when you place an order on Amazon and you order a light, bulb laundry detergent and a pair of scissors and coffee, they put it together in a fulfillment center like in Staten, Island or Jersey, and then, as many said, they'll pack them together in that box. That box goes to the distribution center and then it's taken out by vans, so they're not putting together boxes at these places at the center in Massman. But it's a bit it's a pretty big center, but again 45 minutes from us. You could get mostly anywhere in New, York, City and many places in nassau. Probably all of that thank you, Walter, and there are a number of other places in Queens we talked to that they talked about they. I think they have one of fresh meadows, one down by Kennedy Airport, so that's how they are expanding, they're taking over properties and that's how they're expanding okay and they're also selling franchises for these prime vans. So when you see the Prime Van comes up to your house drops off the package, you could become a vendor for them and you know so there's more opportunities for entrepreneurs also Brian Dooley. What do you have to say yeah? This is just a small item. I happen to notice. As I was coming back into Glendale today we did a street renaming for Jax Warren's and they still have not fixed that sign. Wait. You got a different subject: different subject: okay hold on hold on kenny. Do you have something on this subject? Yes, I move forward. I know Amazon is working with the community. I just had a question, though, what is happening with the infrastructure because they keep advertising that in a few years they all their. Those prime vans are going to be electric. Are they? There was just a announcement today about that? I do not recall exactly what it was, but next year the first vans should be coming out fully electric, but the thing is that is our infrastructure going to hope we're going to build to take this capacity like say, 300 vans. Well, we'll have to find out, I know at wyckoff hospital we put in outlets in the parking lot, the doctor's parking lot and we did not add any additional electrical service to the hospital, because it's a slow charge. It's not 300, though I do not know exactly how it works, but, like I said there, we could plug in as many doctors cars that they have electric without adding to the facility right. I guess we'll find out. Okay, thanks, fred, hello, fred! No! Yes, you mentioned the Amazon trucks they're a good. You know, source of income, their businesses, all those fedex trucks, you'll also see driving around many of those they're. All private franchises too, which is a great also when I happen to know someone in the business. Anybody wants to look at a route they are most of those are franchises, also good. Thank you, John Meyer, John, hello. I would just like to add one thing about electricity: okay, I'll be up in during our last blackout. That building did not lose power. Well, everyone. What building you talking about? The one on Metro, which I know is where the most of the vans are going to be the Metro wall is basically a self- subsisting facility. Yes, and I think that's why they selected that, because they'll never be out of business and honestly a thing that we need to look at. Despite what the last speaker just said, I often think of these vans as not prime vans but subprime vans, because the driving is rather deplorable, the double parking. We really need to look at loading zones in our residential areas, because this is becoming a much larger entity of activity and they're, just clogging up our streets. That's a good point. I at one time years back, I think, with Frank principe. We talked about between handicap and delivery, spaces designating corner locations at different blocks, and we need to revisit that. Thank you. John Richard, Phone, Richard, hello. Just talking to Ken's point. According to the governor and one of our congressional representatives, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez New York state is going to be entirely electric, probably in the next five years. So we're not going to have gas furnaces gas stoves or anything everything's going to be electric, so I'm sure you know they're working on the infrastructure for that as well, so it should not be a problem. Thank you very much. Thank you. Richard Mike, Porcelli, yeah hi. I want to ask: did anybody talk to Amazon about putting solar power on that Metro building to charge the vans? We did not get that deep into it. I think John we sort of talked to them or tried to lead them into energy conservation since they are taking over of basically the entire building. It's a good subject. John will work on that all right, Lee Rottenberg that was actually Mike Porcelli for the minutes. Thank you, okay. Yes hi. I just wanted to say that, like the 9:30 or 9 o'clock time- and you think the Amazon vans will be leaving, we had a delivery two weeks ago for two TV. They delivered the TV at 6:20 a.m and you can show up when the driver leaves he actually left. The depot at 6 am because he did two deliveries before us, so I think they leave like any time it may not just all be no. They they're very specific, as John said, and we'll work with them get more detailed information once they we know the whole operation they gave us. They spoke to us about one location, another location and a third location. Then we said, as Walter said, we want to know the whole story, the whole big picture and we're going to work with them on that. So that's a good point and yeah it's better. If they leave any time that way, they all do not leave at once at nine o'clock A.M. Now they delivered your TV from the bulk fulfillment center. As I said earlier, they leave it a different, that's a totally different thing. These places they're leaving at 9 30.. That's it! Okay! Thank you. Thank you. Anything else on that subject: okay, any other committees that I failed to recognize all right, any old business, any new business, ryan yeah. This is just my complaint about the street code naming for Jax Warren's. I think it was last January they put the sign on myrtle avenue instead of on 82nd avenue, it's still there. I do not know if I need to write a letter to DOT or if they who was the sponsor the elected official. I think it was council, member, Holden. Okay, that's who you have to go to? Okay, all right! Thank you! Eric yeah. From my understanding, there was at least in the works or a rumor that the track at Juniper was going to be remodeled. Is that still happening reconstructed Gary? Did we get an update on Juniper Valley track? Not yet, but as far as I know, the money is still in the budget. As far as I know, the money is still in the budget. We have not gotten any more of an update, yeah, okay, so there's no, no estimate on timelines for that, it's just in the budget. Okay, a lot of things have been stalled because of the coronavirus situation, so I'll follow up with them and try to get a straight answer all right. Thanks Gary, all right. Where am I? Where am I Brian Dooley? The signed request? Has been put in to re- change, relocate it because of the pandemic. They, the crew, is not working right now, but the request is in and they acknowledge they will do it. Okay, Kathy Sumski, hi, just one more thing, all faith cemeteries. I do not think it's being run by anybody. I think there's just workers in there that are not getting any health benefits and just trying to keep the are you talking about the shelter again? No, I'm talking about all faith cemetery, all faith cemetery. We have a very good relationship with them. So if you give me your complaint either electronically or in writing, I will take care of it. Okay, can I do it verbally here, because I do not remember anything. You'd tell me if you put it in writing, I remember it forever all right. Well, I'm just saying it's a mess and it's state- run and something has to be done about it. Send me a message and I will take care of it. Okay, thank you all right, so anything else any.
