The executive committee will meet next week, remotely they'll go over the capital budget priorities from last year that were that are agreed upon by the board.
As far as the expense budget priorities go, the way, we'll probably do that is instead of sending a survey, we will email the board members the expense budget priorities from last year and ask them if they would like something moved and, of course.
Members he's also a member of the executive committee, and he is the executive director of the myrtle avenue business improvement district and the ridgewood local development.
So he's titled his testimony in support of new capital improvement project for myrtle avenue and adjacent side streets in ridgewood wholly within the boundaries of the myrtle avenue business improvement.
Dear members of community board five on behalf of the myrtle avenue business improvement, district.
Thank you for your support for a new capital improvement project for myrtle avenue in ridgewood community board 5's number three priority for fiscal year: 2021.
The project under the new york city, commercial, revitalization program included major improvements to the shopping.
Improvements include the following: new, concrete, sidewalks and decorative brick pavers building line to curbside, one of which is woodbine street st nicholas avenue, myrtle avenue junction known as vendetti square, named for detective anthony van diddy, who lost his life in the line of duty.
We are asking for may include, but are not limited to new sidewalks without brick, pavers new curbs new impulse on side streets within the boundaries of the business improvement, district removal of all belgian blocks from over 300 tree pits additional benches and other amenities.
Secondly, I'm writing to offer my testimony regarding the fiscal year 2022 budget as it pertains to the ridgewood mass with middle village and glendale communities.
The biggest concern of the constituents I spoke with was the enormous NYPD budget and their continued presence in areas like schools, public transit, homelessness, outreach parks and traffic enforcement.
Community's concerns have amplified in recent weeks as the quality of our parks and streets have been ravaged by cuts to the parks and sanitation department and acts of aggressive driving and accidents have increased dramatically time and again.
They asked me why if the NYPD provides little enforcement of everyday quality of life crimes like littering or speeding or running red lights, can't we remove these duties from the hands of armed police and put them back into the hands of service-based departments like the parks or D.O.T. So. Our community can get the services we already pay.
I implore this board to take a stance of no new cuts to any service-based departments and instead ask the NYPD to make the necessary cuts to help balance the budget and he signs that derrick j, evers democratic assembly, district leader, assembly, district, 37, Thank you anything else, not for the budget.
If she's moving out of new york city, she writes something very personal, but it is with regard to her being a recent victim of domestic violence and that's part of why she's leaving the city and resigning, And No sir, the borough president's rep has something on the public forum or no.

The mayor will announce a decision regarding indoor dining in the next few days, new york city, care, launched in Queens on september.
The city will only open schools of transmission stays below 3 percent, exceeding the 5 standard set by the world health organization and new york.
We are continuing new york city's economic recovery by bringing back indoor dining working with the state and public health.
This may not look like the indoor dining that we all know and love, but it is progress for restaurant workers and all new yorkers restaurants will be allowed to reopen on september.
So there is a new wrap for the controller's office assigned to our community board area.
I have been in touch with the police, commissioner and commander of patrol borough Queens north about this issue and will continue to work with the 104th priest and to make sure it is adequately investigating these complaints.
The current new york city budget, being splashed by billions of dollars, our sanitation and parts departments have been hit particularly hard because of this.

Think last year most of the roadways were in ridgewood and glendale, but some of it was massed within middle village last year as well, because we got 69th street from grand avenue all the way to calamus, and we got metropolitan avenue from andrews avenue in massbutt.
Well, And I think you all know that the infection rate in new york city for for covert, 19 or the coronavirus has been, I think, as councilman holden pointed out below one percent for 30 days, or so.

Is you know: crime continues to be up locally and that's primarily burglaries and felonious assaults and those felonious assaults are primarily domestic violence or abuse, but mary and latanza will cover that in the public safety committee report they met last night.

I went personally today to visit about the five or six schools in the area of the shelter so between glendale middle village, and we have implemented a plan to have a police presence as much as we could.
Felony assaults are up mainly due to Covid-19 everyone being in the house together, getting tired of each other and, like you said, most of those are closed out to an arrest, either by patrol officer.
