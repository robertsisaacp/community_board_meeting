My first name is king If you know what he wanted to report, you can report that later for us Thank Visual meeting of community board 5 Queens will open with, as usual, the pledge of allegiance donald First order of business tonight is someone's, got to sign their sound on or making noise.
The numbers are updated every day, so for Queens itself, Queens has 65 428 confirmed cases of those cases 26 or about 1737 people are hospitalized, have been hospitalized, There have been five thousand six hundred eight hundred sixty eight confirmed deaths and one thousand two hundred twenty two probable deaths as of today and Queens has 41 confirmed cases of misc As you all know, new york city is in phase three of the reopening All new yorkers should get tested for covert 19.
Personal care establishments are open, real estate, retail, which is limited to curbside or in-store pickup or drop-off, retail rental, repair, cleaning, vehicle sales leases and rentals and wholesale trade non-essential worker workers not included in phase 1, 2 or 3, are directed to work from home with phase 3 We also have open outdoor recreational activities such as basketball, bocce handball, tennis, volleyball courts, dog runs new york, city, public and private beaches for swimming new york, state park, beaches for swimming playgrounds and public and private outdoor pools These are now open and recently the board of health allowed child care centers to reopen on monday july 13th The centers do not have to open if they feel uncomfortable In order for them to be open.
Child care, centers must have new york city permits and attest to the following: No more than 15 children per room base, coverings for staff and children, daily health screenings, frequent cleaning and disinfection and limited sharing of items, including toys.
It does cost money I'm, not sure which models will be open, but The requirement is there and since we can't dine inside the city is expanding restaurant seating options in order to keep new yorkers safe So, we have sidewalk seating, curb lanes, heating backyard and patio city, and the open streets will be active from friday from 5 pm to 11 pm and saturday and sunday from noon to 11 pm If I could ask a question, there's been a lot of discussion about false positives and false tet negatives, on the testing So for the Covid-19 19 testing itself, if you're getting the regular, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, the test is relatively accurate and you know we need to conduct additional testing That's a concern that we definitely have you know we're offering free coping 19 testings so that new yorkers can get tested as frequently as possible if they want to higher heat.
But obviously you know: wyckoff pediatrics were right on the border of ridgewood and bushwick So, it's in the plan to be able to do more outreach into Queens You do realize there is nothing between wyckoff and jamaica hospital or saint john's episcopal This whole community board five area is barren and we rely on wyckoff to help us So. That's why I was thrilled when gary accepted the invitation for me to be able to spread the knowledge about this program very good, any other questions.
I, don't know if you want to talk about his situation, what he put forth first or no 'll so police officer, bearish, michael barish who's, one of the two community affairs officers for the 104th police precinct and said he hopes everyone is doing well Some information and updated crime stats for the past 28 days here in the 104 precinct, rape was up by one incident.
As far as his report goes, I do I just wanted to know if there's any statistics on the homeless, shelter what's going on there, a lot of rumors where is hold on a second, let me just kathy massey you've been dealing with that you have anything to say about it.
I've requested that we have another meeting in august, not wait three months, because all the problems that we brought up to them, if they're not corrected we're going to wind up with a larger problem, given schools open in september and there's no program, the only programs they're doing and everything they're blaming everything on the coronavirus Therefore, they can't do job counseling, job training, They can't do group anything and basically, whatever we brought up to them, and we questioned what programs they have basically were concerned that they were not addressing the alcohol and substance abuse issue which we've seen quite a bit of and their response to that is, they will refer people to a medical professional, all right so for the next meeting, you'll have a full report for us and give you a report at the end of this meeting.
The next item under my report is well I'm, going to skip around a little bit so before I get to the elected official I've been reviewing the outline from d-cass and the mayor's office on what needs to be done to restore full-time or and or part-time use.
Do you know what kind of filters we're going to be able to use at the office?, Don't think the average system in any facility, including a mall, can't support hepa filters right so and the governor said that was going to be a problem, probably So. For instance, at white golf heights, medical center we've installed ultraviolet systems into ductwork It's we looked at that we had when we had the ultraviolet cleaning of the office that cost us 850 dollars to do about five hours of ultraviolet light.
You said you got holden's report Okay from the office of robert holden, hello, neighbors, community board, five members and fellow elected officials.
Please do not hesitate to call 718-366-3900 or email district 30 at councilnycgov my office anytime, when you need assistance As. 2021 budget After much I voted no to the proposed budget due to the fact that it included one billion dollars in cuts and reallocated funding from the NYPD These cuts will result in the over in the school safety division being moved under the authority of the department of education, overtime, hours being cut, and the cancellation of at least one police academy class I believe these cuts will be damaging not only to the morale of our police but to the overall public safety of our city, which is why I could not vote in favor Now that the budget has been passed.
We are also working to bring a long-term code testing site the district So going back to the correspondence we received from the mayor's office in d-cass, about operations remotely and during this crisis, one of the items they determined there was that if there is no regulations in our bylaws for voting remotely, we need to vote to permit that Mr giordano, would you read off the results of the elections and then I'll take a motion to ex to accept the vote.
That are offered by the city, state and federal government, as well as non-profits We've shared the resource guide with cb5 and we'll continue to share the guide with the public Please do not hesitate to call our office We will call you right back, thank you and be well from assembly member brian bondwell, and that's what I have as far as elected official statements where we might as well give your report.
If that could possibly be done of people coming from many other states and I just wish that people throughout the country would take the initiative to just keep social distance and realize the importance of wearing masks, because those numbers didn't come down in new york, city and new york, state I think marianne latanzio is going to give a public safety report, but I'm certainly concerned about a lot of the violence that has taken place, especially with regard to the tremendous increase in shootings in the city of new york that have resulted in numerous murders.
The committee voted in favor of sending a letter both to mayor de Blasio and to the head of the new york city council, corey johnson, explaining why we are where we are against the funds in the police department and what is needed to is better training of police officers to dis-escalate situations.
This month after the public safety committee met, it was learned that 104th received seven new offices from the academy crime stats in the 104 crime is up 28 in the past two years in 104th precedent and 17 year-to-date felony assault from 66 percent year-to-date, burglary, up 83, year-to-date robbery, up 22, year-to-date officer, bearish, stated burglaries up during the pandemic graffiti becoming a big problem.
The committee must discuss fireworks being out of control both in 104th in new york city officer.
