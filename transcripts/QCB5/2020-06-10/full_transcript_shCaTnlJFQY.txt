To give us an update on the fire, therefore, I have word Clippers with their backyard on Amazon. So what [Applause]? We have what's happening right now required sensing [Applause] [Applause] children associated with co19, it's characterized by serious inflammatory conditions such as Kawasaki disease and a toxic shock syndrome. Most children have several days of fever, along with other symptoms such as irritability of Domino pain and vomiting, Steve care. If your child has a fever for several days plus other symptoms and go to the hospital or call 911 one. This emergency I asked for testing all New Yorkers should get tested for whether or not you have symptoms or at increased risk. Immigration status will not be asked and cope in. Nineteen testing and care services are not a public benefit on a charge. Roll repeat, testing should be offered if you have : 9, : 19 symptoms. If you're concerned, by a positive, all possible exposure, including spending time in large crowds and explore there, someone with a confirmed or positive :, 19 or breaches and wearing a face covering or new team distancing. All New Yorkers who participate in recent protests should assume that they were exposed to over 19 and get tested. The state is prioritizing 15 testing sites across the city for individuals who participate in protests. The city has a more than 240 locations that offer free walking, testing for more information visit, nyc.gov, slash, kovin testing or call. If you want to find the location near you and the city is also launching mobile testing drops this week, New York City, antibody testing will reopen in July your doctor's office, City, MD or other urgent care facilities may offer antibody testing. All positive results may occur, it's possible that you did not have hope in 19 and anybody's detective work from an infection with the related virus. A positive test does not mean that you are a musical with 19 or that you can't get it again. It is important that you continue to follow physical, distancing and the hand and hand hygiene recommendations. All New Yorkers must wear a face covering and stores can now refuse entry to individuals to not have face coverings so but people who are less than 2 years of age and people with breathing problems or another health issue that makes them unable to tolerate face covering do not need to wear a face covering that they mean to provide documentation. Let's see as for the dressing connecting disparities, the top 10 zip codes with new : 19 hospitalizations are in communities of color in the Bronx Brooklyn and Queens, and New York City is prioritizing resources for these impacted, zip codes. New York State is opening 14 new temporary testing sites at churches located in communities that were hit hardest by : 19, and it is done in partnership with northwell health and so most Community Care. The insurance deadline has been extended at once again, so in New, Yorkers, with that health insurance can apply through New York state of health through a June 15. If you lost coverage from an employer, you must apply within 60 days. Blood donations are greatly needed. Due to this crisis. Both donations have dropped off, so the New York Blood Center is collecting whole blood plasma and if you were diagnosed with : 19 or if you tested positive and antibody testing, you can donate convey lease and plasma. That's in great need, visit, NYBC, DOT, org or call one eight hundred nine, three, two five six to make an appointment. Vaccinations are also essential to protecting kids and communities. Free vaccinations are available or 1000 New York City facilities by the vaccines for Children Program are active, they're also available in health broski health clinics families can call 8/4 for NYC - for NYC to make an appointment that eccentric near them was phase one New York City can now resume elective surgeries and ambulatory care yeah. That's it for me, that's it for my update. So please let me know if any questions. Thank you for your time. Anybody have any questions. Raise your hands or frightfully. I got to turn the mic on for Fred. Excuse me: I have a question where we detestation for this for 819 I'm from result by wanker final Rickles. Is there any locations where you could send the people? What this is tell everybody who you are first, it's true, so we got to help you with answer that question. Wyckoff is planning on playing somehow testing in the neighborhood. So when we find that information out I'll give that to you quick Jay, do you know any city locations as for this community for CB 5 I do not have a list of locations at hand, but let me see if I can pull it up right now. Give me a second. You may want to look over the border, -. Ok, any other questions, while he's looking at up Fred hold on hold on hold on Fred heavily first good Fred speak Fred, yeah, New, York, State DMV is engaging in limited services that are only a little drop-off starting June 1st and June 4th. They plan to resume in-person transactions when phase 3 comes over I'm, not sure when that's gonna be DMV. Locations in different counties on upstate and also in LA on NASA can suffer. Nassau and Suffolk are engaging in business for more information. Please visit the MV DOT NY govt. They have their office locations and their policies listed out. Very detailed I actually had to look it up myself, since my license will expire in two months. Well, I would recommend going up to Westbury. The lines are always smaller into people at night. Nicer, yes, they're, not conducting any in-person transactions right now. So if you need to change your title or you know, license plates or some returned license plates and so forth, you would have to all their guidance on the website as for license renewals, if you're trying to switch it to a real ID. That requires an impressing transactions and that is currently suspended. Anyone else, Lee Hanson Lee had a question in it. Yes, hi I heard you talk about the antibody testing and I was one. What the purposes is because, if being having n divided is doesn't mean that you can't get it again and if you get false positives and false negatives, then what's the purpose to be tested for antibodies yeah. Thank you for your question arm. So it's to find out if the, if the patient or the subject was exposed to cover 19. So when antibody testing was first implemented, it was to gather statistics on the general exposure rate of the New York City population, as well as a state. Now we're trying to do that too, to see if antibodies are offering protection, because this is a this is a very new disease, and you know science has progressed to the point where we're able to you know, create testing methods and create antibiotic mint and then whatnot we're not there yet so we're trying to figure it out. So the antibody testing is all you offered again: New York City in July, but I mean guidance, is still pending. So I wish I hope to give you a more clear answer in the coming weeks: okay, cool! Thank you one thing: if everybody would press on participants- and it comes up on the right-hand side and on the bottom, it says raise hand if you want to speak hit. That would you, okay, so who else wanted to speak? Kathy some skis next hi Kathy, hello, Ken Kathy, we lost you. Kathy do kill me now, yes, okay, sorry I was just curious with these demonstrations. What's going to happen in the next couple of weeks, is there any? You know word on that being that you know, we've had thousands of people when we came down from the curb now walking the street since yelling, and that can cause the disease to spread among other protesters concerning matter, especially for someone who is elderly and going to come in contact with some of these protesters and not even know it. Thank you for your question. It is a big concern of ours. We saw the various jurisdictions saw their numbers on go up after the Memorial Day weekend, and it hasn't been two weeks since the protests started in week and a half ago. We, as the health department, did release guidelines on public protest, but once again these are guidelines and people. You know if they're tearing up their health, they should follow them. We urged protesters to wear, face coverings, wear eye protection, use hand, sanitizer do not yell, you sign the noisemakers. Instead, stick to a small group keep six feet from other groups, but, as we all know, all the parties are involved in the protest protesters and of you know, police officers and other individual alike. They abide by our recommendations, so we're hoping that the case numbers don't go up. We're conducting aggressive surveillance with them with the hospitals and medical providers, and we have our fingers crossed, but our guidance, our guidance. Is there who's that Peggy? Did you press the button let's raise and that what's up? Okay, so pick one I'm just going the order they came in to me and now it's not up again Peggy. Well, it says raise hand. Now it is right. Click on pick raise hand, lower hand, means put it down, I know, but it's been pressed raise hand. Don't then you, but then you're pressing lower hand to put it back. No I'm, not it says, raised, and it's that's what's showing okay, which means you have to click it. So that the hand is up. Let's help, that's the command. I, don't have a hand, symbol, Neely, says raise hand down just speak, Peggy go ahead. All of this, just how reverting to the DMV my license expired in May I had applied in April I just got a call correspondence from that processing. It though they are doing something by me. So put the slide up, they said, don't worry about. It was extended. Anything that expired. March 29th is automatically extended, whether it's a license to build buildings, a license to drive or whatever wait until you get it back saying that they are working. Thank you. Okay, mark who's. Next ed, oh sorry, hi Vidya, I, signed in a little bit later. I just want to know. I was here, I returned to work. Two weeks ago, Tuesday May 26th I was tested two weeks before that, both for the antibodies and for the corona virus. The two tests I was negative at worked, though, unfortunately, several people passed, we have people that have the antibodies that were positive and we had people that were sick from the virus. So there is what you would say: I wear the mask. There is PPE, you know to sanitize. They tried to put up barriers and distancing. My question is how, with my underlining health issues at my age and I still add a high risk to catch the virus, even though I can do I can do only to protect myself but going into the subway going onto the bus going into work. I killed that you know it's possible, you know, I can catch it. Even though I was exposed since March to the virus. Until I was sent home to quarantine because they've reduced you know the workforce and to ride out the virus itself. I don't know if it's a lucky thing or if having the who shot in October gave me some type of protection against this version of what would be a flu, but a more you know, deadly version. If you should wind up catching it so J, yeah question influence is caused by a family of Windsor viruses and :. 19 is caused by a specific strain of corona virus so that so it's a bit different but having a flu shot is always good and I'm asked for it. Exposure to SARS coffee to the virus that causes cope in nineteen everyone's experience is different. Some people- may you know they may have been a I'm asymptomatic. Some people may have a team down with symptoms more severe than others, so I asked for that. If we're every person is different, but it is a certain. It is a big risk. As for minimizing your potential exposure to SARS, Kobe to and just cold in nineteen in general, the state and the city have been. You know: releasing these guidelines and different orders in order to minimize to whatever risks that may be I mean we understand that public transit is a necessity. We understand that in-person transactions in certain cases are necessary city to so we're asking businesses and individuals to take all appropriate precautions as much as possible. As for the possibility of you not catching again, we're not sure we're not sure if an individual can come down with it again, we're not sure if the individuals mean permanently or immune for a certain duration, maybe six months, maybe a year. Who knows we're still trying to figure that out and we're releasing information as them they become verified. So yeah. Sorry, for that we have to keep going here. Folks, Beach Demetriou: what do you have to say two things one. There was a question asked about testing, so the New York State Department of Health will test you at their locations by appointment. I the number in the chat that you would call you call you do an intake. They take questions, they answer questions you give answers. They then call you back a day or two later and they schedule your appointment wherever they're testing, Stony Brook, University aqueduct, those with two locations at the New York State Department of Health, was testing. So I did put the numbering in the numbers. Eight, three, six, four, three: zero: six: five, that's just a colon: that's not the antibodies! It's just for covert. They do it in your car. You drive up in your car and they there's a whole process. It's really run well and it's works. So you had anyone wants a cold boot test and they don't know where to go. They can get the New York State Department of Health a call and they will get you your results. Roughly within three to five days after you're tested going back to che, you had said that it's unclear whether people can contact or get Cobra a second time, and that is understandable because the virus is so knew. What the question is now there any records kept to identify people who have gotten it twice since the outbreak, and if not, is the city prepare to monitor that so that we know whether or not it is or can be contracted a second time, I believe that HIPAA laws on hospitals and medical providers are supposed to retain this information for seven years yeah. So they stated they retain the case information for the individual for seven years and considering that Cove in nineteen is a reportable disease, we would have information, but it would not be open to any other parties, except for the medical provider and the patient themselves and yeah. Hopefully, hopefully, we don't get an instance of someone. You know catching in a second time or you know and so forth, but if that occasion does arise on, we will find out. Well, I only ask that, because what we don't want is people like my who have had it and have dealt with it, to think that we're safe and I don't take that approach. Trust me, I, don't I, take the approach as if I never had it, because if you ever want, if you ever have it you'll know, trust me and it's not. It's not fun and it's very dangerous, as we all know so. I just want to make sure that the people who have had it don't take the approach. You know I got a free pass here. I could do what I want. So that's why I was concerned that we should highlight that if it becomes an issue for a second, you know as the second time go around. That's all I'm, saying I, don't think it's necessary to know who had it a second time but I think it's important that we identify that and publish that information so that people all people will be concerned and take the right, the forces of social distancing and everything else. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I'm really thankful for your commentary because know no one is perfectly safe from this, and people should take all the appropriate precautions and we're trying to push the messaging out. But people are people so we're trying to do the best we can, but we'll try harder and very glad that I'm you and your family have recovered trade. Our two things is that a palm tree behind Marion come on, that's not fair and that small business 800 number I didn't have my and I wasn't ready for. Could you give it to me again? Yes, it's one, eight hundred, seventy two, seven, four, six, nine, two Thanks, okay, so Ken! Who can we can't hear you must have a problem with your microphone because you're not muted, all right, we'll get back to you when you figure that out Mary Ann, a Plan, C, Oh, Mary, Ann, hello, yeah, the parts and social distancing not being enforced and, as you all know, like a plane's about juniper Valley pas about how people are on top of each other and the police. Tell me they're, not responsible school safety. All is put there just to sit in the car and they're telling me they can't talk to anyone any encouraged to be social distancing, and yet we have people playing soccer and on top of each other one who is it? Who is to enforce it and to how we're gonna get a handle on covert 19 if we're not enforcing social distancing in all public places in our parks, okay, I. Don't think you can answer but try it. This is a concern that comes up from different communities as well. So this enforcement of social distancing is now under the purview of social distancing ambassadors well, they're, not enforcing they're, telling people to back off and they're, also giving our face mats and educating them. That's under one of the deputy mayor's office, but asked for the parts itself. This responsibility falls on their parks enforcement. Unfortunately, the parks manager is not here today but I'm out, bringing up the issue with him, and you said: juniper Valley Park right absolutely. Yes, all right, then I'll flag it up to mr. Simmons. Okay, so be Laura. Are you out? There I saw your name Laura. No, yes, no! Okay! So before you call the roll call I want to know who Mary Ann Rivero is yeah.

Thank you and it's a pleasure to join the community board. Thank you and welcome. So two members have elected not to renew pepper dates in hand Connie Santos, so that will eventually get you all the listings of the members and everything else and in new members, your beginning of package describing different things and asking what you're interested in and at some point in time the executive committee will appoint you to committees with that I'd like to go continue with the public forum. Mr. Jordano, do you have any items in the public forum? I do just bear with me city. Can you hear me yeah? Okay, do you want to read the police report? Then? Okay, I'll do that. Well, I was going to do that on to the Chairman three four okay I'll! Do it now so I'm, sorry, folks, it's rough doing this back and forth so officer, barish community affairs officer reported to us that first off, you did all of us to congratulate the commanding officer, Victoria Perry, who was just promoted to Deputy Inspector and as far as the we, the statistics go in a for the last 28 days. Rape is down by four robbery down by two felony. Assault is up by one burglary is up seven and that's mainly because of all the businesses that were closed and exposed to vandals and burglars. Grand larceny is down by eight and grand larceny. Auto is down by three. The various protesters that were mentioned within the kind confines at 1:04 were basically peaceful. That was on two dog Avenue tune of the park on the perimeter. The only one that was a problem, as I mentioned earlier, was over at Queens Center Mall. Thank you, Gary Benny, just to expand on crime status. At the end of May year-to-date, we were up significantly from 2019 to 2020 in the 104 17.5 1 percent year-to-date crime increase. So for the past few months it's been good, but robbery is up 22 percent year today, felonious assault is up, 70 percent burglary is up. 81 percent year-to-date rape is down 64 percent, so just to kind of clarify over the longer haul, so to speak. Citywide crime is down as of May 31st 2.4 6% citywide, but our precincts been up. Ok, thank you. So what do you have loved in a public forum? We got something. Hang up. Hang on one second Gary Richards I fell them as his hand up that should be you, but right, you're, muted, Ritchie. Just speaking regarding the crime stats, the numbers you just reported Gary all seem to be somewhat significant. Anything over 10 percent is greater than anomaly, in my humble opinion, and all of the crimes that you're speaking of are serious quality of life issues and, in my personal opinion, I think this has to do with bail reform and emptying the jails. That's just my thoughts, and hopefully these things can be addressed going forward as we get back to a so-called new normal. Thank you very much Gary, and thank you all for your time. Thanks, rich, ok, mr. G, all right, so we got something from the American Red Cross, stating the American Red Cross across the regions of New York State have developed a program in response to Cobra 19 to support individuals and families who have lost family members to death as a result of COBIT 19. The program will link crisis counselors with families to provide emotional and spiritual support, as well as targeted short-term case management to assist with navigating through the challenging processes that might be faced with as a result of a death. This might include challenges with moving the family members body through the hospital, nursing home medical, examiner and funeral home systems in this time, when those systems may be overwhelmed and their processes may be different than they normally are. They may also include linkage to leave legal resources for state custody, immigration or other issues related to the death, and then they say the following links to an online intake form can be submitted by a family member, a friend who thinks someone needs help or an agency on behalf of the family for those without access to the needed online technology. The phone number will link the caller to an intake person who will assist with the initial steps for getting assistance. The phone number is five, eight, five, nine five, seven, eight one, eight seven. The program is expected to operate for as long as families will benefit from the service or through the month of September. Thank that's the only one right we've got a few things in writing. I, don't hear their elected officials yeah. No, but I'm, saying I have a few things that were received today that look like they wanted to have them as part of the public forum. Okay, I, don't have them but go ahead. A woman named Carrie Herlihy says that she's a resident of Ridge Road on Cypress Avenue and she speaks about as the city opens up. She thinks buses are critical to get the city back running as we see essential workers take busses at a high rate and many residents, including herself, feel much safer in a bus than in a subway underground. Oh, she said she's very happy with the bus lane we already have on Fresh Pond Road, so she wants to prioritize ensuring that enforcement is taken very seriously. She calls it resurfacing the idea of expanding the length of the hours like originally proposed for the transit system and then asking if we can push for more bus lanes, the curbside compost collection is suspended. Do we have any updates and cuts to the police transportation issues will be discussed in committee, we'll try and find out from sanitation or the mayor's office. Actually, when they're going to reinstitute curbside recycling or composting anything else, yeah from Kelly Mancuso owns a small salon in Ridgewood used to be a reporter for the river times, but not being able to open since Cove in nineteen she's having trouble with her landlord yeah, well I'm trying to evict her and is looking for better protection. Let's get Ted and Angela involved in that please yeah and then Vinny without reading them and I'm not sure they wanted them to go to.

Okay, I think it's the last one councilmember hold right: councilmember Holden, and this is signed by the councilmember, hello, neighbors community board, five members and fellow elected officials. I hope that you were all staying, safe and healthy and I. Thank you for your continued work and volunteerism as we navigate this challenging year together. Our city is now beginning to reopen businesses as the spread of Cobra 19 has slowed dramatically, and that is thanks to all our collective efforts to practice. Social distancing, wear, masks and practice. Good hygiene says that their office in Middle Village remains closed, but the staff and I gladly continue to serve our constituents every day. We're working from home. Please do not hesitate to call seven one: eight three: six: three 900 or email district 30 at Council, DOT, NYC govt, which is their office anytime. You need assistance. The City Council has continued work over the past month to hold remote hearings and US legislation related to the Cova 19 pandemic and other topics. During the most recent stated meeting, councilmember Holden says he voted no 1 a bill that will create a local conditional release commission with all members appointed by the mayor, to identify possible candidates for early release from incarceration. He says he also voted against a bill that bans the use of the word alien in city documents and regulations says it is we consider legislation related to police reforms. I am not in favor of large cuts to the NYPD budget, as our officers need the proper resources to do their jobs, while the rates of several major crimes have risen in 2020. The councilmember says that he's also continued work on the local level to always improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods. After advocating since March for the residents of the Cooper Avenue homeless, shelter to be moved into hotel rooms during the pandemic, the Department of homeless services finally informed me that it will be doing so this week. In addition, the city recently launched its text to 9 1 system, after several delays, which will give domestic violence victims, the heart of hearing and others who can't call 911 1 the ability to contact the authorities safely during an emergency. This was one of my priorities as chair of the Technology Committee and I'm, proud that New Yorkers can finally utilize this service. While we can't boost your attend host or attend many events. These days, councilmember Holden says his staff and I have organized a pair of mask giveaways outside their office, where we donated thousands of massive bottles of hand sanitizer to the local community. He says we have also donated a mess and sanitizer to our local cemeteries and food pantries, and he recently took part in a pet food giveaway for people who have lost their jobs due to Co vat19 going forward. Councilmember says we'll continue to provide all the help we can to our community during this time. Now that the city has entered the first stage of reopening he's, confident that we can fully reopen in the coming weeks, if we continue to do our part, it says his staff and he welcome any and all questions who can sign. So please do not hesitate to contact us I. Look forward to seeing all of you soon, my knowledge of any that is thank your elected officials, so that I think that's all I. Have anyone have any questions or comments to the chair person? If not Robert Chameli is hand up Bob ix thanks Gary. Do you have any new statistics on the census? I know last time it was like 47% and we go further I, don't think it's much better! Okay! You know we just everybody's kind of realized. How important this is. We could lose to two seats. The response in Queens and in portions of the board five area has been below 50%: okay, Fred Halla, Fred aller, yes, up, Fred I got it. The telephone number given earlier in the meeting was given with an 800 number. Gary gave it correctly. It's eight seven, two, seven, four, six, nine to nine 800 to call the 800 number. They try to sell you a lifeline. Okay, thank you. Reaching your hand is up yes, I, just like to say, I've been saying for the last few meetings that we're going to lose two congressional seats and I have a friend who just got a job with a moving company. He said he is got more business than he could ever imagine. People are fleeing this state like rats from a sinking ship, as I have been saying, and the income and the taxes that are going to be forced upon us to balance this budget are gonna, be astronomical and it's just gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Sorry to say: please everyone stay safe. Thank you. Thank you anything else for the chair. If not we'll do the inn mr. Jordano, to report okay. So as far as capital projects goes, one of the things we've been waiting for quite some time, it was supposed to I believe started. March is the reconstruction of the turf soccer field, slash football field and the running track at juniper, Valley Park, so I did some inquiring and Dennis Stefan was good enough to keep after me about this, and the response I got today from the Queen's team leader for capital projects is that they're saying that the parks department will likely be pushing the order to work date. Back again, the Office of Management and Budget has not cleared the agency to begin new construction projects. Apparently, they've got a couple of projects that construction has continued on if, for some reason they were deemed emergency projects, I don't know how many I think seven and then, as far as the local sewer projects goes, one of the board members said I think it was Walter. Clayton dead, penelope Avenue has been resurfaced so the last legs of that project after the installation of some very big new sewer lines, which should provide a lot of capacity to prevent future flooding in that Penelope Avenue 74 area was the resurfacing of Penelope Avenue and the resurfacing of 74th Street. So it's Penelope Avenue from 71st Street to 74th Street and then 74th Street from juniper, Boulevard south to Juniper, Valley, Road and, as I've said before, I think this was a twenty plus million dollar a sewer project at community board. Five pushed very hard to secure funding for the other big sewer project. That's going on now on board in the community board. Five area is on calamus Avenue, which is our border with Woodside and boy too, and it's not too much of it is on calamus from like 69th Street, -, 7, th, Street and then they're going up, 7 th Street, with a very big new sewer line, some of which is going to be micro, tunneled up to 60 feet down, I believe at least, and it's going to go along 70th Street into 71st Street to the Li e they're moving along quite well with that project put in a new sewer line and calamus and/or this week are working on that and they need to make a very big connection along 69th Street to go from calamus Avenue into Queens Boulevard, so that projects moving along real good beef, water, main project and Troutman Street and surrounding streets in Ridgewood. It's Troutman, Street trunk. What a mane from Flushing Avenue to Cypress a lower portion of Cypress Avenue and along hemorrhoids treated well as well, and that project seems to be moving along real well cherry. The city in peace in our area has done a lot to upgrade water and sewer some of it with our Bush in the case of Troutman Street. It's an example of, in my opinion, how the city consistently replaces water main, probably sooner, is actually necessary. Just to be prudent before you go any further. Kathy Massey had your hand up. Yes, very I know he lives up on today and I just wanted to ask you: is there anything that you can do to push the opening of the turf fields that Maurice, because we've been close, that just increases about the volume of people at the other parks like tonight running field is Walton Roy well, I have a question that I thought all the box of clothes. Why is anybody in them? Parks are not closed. Playgrounds are closed. Well, if you take a ride too far as pop John, they have open streets at Forest Park. Many, it's a great place. It's open, the playgrounds are all closed. Some parks that are access points to playgrounds are also then shut off, like rosemary playground, star Street playground. Those parks are completely shut off because they have kind of open space. Playgrounds right, principie park is closed entirely, but people are on the turf fields. Every day tables are not closed. Okay! Well ask for clarification, going missing, teeth! Yeah! That's all I have right now! Okay, so with that will go to committee reports, and the only committee I have is economic development. Ted? Are you there yeah just give me a second? Maybe you want to think yeah give me now? Yes, okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna, take myself out of you, because I have notes and I don't want to be rude and not and look out while talking to you so give me a second to stop the video wait. How come it's not going off? Okay, so thank you very much. So, basically, speaking since stupid and pandemic began, I guess the end of last third week in March about 70% of Myrtle Avenue was probably shut down, because Myrtle Avenue was a major comparison, shopping strip with retailers. You know service that would retail, like clothing furniture stuff, like that children's wear and of the other 30% that was mostly restaurants, delis other businesses, like Liberty department, store hotel, closeout, heaven and other extreme, which were like discount stores they served and enough of essential items like sanitizing and toilet paper, and food and stuff like that they were got an exemption and were also considered essential businesses. Probably about a month ago, almost every restaurant and eatery was open. One thing that was unusual was most Chinese. Takeout did not hope only to in the district were open from the get-go and most did not open until about two weeks ago and some are still shut, so that was that was a story so also since the pandemic began, the bid continued essential services because we provide essential services clinging at horticulture and landscaping and they concentrated on sanitizing, the Muny meters and others furniture. We locked up the furniture in the 71st Plaza, so people couldn't congregate and we started moving graffiti and we still have a ways to go. There was a tremendous top tech in graffiti, not only on Myrtle Avenue, but throughout the district during the pandemic, we've worked remotely from home, but I was on the street at least once or twice a week, driving down to see what conditions and seen there's anything to report to the either to the police or to the SPS. Let me see over. Let me see what else is my notes here. Oh I also during this course talked to a number of landlords and merchants, and many loyalists told me that a lot of people weren't paying rent and that actually, the smaller mom-and-pop stores were calling and saying, I can't pay. Rent I can only pay half I can just I can do this and they wanted to work something out, whereas the big guys, the major chains haven't paid them rent since April, May and I, don't know about June, because June just started so also a number of our restaurants. We have a member of our own flock Rudy's bakery who, in addition to being opened and starting a community, donated much pastry and food to Wycoff, Heights, Medical, Center and to first responders a number of other eateries I. Think did that also so a shout-out to heart. For that we were fortunate, of course, not to the Saint any damage from the unrest that's going on and must met in other parts of the city. We only had two stores that boarded up their property and one remains. As you know, we went into phase one beginning Monday and we were in the office today, because Gary also mentioned we got ten and mass delivered to us on Friday we've already doled out about 2,000 about half a tows actually came from other businesses since we're on a list. We got a business from ozone park flushing and a few other areas that wanted our masks and we are. We sent out a memo to our to our stakeholders and we're in a process over the next week, and we will probably exhaust that 10,000 by next week. I, don't know, there'll be another round coming from SBS and we heard through the grapevine there may be sanitizing and gloves that might follow. Also, so that's on ad note what I've noticed a number of businesses on the Avenue and primarily the major chains as well as some mom-and-pop stores that could have opened Monday have as of not have not yet opened. We did an extensive surgery today, the staff of the entire district and I don't have the results of that tabulation because it came in about four o'clock in the afternoon, and I will share that with the community board. So now, moving on to and Antonio Knossos bill, which talks about outdoor seating, the hearing was last Thursday and I believe it will be on the stated, although I hadn't confirmed this yet I talked with dad with Daniel from councilman Holden's office. Who was a co-sponsor, and this bill was sponsored by Antonio Reynosa, who is our other councilman for our area and I want to thank both of them for supporting this I believe they're going to vote on this next Thursday and, of course, what this will do. It will allow outdoor seating when we go into the phase two, which will be sometime if everything goes well. The end of this month, first week of July there abouts we're already have been talking with d-o-t, which will be I, guess the lead agency- that's involved in this, because it will tie into their open streets, partial Street program and the plaza program. We of course have three plazas in the big district in Diddy Square, the Ridgewood Memorial triangle, under the auspices of the parks, department and 71st triangle. Both the 71st and in Diddy are under the auspices of Quixote, and we also have Glendale Memorial triangle under the auspices of d-o-t adjacent to stamp Tisch Antonio Reynoso invited me last week to a meeting of his board, one that talked about this build because they of course board. One includes Williamsburg, where there are many restaurants who were interested in this plan that we've doled out and I invited Hanson from and burner from staunchest George Dante sees restaurant Antoinette from Rudy's bakery and Bokashi from the nepalese restaurant to tie into this meeting and some interesting things were said and I, of course, told council member, and also that you know the city's great on rules and regulations. They really have to back off on this. If, as we move towards Phase two and the councilmen agreed with that, I also made the case that in the plazas we should waive the idea it's a public space. But in this particular situation this bill expires. October, 31st and I. Think restaurants, like stomp fish, the diner unbend it e-square, the restaurants on 71st, Plaza and even TRO and John's across the street, should be allowed to use parts of that Plaza for their exclusive seating and I sort of got the impression that and I had conversations with d-o-t and they told me they are on board with this and there they're going to be flexible about this, because I think it's very important to help our restaurants in this regard. So let me see what else they have here, as I saw, we've identified the bid as identified several areas that might be good for either partial or complete closure and, of course, our plazas Seneca revi might be a potential because we have three restaurants on that block. The Ridgewood memorial triangle might be a potential because they have several restaurants, not a two adjacent that on that plaza and two restaurants across the street. That might be able to avail themselves to this plaza as well as Venditti square, so we're, and we also have tasty restaurant as expressed interest. We might be able to close Center Street, take parking lanes and we already have the d-o-t bump out there. That marked the expansion to allow for better turning radius and Corrado. Pizza has also expressed an interest and it might be potential for taking spaces away to allow them to have outdoor seating, of course, that opens up another Pandora's box as we open up the edge people I think as a bid. We can work these issues out because we're all in this together to help each other out honor. Just another note: poor Karthik called me on Friday and alerted to me about an article guest article in The, Daily News storefronts suffer neighborhoods weep. It was by a architect from Sunnyside and basically it talks about. You know, as people boarded up and stores have been smashed. You know: we've worked for the last 15 20 years to get rid of roll-down gates and to open up our commercial districts as not only Ridgewood and our board, but citywide I fear that something like this might, you know backtrack and that we're gonna have a we're. Gonna have people wanting to keep their golden rules on gates, although there is that city rule that past five years ago that when you put a new gate up, it has to be 75 percent, lattice and clear so I think that's basically it we're looking forward to phase two and we're looking forward to you know getting out of this mess that we're in and coming into some kind of normalcy. So I'm gonna put myself back in if, as anybody wants to have any questions or have issues Paul, but one more thing during this time, Department of small business services engaged many of the bids into what we may do. What we may do to create a better climate for business and how we will get out of this and those ideas are being shared and will be shared by ESPN yeah Kathy. On me, there you go speak I, understand that the restaurants are still going to have to go through an application process for the outdoor dining, and that, of course, is going to go before the community board. So we're going to have to get creative and figure out a very efficient way to get that all on our end to prove quickly not you know, for month-to-month, we have to work on something as a board so that we're not the reason that these applications are being held up. It's I think we should handle it the same way. We do liquor licenses. If it's not controversial, we say yes or no. If it's controversial, we'll do a roll call outreach to the board members, no we'll do it quicker. Okay, like soon now electronic outreach, whatever it takes, yeah. Okay, all right, Richard I, just like to say yeah for this interim I, agree with Kathy, but let us not get a get into this idea of everything being virtual, because having a true face-to-face conversation and having the control of a live in presence meeting is the best way to discuss these issues so that, once this whole blue flu thing is over, that we can get back to normalcy of having those who are show up for the community board meeting. Are the participants and can discuss these matters properly. Thank you very much. Thank you anything else on that Ken yeah. Can you hear me yeah great yeah, I think with normally we always voted at our general meetings? Monthly. Maybe with this we should consider doing a weekly. Well see what happens. Yes, thank you, yeah! Well, okay, anything else, yeah you gotta push the button to raise your hand, look at what button I mean by it, so just to finalize some more thoughts about what I said. As we move to restarting I mean this is the time I think for all of us to you know we start we take a look at where we are in society and maybe, as we maybe policies that could changed and the time to look at I mean taxes are out of control. Rents are out of control, and maybe this is time to really come back and then see what we can do to like. Have a more equitable system. I, don't know, that's gonna happen soon, but I think it's worthwhile thinking about it's just food for thought, and you know businesses that got help from the city and I'm sorry from the federal government. We need to read, they still need help, and you know we don't I, don't know yet what our commercial strip Myrtle Avenue, let alone the rest. The area will look like and how many businesses we may lose I mean there's already chains that are filed for bankruptcy, major chains in the in the country, that file for bankruptcy, and we may lose a lot of our mom-and-pop stores and we need to help them because they are the backbone of our neighborhoods and of the economic climate that we have thanks anyway. That's we did it in 1975 we'll do it again? Absolutely we're not gonna here, dropped it to New York right, wait exactly! Okay, all right anything else. If not we'll go to the nominations before we do I need to read a letter from fat. Grayson is with regret that I am resigning from the committee board five Queens, due to ongoing medical issues that have confined me to their peuta CREZ identity. Time.

So we are the governing body so to speak, of the community board and everyone has an equal vote in equal participation at the executive committee meetings at lodge is just the goal of that lodge was to have someone representing every part every part of the district, so we have Glendale middle village, Maspeth Ridgewood. So those that were nominated we would cover the district. We would hope that when the election occurs, that its people are voted by and there's equal representation from all the areas of the district, so that at the executive committee there's fair judgment and meeting and decisions made, the me chair has a Santa.

So explain that we're only we're electing four out of one two, three four five, six seven eight, and how will we how you going to distribute the ballots? Well, why don't you explain that? Well, you end I'm trying to find it. That's look! Here's what we spoke about yeah you wanted them to be mailed to everyone correct and that would have to return it by mail or in person to the board office. We would mail them tomorrow or Friday and try. You know, I, don't know about the when we could get them back, because the mail is very haphazard, but mr. our Curie, if you want to go from there yeah, so they we will send out and it's actually it's going to be one ballot, because all the others were nominated but you'll have to sign for those anyway, we always have this signature, so we'll send out the ballot, those that were elected by acclamation and the six nominees for four positions. We will try to get them out, as gary said between tomorrow and friday, assuming that you get them next week, and let me get my calendar up, so I could speak from logic instead of mine. Well, assuming I get it by the 17th. We would expect you to fill it out and turn it around immediately, either by mail or delivery to the office mailbox in case no one's there still and that we would do the tabulation and if we have to have another vote because of ties or things like that, we'll follow up with that, so that we will then announce some time before or at the July meeting the results of the election to suggest that we email the ballots, because the mail is very I me email, the balance to us and let us print them out and fill them out. That's going to take a lot of time, because you know people who are not getting mail, I agree, but I can't print anything here. My two laptops that I work with every day, don't like my printer, so I can't and I assumed. Maybe other people are the same problem, we'll try and work it out how about two things: both mail we'll try and work it out. It's right. Happily, that was my recommendation as well to just email them to expedite things. Okay and Richard I just like to say it's kind of tough, because now that we have eight candidates, looking for four positions, I remember in years past, where we've had to go through, probably six or eight ballots till we had a 51% for the four open position, so yeah I agree that we should get email and that I would thank the board for staying on top of this to try and get this resolved before our next meeting. Thank you. That's our great step, we'll do that. Let's see who was next Michael Mike, poor chilly? Why are you thinking about use in the post office? You can do everything by email now how you gonna do a signature. I can't remember! You have to print your name and sign the ballot, and we have to have a signature on file that you voted. Okay hold on hold on I'll call the Eric yeah just stop because I know what everyone's talking about potential free email I just wanted to bring up. If it's a potential option, I know Google Forms is used a lot for asking ballots that might be out. I know you need a signature, we need the signature or there's a picture that can be uploaded with the ballot cast on Google Forms. If that is acceptable by the bylaws, it would be an immediate vote cast and the votes could be tallied immediately. So, but we don't know, we don't know who is receiving it and who's signing it right. So you sent over email and anybody could get. Anybody could get my email anybody could answer electronically. So that's why we need a real signature, and but you can attach a picture with a signature Eric. We need piece of paper all right, bring it up. Thank you appreciate it can your next. No, we need a signature. We need a signature period. Okay, who didn't stay here, dr. Goran doctor get that make yourself doctor. It goes the signs different ballets and electronically. You can sign there and send the form and it will be only for the person which that email expensive, but for other and one you can sign it Nevada. So there is. There is a purpose of this first time ever remote election. We still require a piece of paper with your signature on it. Yeah I do agree on those rather than actual signing. We can do electronic signing. Also an opacity No speak. You have two unmowed unmute Donald, okay lilia. Now you can easily sign a piece of paper here that I've received and scan and send it as a PDF. Then you can print out the PDF of your and very easily - and I'll have my signature on it. It's not an original signature right now. Until this whole situation is discussed illegally and everything else, we still need the hard signed signature. Thank you because no one in the city has figured this out. Let's see we had Richard, we had Fred Bob chameleon send the email, because I got a feeling. You're gonna have to do it, a I, don't think you're gonna get a majority at the first round of votes with eight people. Moving for you, I know, I, wouldn't wait for the next board meeting and I would do this as soon as possible start the voting you send the email out, get it back, we'll try to get to you. It will get back with the things and, if you don't have any vote, we're gonna have to go again with instructions. What to do understand what I mean Gary, yes, I think. So, if you don't get more 5050, you know you get something. That's a two to four people and you may get five people with the same vote or very close get a majority. They don't get. It voted in correct, go for another vote, I say again what faxing be acceptable? Would that be considered and original everybody doesn't have fax machines, but well if we can do various ways to get them to you, that's what I'm enquiring emails will probably come to us. I think everybody has most people have printers I think anything else is the same way and then we could print it out and then mail. It back chairman I'm, trying to make it clear. There's been no legal precedent for this. Yes, and no one could answer us in Borough, Hall or City Hall. So we need a hard real signature. Okay, hopefully spoke Laurie. You have something to say just quickly what Peggy was saying: our fax machine isn't working Verizon hasn't been out to fix it because of what's happening. I just want to say that it doesn't matter. We need until it's legally determined. We need a real signature, all right Ritchie. What do you have to say all I'd like to say is that most people on this board have a smartphone it for a matter of that you're, not listening I'm to you until it's determined illegally. We need a real signature period. Okay, thank you, you're welcome, Fred, heavily and then Fred Haller and then the email ballot to you when they emailed to us I'll print a copy, and you could talk to coordinate with Gary and Laura. Yes, thank you because I more than nominees I shouldn't be receiving them. Thank, You, Fred, Haller, I'm mute Fred, so those who receive the majority are in and then those who don't we drop the lowest and then we revote is that the standard procedure, whatever it's in a pile, oh no I'm, just asking the secretary- is that the standard procedure? Yes, it is okay. Thank you. Dr. Goran sure, in regards to the ballots, if it is not possible to email, maybe you could go to the committee bone office pick up ourself and a couple of days we're gonna get every bit of comedy that possible. Well, we're gonna, try an email them out, but we need the hard signature back. Yes, we'll probably be a combination of all three like Fred, said: delivering email and snail mail. So that's all gonna work out with Steph. You have to remember that staff has been cheating being in the office this week because we have not been released to be there by the city, but they've been there because of the elections because of the year-end close out on the financials and everything else. So we have to be careful. What we're doing? Thank you, John Mayer I'm, just making sure that there's a mail slot at the office. There is not all right, so maybe we'll go out and buy a mailbox and nailed it to the wall, we'll work it out, John. What they've been doing it was holding the mail at the post office for us to pick up and mr. Jordano has been picking up mail every day, I'm not going everyday very well. You were this displaced this past week, but that's besides the point. Okay Walter claim: unmute Walter. Can you hear me? Yes go ahead? Okay, since we don't trust the mail to mail, it out we're gonna, email, town rate, then we shouldn't be mailing, it back and I'm concerned with the mailbox. True two years, I've been slipping it under the door whenever I did the budget I used to slip it onto the door? Okay, thank you here we go yeah! Okay, thank you! Yeah mochi! Yes, you know, I didn't I, just I. Just put it up now to answer you because I wasn't speaking to you. Okay, thank you all right, so it is now nine thirty, nine forty do we have any old or new business, any old business, any new business, okay and I apologize to all the new board members for this total confusion, Kenny, where ken and Richie can you have to unmute? Is there any word on a date that we are cb5 is going to get together with Amazon and rent our plaza Gary? What the original plan was Gary sent out a couple of requests today, I, don't know if he got it response back. Gary I did I, don't know if I have it real handy I'll tell you what I, so you see that everything's boarded up over there or barricaded along Metropolitan Avenue and still from what I'm gathering they're putting in new sidewalks and they are going to put in at least two garages I believe they I think they've taken down the canopy where the entrance was for the pedestrians and I'm still quite sure, but I'm. Looking for a total confirmation that there are two new garages for smaller vehicles, I believe are going to be where the front pedestrian entrance was okay. Bridge on my Ritchie was first and in John. - I would like to say that I hope everyone stays safe in these difficult times and I'd like to make a motion to close this meeting and thank everyone hold on. We have two other questions: John Mayer, yes, Mary's information. Is it possible to get the plans on file or not because they had to put plans in that's a very good question, because it wasn't even essential construction so well, this construction is done now so and I mean yes, they did some demolition and stuff before the date filing plans. They could have done we'll, try and find out adlet. Oh yes, I just wanted to remind everybody. You vote make sure that you either go to the early voting site that you're assigned to. If you did, the absentee ballot request make sure that you sign the ballot envelope and only put the ballot inside the ballot envelope, and the third thing is also if you're waiting for the 23rd there are going to be some pulse I. That may not be open. There's several that are not gonna, be open because not the board, but because of the corona situation, so just check, vote DOT, NYC and follow what's on there, the latest information. So you need to clarify that this is only for Democrats, because there's no Republican, no conservative, no liberal primary rice is a Democratic primary period right and also it has the you know: district leaders, your committee people assembly, whatever EDA D you're in it, has specific for that area. So make sure that you vote for all the lines, because you won't, if you do it absentee the machine is not there to respect it, but you know you miss something: it's a very careful filling out those ballots and sign that ballot envelope. Okay, is there any other questions or comments, then it's a motion by Ritchie to in the meeting. Is there a second thank you Tony, all in favor, okay, again we'll try and keep everyone informed and get the balance out as quickly as possible. Thank you good night.
