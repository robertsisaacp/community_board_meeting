The first item of business tonight is a presentation on the proposed city-wide zoning text, amendment for coastal flood resiliency and an application from the New York City Department of City planning and Joy Chen.
Everyone I'm, going to share my screen now and give this presentation on zoning for coastal flood resiliency.
So again, good evening tonight, I'll be presenting a city-wide zoning text, amendment on zoning for coastal flood resiliency.
This is a city-wide text, change which applies to all 50 community boards throughout all five boroughs, and this plan would improve homeowners and business owners, ability to withstand and recover from storms and other disaster events, and it builds on a lot of collaboration with flood plain communities and it promotes post-disaster recovery with a focus on buildings and new building construction in the flood.
There's very little in board five, but there is like a tiny section around Newtown Creek in the Maz Pass industrial area that is prone to flooding, and this middle one shows Hurricane, Sandy, Storm surge and this red image to the right are future predictions for high-risk flood zone.
There's coastal strategies which uses strategies along the coastline like the sea wall as a first line of defense against flooding than their buildings along the floodplain, so that we can design future buildings with these new rules to withstand and recover from flooding, then infrastructure to protect from climate hazards.
Zoning text change, which I will summarize today during this presentation, is focused on buildings and on the building code and how zoning would help the buildings and new building construction within the flood plain become more resilient.
These rules would provide the option to design or otherwise retrofit buildings that are being built in the floodplain to reduce damage from flood to be more resilient in terms of like reconstructing after a flood.
And then also to potentially save on long-term flood insurance costs, and these rules that I'm summarizing here today would also set a framework for emergency situations, whether it be a storm like Hurricane, Sandy or like a pandemic, and there are some applications for Covid-19.
We can't make everything resilient all at once, but these rules would allow for incremental change over time and then the fourth goal is looks to the future and would help facilitate recovery by reducing red tape.
The yellow areas are rules available for buildings is in the one percent flood plain, as you can see, it's a very small area in board five in the Mazda Newtown Creek Industrial area, and then these proposed rules will be widened in terms of their applicability.
Rather than just being this tiny area, it's still pretty tiny, as you can see on the right, hand, side, but the lots that are within both the one percent flood plain and also the point.
What, wet floodproof means is basically, in a nutshell, is protecting spaces from water damage like wet floodproofing, different strategies that construction strategies where you would protect the you know basement and the ground floors from being flooded and from water damage, and so the new rules, on the right.
Okay, and the second goal is to support long-term resilient design of all building types and these building types range from detached houses, semi-detached houses, and the zoning rules would allow building owners to basically physically elevate their like living.
You know could be adopted to encourage active uses to be kept at the street level and to promote internal building access, and so these ground floors would be flood proofed and also the basement level would also be floodproof and.
I. Just want to remind everyone here at this point that the actual building code regulations are can be found in Appendix G of the New York City Building Code, so the New York City Building code, as you all know, regulates building construction, and there are rules that are already there in place if you're a building.
These new rules that city planning is putting out kind of these are a lot of them are optional rules that would apply so that property owners can adopt them.
Key spaces that are often located within basements or cellars, especially those that help support businesses such as offices or storage rooms, would be able to be located above flood levels.
Fourth goal is to facilitate future recovery by reducing regulatory obstacles and these obstacles, power, systems, accessibility, vulnerable populations and disaster recovery in terms of power systems and like electrical systems, Hurricane Sandy showed that areas affected by the storm went beyond the floodplain and that the regulations which would facilitate recovery would be useful for other types of disasters.
That would make it easier for properties to provide backup energy, especially in the event of a future disaster, and then in terms of accessibility, doing more like ramps and other you know to raise commercial businesses, but also have more accessible design.
You know it's very long process in terms of rebuilding after something like a disaster or storm, and the city is recommending rules that could be made available to facilitate recovery process from future disasters, some of which could be applicable or implemented to help address the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic effects.
You have until December 28th to give a recommendation and the zoning for coastal flood resiliency city-wide tax amendment is also being accompanied by local actions and zoning changes in these three different beach areas, one in Howard Beach in Queens and two other local zoning changes in Brooklyn.
Think Gary and Walter have the link to the full report and the full zoning tax change for the Postal Zone flood amendment as well, and I'm available for questions now and later.
You know to spend a lot of money right now to retrofit their existing business, but there are recommendations here, for especially if one day the concrete plant wants to make changes or expand their building, they would have to meet the new standards if they expand, enlarge or make any physical, construction.
You know design changes to their facility, so right, now, if they're at basically barge height to unload, sand, gravel cement.
They can use that are more cost effective, but you know the idea here is to to help property owners kind of protect their businesses and be more proactive and doing things that are not super expensive.
We the concern we have in the community if they can't transport sand and gravel on the creek, because they're 15 feet below the new elevation, it's going to require trucking in materials and that's additional traffic and transportation into our community, and that would be something you know detrimental to the area.
Again, it's not a requirement now, but it is something there are strategies within this report also that a lot of industrial businesses can look at and consider as they plan for the future.
It's going to be trucked in and out of the community, so I think we need to grandfather those facilities into the situation.
I'm, pretty sure that usually, when you know during zoning text changes once the city Council approves something.
It's good to know that very small area of community five is under flood zones.
Therefore, to protect this building and structures, I, don't know means what is the planning I was under the impression that there will be physical barrier wall constructed along the coastal line, so the flooding will not be increasing into the this low-lying area.
They would need to follow rules for the you know, technologies for like wet flood proofing and things that can help prevent the water from getting in or if it gets.
If you could send I guess at least the people on the zoning committee, the links both to the the industrial report and the residential recommendations.
I would just like to ask for that industrial resiliency link, because the link that you had in your presentation is coming up as as a broken link on the New York City government, site.
Mitigating construction on and in public, waterfronts and waterways should also utilize approaches and technologies that minimize impact on resilience, building ecosystems like oyster reefs and reduce conflict, with pre-existing environmental goals like the restore New, York, Shellfish, program, environmentally sensitive approaches and technologies that integrate natural and nature-based features into waterfront development and coastal protection should be an integral part of any waterfront.
The hospital continues to work closely with federal state and New York City authorities contain and defeat this virus restore our technical capabilities and transitions.
Good hygiene, the city Council, continues to operate remotely and our calendars have been filled with committee meetings and stated meetings as we continue to work on behalf of nearly 8.6 million New Yorkers.
This event showed us the need for e-waste recycling programs and my office will work with the administration and the department of sanitation to reinstate the city program for this Thursday at 6:00 p.m. So I guess.
I.e we or I, got something recently them looking for the community boards, okay, that being the department of design and construction to take away parking on Grand Avenue from 69th place to 72Nd street or 70.
They will be coming back to us in the spring of 2021 once they make some decisions on the environmental process and they would like to actually kind of meet jointly with us and Community board, one in Brooklyn, who is also impacted by this project as it is, it brings us both together, and so they can eliminate.
Our, chairperson, Mr Curie, was recommending something like a community group like the Kosciuszko Bridge, which would be beneficial for all the other major thing that's come up in the last two meetings is Wyckoff Avenue, which has a large plan for rebuilding from basically sidewalk to sidewalk or building to building I should say, and we have some ongoing questions about the contamination of the Wolf Albert site, which is a federally designated superfund site because of radiative radiation contamination, and it is within the bounds of some of this work.
I suggest if they want to know what is being asked, they should try driving a tractor trailer through a small space.
