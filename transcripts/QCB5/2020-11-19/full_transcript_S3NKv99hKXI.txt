The pledge of allegiance- thank you, everyone, who's joined us for this public hearing and board meeting of Committee Board five. The first item of business tonight is a presentation on the proposed city-wide zoning text, amendment for coastal flood resiliency and an application from the New York City Department of City planning and Joy Chen I believe is doing a presentation. Joy, yes, hi good evening. Everyone I'm going to share my screen now and give this presentation on zoning for coastal flood resiliency. Let me see everyone else, please mute and so joy doesn't get interrupted. Can everyone see the screen? Is it showing up? Okay, all right, great awesome. So again, good evening tonight, I'll be presenting a city-wide zoning text, amendment on zoning for coastal flood resiliency. Again this is a city-wide text, change which applies to all 50 community boards throughout all five boroughs, and this plan would improve homeowners and business owners, ability to withstand and recover from storms and other disaster events, and it builds on a lot of collaboration with flood plain communities and it promotes post-disaster recovery with a focus on buildings and new building construction in the flood. Plain close to a million New Yorkers live in the flood plain today and board. Five, thankfully, does not have a lot of residential uses in the floodplain, but it definitely is a risk that Hurricane Sandy awakened us all to in 2012. in 2013 and in 2015 following Hurricane Sandy. The city proposed and instituted rules that would help places like the Rockaways and other flood-prone areas recover from disaster. Storms and this these visuals show that the risk for flooding will actually increase over time with sea level rise, climate change and it will also be exacerbated by more frequent and powerful coastal storms. So the image to the left shows the one percent annual chance flood plain, which FEMA put out and you'll see all the blue areas along the waterfront are flood prone areas, there's very little in board five, but there is like a tiny section around Newtown Creek in the Maz Pass industrial area that is prone to flooding, and this middle one shows Hurricane, Sandy, Storm surge and this red image to the right are future predictions for high-risk flood zone areas. The city's overall resiliency strategy involves a multi-tier, complementary approach. So when we talk about coastal Zone and new development, there is a lot of different strategies that can be mandated to help make our waterfronts more enjoyable and safer. There's coastal strategies which uses strategies along the coastline like the sea wall as a first line of defense against flooding than their buildings along the floodplain, so that we can design future buildings with these new rules to withstand and recover from flooding, then infrastructure to protect from climate hazards and then our fourth strategy for residents and businesses. This zoning text change, which I will summarize today during this presentation, is focused on buildings and on the building code and how zoning would help the buildings and new building construction within the flood plain become more resilient. So the zoning for coastal flood resiliency would make temporary zoning rules adapted Post Sandy permanent. So the rules that I mentioned in 2013 and in 2015, which you can see here in these images, the recovery text and the flood text, is now being improved upon and would be basically set as new regulations and new standards. And these rules would provide the option to design or otherwise retrofit buildings that are being built in the floodplain to reduce damage from flood to be more resilient in terms of like reconstructing after a flood and then also to potentially save on long-term flood insurance costs, and these rules that I'm summarizing here today would also set a framework for emergency situations, whether it be a storm like Hurricane, Sandy or like a pandemic, and there are some applications for Covid-19. so for the proposal, I will touch upon four goals in this short presentation, and these four goals are shown here in these diagrams. The first goal to encourage resiliency throughout the current and future flood plains, so in essence, to enlarge the area where these rules could apply. The second goal is to support long-term resilient design of all building types, so these building types include both residential uses, detached houses, semi-detached houses, apartment buildings as well as non-residential uses such as factories, shopping malls, commercial uses, and then the third goal is to allow for adaptation over time through incremental changes. So we can't change everything at once. We can't make everything resilient all at once, but these rules would allow for incremental change over time and then the fourth goal is looks to the future and would help facilitate recovery by reducing red tape. You know by reducing regulatory obstacles that are currently there, which makes recovery or reconstruction more difficult, so goal one encourage resiliency throughout the current and future floodplains. So you might be asking all right. This all sounds good, but what? Where would the rules apply, especially in community board 5? So this map shows the applicability of these new flood coastal zone flooding guidelines and the existing rules are shown on the left-hand side. So the yellow areas are rules available for buildings is in the one percent flood plain, as you can see, it's a very small area in board five in the Mazda Newtown Creek Industrial area, and then these proposed rules will be widened in terms of their applicability. So, rather than just being this tiny area, it's still pretty tiny, as you can see on the right hand, side, but the lots that are within both the one percent flood plain and also the point. Two percent flood plain so slightly wider area would also be these new rules and guidelines would also apply to them. So it's. Why make the area where these rules could be applied? And then this map again just shows a little bit more in terms of wet proof, wet floodproof spaces? What wet floodproof means is basically, in a nutshell, is protecting spaces from water damage like wet floodproofing, different strategies that construction strategies where you would protect the you know basement and the ground floors from being flooded and from water damage, and so the new rules, on the right hand, side proposed optional rules which show that a greater area could be brought into this optional rules. So now you can both have one percent flood, plain buildings and point two percent flood plain lots: could these rules would apply to this image is not from board five, but it's from the Rockaways, but it kind of just illustrates that the rules currently apply up to. You know this area, which this blue line, the blue dotted line, which is great, but it doesn't do enough. So now, if we had a super big storm again, these all these houses here would be expanded in terms of their active applicability and so building owners. Throughout these you know this area. The floodplain, which is more inland, would also be able to proactively incorporate resiliency improvements into their buildings. Okay, and the second goal is to support long-term resilient design of all building types and these building types range from detached houses, semi-detached houses and the zoning rules would allow building owners to basically physically elevate their like living rooms. There are kitchens and other like bedrooms above building support, features so that, if it's going to flood up to this blue line, this blue-line those living areas would be safe from water damage, so habitable spaces would be elevated above the-flood elevation line. In addition to residential buildings, the ground floors of commercial buildings and mixed-use buildings would also have new, optional rules. That could be. That would be incentivized so that flood proofing of ground floors would be required. You know could be adopted to encourage active uses to be kept at the street level and to promote internal building access, and so these ground floors would be flood proofed and also the basement level would also be floodproof and then streetscape when these allowances are used and when these buildings are raised above the floodplain elevate, flood elevation and buildings would have to comply with the flood resistant construction standards and the new set of streetscape requirements. I just want to remind everyone here at this point that the actual building code regulations are can be found in Appendix G of the New York City Building Code, so the New York City Building code, as you all know, regulates building construction, and there are rules that are already there in place if you're a building. Now within the flood plain you have to, and you want to like rebuild something or you want to build a new factory, you have to follow those rules in Appendix G. These new rules that city planning is putting out kind of these are a lot of them are optional rules that would apply so that property owners can adopt them. If they're within the flood zone and they're incentivizing some of these more proactive measures, so special conditions, additional flexibility would be available to special conditions common in older neighborhoods, so that those buildings can also become resilient. And again, these images are from more like beachfront communities, but but it gives you a sense, an idea of how you know widely applicable. They are and then discretionary options will be available to address unique situations such as you know, apartment buildings and these situations so to ensure that all buildings and neighborhoods can be more resilient in face of storms and climate change. The third goal is to allow for adaptation over time, so buildings along the floodplain are also developed over time. A lot of the buildings, especially in CB5 that are along town creek, the industrial buildings there were built prior, like we're built before 1946 and over 87 of those industrial buildings within the Mazda Newtown Creek Floodplain were built prior actually to 1983 when the New York City adopted his first flood maps and enacted floodplain regulations. So you know it will take time for especially new construction to adopt these new rules and standards, but hopefully it will help just bring things more up to code and make these buildings more resilient. So mechanical equipment would have more options to be placed above flood levels, either on open areas or roofs in lieu of basements or cellars. So you can think about like let's say you have a factory in in Massbath and along the Newtown Creek, which was flooded in hurricane Sandy, a lot of if you may be like a wholesale food distributor. They were not able to provide food because their electrical generators were located on the first floor and got flooded so there's no electricity and that you know completely, you know, can really be detrimental to those kinds of businesses as they recover. But now mechanical equipment we're encouraging them to be lifted and elevated above above the ground floor and then support spaces. Key spaces that are often located within basements or cellars, especially those that help support businesses such as offices or storage rooms, would be able to be located above flood levels. And this diagram just shows like ramping and how you know they're, including materials above you know, being elevated. Unlike this little platform, and then this flood protection measure just shows. This is more residential to be installed for compliance with flood resistant construction standards, so either hazardous materials can also be placed in like safe floodproof or waterproof containers that are elevated above the flood, elevation, etc. The fourth goal is to facilitate future recovery by reducing regulatory obstacles and these obstacles, power systems, accessibility, vulnerable populations and disaster recovery in terms of power systems and like electrical systems, Hurricane Sandy showed that areas affected by the storm went beyond the floodplain and that the regulations which would facilitate recovery would be useful for other types of disasters. So these new zoning tax changes would also incorporate more options to locate power systems on lots throughout the city. That would make it easier for properties to provide backup energy, especially in the event of a future disaster, and then in terms of accessibility, doing more like ramps and other you know to raise commercial businesses, but also have more accessible design. So people can see consistent standards throughout the city and Hurricane Sandy demonstrated. You know it's very long process in terms of rebuilding after something like a disaster or storm, and the city is recommending rules that could be made available to facilitate recovery process from future disasters, some of which could be applicable or implemented to help address the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic effects. So next steps this zoning text amendment was certified by the Department of City planning on October 19th, so it was referred out to all 50 community boards and it's being heard by Community board five today the deadline for recommendations from community boards. You have until December 28th to give a recommendation and the zoning for coastal flood resiliency city-wide tax amendment is also being accompanied by local actions and zoning changes in these three different beach areas, one in Howard Beach in Queens and two other local zoning changes in Brooklyn and I just included this because in terms of the flood plain and community board, five there's not a you know a huge stretch of waterfront, but there is an industrial, a pretty resilient industrial area in Massbath and if those of you who are working in the industrial sector or know people developers in that Massfest area, this is a great publication put out by the department as well. It's a related publication called mitigation and preparedness in the city's industrial floodplain, and it does give case studies of and is kind of, more written in general, a layperson language so that you can see in this resilient industry report- and you can see in this picture here- flooding of industrial facilities during Hurricane, Sandy and mass best Queens how it applies to more industrial properties which is relevant in CB5 and Masbath. So, if you're interested, this is a link, there's a link here to the full report and I think Gary and Walter have the link to the full report and the full zoning tax change for the Postal Zone flood amendment as well, and I'm available for questions now and later, as you see fit and yeah, and that includes my presentation. Thank you joy. So do you I, don't know if I'm on me, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you so three of the largest operations on the creek are the bus facility and the MTA finance center and a large Rio pre-concrete ready-mix concrete plant on the creek. So would they have to be elevated or if it came to, if it waited for another hurricane after hurricane, how do you elevate a concrete plant that uses barge facilities to bring in sand gravel and cement? It sounds like a difficult situation. Yes, that's a great question. Those existing businesses, like the concrete plants and the other that you mentioned, are not required per se. To do any, you know to spend a lot of money right now to retrofit their existing business, but there are recommendations here, for especially if one day the concrete plant wants to make changes or expand their building, they would have to meet the new standards if they expand, enlarge or make any physical construction. You know design changes to their facility so right now, if they're at basically barge height to unload sand, gravel cement, if they had to elevate what it appears to be, maybe 8:10 15 feet whatever it is. Yes, how would they be able to unload barge materials on their property? I mean it's either to reconstruct the peer or to elevate. You know their. You know their case. Studies in this report actually I believe for uses like that. Can you know they can read up on strategies? They can use that are more cost effective, but you know the idea here is to to help property owners kind of protect their businesses and be more proactive and doing things that are not super expensive but, like maybe moving trying to move some materials more upstream or like away from the water and well I'm concerned. We the concern we have in the community if they can't transport sand and gravel on the creek, because they're 15 feet below the new elevation, it's going to require trucking in materials and that's additional traffic and transportation into our community, and that would be something you know detrimental to the area right yeah. So there's a really a lot to balance and a lot to you know to consider when they're doing improvements or they're trying to elevate something or make it more resilient. But again it's not a requirement now, but it is something there are strategies within this report also that a lot of industrial businesses can look at and consider as they plan for the future. You know like future operations, yeah, that's a concern if there's an another hurricane and the property is damaged and they have to rebuild to the current standards- and you know where we're going to be strapped with trucks coming into the community rather than barges. Yeah, I'm going to take that concern and write that down and share it with the folks on the waterfront in the waterfront division so yeah. Definitely it may be something that needs to be grandfathered in Mm-hmm, okay, it's also a fuel oil distribution facility over there that they barge in the fuel and if they can't barge it in because it has to be elevated, they're going to be multiple trucks. So I think we need to look at those facilities plus the on the Brooklyn side is the sanitation facility that takes in and sends out garbage on the barges if they have to elevate 15 feet, they're not going to do it. It's going to be trucked in and out of the community, so I think we need to grandfather those facilities into the situation. Okay, I made a note of that Vinnie and we'll definitely share it with you. Thank you. Anyone else have a question or comment. Oh yes, could you hear me who's that? Thank you, hi! Could you join? Could you take your screen down so we can see it yeah. Okay, what I am asking is that there are people are still paying for repairs that was from the last hurricane. If they have to, are they grandfathered in or do they have to start thinking about raising their property, especially I'm talking about residents with single-family houses. They could barely afford to get their house back in shape before the last hurricane, especially sandy point now, if you put these restrictions on them where they have to actually raise their living levels and things like that could be a very costly thing, who's going to pay for that yeah their grandfathered in so that's a good question. If you were, if you have an existing house, your grandfathered in, if your house is destroyed in like a future storm, you would have to build to these new standards and it's the building code standards under Appendix jeans. Those are the standards that have to be followed, but if you already have a house now on the beach and it's fine the way it is you, it can stay like that. You know, except for my little Bungalow and Fred Hallas Bungalow Rockaway. If they are damaged beyond one third of the replacement value, we would have to elevate rebuild to the current the new elevations, so it would be from a twenty thousand dollars repaired. Two hundred forty thousand dollar replacement, okay, Kenny Ray Burger yeah lowering hand. Is there going to be a time, or is there a set time on when the Dp's going to say from this day on, you must have the height yeah. When is it going to affect joy? That's what I meant yeah. So once the city council votes on it in three months three to six months, whenever they, if they approve it, then it will go into effect. These new rules will be in effect. Will it be immediate or one year from the date of I'm pretty sure that usually, when you know during zoning text changes once the city Council approves something? If that the day it you know they approve, it is a day it technically goes into effect, but of course it takes time for all of that stuff to get transferred over to buildings department and for things to get reviewed, but but yeah they have to promulgate the rules, so it could be three to six months right. Dr Garang. Can you have your hand up? Thank you. Yes, Sir. First of all, it's good to know that very small area of community five is under flood zones. However, the area which is under the flood zones, as for the female map I, was you know the impression that these buildings or structures can not be raised, because the buildings or structures are already there. Therefore, to protect this building and structures, I don't know means what is the planning I was under the impression that there will be physical barrier wall constructed along the coastal line, so the flooding will not be increasing into the this low-lying area. If that is not correct, please let me know, that's not correct. The other thing is since most of like about 80 90 against you from your life. Eighty ninety percent of community five land is above the flood area. Do we still need the flood resilience or floods resistance constructions, regulatory to be imposed in our new construction yeah? So so just two ways: I see. You asked like two questions: the first one about the coastal strategy for buildings that are already built. You can't raise them. You know this huge building, that's 300,000 square feet or something so for those buildings they can there's strategies called wet flood proofing. Where you can, it takes a lot of technology, but you can I, don't know like do different things in the building while with like dams or you know stuff that will help keep the water out of the building and in terms of the coastal Sea wall. That is also a strategy, but it's not really treated as part of this plan, because this plan is part is looking at. Building construction and building zoning rules pertaining to buildings and existing buildings. I mean a new building. Sorry new building construction, so the old industrial buildings they can. They would need to follow rules for the you know, technologies for like wet flood proofing and things that can help prevent the water from getting in or if it gets in. They can. You know, raise their mechanical systems to the second floor or third floor or have backup generators. So, even if it does flood like their basement in the first floor they can you know it won't be such a disaster to recover they'll be able to recover quicker if their electrical mechanical systems are protected or, as I recall, from the presentation at the thorough board. Existing buildings could would be, would vacate their basements and first floors and move everything up, move the mechanical system to the roof or the upper floors, and the first floor would just be a lobby. The basement could be possible to use as a garage or just actually filled in some instances, correct, yeah, okay. Anyone else have a question comment. If not I, don't see it, I'm sorry anyway, who is it Paul, Kurzner Paul? Do you want to raise your damn hand? Oh he's, muted, Paul's, muted, okay, let me see if I can hold him. Where is he Paul Carrick someone, okay, Paul! Are you there? Yes I? Am you have to raise your not the physical hand, down on the bottom corner of the participant screen is a raise your hand, sign I, have nothing to do. Go down the bottom of the screen, click on participant, okay and then go to the right and raise your hand, because it's people there's nothing on my iPad that has features. Oh that's. Why you're on the iPad, I'm sorry, okay, so all I would like to have is Gary if you could send I guess at least the people on the zoning committee, the links both to the the industrial report and the residential recommendations. Can they be sent to us by link and then we can just open them up yeah, I'm not sure if we sent that out already but I'll double check and do it again or send it out. I thought she did, but okay, just the links I'll once we get it, I can open it up and read it yeah. Thank you all right. Thank you anything else. John has his hand up. Oh I lost it. I lost the screen here. I would just like to ask for that industrial resiliency link, because the link that you had in your presentation is coming up as as a broken link on the New York City government site, okay, I'm I'll forward the links to Gary and make sure they're both working and yeah, and thank you anyone else. If not thank you joy and thank you we'll continue with the rest of the meeting. So the next item of business to come before us is the public forum Gary. You have any written statements on the public forum hold on a minute, so Vinnie there is a person who has testimony with regard to this proposed rezoning right. Who has a radio on I'm sorry I hold on. That's me, okay, so the statement submitted is waterfronts, link our cities to our oceans to increase sustainability and resilience in an era of rising seas and stronger hurricanes. We need to reimagine this interface. The zoning for coastal flood resiliency amendment takes distance and elevation and to account for high risk flood zones. However, flood mitigating construction on and in public, waterfronts and waterways should also utilize approaches and technologies that minimize impact on resilience, building ecosystems like oyster reefs and reduce conflict, with pre-existing environmental goals like the restore New, York Shellfish program, environmentally sensitive approaches and technologies that integrate natural and nature-based features into waterfront development and coastal protection should be an integral part of any waterfront project. Natural and nature-based features fulfill engineering functions relevant to flood risk management, while producing additional economic, environmental and or social benefits. Shoreline based restoration is one tool in fighting coastal erosion and flooding in water barriers like Houston's, Ike dike are also effective solutions for maintaining waterfronts and the public's ability to access that shoreline-based. Solutions like beach, nourishment and in water technologies like breakwaters, should take environmental services into account at all levels, from their materials to their form and placement, with the goal of reconstructing and retrofitting New York waterfront and waterway infrastructure like sea walls and peers in mind, new resiliency standards should include best practices and echo engineering principles. By so doing, marine habitats are unable to restore themselves allowing for true sustainable development and greater hurricane resiliency. We urge this board to take ecological engineering principles into account and ensure New, York's, waterfronts and waterways are built not only to generic strength standards, but also to provide environmental risk reduction and ecological uplift, and the gentleman who submitted this is the name. Walter Dodson address is 200, Barrack, Street, okay, anything else under public forum, no all right! So then, if not Laura are you there miss Laura? Yes, I'm here. Would you please take attendance? Okay, Vinnie! You sent me that public work forum statement from White Golf Hospital about five o'clock tonight. Okay, so all right read that and then do attendance, please: okay, Wyckoff, Heights, Medical Center, in conjunction with the state of New York, opened a copic 19 testing center that is now performing up to 200 tests. Daily Whmc has an open visitor center for ambulatory patients and friends. Relatives are waiting for their loved ones. After a clinical procedure, the visitor center is located at 1610 Cal Avenue Whmc has taken steps to create a safer hospital plan by heat testing and questioning every employee every day before they enter the floors of the hospital. In an effort to create an Nba type bubble on 10:27 20 Msc was the victim of a russian ransomware cyber attack that is going on to this day. No patient information or financial information has been compromised. Uhmc has successfully transitioned manual documentation mode as our quality health care has not been impacted. The hospital continues to work closely with federal state and New York City authorities contain and defeat this virus restore our technical capabilities and transitions. After normal operations, uhmc was as many Us hospitals targeted and subjected to this ransomware cyber attack, and that is it from Evelyn. Everybody knows that the federal government site was attacked and all the hospitals were affiliated with that and they got attacked. It was a russian cyber attack on a federal government. So some of the lower facilities are not online right now, and it was a major cyber attack that never got into the papers. Okay, Laura, would you call attendance, please just be before you do that? Laura. Just remember everybody unmute yourself to tell. Are you here and then remember to mute yourself again? Okay, all right Hikari, yes, President Vincent, Arcuri, President, Tony, Bernanke, Eric, Butkowitz, Eric, Robert, Chimeli, yeah, Walter, Clayton, Patty Crowley, here Brian, Julie, Brian, Dooley I saw him earlier. Okay, here, Harry Drake, Dimitro, Pitkowski, President, Steve, Fiedler I saw Steve I, think he's on the phone here: okay, Dr Gurang I know you're there, I'm here, okay, said hofferly. Fred I saw you there: okay, rich Hubert, present: okay, Paul Kurzner, yeah, Kinga, Kurzner, yeah, President, Marianne, Latanzio, Ed la Tao by Telephone, Kathy, Massey, I, know you're there she's, not all damn no she's there, she's, muted. Okay, there you go Eileen Maloney yeah here, Peggy O'kane, present Michael O'kane wide awake, no matter what you think: candy ratberger yeah Ted Wrens, present Kelvin Rodriguez, Luis, Rodriguez, Lee Rottenberg, here President Walter, Sanchez, yeah, Carmen, Santana, Dennis, Stefan, Kathy, Sumski, Megan, Tatio, Guyanel Thapa. Let me hear Barbara Toscano President, Patrick and Casey Patrick I thought. I saw you: okay, Micheline Von, Draven, Marianna, zero, Nan sang okay is Kathy O'leary there, okay, Gary Kathy and Laura right. Thank you anyway. Joe Nacerino we had joy, Chen Joe! Are you there? Yes, thank you Mr Chair. Thank you, Gary hello, Board members, a couple quick items if I may, from President Sharon Lee events 1119 a virtual parent advisory board. It is six o'clock on the 19th tomorrow and if you would like to join us, go to our website and hit the link to go on it's virtual December 3rd. We are going to do a in person, borrow hall tree fight. We believe that on the front lawn, we will have enough space repeat that date: December 3rd wink Santa will be there. I'll send out a flyer to Gary and we are confident with the size of our one 4:30, with the size of our lawn. We should be able to social distance and with that I borrow President Lee wish you all a happy and safe, wonderful Thanksgiving. Thank you Laura. Could you read the statement from 104? If you haven't got it right here. Here is something okay. Currently the 104 precinct is seeing an uptick in burglaries. This is a mix of residential and commercial burglaries. In efforts to combat this crime, we have adjusted some schedules and added additional resources to the late night and early morning. Hours of the day since this is when majority of the burglaries are occurring, grand larceny, as well as grand larceny of order are crimes that continue to take place in the 104th. Some tips to prevent these crimes from occurring are not leaving your key fobs in the vehicle, not leaving any valuables in the vehicle. Locking your vehicles, ensuring you have working cameras at your business or residence. Try to use lights to brighten up the location, ensure that all entries and exits are properly secured if you're, a business owner or worker do not leave cash on the register at the end of the business day with the holiday season approaching so is online shopping, be sure to leave specific instructions on delivery methods and always track your purchases in efforts to prevent packaged, thefts be sure to not leave a package unattended for long periods of time. The use of security cameras at your location helps greatly to deter these crimes. As always, if anyone has questions or concerns, please feel free to call or write look forward to, hopefully seeing everyone soon, police officer, Michael Barish. Thank you. You want to do liquor licenses. Yes, okay, liquor, wine, beer and cider license applications and renewals new licenses, Israel churns doing businesses, sweet Jane's, bar 6402, 68th avenue in Ridgewood liquor license hold on that's an existing facility new owner right, but they did put in for a new license right liquor license renewals, Fajita, Sunrise restaurant Court, 5924 Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood Mifra Corp, 779, White, Golf Avenue in Ridgewood lethal restaurant 5550, Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood, Juventus, Sport, Cafe, Inc, doing business as Amichi Cafe, 73-11, 88th street new wine and or beer licenses; Nij Inc doing businesses, Cachacas 678 Seneca Avenue in Ridgewood, Gab restaurant Corp, 6932, Grand Avenue in Massmith, Olivares, Mex, Llc, doing businesses, Ridgewood taco factory, 6689, Forest avenue in Ridgewood royal pizzeria of Myrtle Court, doing businesses, world pizza of Myrtle, 5506, Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood wine in or beer license, renewals Zny, NYC Inc doing business as my sushi 7920 Elliott Avenue in Middle Village La, cocina, De, Mama, Inc, 5613, Metropolitan, Avenue, Ridgewood, Annatal, folklore and soccer Club, 1880 Manahan street in Ridgewood, Wakamatsu, Queens, Japanese, restaurant Inc, doing businesses, wakamatsu, japanese restaurant 7018, Grand Avenue in Massbith, Cbc, Pizza, Corp, doing businesses, Glendale pizza, 6827 Myrtle Avenue in Glendale, Wyckoff, Wheerfield, Corp, doing business as Transpecos 9-15, whiteboard avenue and 1611 Wherefield Street will be submitting an alteration application to make the following changes: refocus of business direction to a vietnamese restaurant from previous, principally music venue focus, relocation and change of dimensions to customer bar relocation and change of dimensions to existing seasonal service bar on patio service bar to allow drink preparation within cafe, seating area, change to alcohol storage area locations activation at the entrance exit at Wheelfield, Street, Frontage, minor change to partition walls not affecting egress seasonal, sidewalk, setting and seasonal temporary freestanding coverage structure in accordance with NYC, open restaurants, program and all other regulations.

So then the next item of business, if I get my papers straightened out here- is the chairperson's report. That's me and 8.25 Vinnie. Yes, so we have statements for elected officials. Yeah I didn't get there yet. Okay, all right! So, first item with business under the chairperson's report minutes everybody got their minutes any questions or comments. Anybody make a motion to approve motion seconded by whom that was Walter, all the favor. Okay, any opposed. Thank you. Okay, we did liquor license okay statements from elected officials, any elected officials send us anything Gary yeah, so, starting with the mayor announcements from the mayor's office, the open storefronts program began October 30th and will run until December 31st. This program permits storefront businesses to use a portion of their sidewalk to display merchandise, sell goods, complete transactions and provide queuing areas. We encourage New Yorkers to shop locally this holiday season and support our local businesses as part of the vision, zero initiative, the city has launched the fifth annual dusk and darkness campaign, reminding motorists how dangerous fall and winter evenings are for pedestrians and cyclists, especially after the clocks fall back for the end of daylight savings time. There is also a similar education and enforcement effort taking place around New York state laws which require all motor vehicle passengers to wear seat belts. The city is concerned about rising Covid-19 case numbers, but we can still fight back a second wave. Please continue to wear a mask, wash your hands social distance and get it a test. Often, please see the attached flyer for testing sites in Queens wishing everyone a happy and safe thanksgiving. Okay, we have a statement. We have a statement from Council member Robert, Holden Okay, hello, Neighbors, Community, board, five members and fellow elected officials. I hope you all enjoyed the month of October while staying safe and healthy and I. Thank you for your continued work and volunteerism. As we draw closer to the end of this incredibly challenging year. Our city continues to battle the novel coronavirus and we must continue our collective efforts to practice social distancing, wear, masks and practice. Good hygiene, the city Council, continues to operate remotely and our calendars have been filled with committee meetings and stated meetings as we continue to work on behalf of nearly 8.6 million New Yorkers. Last Friday, as chair of the council's committee on technology, I held a hearing on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and automated decision systems. Both the public and private sectors, utilize technologies to take the human element out of important decision making, such as hiring deciding punishment in the quarter of law and many others. We heard from the chief technology officer, the city of New York, along with other De Blasio administration officials and from industry officials, academia advocates and members of the public I, will also be holding a technology committee hearing on cloud computing and how we could use advanced technologies to make city government more efficient and productive. This past Sunday, together with assembly member Mike, Miller and State Senator Joe Adabo I, held an electronic waste recycling event at the Forest Park Band show well over 400 vehicles participated in the event and dozens more folks walked over to recycle their electronic waste. This event showed us the need for e-waste recycling programs and my office will work with the administration and the department of sanitation to reinstate the city program for this Thursday at 6:00 p.m. So I guess: that's tomorrow, night, along with the landmarks Preservation Commission I will be hosting an outreach event for property owners in the three designated Ridgewood historic districts. The goal is to help property owners, understand Landmark, Preservation Commission's, permitting process which ensures that the character of these neighborhoods is preserved and also to share opportunities for grants and low-interest loans for owners who do work to maintain their properties. For those interested, please check my social media pages for more information, as always feel free to contact my office with any of your questions or concerns. Thank you again for your continued dedication to our communities and I hope to see all of you soon. So that's council, member Holden. We have one more from the Office of Brian Barnwell. Our office hopes every one of their families are safe, healthy and well. Assemblyman Bondwell and our team thanks the community for the honor to continue to serve the district, and it is a privilege that we do not take. We do not take for granted. We are happy to announce two community drives that our office will be hosting. We will be hosting our annual turkey drive in which we donate turkeys to those in need for thanksgiving. If you would like to request a turkey for your family or if you would like to donate a turkey, please call our office at or 718-651-3185 assemblyman Barnwell at Barnwell, B NY Assembly.Gov. Please note that the last day to donate will be November 23rd. Our office will also be holding a toy drive for families in need. Since our office remains closed due to Covid-19, all donations can be set up by calling us at 718-651-3185 or emailing that office at that email address. I gave you a minute ago. Please note that the last day to donate will be December 21st for the toys, as always the few or anyone you know, needs help with any issue. Please do not hesitate to reach out to our office and I. Think that's it. Thank you. So some of you may have heard about my complaint against the mayor, the governor, limiting no more than 10 people in a family setting the other day today the police commissioner came out and said the NYPD will not enforce the family gatherings of more than 10 people so enjoy your thanksgiving have as many people as you want, because this is still America. We are have the freedom to practice our religion and association. So Mr Giordano, you have a does. Anyone have any questions for me or the board. If not Gary, would you give your? Do you have a report, not that won't be given by by John Meyer, but the sewer project on on 70th street is moving toward Grand Avenue, so this project started Calamus Avenue with 69th street and moved a little bit east to 70th street and then is going up the hill and down the hill on 70th Street going south toward the l.I.e we or I got something recently them looking for the community boards, okay, that being the department of design and construction to take away parking on Grand Avenue from 69th place to 72Nd street or 70. No 69th lane to 72nd place real soon because they have to put two sewer chambers in into Grand Avenue between 69th lane with 72nd place, so they can't have parking there. When you're going to have a 30-foot diameter chamber in two locations, they want to have 213 foot wide lanes which are wider than the standard 11, so that they could share it more easily with a bicycle, but parking would be taken away. So I wrote to DDC, designing construction and saying hold off a minute. This is the holiday season and by doing what you want to do before January 1st, you could really infringe upon the ability of these businesses to earn a an income and from what I know very often 40, of what a merchant makes for the year is made during the period between you know the mini the middle of November and the end of the year, the end of the calendar year. So I'm trying to hold them off from doing this work before the beginning of the year and they're micro tunneling down between those two chambers, I think 60 feet or so, which is common for a lot of the work they're doing along 70th street for oh for sanitation purposes. Illegal dumping is still a problem in our board, including near our board office. So enforcement is real important as far as sanitation police goes, but put your garbage and recycling out the night before your collection day, because some of us are going to get picked up on the midnight shift, which is the first shift on our collection day. So for me, I get picked up, Monday and Thursday, so I've got to put that out tonight, just in case I'm on the midnight shift. As this you know, kind of moves along we'll know better at who's on what shift, but don't take a chance now and Miss miss your collection, so otherwise I wish you all a happy thanksgiving and may you have much to be grateful for and hopefully we can beat this virus by wearing masks and Vinnie. If you're going to have people over practice, your social distancing and wash your hands a lot and the vaccine is, it looks like it's almost ready to be distributed. Thank you so committee reports, Sony and land use. Do we have a report we do and we have two issues to vote on tonight. We recommend the application, so we want to put something we want to put forth tonight that we recommend their application for a variance for continuation of the variance it's a non-conforming use in a residential zone. Fm Brush has been with us for about a century. It's a family business they've been great neighbors. So we'd like you to approve the application Mr Chiutano. Would you call the role? Okay again, everyone remember yourself to vote Mr Atticari, yes, Mr Archery, yes, Eric Berkowitz, yes, Bob Schmelly, poor, Walter, Clayton Walter, there I heard well. If you were listening, we're voting on the approval of an extension of the existing variants for the brush company on auto road. I'm sorry Edgel, Avenue, that the committee reported in favor of hello. Are you there Vinnie we get Patty Crowley can't find him all right. Brian Dooley or Dimitro, or Steve Fiedler D, Fielder, Dr Goran, yes, Sir, Poor, Fred, hofferly, Rich Huber for our local business. Yes, Paul, Kurzner, Paul, he's muted, put him down as a yes, four or I had a question to ask before we started and that question has to do what is the term of the new variance two years? Thank you so much. What is your position for it? Thank you continue, Gary, so that the request for the variance extension is 15 years. I apologize, 15 years, yeah, the other one's 10. this one's 15. all right continue. Yeah I got ta point that out Peggy, okay or Michael O'kane, or for Luis Rodriguez four Lee Rottenberg Floor Walter Sanchez, Dennis, Stefan, Moore, Good, Everybody, Walter, Clayton, four, oh hi, Patrick, sorry, I got disconnected for a little bit, so I get everybody now so my question Mr G, since you got the everyone's a favor. Since this has been a hundred year business in this location. Is there any reason why would they have to continue to come back every 15 years? Well, yeah I think this was raised at our last meeting. I. Think my own opinion is I think they should make it easier for these applicants usually businesses to get a renewal. They make it a bit bureaucratic to say the least, and it cost them quite a bit of money. Yes, I think what Walter pointed out at the last meeting, though, is that you want term variances, because you want them to have to be accountable. So it's somewhere they've been there a hundred years well, they've been in the neighborhood 90 yeah I mean there could be a change of management, a change of structure and all of a sudden they become bad neighbors. Okay, all right! Thank you! Walter all righty. The next one is a 10-year variance. I apologize for the first, so 10 a request for 10-year variance and it's from service station on Elliott Avenue and 69Th Street, the Bp Service station, and they have a very small convenience store. They have two bays where they do repairs and they have gasoline there and the city has them, apply every 10 years again so see if they're, good neighbors. If we have any complaints against them, we have had no complaints against them and they went through the same procedures as Fm brush. They apply for that variance of use and- and we, the committee has decided to recommend approval of that that one as well so we'd, like your support on that, is that the northwest or the southeast corner, that's the northeast corner. North Knoll would be northwest or southeast. Now it's the north. It's the northeast corner, Vinnie I grew up. There, you've got Elliott Avenue. One gas station is on the northeast corner. The other gas stations on the southeast corner they're right across the street from each other. Isn't there one on the northwest corner too well, not to advertise, but the one on the northwest corner is pace. Tire okay, yeah I just want to know. Has this gas station has the owners changed at all constantly? Okay, thank you. Okay, all right, so any questions call the roll. Please Mr, Atticari Gary a question: if I may okay, what was the committee's recommendation on this variance in favor of a 10-year renewal? Okay, thank you. Okay, that's what we're asking for you to report on that. We asked that the community board approve it for another 10 years: okay, so Mr Radhikari, it's okay; yes, so you're, a four right: Mr Archery, four Eric Buckowitz, four Bob Shimelli Walter Clayton, four Patty Crowley, four Brian Dooley or Dimitro, or Steve Siegler doctor or Fred Hoffaly, or rich Huber, Thor, Paul, Kirzner or Kathina Poor, John Meyer for Patricia Malteses or Edgar Matteo for Kathy Massey, Eileen, Maloney or Peggy O'kane, or Michael O'kane or Don Passantino for Mike Porcelli, Ken, Ray, Burger or Ted Renz or Luis Rodriguez, four Lee Rottenberg, four Walter Sanchez four Dennis Stefan Guyanel, Tapa, Barbara, Toscano, Patrick Trinchesi, or for just to let you know, I think that the gasoline station you're talking about is on the South East corner. That's what I thought the gas station we're talking about is 6905 Elliott Avenue! It's the Bp Gas station, which we think is the southeast. That is an odd number. You are always on the north or the east side of the street. I go by dead reckoning. Sorry, yeah! There's a mobile station on the other side. I think that's when you're thinking of them all right, whatever it's the form again, whatever continue there now. That's it I get everybody all right transportation. What do we have? John Meyer, hello? Folks? How are you? We actually have two meetings to report on both of which have involved some of the same materials. We had a meeting on 10:27 in October that had a presentation and an information session from the department of transportation bridges division regarding our okay. You want my video. You can have my video, you just don't get me so the department of bridges is presenting on the Newtown Creek Bridge at Grand, Avenue, which everybody should understand, is a bridge from 1903 well past its life of service and is constantly being shut for repairs, temporary patches and the like. They are currently just discussing their work in reviewing the bridge and coming up with a design plan and the environmental plan that they have to present with it. They have not picked a design that will be coming later. Currently they're in pre-scoping testing environmental issues. Doing some sample, borings I believe this last month they will be doing design. Eventually, to be finished in 2023 and construction to begin roughly in 2026. no definitive end date to the project. At this moment the folks are getting some big money from the Federal Highway Administration, so they will have a say in this. Another party that has a major say in the eventual design of the bridge is the coast guard, as it is over a navigable waterway at this time. So, as I said, the existing as we were talking about earlier with department of planning this bridge is in a flood plain and it will need to be resilient to flooding. They are going to be looking for a 75-year service life, the elimination of non-standard features, bringing in some standard features like 12-foot travel lanes in both directions. Currently, the bridge can't handle two full-size vehicles going in opposite directions. There will be a larger sidewalk as well to help with pedestrians, as well as dedicated bike lanes in the eventual design. These are not. They don't have a plan for them. These are the things that they're saying they're going to have in the plan. They just don't know exactly how it's going to be filled out. They will be coming back to us in the spring of 2021 once they make some decisions on the environmental process and they would like to actually kind of meet jointly with us and Community board, one in Brooklyn, who is also impacted by this project as it is, it brings us both together, and so they can eliminate. You know crosstalk and have everybody on the same board they're going to try to get us together in kind of a collaborative design process. Our chairperson, Mr Curie, was recommending something like a community group like the Kosciuszko Bridge, which would be beneficial for all the other major thing that's come up in the last two meetings is Wyckoff Avenue, which has a large plan for rebuilding from basically sidewalk to sidewalk or building to building I should say, and we have some ongoing questions about the contamination of the Wolf Albert site, which is a federally designated superfund site because of radiative radiation contamination, and it is within the bounds of some of this work and so we're trying to understand from DEC and DEP, where the extent of that off-site migration has happened and how it might impact the work on Wyckoff Avenue and we're still waiting for feedback on that. As Gary mentioned earlier, both meetings had conversations about a major sewer project with the DEC actually coming. The department of design and construction. Sorry coming to us asking us for some temporary roadway adjustments as they need workspace on 52Nd, Avenue and Grand Avenue, and, as Gary had mentioned, we are looking for them to make sure that they don't impact our commercial areas during the holiday season, especially this year. We don't want to see any more impacts and hits on our commercial areas when we can help avoid it. There's a lot of information about that. If you have questions about it, you should reach out to the board office. They have a lot of real information. There is some information, that's circulating, that's not entirely accurate, so always look for the truth. On that. The other big issue that's been at our committee meetings for the last three meetings has been a request by Broadway stages for no standing, no parking on Cooper Avenue near their entrance to the East of Atlas Park and basically the gist in all three meetings. That it's been is that the committee is, you know, there's people that have supported it, but the majority of the committee does not support it. We have recommended, since they just keep coming back to us with the same drawing and the same ask, and they keep hearing the same thing that we've asked them to either make a major adjustment to what they're asking for or to step away and just go through DOT and ask them what DOT thinks there's a lot of question as to whether the turning radiuses are truly needed. The street is not very narrow, there's already clearance on either side of their entrance, so that's kind of where that is Vinnie. I know you had a question about that yeah. No, so what did the committee decide? The committee was in favor of not recommending it not granting it okay, so that was against it. You want to propose that we reject their request or you're still willing to work with them, and the D.O.T I think that they should go to the DOT at this point. I don't know that we have anything to vote on really because it's not a formal proposal that we have really I know they submitted the dimensions and the locations. But if the committee is recommending that they go directly to DOT, I will say: I made that recommendation, because the committee, as you were at two of those meetings right, the general gist of the members- is they're, not in favor of it and there's. You know, there's a number of people on the committee that are in that area and they see the actions and the activities. If people want to understand a little bit about what they're asking they can just go to. Google Street, View and they'll actually see a different version of what Broadway stages was presenting to the committee further down the road at the exit to their building instead of the exit to the parking lot. So that's always been a question too. Is this the first step and then there's going to be another? Ask so, at this point, I think Vinnie that the committee has just been so hesitant to accept the continued ask for the same thing that we did say to them that you either have to readjust and I tried to do a question to the committee of a portion of it like I, tried to break it up a little bit and say what about one side of the street? Nobody really wanted to address it that way they aren't presenting it that way. They're presenting we know they're building another sound stage there, so that would change the traffic patterns. Also Mr Chairman no problem Mike, but there is a raised hand function on zoom, which is a lot easier. We don't always see raised hands because there are multiple scenes. Thank you, okay, Mike. What is it John John just said: if the committee wants to know what they're asking why they're asking for it, they should look at Google I suggest if they want to know what is being asked, they should try driving a tractor trailer through a small space. No, what it is. They gave us a finally gave us a site plan. Originally they just asked for space. They finally gave us a measured site plan, but that does not include the additional sound stage at the building on the corner of, is that is it 88th street, no yeah, 88th or 83rd? No and 83rd is maybe 33rd they're going to build another soundstage. So will they need more space in the future? Is what we don't know so I think we need to respond to them John, so I think we should put something together, so Gary could respond to them that at this point in time, we have no position on their request. If they wish to go to D.O.T, it's only going to come back to us anyway, yeah I think they look. The same. People have been at three meetings now and Tony Argento was there Monica? Was there again they're drawing while it was helpful with measurements, it was not to scale it's it. They don't truly represent and know the dimensions of the roadway that they're talking about right. There's a lot of question as to the legitimacy of the request from the community. I am not one of those people right. That said no to this, but the majority of the committee said no: they heard that and I don't I guess if we have to give them a formal, I think they've heard it I, don't know that they need a formal I did also just want to say: Kathy is clapping right now she was physically raising her hand. Not everybody knows where the raised hand. Functionality is because it depends it's right over here Vinnie, it's that's where it is for you, if you're on a different device, it's not always in the same way. I'm sorry so Kathy is unmuted and she'd like to speak speaking. I think the issue is that they need the extra space to turn their trailers to make it easier for their trailers to turn into their property. Is that correct? It's not even air trailers, they're saying when there are production companies using the facilities, they often bring large trailers in to the property and they have difficulty making the turn into the driveway, because there's a car parked either on the left or the right and okay cross the street from the driveway. So the trailer could swing in the maximum length of the tr of the trailers is 53 feet: correct 53 for the permit yeah. If they have a daily permit to enter New York City with a 53 foot or larger trailer, they could that's what they are and to date, without the no parking I've watched them maneuver in simply without a problem, so I don't understand now, all of a sudden. They need the no parking on that side of the street. Now I personally. Well, there is D.O.T has a radius calculator which can be used to determine if it's a jackknife in or whatever the procedure is to get in I. Don't think there is a problem for those trailers to get in so I think we need to respond to them and tell them to don't sit with D.O.T more than a 53-foot trailer. They are larger than 53. because sometimes the cab itself could be 12-14 feet and then you have the 53-foot box or you have a 55-foot box. They come down my block where I live right here. There's the warehouses behind me and we often get 53 55-foot trailers come down the block and they have no choice. They have to go down my block to go to Myrtle Avenue, to make a turn onto the truck route. Well, I think it's a very big inconvenience for the people that live along Cooper, Avenue Parking is limited to start out with well I. Disagree because I, don't believe residents should be parking on Cooper Avenue. They have their own driveways. Most houses in your area have a garage, a driveway and an apron. You can fit three or four cars on your property. I. Don't think you should be talking on the streets overnight, but that's my opinion right, but it's the choice of the resident to park on the street if they should be inconvenienced to have to jockey their cars around in the morning. If there's more than one or two people I disagree that they should have no choice, they should talk on their own property. Okay, go ahead, Edgar, First, Speak, editor, I, guess not Mike police I think we're. As you say, sometimes drifting into committee work with all due respect and the committee did its work three months in a row. John reported the report. They were given a decision last night. They were not given a decision. It was a basically no position last night, so I think we opined on something last night. John did you take a vote last night it was a basically a straw poll. I asked the committee to say where they were on this we've listened to it three times. Is it going to go anywhere? No formal position, so no formal position? No, so my again, my point is that we should suggest to the applicant that they go to D.O.T with their arguments and see what comes back to us from D.O.T may I speak I haven't yet not yet because Mike Ford Shelley has his hand up. You don't have your hand up Mike. Now you do Mike First. Ladies First Peggy goes then I'll go it's very brief. It seems to me that what you really are complaining about is they are not bringing accurate plans. Why don't you tell them to bring you something that has the exact they did peg? They brought the measurements of what I'm hearing. They brought plan with measurements and locations so Vinnie. If I can just step in a little bit before Mike, we never got a proposal from the city about this. We got an ask. We got an ask from an organization within the community board correct. That is not something that we are not being asked to. Do: a zoning variance we're not being asked to do something about the city. There is no necessarily. There is no position to bring forward to anybody on this. So the work of the committee has been done. This isn't a formal board issue, but it is. We should be advising them to go to D.O.T with their request and that's what I actually told them last night. Well, we've got to do that in writing. Then, okay, all right Mike put jelly all right. Apparently we have a local business here who has a problem getting their vehicles in and out of there? Oh no Mike, it's not the local business problem. It's the clients of the local business. If you understand how the sound stages work they're available for production companies that would rent out the sound stages and utilize it and depending on what they need for scenery or equipment, they bring it in Vinnie. I understand that okay, I'm not forget about who owns the trucks, who's driving the trucks. Apparently, the drivers of these trucks have a problem maneuvering with the space they're given. If there's cars parked there, so Broadway stages came to us to ask to have no parking signs. Put up now. I said last night at the committee that anybody who hasn't tried to drive a tractor-trailer through a restricted space shouldn't be voting on this, because you don't know what you're talking about I have done. This and I know there's never enough space for a big truck okay, but that's not we're here to look out for the whole community, so the answer is they should go to D.O.T right file, their request and D.O.T would come back to us or ignore us whatever they want to do, because most of the restricted parking regulations are done without our input. Yes, so Broadway stages made a mistake by coming to us right: they wasted their time. They should have gone late, so what we did was piss them off and now they're going to get what they want. Anyway, no Tony Argento is not mad at us. He's he's a good businessman. Does a lot of local business with the different groups in our area? Buy his lumber from the lumber yard. I understand all that I just think we wasted his time and well, okay, so we'll advise them accordingly. Anything else on that matter. No! Thank you. Okay! Thank you, John! Any other I would just like to speak for my time that I feel that they burnt through in three meetings, so any just any transportation or transit problems. Our next meeting will be on the 26th of January, most likely. If things do not change, it will be remote. God help us, okay, any other committee reports anything to bring before this board under old or new business. I've got my hand off hey. Give me a second I have to undo myself. Peggy. Okay, go ahead just briefly: they've taken away the traffic light, the rather the street light on Myrtle between 88th and 87th. There's a doctor's office. There I was there last night, I practically killed myself, trying to find the curve in, amongst all the leaves hold on down, be replaced so slow down a street lamp. It's gone on, North South, which is it Myrtle, North or south on the east side between eighteen Myrtle runs East and West all right. It's on the north side. They took it away and it's dark as a pocket here at what street it's on Myrtle by 87, 47, Myrtle, Avenue, so call the office tomorrow and make that request. Let it be restored I just wanted to bring it up now. Thank you, okay, thank you anything else to come before us tonight. If not I'll make a motion go out and kill some turkeys and enjoy life and, as I said on the radio and at Borough Board meeting on line the other day, we're entitled to our constitutional rights, to practice religion and to associate so if you want to have 14 16 people in your house for Thanksgiving go right ahead and do it no social dictionary. Okay, anything else motion to adjourn seconded. If anybody would like to stay on after the meeting's over I can go through the raised hand, function with you all right, Joe everyone have a good thanksgiving, be safe, everybody good night. You.
