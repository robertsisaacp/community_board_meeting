Any yes, if you do, you have an arrow at the top of your screen. If you have move over to that bunch of squares and you'll get gallery view an arrow, no I don't want to play with it right now. That's okay! We live mark! You are okay, so welcome I lost it. I lost the agenda. I lost the agenda, hello, yep, I'm working! Oh okay, Peggy! That's not working for me! Vinnie! You can't get the grid tie upper right. My on mine, it's upper right! Yeah! It's okay! Can we get that up there? You go good evening. Everyone welcome to the regularly scheduled community board meeting. Once again, we are doing it remotely and I welcome everyone to being here. The first order of business tonight is a presentation. I'm sorry Donald. Could you lead us in the salute to the flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands? One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. First order of business tonight is a presentation or an introduction to our newly elected borough, President Donovan, Richards, Mr, Borough President. Thank you and it's great to see you hey how you doing happy holidays to everyone and I first want to thank Chairman, Vinnie and obviously our district manager Gary for all of the work that you continue to do for community five port. Five and I want to thank all of the members of the board. You know you don't do this because you're looking for a payday, you do it because you love your community and I'm grateful to now be the incoming borrower, president and, of course, wanted to stop by to introduce myself Donovan Richards and wanted to also thank our former borough president Sharon Lee, who really did a tremendous job in guiding our borough through this pandemic, that we continue to fight each and every day and I could say that you know the transition has been seamless and smooth, and we did a lot of work to make sure that you know the office would continue to function as we move forward and through this transition. I also just wanted to add. If there are anything that you think that we can do better. If there are ideas you have, please do not be shy at sharing them to us. My email is D Richards at queensbp.org. So if there are any recommendations or any suggestions, please do not be shy about that and I'll just end in saying, because I don't want to take up too much time. You know we in Queens are still suffering immensely through this pandemic. I'm getting around to about seven hospitals over the course of the next 24 hours to check in to make sure that our hospitals have all the PPE they need that they have the resources. They need. I, really just wanted to stress two things that everybody get tested that you utilize the h sites. There's been a lot of conversations around. You know going to urgent care, but really the health and hospital corporation sites are run really smoothly and I went and got tested myself on Monday my weight was no more than 10 minutes and I didn't not get on the line and say I'm the borough. President right, you know I wanted to see for myself how the government is functioning when it comes to testing. We obviously need more testing in Queens because we were the epicenter, so we're going to be pushing for that and then obviously you might have heard that the vaccine is being administered and I know that there are. A lot of people were really leery about the vaccine, but we're gonna push to make sure that Queens in the areas that were hit the hardest are really prioritized even through this through the vaccine. As we move forward, there's also been a looming conversation around small business closures, which I know impacts our entire borough. Many of our small businesses are holding on by the threads and we've started a conversation with the De Blasio administration on a new program that they hope to roll out I think towards the end of this month or early next year. Sometime, where we'll be administering financial assistance to small businesses and really what we're pushing for is grants. You know, there's always the conversation around loans, but we don't want our small businesses dreading in debt for their entire life as well. So we're going to be looking forward to working with our community boards, I'll be out with the small business services. Commissioner I think twice one once next week and another the once the week after to really get a good gauge of what our small businesses are going through. Although I think I have my finger on the pulse on it, so I just wanted to stop in and wish everybody a happy holiday. I know it's been a tough year, but we're going to get through this and you know one of the reasons I know we're going to get through. It is because you know, as someone who represented the rockaways, which was hit very hard by Hurricane Sandy was really the goodness of the people of this borough. You know I was looking out for our neighbors. That really got us through that tough time. So, if you're suffering you know hold on, you know, I'm not saying that everything is going to be perfect next year, but we're going to work to serve the spiral and to do everything in our power to make sure that our quality of life is up kept in that we're getting resources into the hands of those who need it. So please don't hesitate to reach out to the authors, I'm here and it's an honor to serve this borough and to serve you and happy holidays to each and every one of you and if there are any questions, I don't know if you I could take two questions. If anybody wants to ask any questions and then I'm off to the next community board, I think I've done three already tonight before the holidays. I have one comment when, in your outreach to hospitals, please reach out to Wyclef Heights Medical Center on the Brooklyn side, 30 percent of their population comes from Queens yeah I could see that yep. Okay, any anyone have a question or a comment like I said: I can't pick it up. Who is it? Peggy you muted, Peggy and Joseph on. My staff is on. Joe is on the line, so he'll take notes of that and make sure Brent gets that and I want to. Thank you for the. If not, thank you Mr Borough president. They answered all the questions, I'm off with all right to a good start where you going to board seven now yeah, I'm doing yes, yep, that's! Okay! Thank you very much great. Thank you. Please all righty! The next item of business is public forum. Mr Giordano. You have anything and include the elected officials. Would you please yeah? No one for the public forum from what I know and the elected officials. We have four statements: okay, so from Jessica Shabowski at the mayor's office, she states the New York City low to moderate income. Storefront loan can be used by businesses to restart or continue operations after experiencing challenges from Covid-19. phase 2 eligible zip codes, which include 11385, can submit applications starting December fourteenth for zero interest loans up to one hundred thousand dollars. Businesses must employ between two and ninety nine employees. Businesses must also have been in operations since or before January, 1st 2018. For more information. Please go to Nyc.Gov storefront loan. All one word: storefront loan, Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are increasing rapidly in New York City. The city stockpile has now amassed over 150 pieces of personal protective equipment after announcing its plan to maintain a 90-day stockpile earlier this year. Adults over 65 and people with underlying health conditions should limit activities outside their home and avoid public spaces or gatherings. New Yorkers are advised not to travel this holiday season. Covid-19 vaccines may not be available to the general public until mid-2021. We expect the first Pfizer vaccine shipments as early as December 15th and the first modern shipments. A week later on December 22nd. We are working closely with the state of New York on a distribution plan with an important focus on those who have the greatest need, including health care workers, nursing home residents and people who work in our nursing homes. The Pfizer vaccine requires ultra cold storage and special freezers, we're shoring up capacity for both to be prepared. We will use our citywide immunization registry to monitor, inventory and administration and help make sure everyone gets both of the doses wishing everyone a happy and safe holiday season, Jessica Schabowski, Queensborough, Director, mayor's community affairs. Okay, then we got a statement from Congresswoman Niti of Alaska's office. Hope everyone is well and safe. The congressional session is ending, but there are two items on the congresswoman's agenda that I want to highlight for the board: Usda farmers to families, food box, program, I, guess: that's U.S, Department of Agriculture asking Usda to provide information on the food banks receiving deliveries, the number of food shipments eliminated the processes used and what protections the program has in place to prevent community groups from facing additional costs. By requesting a formal investigation, the lawmakers are seeking more information on how Usda can best address the issue to ensure the program is reaching New Yorkers in need and suffering from the fallout of the cobra 19 pandemic and the letter with regard to that written to the office of the inspector general of the U.S Department of Agriculture I think Laura sent that or Kathy sent that to the board members and that's signed by numerous members of Congress. Maybe everyone in the New York delegation, because I see 20 congressional people on the letter, including Congresswoman Velazquez. As far as Covid-19 relief Congresswoman Velasquez's office writes both the house's Senate presented their proposals and a formal offer has been submitted by the White House for consideration. The member recognizes the urgency for family and small business relief in her district. Financial and food and security are central to the congresswoman's items of concern in the negotiations and will advocate for a response that matches urgent needs. Our office is still working remotely all federal agency concerns or pending case work can still be sent their way. Their office number is 718 and they wish everyone happy holidays got a statement from Council member Robert, Holden Neighbors, Community, Board, 5 members and fellow elected officials. I hope you all enjoyed the month of November while staying safe and healthy and I. Thank you for your continued work and volunteerism as we navigate this challenging year together. I hope that you all had a great thanksgiving. Our city continues to battle the novel coronavirus and we must continue our collective efforts to practice social distancing, wear, masks and practice good hygiene. My office has been hard at work on behalf of Ridgewood Glendale mass with middle village, Woodhaven and Woodside. The problem of illegal I don't know what this sentence means. So we can't skip that one. My constituents have had enough of this assault on their quality of life, I think it's car break-ins, where they're loud music emanating from stadium-sized speakers. Okay, here we go or illegally modified vehicles with straight pipe exhausts or car horns and guns. Together with assembly member Brian Barnwell, we met with City Hall representatives and top brass from the NYPD to Ma, demanded actions be taken. I also met with Queen's district attorney, Melinda Katz, asking that her office become more involved in this matter and prosecute these individuals who also drive, while under the influence or intoxicated and put the lives of the public at risk. All of this ties into a recent op-ed I wrote for the New York Post entitled broken city. How New York forgot the Abcs of public virtue in the op-ed I described how elected officials have stopped encouraging lawful behavior and have made it impossible for the police to enforce laws. It hits on the theory of broken windows and how vital it is to crack down on quality of life. Issues like graffiti abandoned cars, noise pollution littering and others before it spirals into something larger I invite all to read it and I. Welcome any input community board. Five member Guyanel Tapa recently reached out to my office regarding the New York City Department of education I met with him in my office, where he relayed that the current city curriculum has misinformation on the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama, also known as Buddha I understand that CB5 District manager, Gary Giordano, has played an instrumental role in this and that the Department of education has acknowledged that they will work on fixing the issue. Hopefully we see some resolution on this before the start of the new school year. The City Council continues to operate remotely. We recently held hearings on topics from how the city will disperse the Covid-19 vaccine to issues of street accessibility on Friday, the Criminal Justice Committee will hold a hearing on a bill that would eliminate punitive segregation in city jails. I believe that this bill would lead to an increase in violence in city jails and I. Do not support it. As chair of the technology committee in the New York City Council next week, I will be hosting a hearing on cloud computing and how using the cloud could make government services cheaper and more effective. Should anyone have input on future hearings in the technology realm? Please do not hesitate to reach out I wish all of you a happy Hanukkah, a Merry Christmas and a happy new year and I look forward to working with community Ward 5 in the year 2021, as always feel free to contact my office with any of your questions or concerns. Thank you again for your continued dedication to our communities and I hope to see all of you soon signed by Robert, F, Holden, City, Council, member district 30. and the last statement. We received this from the Office of Assembly member Brian Bondwell from Olessa Herrera. Our office hopes everyone in their families had a nice Thanksgiving assembly when Assemblyman Barnwell and our team would like to thank the community for donating to our annual turkey drive. We are happy to have donated turkeys to families in need, and we again thank everyone who participated as a reminder. Our office will also be holding a toy drive for families in need. Since our office remains closed due to Covid-19, all donations can be set up by calling us at 718-651-3185 or emailing Barnwell B at NY Assembly.Gov. Please note that the last day to donate will be December 21st. If you or anyone you know, needs help with any issue. Please do not hesitate to reach out to our office. We wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season. Gary and Vinnie Joe Nosorino has something as well. Oh I'm sorry, don't be sorry. Since my boss talked I, figured that very quickly parent advisory board meeting is tomorrow at 6:00 p.m. It's virtual! You go onto our website and you will sign in for that. I will send Gary and Vinnie the link to it tomorrow morning, but that's 6 p.m. Tomorrow and then I just wanted to wish you all happy holidays. I have to tell you as I travel the borough for the borough president. It is a pleasure to serve this board as I tell Vinnie and Gary all the time you guys are second to none, I mean don't tell other boards that just in case I tell them the same thing. But clearly you should know that from the bottom of my heart pleasure working with you guys happy holidays to all of you. Thank you. Gary. You have a statement from officer bearish for a report from him. Vinnie Rich and Ken have their hands up too yeah. Well, I'm finished what I'm doing and now yeah Vinnie I do not have an a statement from officer barrage, okay, so rich Huber, you have something lower your hand and speak. Yes, I just like to comment regarding councilman Holden's statement with regard to graffiti our community, the 104th Community Board. Five has always worked very hard against graffiti, just as a FYI. Recently I was told I, don't know if it was the councilman's office or the 104th that they are no longer allowed to put convictions together with Tet similar tags, with expert testimony from an analysis from a police officer who has expertise and tags. So we're not getting the appropriate convictions that we used to, and I'd also just like to say thank you to the councilman's office, because there have been some tags around here and I called up his office and they addressed it and had it cleaned up. So thank you very much for the time. Thank you. Rich Kenny, yeah blowing your hand Ken. Oh I'm sorry, okay, go ahead. Yeah joe I was just wondering if the president had any idea. Is there any way to tell us what the difference is between indoor dining, this I should say the safety of indoor, dining and the safety of these new tents and wooden structures that are almost you know completely sealed, okay. So what is the you know? What do they have to do to make us? Keep us safe. I. Certainly couldn't answer that question too bad Jessica wasn't here from the mail. I will end his opinion. Oh sorry, Vinny they came out with a winter snow alert for cafes in the street to bulk them up, provide barricades, build enclosures and when they get a snow warning like today was flurries. They would warn them and when it snows, they would warn them. They recommend that they don't have customers in while the plows are moving and that they take their equipment in so in case they do get damaged. It's not really bad, but they told them to bulk them. Up. I saw one the other day that was fully enclosed in plywood, yeah and they're, also along those lines and yes, Vinny they're, making the ones that are more than eight feet adhere to eight feet because of that reason, with plowing coming up, let's see how that plays out. Okay, anyone else can I ask one like what I notice is like Vinnie. You must have noticed Stampedish they put up a new tent today, yeah, it's like cold. It looks more like an indoor room, it's a wedding, tent yeah, it's lit. It will be heated by electrical heat, air forced air, so that doesn't fall into the category, the ones on the street. Oh, no. What I meant is the ventilation that we have enough ventilation. It's going to have a duct system. Okay, thank you. Okay, anything else on that all right, Don has his hand up Donald yeah, there's a thing on the newspaper just today that if there's going to be a 12-inch deep blizzard, they have to completely remove their structures from the street all together, so that the street can be plowed. That'll, be interesting, see him pull up the whole thing because they're pretty permanent, they built them yeah, but I've seen the plows come through and they could easily demolish this stuff. If there's a heavy storm, they won't even see the thing when they plow into it. Okay, rich has his hand up again go ahead, real quick just to clarify what you were saying: Vinnie. They have electric heaters at some stamptis, so there are no fumes from any gas or propane or anything like that. Anything else, Vinnie before we go any further somebody's called in three five: four: two: zero nine yeah I, don't know who that is identify yourself, please you're, muted, as well, and I'm trying to mute you and I can't. Okay, then turn them off. Well, they're, muted, well, I mean delete them. If they don't want to speak, delete them all right Vinnie. Is that me I, don't know? Yes, who are you who is me Eileen, Maloney, okay, please try and identify yourself in the future, because it's if we don't get a response, we're going to delete you. Okay, all righty, anything. Anyone else. If not mark will go to the chairperson's report. Could we get her off the screen at least who finally mute yourself? Please mute myself. Okay, I got it all right! Thank you. Agenda, backup, walk, okay, so we're at the chat presents report. That's me Vincent or Curie. Before we get into it Laura. Will you please call the roll or double check the roll? Okay, Boo Banasha at Hikari Bubanashore at Hikari I know: I saw you there earlier yeah, I'm sorry that was mute. Present. Okay, Vinnie I know you're. Here, Tony Benanti, Eric, Butkowitz, Bob, Chamelli I, see you there Bob Walter, Clayton, yeah, Patty, Crowley I, know President Ryan Dooley, here, Jerry Drake, not here, Demetro Fakowski, not here, Steve Fiedler, not here, yeah, rich uber, no you're here present Paul Kirzner president here John Meyer President. What happened to Mike Liendo he's I know he wasn't there because he told us he wasn't coming Patricia Maltezos President, Edgar, Mantell, President, Kathy, Massey, President, Eileen, Maloney, I, know you're here, Eileen Margaret, O'cain, Peggy, I, know you're here who's here, Michael O'kane, here, Don Passantino, President, Mike, Porcelli, yeah, Ken Redberger, here Ted Renz presents Calvin Rodriguez, not here: Luis Rodriguez, President, Lee, Rottenberg, Walter, Sanchez, yeah, Carmen, Santana, no Dennis Steffen, here, Kathy Sumski, Megan, Tatio, no guy Nell, Fappa prison, Barbara, Toscano, President, Patrick Trancasey, here, Mickeleen, Von, Draven, no Marianna, zero, President, Nan, Zhang, okay and we have our staff Gary, Giordano and Laura Mulville and Joe Nacerino is here so under the chairman's report it has. The minutes. Do I, have a motion to accept the minutes or anyone. Rich Hube has got his hand up to accept and make a motion to accept second ocean. So the next item then, is review of liquor and alcoholic beverage licenses and building notices. Laura. Would you take that please? Okay, so under new liquor licenses we have cabanas Jorge Restaurant Corp at 688, Seneca Avenue. In Ridgewood we have the fresh pond cocktail club LLC at 6418, fresh pond road in Ridgewood, under wine and or beer license renewals, we have Frank Kowaliczynski Post 4 at 61-57, Massboth Avenue in Massbith, and we have Zenith Tie Inc at 70-02, Freshpond Road, 60-98 70th avenue in Ridgewood. The City Diner Corp at 6535Grand Avenue will be submitting a change of class application from a restaurant wine. Beer and cider license to an on-premise full liquor license. As far as demos go, we have only one actually in Woodside at 51-51 69th place, and that is it okay. Thank you. Just looking for my phone all right, the next item of business I think that's it. Anyone have anything for the chair. Okay, if not Gary Giordano the district manager's report. Well, first I wish you all a wonderful holiday season and I'm sorry that we've been meeting remotely or virtually for I guess this is the ninth month. Well, we didn't meet in August, so the eighth month and I know it's been hard and I miss the camaraderie of being at the board meetings at Christ, the king or wherever we would hold them. Otherwise, I think we just need to be a little bit more patient. Do what we're supposed to do as far as wear a mask and social distance and wash our hands a lot and stay home if we're sick and now that a vaccine is here at least we'll start to make some inroads on people, not catching this beastly by terrorists. Sorry about that, so God bless you and your family and I hope you do the best you can in the holiday season, and you have some joy. Well look for the joy as far as what's going on in the neighborhood. We continue to have that big sewer project on 70th street, from Calamus Avenue to the l.I.e and then along 69th street, where they're really doing other enormous work going north toward Queens Boulevard. There was a big cave in as I think. Most of you know on 70th street, pretty much at the top of the hill about 52nd Avenue along the that big sewer project, where they're doing the micro, tunneling I think was on the front page of one of the newspapers where a vehicle actually fell in there and I. Think it's still under investigation as to whether or not the work done with regard to the sewer project is the reason for the cave-in I had a little bit of a difficult time with them, because they wanted to have the contractor go in and work on, Grand Avenue, beginning right about after Thanksgiving and I said to them. There's no way you should be on Grand, Avenue or any commercial street during the holiday season. So they are going to do very little work on Grand Avenue, because they've got to go from 69th lane to I think 72nd place with two sewer chambers, each of which is about 30 feet in diameter and they're going to be deep, maybe as far down as 60 foot deep, so they're not going to do. They say they're not going to do much work on Grand Avenue until after Christmas, so that's a win for us and don't forget, put your garbage out and you're recycling out the night before your collection, because I saw where I live, that they picked up during the midnight shift. So if I would have waited till the morning, I would have had a lot of miscollection. So please continue to do that and I wish you all the best. Oh one other thing we're so we're planning on starting a Facebook page early next year. I, don't think it'll be the type of page where you know we're commenting back and forth. I. Think I, don't want that. I! Think it'll more or less be our opportunity to get what we would like to get out to the public. So we're aiming I, don't want to say, shooting I'm a pacifist when it comes to that thing: we're aiming for early January or sometime in January to start a Facebook page, which I think Mark Moss is helping us with any questions all right. Thank you! Well, Gary, just the thing about shooting New Jersey had its highest bear shoot in history this year, oh baby, okay, so if there's no questions or go to committee reports, rich has his hand up. Oh god, rich real, quick Gary. A lot of people have been banned from Facebook. Would you would we also be considering opening up a parlor page as well for those of us who don't do Facebook or have been banned from that any comments? Opening up what a parlor page I, don't know what that is. I, don't know that we could discuss that at another time. It's not a consideration that I know about at this point in time. Send us the information and we'll look it up. Thank you, okay. So the first committee report is zoning. The land use Walter yep here, I am rich. Were you just telling us that you were banned from Facebook? No I think that I've never had made a terrific presentation, powerpoint presentation of the zoning for coastal Zone Resiliency Text amendment that they had and they she presented it to us again at the committee and they'd like us to vote in favor of it. We really did not have any concerns with it doesn't present too much in our community board other than Newtown Creek, and it's designed to really protect the areas around the waterfront. So we ask you to vote in favor of their plan at city planning. No, my hand was up before this. It wasn't on this. It was on what rich Hubba was saying. Okay, you know about what he was talking. Absolutely he's, 100 correct you go into Facebook, which is old news instead of new news. Okay, so give us a report on that. If you would please not now, no okay, thank you. Walter continue! I'm asking for a vote of confidence, a vote, no objection to this. What is it called again? Zoning for coastal Zone Resiliency text presented by city planning great sorry. This is for coastal diligence, test Resiliency Coastal, Zone Resiliency text for the zoning. In zoning for New York City- and it basically is done to protect, she made a presentation last month to the whole entire board. Remember she talked about how we're going to protect the areas around the waterfront for future flooding over the next 100 years. Correct so that they're having you know, they're having properties around it, do certain things to protect the properties and the people from flooding correct for our boat. The Mass fifth area nearby is correct. Yeah, those areas very good. Okay, Gary. You want to call a roll on this Mr Atticari, yes, Sir, okay, yeah, Princeton, Mercury, not I, can't I, don't want to say no, but I'm not I have to follow my own rules and regulations, not in favor of it because, don't just say no or yes: okay, no Eric Bakkerwicz, yes, Bob Shimelli, yes, Walter Clayton, yes, Patty Crowley, yes, Brian Dooley! Again, are you against? Yes, Dimitro Fitkowski? Yes, rich Huber, Rich, Uber, no Paul, Kirsner, Paul, Kirzner, Kanga, Karzina, Marianne Latanzio, yes, Ed Latou, yes, John Meyer! Four! Thank you John, because it's very hard, sometimes to tell the difference between yes and against so for or against, would be preferable. Patricia Maltesos or thank you. Edgar Mantel for Kathy Massey for Eileen Maloney, Eileen, Peggy, Okay, four Michael O'kane. Four, you get me Eileen Maloney. What did you say she said? I said four: okay, thank you: Don Passantino for Mike Porcelli or Ken Rayberger or Ted Wrens or Luis Rodriguez or Walter Sanchez for Dennis Stefan, Guyanel, Tapa, Poor, Robert, Toscano Barbara. Thank you, Patrick Trinchesi Marianna, zero! Four! Thank you Fred! Oh, we just came in yeah and Paul Kirzner. Did we get you I, don't see Paul anymore, it would his wife, okay yeah, but it right Mary Ellen. It would be all right. So let me clarify hold on Gary Laura. You had something yes, I just wanted to say that Tony Benanti came in as well. I, don't know if you got her I didn't Tony. Did you hear what we're voting on yeah? He can see you right. Yes, on a piece of paper, he's muted wall's, not muted. Now, okay, yes, say no you're, not muted. You can talk. Yes, okay, all right, we got Paul all right, so Vinnie. Let me clarify good. There are three votes to my knowledge against. Okay, that's what I'm showing you Vincent R Curie, Brian, Dooley and Rich Huber correct right. Those are the three votes in opposition: correct. Okay, thank you anything else. Walter! Yes, there's a people showed up representatives of the property at 1086, Cypress Avenue yesterday and they're just having preliminary meetings with city planning on changing the zoning. So they came to us to get our thoughts on it. It's a corner property, Cypress Avenue. They want to change it from an m14 to an R6B and basically it's they want to change the height. They want to go up to 40 feet, 34 apartments and they will have 17 parking spots across the street. They have a property across the street where they will have enough parking for 17 cars. If they get infill zoning, they will be able to have 17 more apartments and they'll add some more parking. So we had you know pretty long discussion. They know we're really concerned with parking. They plan to build it, affordable and so they're gonna go for that zoning change. They're gonna come they have to come to the committee with their entire application, but they just wanted to get a feeling from us, and you know, as we said, it really wasn't too far out of character with what's on the block. There are several other buildings that will go up three stories to four stories, but that's it. So if you can go take a look at that property, anybody on the board, 1086 Cypress Avenue. It's the carpet place right, yep, okay, anything else! No next committee is transportation and public transit against John yeah Vinnie. We had our last meeting just before our last community board meeting since we met later in November, so I don't really have anything to report back right now. I would like to say if we could take a minute of silence for a past member of our committee that wasn't on the board, but was an active member of our community Roland Belay, who passed away at the end of November. So if we could take a moment, thank you folks. Thank you. Did we ever notify Broadway stages that we're not doing take not taking a position and if they want to go direct to D.O.T I mean that's what we told them at the last meeting? Okay, they know that I don't know that we had a formal message to them. Okay, they heard that from the committee all right, very good I have a library committee report on the status of Glendale branch. Construction is currently back in progress, delivery and installation date of the exterior book. Return machine has not been confirmed, so that's holding up part of it. Verizon is expected to provide all of the needed connectivity for all the computers and everything else. Regulatory agency inspections are yet to be scheduled so before you can get a to see a amended Cfo, they have to have the inspections and the fire department. Inspection also still expects substantial completion to occur on or about April 28th I think there would also be then a month of fit up, so it could be opening in June. If everything is okay, it was one of the few libraries that was allowed to continue under construction. Any questions or comments, rich, has his hand up Richie, yes, just curious the book or the after hours book return. Will that be on the top of the stairs or will that be at the new handicap entrance? Do you know I forget rich I did know, but I forgot, I assume it will be on the where the handicap entrance is okay. Thank you. You're welcome anything else. Any other committees I failed to recognize tonight. Fred has his hand up Fred howler go ahead. Fred you have to unmute Fred the flag is in tatters. That flies above the library looks like it's been through the war. Is there any chance that could get replaced? I will send out that message as soon as we're done. Thank you anything else. Okay, any other committees, all right, any old business, any new business, if not I like to wish everyone happy Hanukkah Merry Christmas, whatever that other one is yeah motion to adjourn all right, very disappointed that we're not going to get any of Tony's donuts that she's been years past. So you could, if you walk in there and spend some money. Okay, well, I want to thank the staff for an excellent job. They've done Mr Jordano. There are no further meetings until the new year. Is that correct? Or it is yes, Sir, okay, so the next meeting is January 13, so, okay, next minute, January 13th, thank you. Everyone stay safe, stay. Healthy recommendation is to get tested for both the virus and antibodies. Okay, Vinnie can I, say something over and ahead key things. First, thank you. Everybody for the year. Secondly, I just got tested today, Laguardia Airport, Terminal, B parking garage in and out of 30 minutes. I should have the results in 24 to 48 hours. Great well, I had my test at 11:30 this morning and at 5:30 I got the phone call giving me my results, though yeah that's a little different I heard over at the overlook in forest park. You can get it very quickly, also like no not really I tried that bread yesterday and I almost froze to death. You know, luckily, my daughter-in-law got it today and there was nobody there. No one actually walked right through it was so slow. It took. I was third person in line had two lines to register and it took them 20 minutes to register a person. Then you had to go to the other end of the park to get the test. Oh okay, I was better. Today he was lucky very good. I found New York Health and yeah New, York Health and hospital court twice and the second time they had the turnaround for the results in 17 hours, so they're getting better at the result and, like I said you could still go to white golf on. We have the testing center there. That's a commercial, so I guess I owe everybody a dollar right. You bring them a fruitcake yeah. He has an urgent care there on Myrtle and I. Think it's 78th street. Yes, 15 minutes! Otherwise you, if you want to wait, it's I think a week, but it's free right that I, don't know, he's my regular doctor. It's either free or paid for by your medic Medicaid Medicare right! No, who cares it's not covered by it's not covered by private insurance? No, if you go to an urgent care to get the rapid test, there's one on fresh palm road as long as you're going only for a Covid-19 test, you show them your insurance, whatever it is, and you will not get billed, but if you go for a visit and everyone good night. Thank you very much. Let's hope 21 is better than 20. You.
