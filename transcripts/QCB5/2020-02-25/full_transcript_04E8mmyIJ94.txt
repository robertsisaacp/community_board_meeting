Testing one two: okay good to go good to go yeah so good evening. Everyone. This is a committee meeting of Community Board 5, it's the combined public transit and transportation Services committee meeting. This is where all the work gets done at committees. We're experimenting tonight because usually a committee meeting is any off its small group, the members some audience people come and visit with us tonight. We opened it up Lajja and we're also podcasting it for the first time. So welcome anyone. That's watching! We the way we work, the committee and whatever transportation or service group presents to us or has questions or needs from us. We sit together and chat back and forth. Sometimes at the transportation committee people come with traffic safety requests so usually just call them in or mail a mint. Occasionally we invite those people to come to the committee and present talk to us. If we have any questions so tonight, be that our big subject is the bus routes. It's good. It's massive believe me its massive. It's going to take a long time and we're here, the committee's are here to gather information and concerns. So what we're going to ask MTA to pass out some cards if you have any concerns or recommendations? Some people out of here I'd ask you to fill out on the card, and then the committee will collect it later and we'll study them and get back to you or incorporate them in our studies. Okay, so you can hand those cards out. Please, as I said, it's a combined committee, public transportation and threads it's via public stream, the public transit and transportation. You have a microphone John where you need one okay, so I'm going to turn the meeting over to the co- chairs of the public, Transit Services Committee and you could watch us work. Thank you, hello. Folks, hello folks from the MTA I recognized a couple faces. Some of you are new faces. We've been looking at this for a while, as you can see, I have a nice stack of your paper already. The plan is quite comprehensive. It's not necessarily, as you've probably have heard in various meetings. It's not what everybody wants has a little bit of things that people like it's got a few things. They've got a lot of people concerned, I think in our community. We've already heard that some of the residential lines are really problematic in their disappearance. I know, personally, a lot of my natural use of the bus routes and Queens are turning from a one seat: ride into a multi seat. Ride I think you've also heard some elements of being a little too trained specific, getting buses just kind of staying on grid, getting people to trains, but that's not the way buses have historically been used in Queens, but in that let's hear what you guys have to say about the plan. I do know that this is the first iteration and correct me if I'm saying anything wrong here. The first iteration draft there's going to be another draft and we still do not have a native time for implementation, so that gives us both hope and it gives us a feeling that you are literally listening to people and trying to take feedback to build a better plan. So with that, should we turn it over to the MTA to do their presentation hold on a second. You guys do not want to see the maps all right so we'll hand some out to you. Thank you could take them home with you just for clarification. This is the PowerPoint in print form correct. So what we're going to see on the screen is also in these, so and people, if you end up with one, please share, take them home and there is hopefully a link in this presentation for feedback on the Lund web and the last slide just so in case. You want to hear that so good evening. Everyone, my name, is Howie Lavine I'm from New York, City, Transit I, know I'm just coming around the table. My name is Howie Lavine I'm from New York, City, Transit government, community relations, Department here to talk about the Queen's bus Network redesigned tonight. Thank you so much for having us. It took a lot of my talking points just want to stress that this is a draft plan. This is our first look, our first stab at redesigning the bus network in Queens. There will be future iterations of this, but right now we're here purely to present to you. What's in the plan and to get feedback, we really want as much feedback as possible, the more granular at the better. That's how we learn. You know what works, what people like, and also what people do not like in this plan and that's what we're here tonight to get so with that I'll start the presentation and I'm joined tonight by Eric and durian members of our bus planning team, as well as Kate from government relations and who is right there. So this process began in May with public outreach. We did open houses asking people what they liked, what they did not like about bus routes in Queens. We have a number of those throughout the borough, there's a picture of one right up there and we combined from what we heard there and a lot of data into the existing conditions report, which was released in September, which was kind of where we laid out exactly what was what we were seeing with the bus network in Queens. What was working, what was not working and what we could use and use that document to build upon for the draft plan and that was released in September. The draft plan was released in late December. Following that we've been doing tons and tons of. We were at over 60 different meetings throughout the borough, looking into different public input, whether that's workshops or presentations like this one, we've been doing that now we're doing that in the coming months. As the chair mentioned, there's no planned implementation date for these changes again. We're in a draft there'll be a proposed final plan later we do not have an exact date for when that will occur, but there's no implementation day we're here to gather feedback as much as we can and then you so to conclude a little bit no implementation date gathering as much feedback as possible. Now, with that I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, Eric who's going to take us through the rest of the slides, all right, perfect, so yeah. So like how I said my name's Eric bird I'm on the planning team for both the Queen's Network redesigned and also the Brooklyn redesign, we got both of those going on at the same time right now, so how he gave a brief mention about all of our outreach that we've done so far and really with the initial part of our outreach, the open houses that we held back previous of last year. We really we took in a lot of comments and everything like that. We wanted to really combine them into four key categories that we could try and tackle with the new network. One of those was reliable service. A big thing that we heard is that buses were not. They were not showing up on time. They were, they were running off scheduled they were, you know you could not really just show up and have it show up or you could not show up to the bus stop and the buses boom right there waiting for you. So we really wanted to try and tackle that, along with improving travel times, we heard from a lot of people that takes them a really long time to get to their destination. The routes are very windy. It's trying to serve a lot of different purpose with one route, so we really tried to tackle that as well. Another thing was improved connections, not only within the borough, but to place outside the borough. Like Brooklyn, we heard it's. Why do I have to go through Manhattan to get from Queens to Brooklyn? We've been hearing that a lot, so that was one of the big things that he tried to tackle in the last one was ease of use. You open up a map right now, it's very confusing, so what we tried to do is really tried to simplify it as much as possible that way as we're moving forward again how I said this is a process. This is just a stage in the process, so this is really introducing people to what this new network could look like and really trying to walk people through that. So when we talk about sort of our core I guess strategies in terms of redesigning the network and how we achieve those for customer priorities that we laid out first, one is making sure that our routes are as straight as possible. The more turns that a bus makes the more opportunities it has to get stuck in congestion, get stuck in traffic. It has to wait to make a left turn and things like that all cascades throughout the network, and it really makes our buses unreliable and it slows down your trip as well. Another thing is figuring out the best location for bus stops. Now this is really sort of a balance, because a lot of people obviously rely on a stop, that's right near to them, and that's great, but also the more steps that you have along a route. The more of the bus is stopping and it's going to be slowing down your trip. So we want to find the right balance between offering that accessibility that everyone's used to, but also speeding up trips, where we can. So it's not necessarily a one-, size- fits-, all distance standard that we're applying. It's making sure that makes sense for different parts of the route in different parts of the borough. Another thing is the enhanced connectivity that I was talking about just making sure that were providing direct access to important trip. Generators like colleges and universities really tried to make sure that we were beefing up frequency to key locations like that and, like I, said, providing new connections to Brooklyn and Queens. Another thing is really focusing that frequency in the correct locations. This is the first time we've done a real holistic look at the entire bus Network. It's been a lot of piecemeal tweaks and things like that and that's created a pretty jointed Network. So we're really trying to make sure that this is very cohesive, that everything sort of blends together. So what are reencountering or what have we encountered in terms of redesign the network? Some of the challenges? The first thing is you look at a map like this and we see a bunch. It's a tangled mess, I think somebody referred to as dumping a bowl of spaghetti on the ground and that's essentially what the best network looks like right now. Another limitation, the network right now, is that most of the routes go to the same three places: they go to downtown Flushing, downtown Jamaica and Long Island City, the Queens Plaza area. So we want to make sure that we're providing access not just to those three areas, because we know that people are trying to get to many different destinations throughout the borough. Another thing that just touched down was the bus stops making sure that they're the correct distance to provide the access and also speed up trips where possible. Another challenge is just the overall performance of our buses. We see overcrowded buses, bunch buses, we've seen our bus speeds decline and that's due to a lot of different issues, but one of those is the overall design of the routes themselves. So, with this new network, we're really hoping to hit those four customer priorities, and we realized that the network, as is right now, does not necessarily do a perfect job of that. But that's the point of a draft is to get things started and gather the feedback and really take that as we move forward. So the first thing is simplifying that network and really providing that reliable service by having these routes that are as straight as possible, so they're not getting caught in traffic they're, not getting caught congestion, they're just able to stay in a straight line and move as reliably as possible and then another way to help speed up those trips like I talked about is the balanced bus stops fewer turns, and also working with our folks at D- O- T to implement better bus priority throughout the borough as well, and then sort of the better connections was another thing I touched on and also the ease- of- use, creating that grid where possible, so that you can see where those easy connections are. The way that our network is set up right now is not necessarily for a transfer based system. So that's why you'll see right now you have to wait a little bit longer than you should for your bus to show up if you're taking another bus or something like that. So that's this process is making sure that not only the routes match, but also the schedules as well, and making sure that we're having a more transfer based system that those connections are showing up on time. So it's a pretty seamless, pretty seamless opportunity. So when we talk about a blank slate approach and that's really what we've been taking with the network as we've been redesigned, the network is really building from scratch, using the public input that we've gathered so far along with the existing data. Obviously, the data does not say the entire story. We need to get on the ground and hear from folks, and we've been doing that so far and we'll be continuing that throughout the process most of the routes, we totally understand, they look unfamiliar. They serve different areas differently and I. Think it's not necessarily good or bad. It's just different I think it's a lot of this is education and making sure that we're presenting it the right way that way we're making informed decisions as we move forward, whether or not we're going to be tweaking a lot or less of this network that we have out right now and as I've been touching out. A big part of that is the public input. How I mentioned that we've had about, or we will be having about 60 overall meetings, gathering that public input throughout this entire process. So we're really making sure that we're listening to what we need to be changing and making sure that's. Customer driven a big portion of this project is working with D-, O-, T and figuring out those locations for bus priority. We want to make sure that in areas where we're, where we're focusing our frequency that we're giving our buses the best chance to really move people as quickly as possible, so it's things like the Red Bus Lanes Transit signal priority which gives buses a head start at intersections. There's a lot of different items in the toolbox that we can use to help speed buses up. So when we talk about the draft plan overall, so just some things to touch on the stop locations that you see, those are generalized stop locations, you'll just see an intersection, so we at this stage of the process. We do not know whether or not it's going to be a near or far sight, stop or anything like that. We're just at the stage where we're just proposing these very generalized locations and as we move throughout the process, you'll be seeing more and more detail with those stop locations. The frequencies that you as well, those are pretty conservative frequencies again just because of the stage of the project that we're at. We do not have fully finalized schedules or anything like that. So you're not really seeing the peak of the peak frequencies right now. These are very generalized over broad time windows. So as we as we release next iterations of the of the plan you'll be seeing, those will be a lot more fleshed out a lot more detailed and this graphic right here. It shows do those fewer lines on a map mean less service and that's not necessarily the case. If you have four routes that are running, you know, 30 minutes, 20, minutes frequencies or something like that. That's even though you're seeing a lot of lines, that's not necessarily a lot of service. If we can consolidate that service on to one line and work with D- O- T to identify bus priority improvements, we can really improve travel along a corridor with fewer actual lines while improving service. So here's a map of the zoomed in location that we're sort of in right. Now these are a list of routes as well that are serving the area and I'll be going over the route profiles as well later on in the presentation, you'll see the colors on here, the colors. They actually mean something now, so we have blue route, which blue routes, which are sort of like current SBS routes, where those stops are pretty far spaced apart, they're connecting key destinations so that way, people that these are built for those really long trips to get people to and from as quickly as possible. So the bus is not stopping as much in between you also see red routes. Those are very frequent routes. Those are buses that are connecting again high demand areas and those are showing up. You know every six or so minutes in throughout the day to really provide that high frequency grid. Purple routes are sort of mini Express routes where they'll make where they'll make local stops along a certain part of a route and then LLL go Express sort of Express, where I'll make one or two stops before it gets to a key destination like downtown Jamaica, Flushing or a key subway station, or anything like that, and then the green routes. Those are sort of localized routes where they sort of fill in the gaps. For all these other routes that are straight and they're. You know the stops are a bit more spaced out. So sorry, yes, Oh apps, absolutely it should be there for sure yeah, and that does not mean that we're ignoring or anything like that, just yeah for sure yeah. Definitely so this map, right here on the this shows sort of how our service has changed. Broadly you'll see, yellow means, that's actually new locations that were running service blue indicates areas that we've maintained service, that buses are still running along those corridors and then gray shows routes that we've moved off of that corridor to help straighten out routes and provide more direct connections. So the proposed local routes in this area that we heard that we wanted to touch on today, where the q11 queue 18Q, 21:29, 38, 39:47, 52 and 53, SBS, 55:58, 59 and 67, so, like I, said I'll, be going over a certain route profiles and those are routes that have taken up Porsche that have not necessarily replaced overall but have taken up portions of those routes, and this is a route conversion chart that we have online as well. That shows the old routes. It shows the main streets that ran on and then which of the new routes are running along that portion of the street for that route. This next map this shows our proposed express bus improvements. So, as you can see, there's actually not much. That's changing, there's a few routings that are that are not necessarily the same as they are now, but that we're essentially serving the same area with these different routes, so yeah so I'll start and go through some of the route profiles that we have identified here. All these are online you'll, be seeing these exact same things online. So right here this is the QT 4. So, as you can see, we have the title the name of the route up there, and then we have previously the B 57 Q 18 and queue 47. So that does not mean that it covers every single part of those three routes. It means that for the most part, it's picking up the main portions of those routes. So as you as you look online and you see that Route Conversion Chart take a look and see the new routes that are listen, you can try and figure out what your new trip would look like in the new network, so this route is going from downtown Brooklyn up to Jackson Heights, the 74th Street Station. This is one of those blue routes that again, it does not have many stops in between, but it's really just geared towards getting people from Brooklyn to Queens as quickly as possible. This is the Qt6. This is previously the queue 58. This is running from Ridgewood Terminal to Flushing Main Street, it's one of those blue routes that that's really just about moving people quickly throughout these key corridors. This one right here is the QT ten. This is going from Liguria Terminal A down to Rio Park Queens Boulevard. This is one of those red routes that are very frequent a little bit more, a few more stops in between the new blue route, but still it's about moving people as quickly as possible, with these straight routes and with the added frequency as well, and that's taking up portions of the queue 23 and the queue 33. This is the update, QT 52, so this is obviously taking over for the queue 52 and the queue 53 SPS. This is going from down and down the Rockaways Beach 54Th Street up to Elmhurst, Woodhaven Boulevard down to or up to Queens Center. So this is again one of those blue routes trying to get people quickly from the Rockaways up to a key destination up to Queens Center. This is the QT 55. If you'll see a few of these routes, they have the same number as a previous route. That's because not much of that has changed. This is one of those examples with the QT 55 which is taking over for the Q 55. So really, the only difference with this is we're running from Ridgewood Terminal and we're sending it over to Jamaica. This is the cutie 58. Obviously, that used to be the cue 58 there's a few differences with this. It's essentially the same running from Myrtle Wyckoff, along Corona, up to 108 Street and then we're having it run north on 108th up to Roosevelt and then extending into Flushing that you'll see in the previous slide. I pointed out the cutie six, so that's taking over for the southern portion or excuse me the easternmost portion of the old cue 58, so are you're still having that access you're. Still having that connection to Flushing and these routes are, you know they're, since they have different colors they're having different uses for the route. This one is red so or excuse me this one is green I believe so this one is a little bit more, a few more stops in between the blue route as fewer stops, and it's just getting people from A to B as quickly as possible. This is the cutie 59 again. This is previously the cue 59, so this one is running from Rego Park Queens Boulevard out to Williamsburg Bridge, and this is one of those green routes, so you're, seeing a few more stops in between to provide that access in between any of these red and blue routes that are leaving some gaps in the network. That's covered up by some of these green routes, if I'm just cycling through some routes, that's because they do not necessarily pertain to this area, so just trying to make sure it's as tailored to this portion as possible, so the cutie 63. This is this is key because this, the southernmost portion of the cutie 63, is covering for the northern portion of the old cue 53, so the old cue 53 went all the way to Woodside, so the cutie 63 is extending from that's coming from Astoria or Long Island City. Excuse me down to Rego Park Queens Boulevard, so you're, making you're connecting with the cutie 52 right there to still provide that access along that portion of the cue 53 that we're not serving with that same route. This is the cutie 75. This is a bit of a zigzaggy route. That's meant to really fill in gaps in the network that we're trying to make sure that we're providing as much access as possible. This is taking up portions of the queue 32 q39 and queue 104. This bus. This route actually goes into Manhattan. We have it's going down into Midtown on 42Nd Street and that's coming eastbound into Woodside along Northern Boulevard. Now this is the QT 77 going from Long Island City to Elmhurst, and this is previously the queue 38 q39 and q67. It's picking up portions of all those routes. Another one of those green routes: that's having more stops in between to provide that access. This is the QT 78, if I'm going too fast. Just let me know this is the QT 78, so this is going from Roosevelt Island down to middle village. This is picking up portions of the Q18 and Q 66 another one of those green routes. That again, is having more stops in between to provide that access. This is the QT 80, which was previously the QT 18. Excuse me the Q 18 and the Q 39, so this is going from Astoria, 2Nd, Avenue and 2Nd Street down to Ridgewood terminal to the right access from a story at to Ridgewood. This is the QT 82 which is taking over for portions of the Q 23 and the Q 29. This is going from East Elmhurst down to Myrtle Avenue 81St Street you'll see it's coming down, Penelope down there down 80th and again. This is another green route. Providing more stops in between this is the QT 83. So this is running along Woodhaven, along with the QT 52, so the QT 52 is one of those blue routes which has fewer stops in between this is a sort of a more coverage route that provides more stops in between for people that are trying to get along Woodhaven Boulevard. So that's running from down at Howard Beach up to Elmhurst, and this is the QT 88. This is just taking over for the eastern and western portions of the Q 11 and the Q 21. And yes, so that's another one, those green route, that's providing coverage in that area, so these are some of the express routes that are taking order for the current express routes. This is the Qmt 100. This is taking over for a portion of the queue and 25. This is running along Elliott, Avenue and then coming down or going into downtown. This is the Qmt 101. This is again picking up four portions of the QM. Excuse me yeah, QM 25. This is bringing along Myrtle up to Fresh, Pond and then running along Metropolitan and then down into downtown. This is the Qmt 130, which is previously yeah. Sorry this is taking over four portions of the Qm 34, so this is running along Elliott up to Woodhaven and then it's running providing the service along Third Avenue that the QN 34 currently does. This is the Qmt 31 on the this is running along Myrtle up to Fresh, Pond up Tele and then cutting it acrosss, it's not going over to Woodhaven. That portion is covered by the Qmt 130, so this one's just cutting acrosss getting into Manhattan a little bit quicker than it normally does, and this is running along 3Rd Avenue in Manhattan, just as the Eqm 34 does. The next two are taking over for the Qm 24. It's just. This is the qmt 160. This is running long Elliott up to Woodhaven and then, instead of going to 3Rd Avenue, this is going to 6th Avenue as the Qm 24 does right now, and then this is the Qmt 161, which is doing the same thing as the Qm 24 up from or over from myrtle up to Fresh Pond over to Elliott and then making that same quick cut over to over into Manhattan and that's serving 6Th Avenue. As the QM 24 does right now, so right now, I'm going to talk to you about our website and sort of ways to provide feedback. So that's our website right there, new, MTA, info/, Queen's bus redesign, that's where we have everything that I've been talking about tonight, you'll see we have this link right there that allows you to review these route profiles that I've been showing. We have Ralph's profiles for every single one of the new routes and we have this route conversion chart that I talked about previously. That shows the current route in one column, the primary Street that ran on and then the new route that picks up for that primary portion of that we have our full plan on there in PDF form. In case you want to read through all that again. It shows the shows the route profiles. It shows a little bit more of the explanation of the process and that's where you can find all of that. We also have interactive maps, we're using a website called remix, which is really great. It shows we have a link for our local proposed bus network and also for our Express proposed bus network, and with that, it's very interactive, you can click on and off each route. You can click and see the routing. You can click and see the proposed bus stops and we also have generalized frequencies as well for certain time periods throughout the day. So that's a really great resource to figure out, and you can see you know on the screen right there, you can see where your new route would be going. So this is a screenshot of what the website looks like. The main thing to point out is that up in this upper right hand corner. We have add a comment. That's one of the many ways to provide feedback on this plan, so you'll see in this sort of box right here. These are all the route, all the new routes that are listed and you can click on and off, whichever one that you're trying to trying to find more information about. This is showing the like I said, the generalized frequencies that we have shown. These are, for, like I, said, very generalized time windows, so these are not necessarily showing necessarily what you'll see this time: windows 5:30 to 9:00, so you know that's not necessarily showing when a bus will be showing up at 7:30 or 8:00 in the peak at the peak, but showing it generalized frequency for that time window. That's just showing the same thing again that box in the upper right hand corner is always there to provide a comment for us. This is really great. So this is a feature called Jane where you can drag from this up from this bottom right hand corner here, you can drag it to any location and it'll show the sort of how far you can go within 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and 60 minutes with the new network. So you can really see how we're expanding access with our new network. This is the box that you'll see once you click at a comment. As you can see, you can type all of your information right in there. You can provide your feedback and then send feedback and we're taking all that back where we're going through. All those comments and we're trying to figure out what are the tweaks that we're going to be need to be making as we move throughout the process. That's the message that you'll get once you've sent your feedback I'm, going to turn this back over to how we know thanks so much area. So just lastly, we're just talking about resources for our riders, so we've been doing public workshops which are different than the presentation we're giving here tonight where we sit down. We talk through this presentation and we give people. You know at a table and opportunity to sit with a bus planner and talk about what they want to see what they like, what they do, not like. We've been doing those and we actually, we were planning for two more of those in CB5. We were playing for one in Maspeth and we're planning for one in middle of village we're just finalizing those now, but when those are finalized, the dates the locations. Everything like that will be on our website, which I'll put up on the screen again in a moment, but it was in the presentation a number of times. We've been also been publicizing. This plan at subway stations doing on street outreach trying to get the word out about this plan at Pi/4 locations where people transfer to the subway as well, and then we're also been doing presentations like this at community boards and civic associations. So, lastly, this is just the timeline so, as I mentioned before, this is what's on our website. This is the proposed timeline we're revisiting this now, we've received a lot of feedback and we're very excited to get all that feedback and incorporate it into the next round the plan, but because of that, we're reeling at this timeline. So there's the key takeaway is that there's no implementation date we'll be coming back to you with the proposed final plan at some point and when we do we'll be doing all the same outreach we've been doing like this to community boards and others as well. So again just wanted in the bottom corner. Here is the website just again in case you need it and with that, I will turn it back over to the committee. Questions find a question. You mentioned the nearside, far side, I'm old I've, been on this committee for all these years, and the agencies, both DoD and MTA over the years, have insisted on one or the other. The one idea was that the bus, if it's a traffic signal at that corner, the bus should stop on a near side. If there's no signal that you go to the far side, is that still a policy? That's something we need to know, because if you're going to be shifting parking, especially at Ted Scott is a Business Improvement District, it could harm business and the other question was if the running tandem buses on certain routes. If it's a near side, stop it's going to take up twice as many spaces as the far side, and we can't afford that in the shopping district. So these are the kind of questions we want to look into. My other point is, and John will probably I intend to get into it is we have to take the people in the most efficient way to the court, so the people in Ridgewood, Glendale, Maspeth middle village when they go to jury duty? They go to Long Island City, they go to Queens Boulevard, they go to Jamaica and right now most of those are 3/2 three busts rights to get to them. We also have to get to the airports- it's not too bad, going to LaGuardia or JFK right now, but if you changing routes them may screw things up and then out parks. We are currently requesting that the b13 the extended to Highland Park, because we put in a lot of money into it and it's a destination location. So those are kind of things. Thank you piggyback on something that you just mentioned, and something that we've tried to express already to the MTA is an Eric. It's good to know that you're on both plans, because this area, especially our southern portion- and if you look at the proposed route now it seems like nothing, goes below Myrtle Avenue, even though our community board goes far below Myrtle Avenue. We rely on those B routes and you've built in some stuff within and expanded on some stuff, with some of these routes that run down to Williamsburg or into downtown Brooklyn. But we do need to have you come back with the Brooklyn plan, as it moves forward to talk to us about how it's impacting not only our members of our communities, but also the depots that we house, because we have two of them in this community board and we're going to want to know I mean right now. We've already just gone through a bus improvement on Fresh, Pond Road, which seems to be paying dividends, but it also highlighted too many people in the community. How impacted we are by dead- ended buses deadheaded buses that are not necessarily even serving this community, so we need to kind of figure out how to fair, share that equity kind of thing, I'd like to also emphasize the access to the Ridgewood reservoir. It's not even on the MTA subway map, and it should be it's a destination. It's a major bird fly over the Audubon bird map does not even have it on there, because you guys do not necessarily provide it as a as a known entity and it's very much growing. It's a teaching environment now, with the work that NYC H2O is doing they're. Advocating for this they've been at some of your workshops, we would like to build on that. We've been trying to get something to go there and that might come out of the Brooklyn redesign. It might come out of this somehow, but we definitely want to see that speaking of Jamaica I think there are some really good things and I emphasized a few more the hard things earlier that the people are having problems with the spacing of stops great opportunity to speed buses up. We all have our favorite stop. We might lose that I think we got to figure out how to live with some of that, because we know every time a bus pulls to the curb it gets harder to pull out. It slows it down. The bus spacing in New York City is far too close compared to national and international standards, so that can help create better service. The split for the cue 58 into a very fast line with very few stops and one that's a more local serving various parts of the route and changed at certain points is a great idea, and we really I personally like that. One thing I think you are kind of missing with the grid is you're emphasizing a little too much and I think you've heard it about the cue 44 and you'll hear it from me about the q50 for Parsons Archer. It does not do us good if we're going west I mean going east or coming back from the east moving west into our communities. You're missing the LIRR I mean you're, taking us on hillsides past the LIRR dropping us off in a way. That's not a walkable connection, it's not a doable. You know, I have to get on the subway for one ride back, that's an inconvenient is slow down that terminal at Jamaican't terminal, but that station at Jamaica needs to be more integrated. I think you've heard it on the queue forty- four because it currently serves that. But now it's been taken away in this proposal, so I just want to emphasize that too, because I think also the 55 going to Jamaica is a great thing. That extension. So we applaud you for that. I think I've been trying to throw into the mix and I know some of our community members have reached out to the MIDI and indicated an interest in small circulators and I know. That would be a possible future thing to try to figure out, because it would be an infrastructural thing because you'd have to get different buses, but right now the changes of the cue 38 and how it serves local communities in Middle Village. That's lost in a large degree that a circulator might help right to kind of serve some of these inner residential areas and get people, because, as soon as you'd make it harder for people to get to the bus you're going to turn them either to Uber or Lyft or their own car. And if we want to reduce congestion, we got to get people on shared transit. So anything that you can do with that is a positive yeah. Are we going to, though these are things that we want to get to them, but we need to have them- yep I'll, look through them any other committee. Members have questions Mr., Fur, dunce, dude good evening. I just want to say, I, understand all the work you're doing and that you want to speed up bus service reliable, but where I live, we have a big issue, 660 fifth place in Jeju. It's called the mess with the plateau right now we get two buses at the q18 in the q67. The new q67 will now be 17 to 18 blocks away. This is a big negative for us. Many people take the q67 to Hunter's Point for the 7 train and many college in high school students also use it, and the q18 goes to 61St Street in Woodside with the Express trainers. Now the new cue 18 will be all the way on 69Th Street it'll go to the 69th Street Station, where you only could get the local train. So that's another negative it just it just seems like we're getting hit really hard and it's going to be very difficult for many commuters and students. So I'd, like you to look at the 65th place area and maybe possibly have a bus, goes straight down, 65th place or at least along the expressway, because we're like we're left without buses for a big distance and one reason some people bought their homes and I never ears, because you know buses were only a block away. You know we wanted the decent commute to the city and now we're getting messed up. So thank you for listening. Of course, we'll tell you that early at that, okay, it looks like so the Brooklyn and the Queens timelines are very I, know that they're skewed they're, not necessarily mashing up, so we started only because when they redid when they did work on Cyprus Illustrated few years back, you know eliminated a bus stop at on Cypress Hills Street at 80Th Avenue, which is at the top of the hill for Liberty Park area, a lot of senior citizens a lot of people with disabilities with strollers. That's where they got off. My wife would get off there and we would have a walk. He would neither walk straight or walk down a little bit on a hill. Now you have to get off at the bottom of the hill and we keep getting told oh well now, that's the way it is too bad and the best the funniest part is that at Cypress, Hill, Street and 80Th Avenue going in the opposite direction. Going north there's a bus stop, but there's no sidewalk and there's a divider in the wall on the road and Jersey barrier you can't cross it, which it does not make sense, so have to have access to those cemeteries. You know, there's a big wall yeah but I'm, saying further up, because they've already asked us to cut do cut over. Is it okay? I'm just had a question about this new Qmt 101, which I think was. It was the Q m25 Glendale to lower Manhattan downtown Manan yeah. It looks like it's going to be riding along Metropolitan Avenue. Yes, so that's how we have it right now. That's where we have to take another look at that. Obviously yeah because it used to take the expressway yeah I mean morning, commute being a nightmare, yep I mean also I mean have when you first started. This whole thing: did you? Did they MTA take into consideration senior citizens getting short distances for shopping and doctors I? Just look through some of these questions. There's a couple of things that keep kind of coming up. Again. There was the queue Qmt 100 and Qmt 101, but there is a question as to whether I'm just looking at the maps, I was actually looking at them and maybe I'm going to step this back just a second before I address these your route plans, which are great and you can look at them, I think people should know. If you have not used it. There is a little thing called filters. One of the most handy things about the map is to use those filters. It's a way to toggle all of them, because the first time you look at either the local or Express all the lines are on, and if you want to look at one, it's kind of hard to turn them all off, and there is a way to do that. Just you know it's called a filter. You drop it down, it's a little menu that you can say, turn them all off and then you can go turn on the ones. You really want to look at which I found health helpful, but I also know that some of the way that the map is working line sit over top of each other and it's not very easy to find them. Like I was originally thinking. We were getting four Express, which I thought hey. That's one more than we had. We have three Express busses right now, that's great to see your numbers I'm like: where are they getting these other two and now I see them more clearly, but the route map does not let you get at the layers very easily, so I did not even find two of them, but to go back to them. They start in some interesting places like all right now, all three of our routes basically run the same network through our neighborhood I. Think starting a lot of them at Elliott and fresh pond I. Think that's where some of them go. It does miss all of Glendale, and that is an issue. I mean there are more options, so I think we I personally want to go back in and look and see what's coming where so just to see that we have not lost too much, but those routes that are going to certain places that are currently served. Are they going to be serve to get to the West side or get to the east side or get to downtown from the same place in a similar manner in similar time? And that takes me back to your Jane and I'm, just wondering if there's enough time or enough energy or wherewithal to do a Jane for the current existing conditions, I mean Google kind of does that, but not as not as visually but like if I can easily toggle Jane between now and the future, I can say: oh you know what you are doing a better job if I toggle Jane between now and the future- and it does not look as good to me for my usual route. I can then give you a little bit more feedback right, but right now all I can see what Jane might do in the future. What's our next step on this particular subject on the Queen's bus routes? Well, you wanted to do some yeah I'm going to do a couple. I have heard a couple times in different meetings and I think it needs to be mentioned that there might be the 24/7 service. If there's local service, that's 24/7, that's what should I'm! If there's local service routes that match with an Express route or like a limited stop route, the local service should be the 24/7, not the limited stop right, so you get more service acrosss the borough. That's come up a few times in conversations I've had and heard there is somebody brought up no connection for the Qt 77 to the Metropolitan Avenue Station, which is an accessibility station for this area. Almost every one of our stations is not accessible, except for Myrtle Wyckoff, and in that anything that you can get to accessible stations and I, know you're. Hearing this on some other routes. I do believe the Q18 replacements do not necessarily go to an accessible service point on the seven which they do now. So that's something to always keep in mind as you're. Getting us to trains, get us to trains that are usable for everybody and not just the able- bodied I think we should do that. I'm, not sure how we want to work with getting these cards between well, I. Think I think you should look at the cards and I know, but I do not and we'll talk about how we're going to get back to tell you what I'll get I'll just take. Some pictures I think that could work for us and we'll get them because I think this is information that the people here wanted to get to the MTA's. What we want to get and they want them here from we'll get some pictures of them tonight and hand them off to you. But, yes, we need to start really putting together some kind of proposal of what we see as the benefits and what we see is the issues to address I. Think we've verbalized them here, but it's always best to have it in writing and get it in I would say that we can still all of us because the more they hear the pinch points, the more they'll be able to address the pinch points. So you guys saw how many times and opportunities you have to put in feedback. So every committee member do not just once you do. Feedback on the web also send it in to the Community board and send it and send it saying to get this to the to the transportation public transit committee, because you know my pet thing is: when are we going to see Brooklyn? Because if you take just the cue 55, it touches 1:2, 3, 4:5, Brooklyn routes and four subway routes, and we really have to pay attention to that John likes the extension out to Jamaica I, occasionally use 255 off hours, it's very good! It's on time, rush hour. It gets lost into traffic, and if it's going to be extended out to Jamaica, you probably have to double the amount, the bus's on the round, so that needs to be looked at. Even if, as John said, you eliminate some of the stops, it still has to travel, it has to travel them in traffic. Myrtle Avenue in Queens is a major truck route and it dies at the Brooklyn border. We've been dealing with D- O- T on that we have this major truck route and all these tractor trailers go down, they get the white go. If they have you and there's no truck route, so you've got all that. You got the buses, the tractor trailers on a major truck route and regular commuters. So you really have to look at that and that's what we're going to look at just any I just want to say the best way to reduce congestion is to get people on well- functioning buses and give them that alternative to do the service, and that gets fewer personal automobiles on the road, and that makes the bosses move. Did we give you a list Oh Lord: do we send them the list? Yeah, you know the one you all right well, give them a heads up. Meantime John's going to go through it. Thank you. It's too soon the borough board presentation that Walter attended, because you could not attend. He did report back at one of our meetings to the whole board about the undertaking. We can come back in the next the next board meeting. There will be a report of this committee. Well, do you want to hand out what we got tonight? We could do that I mean if they have extras. We can always take extras, so you said: there's no timeline yet really deadline, there's no specific timeline right now. When do you want to hear from us how fast we have to function? I mean I'd, say always the sooner. The better I mean our outreach right now is going to go through about the middle of April. So just to be clear when I say going to the middle of April, that's what we have scheduled right now and we've been doing sorry. We've been doing all of our meetings and they're going to go through the middle of April. It does not mean we're to stop it, we're not going to take feedback after the middle of April, but I'm just letting you know that that's you know you have at least you know, keep you know, there's no specific timeline, but the sooner you can get us feedback the better- and this is the first draft of the plan, so they're going to come back again and go through. Hopefully, another show like this and some more workshops to go with what they make adjustments to the plan. So this is not the last time we'll see them it. It's an opportunity now and that April deadline is so that we can keep it moving, and is there a true implementation date? No I mean some of this is reliant on equipment, its reliant on road improvements, possibly so it. That is not a fair question, though, does the MTA in your looking at this? Have you seen this as possibly a phased, or is it going to have to be just kind of like overnight we're switching it's going to it's going to be more of the overnight type of thing, because it's operating as a network yep, you know it's not something. We can really change piece by piece, because then there's connections that will suddenly not be there there's. You know things like that would make it very difficult to do that. So if we saw something we really like and it solves a problem for us now, could we request that implementation? Well, it has to be the whole package. What do you? What do you mean Vinnie, just I mean we want to hear the ripple like. We want to really hear what you mean just if, as I said, we're working getting to Highland Park. For instance, we have requested an extension of the beat 13 to serve Highland Park reservoir. So if we have to wait for the full implementation will never get that route to the reservoir I can't you know, I do not do that. Computer stuff come on, I mean I'm 80 years old leave me alone, so we have put in a request to extend to be 13 to the entrance to the reservoir for Highland Park. So are we going to have to wait for the whole Brooklyn plan to get implemented or what you could take five years and we won't have any service to that part. So I should say this is the Queen's team here today, but so that's something that we can look at. But generally any kind of major changes that are happening to the Brooklyn network would be part of the redesign you're saying we won't be able to get that bus stop for five years. If it's just a bus, stop that's I thought you were sick of retention of the round. Yes, I think that something has to be evaluate. Have you submitted that request already obviously-, and did you get a response from MTA on that request, from NYC H2O and from with our blessing we have asked for the MTA- or the New York City Transit, to look at a couple of different routes and possibilities. We have never gotten back a real positive like oh that's great. It's just been more like. We can't do that at this time or we're not even thinking about it at this time. So we're going to like Vinny I would I have been actively trying to do something. For years we will keep like just poking. You, I was going to say turning this plan, we're going to keep poking it keep pursuing it, but I think Brooklyn redesigns the opportunity to really revisit that I'm Gary Giordano on the district manager, the Community Board and some of the criticisms that I've heard from people in their neighborhood. To reiterate what Mike for Dunsky said, what's being proposed for the q18 in the q67 would take bus service away from a lot of people in Maspeth and Maspeth does not have a lot of bus service to speak of to begin with, taken away the queue 38 going toward the M train station that whole loop. There is a very unpopular proposal and then the I think it's 229 would no longer go to Queens, Center, Mall and I. Think a lot of people are upset with the with the 47 and how it would not connect with some of the schools that the kids in our neighborhood go to now. I mean there are others, but those are them the main ones that come to mind from me and who's been speaking to me about their dissatisfaction and to kind of piggyback. On that last statement and something that was in your slide. You mentioned colleges and university, but we also need schools, local schools and that's some of the stuff that we've lost and I'd say. Middle, Village and Maspeth is connectors to Martin Luther, to Christ the king in certain cases, and to some of the more local schools within the Middle Village area near 80s, not far from just thank the committee for having us so much tonight, and just you know and Gary, just one more thing, just as you're speaking to people, if you can, you know refer them to the website where they can give feedback. That would be great. We want to get as much feedback as possible, as I said already, and just you know they can submit themselves. That's great, so you are not on the paperwork if we shared with our guests tonight, there's contact information in there. Okay, yeah all right. It's on that! Thank you! Okay! So, before we get into traffic safety requests, there is an it do. You people are having a Network redesign workshop on March 9th, so there's a workshop on March, 9th 8th 6:30 p.m. at PS 153 in Maspeth, and that's being sponsored co- sponsored by Councilmember Holden and the MTA. Thank you very good. Thank you. Okay, so we'll go on to the next phase of business traffic safety request: okay, 2020, Committee, 2020 cost service is requesting a letter of no objection. We've asked them for further information which we have not got. Anybody know anything about. 2020 vision is not very good. Do we normally do a letter of no objection? No we've done 20/20 is located at six five to zero Cooper Avenue is where they're going to store their cars. That's that gas station on the I guess northeast corner of Cyprus and help Street and Cooper. They want to. Let them know they need to have to get their license completed with the city. They need to have a place where they store their cars. There's two gas stations and a supermarket, or something like that. Oh there's, a storefront there yeah they have. Let's see ten vehicles. Ten vehicles, 60:65 20 is the gas stay. Is the store when you look up the that property 65:20 is the store they are off? Is this their cost service is at six one for Myrtle Avenue, that's their radio transmitter. Annette. Do you know who owns that gas station? It would be like Liberty or for wands or any of those. It's not no, it's not over. No, it's not it's a black car service I mean they could run some of them yeah. But yes, this is Dorothea. Collins did you yeah, so they are traffic asking for a traffic light on Flushing Avenue at the corner of 54Th Street several times as I was making a left turn from 54th Street on to Flushing cars thinking. The left turn signal is for them to proceed, while their signal is red. Right behind that red signal is the green arrow to turn left acrosss Flushing Avenue I was almost hit tonight, as I was returning to my office on Flushing Avenue. Last week, a woman with her toddler, we're crossing the street I was waiting for them to cross a car was in the left, turn area on Flushing, but a car speeding down, Flushing Avenue, bypassed the car waiting and almost hit the mother and her child. There must be an extra sign of letting cars on Flushing Avenue. No, who do you want to check on that? Mike kid you so ste forth and Flushing. Looking for a traffic light, it's more of a signage, the configuration of the signals, the configuration of the signals and the timing of the signals and the signage for drivers. So they do not mistake. The signal they're actually saying there should be an extra sign out letting cars on Flushing Avenue know they have the steady read they can not turn until 54th. Street traffic has a red light. Red signal else. Do we have these Laura hello? You usually send these to me. I have probably got them if I yeah. The grammar here is not that great, but it might be helpful if we could send it to Mike. If he's going to look at it just so, he has the words that they're using, even though they're not the clearest. So this is from our transportation, chair, Mr. Curie. It's simply saying: city fence, installation along Fresh, Pond, Road, he's saying a location at 64:10 on Fresh Pond Road is no good because it is front of Catania bakery and that is they're loading unloading zone. That's also I think where they moved at bus. Stop, though yeah, so the loading zone happens. Off- hours I would say that the bus stop is big enough, that they could figure out a place to put it because Catania is kind of in the middle there. They could put a bench in front of other stores, because there's energy there's other things there that it could go in France, so they gave two addresses actually 64:10 and 6417 right. So it's acrosss the street, where the new staff stop is and in front of the other stuff. Maybe instead of saying 64:10 is bad. We should give them an address level. So that's number 3 Mr. Jordano request to address traffic safety concerns in Ridgewood, Queens, John Oni. This is more of an informational thing. This is not really so much in traffic. This is just the status of our ease, Ari Richter, who has been an ongoing machine here, because he just got another stop to stop signs one over near. You I believe it's just telling us where the statuses of some of these and what's been approved and denied. This is a little bit. I feel like I've, seen this more recently than the 20th of February, but I guess. I have not yeah green and Onderdonk just got it this okay. This is it's including the old message that I saw from January, but it's just saying that green and Onderdonk is been qualified to get and always stop. So that's just an informational other matters to discuss so future MTA bus redesign workshops. You mentioned the one on the ninth right and there's going to be one at PS 49 in April, Mark Moss provided a list of questions, concerns regarding bus redesign, we're going to incorporate that into our feedback and there's been some back- and- forth on some of those issues, and people do agree with them and want to see them included. Other people on the committee should have gotten that message. I think it was shared widely. It's not been announced as to date, yet in April the only one that's got. A firm date is the one at PS 153 Monday March, 9th, between 6:30 and 8 Queens Traffic, Safety, Board meeting notice. The next meeting of the Queen's Traffic Safety Board will be held on Thursday March 5th 2020 at 9:30 a.m. in Queens borough hall. So if you have any interest in traffic safety, you got to take the day off, or you know hopefully operate that you can. You can get that for work or something, and it's going to be. It looks like they're going to focus a little bit on pedestrian and bicycle deaths, which we're declining and are now rising again hope you recognize in light of this Vinnie. If you can just talk a little bit about the way the American automobile seems to be growing like the average girth of the American body and right now, any day any hour you walk on Forest Avenue. You now have cars that are fully up on the sidewalk they're compacting the tree pits. So that's not going to be healthy for the trees they're hitting the trees. It's just not going to be healthy for the sidewalks, because the sidewalks are not designed for cars, they're designed for people and that's one of the largest there's, a amazing article that the Detroit Free Press put out last year, very comprehensive one about traffic safety and talking about the design structure of cars and the height, and they now, instead of the sedan which would clip you in the legs, you have SUVs that actually hit you at chest, height or higher, and that's one of the real big problems. Right now, in conjunction with the governor's I'm, sorry traffic say: Queens Traffic, Safety Council, in conjunction with the governor's Traffic Safety, Committee and I, think it's St., Mary's Hospital gives out baby seats for people that qualify with income and or will install yours properly, because most people do not install their baby seats. Properly. We've been notified that the final design of complex pedestrian ramp upgrades has been moved forward when I first saw this Vinny I thought it was your favorite project because it starts with an H WP, but it's not. No. There are only one of these are going to be hitting our board and it's down in your area. Yeah there's! Well, it's one DOT! So I guess maybe that's two spots: q15! No, that's m5Q&And there. It is yeah, Center, Street and Cypress Avenue and that's it so did we get any feedback? Mr. G on my rant about the Wyckoff Avenue reconstruction project, hwk Julio Salazar from congresswoman Nydia Velazquez office, called me and said that he would work to get D DC at one of our meetings, Department of design and construction, to talk to us about the Wyckoff Avenue plan. So that becomes the question of when the next Transportation Committee meeting would be so right. So Vinny is suggesting the 31st yeah, because the 24th is special election, any other items to come before the transportation of a public transit committee. Well, if not well, thank everybody for participating thanks Donald for the electronics and making things work and Mark you get any feedback on who was watching today. I'm. Sorry, oh good, so that's a question for the whole board at some point that we should we and we'll talk about at the board meeting. Should we occasionally podcast committee meetings, I would I would say land. You should definitely be more consistent, we'll talk, we'll talk it in a executive committee, we'll talk about it and we'll check with the money. Yes, rich I will mark our you got to get you think, you're going to get written or verbal comments. No, you never do here. Okay, well, I asked we'll ask around if anybody you know interested in more committee meetings, if we have enough money, all right motion to adjourn. Okay. Second, thank you all in favor, aye.
