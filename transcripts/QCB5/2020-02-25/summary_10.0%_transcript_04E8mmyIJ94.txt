There's a picture of one right up there and we combined from what we heard there and a lot of data into the existing conditions report, which was released in September, which was kind of where we laid out exactly what was what we were seeing with the bus network in Queens We were at over 60 different meetings throughout the borough, looking into different public input, whether that's workshops or presentations like this one.
One of those was reliable service or you couldn't show up to the bus stop and the buses boom right there waiting for you We really wanted to try and tackle that, along with improving travel times, we heard from a lot of people that takes them a really long time to get to their destination It's trying to serve a lot of different purpose with one route.
This is the first time we've done a real holistic look at the entire bus Network The first thing: is you look at a map like this I think somebody referred to as dumping a bowl of spaghetti on the ground and : They go to downtown flushing, downtown Jamaica and Long Island City, the Queens Plaza area We want to make sure that we're providing access not just to those three areas, because we know that people are trying to get to many different destinations throughout the borough.
So with this new network, we're really hoping to hit those four customer priorities, and we realized that the network, as is right, now, doesn't necessarily do a perfect job of that The first thing is simplifying that network and really providing that reliable service by having these routes that are as straight as possible, so they're not getting caught in traffic is the balanced bus stops fewer turns and also working with our folks at D-O-T to implement better bus priority throughout the borough as well, and then sort of the better connections was another thing right now you have to wait a little bit longer than you should for your bus to show up if you're, taking another bus or something like that When we talk about a blank slate approach and that's really what we've been taking with the network as we've been redesigned, the network is really building from scratch, using the public input that we've gathered so far, along with the existing data Obviously, the data does not say the entire story.
How I mentioned that we've had about or we will be having about 60 overall meetings, gathering that public input throughout this entire process, Customer driven a big portion of this project, is working with D-O-T and figuring out those locations for bus priority We want to make sure that in areas where we're, where we're focusing our frequency that we're giving our buses the best chance to really move people as quickly as possible.
So the proposed local routes in this area that we heard that we wanted to touch on today, where the q11 queue 18q, 21, 29, 38, 39, 47, 52 and 53 SBS, 55, 58, 59 and 67, so, like I, said I'll, be going over a certain route profiles and It shows the main streets that ran on and then which of the new routes are running along that portion of the street for that route.
You can try and figure out what your new trip would look like in the new network, so this route is going from downtown Brooklyn up to Jackson Heights, the 74th Street Station that again, it doesn't have many stops in between, but it's really just geared towards getting people from Brooklyn to Queens as quickly as possible.
Up to Queens Center are you're still having that access , you're This one is red so or excuse me this one is green, I believe so this one is a little bit more, a few more stops in between the blue route as fewer stops, and it's just getting people from A to B as quickly as possible.
With some of these routes that run down to Williamsburg or into downtown Brooklyn But, we do need to have you come back with the Brooklyn plan, as it moves forward to talk to us about how it's impacting not only our members of our communities, but also the depots that we house, because we have two of them in this community board and we're going to want to know We've already just gone through a bus improvement on Fresh, Pond Road, which seems to be paying dividends.
We are by dead-ended buses, deadheaded buses that aren't necessarily even serving this community We need to kind of figure out how to fair, share that equity kind of thing, I'd like to also emphasize the access to the Ridgewood reservoir It's, not even on the MTA subway map, and it should be We've, been trying to get something to go there and that might come out of the Brooklyn redesign and I emphasized a few more the hard things earlier that the people are having problems with the spacing of stops great opportunity to speed buses up We might lose that I think we got to figure out how to live with some of that, because we know every time a bus pulls to the curb it gets harder to pull out.
That would be a possible future thing to try to figure out, because it would be an infrastructural thing because you'd have to get different buses, but right now the changes of the cue 38 and how it serves local communities in Middle, Village That's lost in a large degree that a circulator might help right to kind of serve some of these inner residential areas and get people, because, as soon as you'd make it harder for people to get to the bus, you're gonna turn them either to uber or lyft or their own car If we want to reduce congestion, we got to get people on shared transit, so Are. We gonna, though these are things that we want to get to them, but we need to have them , yep, I'll, look through them any other committee.
Of course we'll tell you that early at that, okay, it looks like so the Brooklyn and the Queens timelines are very I So we started only because when they redid when they did work on Cyprus Illustrated few years back, you know eliminated a bus stop at on Cypress Hills Street at 80th Avenue, which is at the top of the hill for Liberty Park area, a lot of senior citizens a lot of people with disabilities with strollers Going north there's, a bus stop, but there's no sidewalk and there's a divider in the wall on the road and jersey barrier have to have access to those cemeteries.
Some pictures I think that could work for us and we'll get them because I think this is information that the people here wanted to get to the MTA's So every committee- member , don't just once you do feedback on the web, also send it in to the community board and send it and send it saying to get this to the to the transportation public transit committee, because you know my pet thing is: When are we gonna see Brooklyn?
