Okay, so I'm gonna turn the meeting over to the co-chairs of the public transit services committee.
I'm from New York, City, Transit, government, community relations department here to talk about The Queen's bus Network, redesigned tonight.
We have a number of those throughout the borough, there's a picture of one right up there and we combined from what we heard there and a lot of data into the existing conditions report, which was released in September, which was kind of where we laid out exactly what was what we were seeing with the bus network in Queens.
A lot of people obviously rely on a stop, that's right near to them, and that's great, but also More of the bus is stopping It's, making sure that makes sense for different parts of the route in different parts of the borough.
The first thing: is you look at a map like this It's, a tangled mess, I, think somebody referred to as dumping a bowl of spaghetti on the ground and Another, limitation, the network right now, is that most of the routes go to the same three places:: they go to downtown flushing, downtown Jamaica and Long Island City, the Queens Plaza area.
We want to make sure that we're providing access not just to those three areas, because we know that people are trying to get to many different destinations throughout the borough.
Another thing that just touched down was the bus stops making sure that they're the correct distance to provide the access and also speed up trips, where possible.
The first thing is simplifying that network and really providing that reliable service by having these routes that are as straight as possible, so they're not getting caught in traffic The balanced bus stops fewer turns and also working with our folks at D-O-T to implement better bus priority throughout the borough as well, and then sort of the better connections was another thing.
So it's things like the red bus lanes transit signal priority which gives buses a head start at intersections, there's a lot of different items in the toolbox that we can use to help speed buses, up.
They actually mean something now, so we have blue route, which blue routes, which are sort of like current SBS routes, where those stops are pretty far spaced apart, they're, connecting key destinations so that way, people that these are built for those really long trips to get people to and from as quickly as possible.
So as you as you look online You can try and figure out what your new trip would look like in the new network, so this route is going from downtown Brooklyn up to Jackson Heights, the 74th Street Station.
This is one of those blue routes that again it doesn't have many stops in between, but it's really just geared towards getting people from Brooklyn to Queens as quickly as possible.
A little bit more, a few more stops in between the new blue route, but still it's about moving people as quickly as possible, with these straight routes and with the added frequency as well, and that's taking up portions of the queue 23 and the queue 33.
This one is red so or excuse me this one is green I believe so this one is a little bit more, a few more stops in between the blue route as fewer stops, and it's just getting people from A to B as quickly as possible.
So this one is running from Rego Park Queens Boulevard out to Williamsburg Bridge, and this is one of those green routes, so you're, seeing a few more stops in between to provide that access in between any of these red and blue routes that are leaving some gaps in the network.
Excuse me down to Rego Park Queens Boulevard, so you're, making you're connecting with the cutie 52 right there to still provide that access along that portion of the cue 53 that we're not serving with that same route.
We do need to have you come back with the Brooklyn plan, as it moves forward to talk to us about how it's impacting not only our members of our communities, but also the depots that we house, because we have two of them in this community board And we're going to want to know We've already just gone through a bus improvement on Fresh, Pond Road, which seems to be paying dividends.
So I'd, like you to look at the 65th place area and maybe possibly have a bus, One reason some people bought their homes and I never ears, because you know buses were only a block.
Of course, we'll tell you that early at that, okay, it looks like so the Brooklyn and the Queens timelines are very I, So we started only because when they redid when they did work on Cyprus Illustrated few years back, you know eliminated a bus stop at on Cypress Hills Street at 80th Avenue, which is at the top of the hill for Liberty Park area, a lot of senior citizens a lot of people with disabilities with strollers.
You really want to look at which I found health helpful, but I also know that some of the way that the map is working line sit over top of each other Now. All three of our routes basically run the same network through our neighborhood I.
But like if I can easily toggle Jane between now and the future, I can say: Oh, you know what you are doing a better job if I toggle Jane between now and the future- What's our next step on this particular subject on the Queen's bus, routes?, And I, think it needs to be mentioned that there might be the 24/7 service.
Also send it in to the community board and send it and send it saying to get this to the to the transportation public transit committee, because you know my pet thing is: When are we gonna see Brooklyn?
So I should say this is the Queen's team here today, but so that's something that we can look at, but generally any kind of major changes that are happening to the Brooklyn network would be part of the redesign you're saying we won't be able to get that bus stop for five years.
