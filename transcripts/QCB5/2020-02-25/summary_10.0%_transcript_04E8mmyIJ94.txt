So I'm going to turn the meeting over to the co- chairs of the public, Transit Services Committee And, you could watch us work.
I'm from New York, City, Transit, government, community relations, Department here to talk about The Queen's bus Network, redesigned tonight.
You know what works, what people like, and also what people do not like in this plan, With that I'll start the presentation and I'm joined tonight by Eric and durian members of our bus planning team, as well as Kate from government relations and who is right.
We have a number of those throughout the borough, there's a picture of one right up there and we combined from what we heard there and a lot of data into the existing conditions report, which was released in September, which was kind of where we laid out exactly what was what we were seeing with the bus network in Queens.
You could not show up to the bus, stop and We heard from a lot of people that takes them a really long time to get to their destination.
The first thing: is you look at a map like this It's, a tangled mess, I, think somebody referred to as dumping a bowl of spaghetti on the ground and Another, limitation, the network right now, is that most of the routes go to the same three places: they go to downtown Flushing, downtown Jamaica and Long Island City, the Queens Plaza area.
We want to make sure that we're providing access not just to those three areas, because we know that people are trying to get to many different destinations throughout the borough.
The first thing is simplifying that network and really providing that reliable service by having these routes that are as straight as possible, so they're not getting caught in traffic Congestion, they're just able to stay in a straight line and move as reliably as possible and then another way to help speed up those trips like I, talked about Is. The balanced bus stops fewer turns, and also working with our folks at D- O- T to implement better bus priority throughout the borough, as well, and The way that our network is set up.
We want to make sure that in areas where we're, where we're focusing our frequency that we're giving our buses the best chance to really move people as quickly as possible, so it's things like the Red Bus Lanes Transit signal priority which gives buses a head start at intersections.
They actually mean something now, so we have blue route, which blue routes, which are sort of like current SBS routes, where those stops are pretty far spaced apart, they're, connecting key destinations so that way, people that these are built for those really long trips to get people to and from as quickly as possible.
That's, actually new locations that were running service, blue Indicates areas that we've maintained service, that buses are still running along those corridors and then gray shows routes that we've moved off of that corridor to help straighten out routes and provide more direct, connections.
The proposed local routes in this area that we heard that we wanted to touch on today, where the q11 queue 18Q, 21:29, 38, 39:47, 52 and 53, SBS, 55:58, 59 and 67, so, like I, said I'll, be going over a certain route profiles and those are routes that have taken up Porsche that have not necessarily replaced overall but have taken up portions of those routes, and this is a route conversion chart that we have online as well.
As you as you look online You can try and figure out what your new trip would look like in the new network, so this route is going from downtown Brooklyn up to Jackson Heights, the 74th Street Station.
This is one of those blue routes that again, it does not have many stops in between, but it's really just geared towards getting people from Brooklyn to Queens as quickly as possible.
This is one of those red routes that are very frequent a little bit more, a few more stops in between the new blue route, but still it's about moving people as quickly as possible, with these straight routes and with the added frequency as well, and that's taking up portions of the queue 23 and the queue 33.
One is red so or excuse me this one is green I believe so this one is a little bit more, a few more stops in between the blue route as fewer stops, and it's just getting people from A to B as quickly as possible.
So this one is running from Rego Park Queens Boulevard out to Williamsburg Bridge, and this is one of those green routes, so you're, seeing a few more stops in between to provide that access in between any of these red and blue routes that are leaving some gaps in the network.
Excuse me down to Rego Park Queens Boulevard, so you're, making you're connecting with the cutie 52 right there to still provide that access along that portion of the cue 53 that we're not serving with that same route.
We were playing for one in Maspeth and we're planning for one in middle of village This plan at subway stations doing on street outreach trying to get the word out about this plan at Pi/4 locations where people transfer to the subway as well, and then we're also been doing presentations like this at community boards and civic associations.
We do need to have you come back with the Brooklyn plan, as it moves forward to talk to us about how it's impacting not only our members of our communities, but also the depots that we house, because we have two of them in this community board And we're going to want to know We've already just gone through a bus improvement on Fresh, Pond Road, which seems to be paying dividends.
It might come out of this somehow, but we definitely want to see that speaking of Jamaica And I emphasized a few more the hard things earlier that the people are having problems with the spacing of stops great opportunity to speed buses.
That's lost in a large degree that a circulator might help right to kind of serve some of these inner residential areas and get people, because, as soon as you'd make it harder for people to get to the bus you're going to turn them either to Uber or Lyft or their own car.
So I'd, like you to look at the 65th place area and maybe possibly have a bus, One reason some people bought their homes and I never ears, because you know buses were only a block.
Of course, we'll tell you that early at that, okay, it looks like so the Brooklyn and the Queens timelines are very I, So we started only because when they redid when they did work on Cyprus Illustrated few years back, you know eliminated a bus stop at on Cypress Hills Street at 80Th Avenue, which is at the top of the hill for Liberty Park area, a lot of senior citizens a lot of people with disabilities with strollers.
You really want to look at which I found health helpful, but I also know that some of the way that the map is working line sit over top of each other All three of our routes basically run the same network through our neighborhood I.
Route, the local service should be the 24/7, not the limited, stop right.
Feedback on the web, also send it in to the Community board and send it and send it saying to get this to the to the transportation public transit committee, because you know my pet thing is: When are we going to see Brooklyn?
It gets lost into traffic, and if it's going to be extended out to Jamaica, you probably have to double the amount, the bus's on the round, so that needs to be looked at.
It does not mean we're to stop it, we're not going to take feedback after the middle of April, but I'm just letting you know that that's , there's no specific timeline, but This is the first draft of the plan, so they're going to come back again and go through.
