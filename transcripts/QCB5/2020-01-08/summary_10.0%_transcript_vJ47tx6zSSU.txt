One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all The first order of business tonight is a presentation regarding composting and trash, and we have a leguminous the outreach coordinator for the Bureau of recycling and sustainability for New York City Department of Sanitation Allie This is my first time in Queens five community board meetings, so I appreciate the generous offering of time.
Another thing is: you may have noticed that apartment buildings with more than 10 units do not automatically get enrolled in the program that doesn't mean you cannot participate At. The end of the day, you'll need somebody like a building manager, a superintendent, a board member somebody with decision-making capabilities to sign off on it, but anyone even a resident can make their initial request we'll reach out to whatever contact information you give us we'll conduct a site visit, determine how many bins you need anywhere from 2 to 100 if need be, and then we'll get you added to a row.
All of the compost It's a different answer, depending on which part of the city you're in and honestly even within sections of a community board district, and it's going by barge In fact back in October, we opened up our Staten Island facility for the first time to the public So. Even if you were organic, waste, isn't ending up and in Staten Island It looks like over the next few months so that from food scraps to healthy, nutritious compost, I saw another hand who's that microphone.
The next item of business is the public forum again I Try, to reiterate no personal attacks, no foul language, no off-the-cuff accusations, and things like that The first speaker is anthony vucic It's, a count of people in this country, It's a constitutional requirement that we count the people in this country The population in all 50 states and various districts of the of this country, Each home, will receive an invitation to respond with a short questionnaire online phone or mail.
You could get this data, some people pay for this data, but they don't realize you could actually get it from the Census Bureau, and this data can be important if you open up a new business is something like that.
You get the federal funds to pay for hospitals, sometimes by the parliaments, health care systems and, as chair of the health and Services Committee I've seen five hospitals close in district in this district County of Queens You know you want federal funds when you have the population here Some may be immigrants But if they're, here and they're living here, their information is gonna, be private.
I have read the annual report with great interest that the board has put out All your committee reports I used to work for the governor of New York I'm, an attorney and and I'm here to answer any concerns and questions regarding our expansions with the cellar space and I'll be in the back table to address any of that.
We are also recruiting heavily right now for field operations, and if anyone is interested or knows, anyone who might be interested I have a lot of people that come to me and just ask you know what I have a full-time job.
So three of the cents goes towards a state environmental fund and the other two cents go back to the city towards buying bags and redistributing the ones that they have so You won't require the supermarket or store buy bags, sell them to a customer for five cents and give that five cents back So the store is losing money and it's costing them employee time and energy, so what they even participate- So we'll leave that aside, and so they get nothing for handling the bags, putting them out collecting the money and sending it back to the city and state The next item of business, My goodness, is the chairpersons report and that's me Vincent, our Curie chairperson, so the several of the community board chairs in Queens County at least decided that our board members should be identified pretty much as the council members, this assembly persons, the Senate is the Congress persons and several of us have designed individual lapel pins so tonight board members You should have all received your official committee board, Five lapel pin now.
Although the councilmember Holden, wanted me to tell all of you that there's going to be a street renaming for Jack Horan's on 82nd Avenue and Myrtle Avenue, this Saturday January 11th at 2 pm and everybody is invited to attend that the councilmember also wanted me to tell you that he's looked at a bus plan redesign and he feels that on committee is lost time to many buses and he's upset also that they're not coming to Maspeth or middle village for a meeting with the community about these loss of transportation, and if the bus plan stays the way it is right now, Very much representing senator addabbo is Sarah's biltman This coming session feel free to contact my office Everyone kevin was an esky with some women have a C's office.
Lastly I just want to report that we were able to collect over 50 gift packages for mothers that are either homeless or facing homelessness in our drive towards the end of 2019 Our entire office wants to wish everybody a happy, a safe and prosperous new year, as always feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns about anything.
Today was the first day of session and brian is up there So if you want to come volunteer and help make food for the needy or if you have anyone that you know that needs to fulfill any service hours from school or in general.
Look forward to speaking and working with you second I'd like to present you with an official community board.
I'll leave They feel that will and bus is not really going down side streets that might not have meant for buses like J, Avenue, I, really they're gonna have some public works workshops, they're calling them take up we're having a meeting here, we're the first meeting and that's at the greater in Youth Council on January 21st from 6 to 8 pm, and our committee will be there our transportation committee, but there we could make comments and look at it and see what we think.
I know you stay neutral on this, but as the chair of Transportation I really think that we have to get in front of this community board 5:00 and it's important that we meet, and you know from a personal perspective , I made an attempt not to drive and take public transportation in and out of Manhattan disasters from Glendale That pushed me back in a car, so I really would like to see this work, and so the cars are off the street and we are able to take a bus or a train and what I see happening right now.
Instead of 61st we're doing committee work again things we need to hear from every okay, so little business , Okay, there's an error on the minutes where they listed me as second vice president of the Community Council.
So there would be two separate exiting requirements coming out of one place: There's the street fairs that we know that are happening: okay, 19th, okay, mr Jordano, when he gives his report we'll talk about the budget and items that we discussed at the executive committee meeting because he took all the notes and my brain is burned for now.
I wish you good health through you and your loved ones, and all year and a little bit of prosperity, Plus, Far as our budget goes for this year, you know we got an extra forty, two thousand five hundred dollars from the city council and we can't use it to hire regular staff I'm very concerned with too much lack of respect for people, especially women in society, and how we hear of all these cases of abuse.
