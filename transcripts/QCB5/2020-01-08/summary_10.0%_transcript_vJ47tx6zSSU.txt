The first order of business tonight is a presentation regarding composting and trash, and we have a leguminous the outreach coordinator for the Bureau of recycling and sustainability for New York City Department of Sanitation Allie.
At the end of the day, you'll need somebody like a building manager, a superintendent, a board member somebody with decision, making capabilities to sign off on it, but anyone even a resident can make their initial request we'll reach out to whatever contact information.
Cleanups, we want to be doing more streets, we care events where we remove litter and apply compost, teach residents how to apply compost, because it's one thing to say: put the material in the Brown Bin So in the fall we were conducting leaf.
Rakes come spring, we'll be doing the same thing in parks all over the place, we'll be doing part cleanups same thing, removing litter, taking care of those trees and applying compost, and we also do really fun events because we're trying to make sure that people are as interested in what we're doing.
It is medium difficulty if you've never heard of the ins and outs of soil, science, you'll still be able to get by We. Also, do compost happy hours where you'll be able to talk and chat with people about our work about other people in the field and about some of the issues you might be having with your Brown bins and if you're interested in volunteering, you're capable we've been doing major volunteer trainings, we offer them in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and even Manhattan.
People have is: What are we going to put our waste in, so you will still be able to purchase those thick plastic liners at a grocery store that are intentionally made for garbage The, clear ones that you put your recycling in the black ones?
We have a commercial team with about a dozen people who does a lot of outreach at major chains and smaller stores, as well all over the city, making sure that this message is getting out there So residents should be seeing things like that, especially in the next month, or so as we're leading up to March.
We are in the process of reaching out to elected officials, community boards to start distributing those bags, along with this flyer, to make sure that everybody knows they're, not just getting a free bag they're getting something that they should and could use.
Is that all community boards and elected officials- Those are some of the things we get asked about the most and some of the food soiled paper products like napkins, you can absolutely put in your brown Bin keep the boxes where you've been told that the grease is not enough to put is a deterrent to put it in the paper.
We've got plenty of stuff to give out new recycling stickers if your bin is looking a little grungy and information if you live in apartment building, so please follow up with us.
Some people pay for this data, but they do not realize you could actually get it from the Census Bureau, and this data can be important if you open up a new business is something like that.
You know you want federal funds when you have the population here , a lot of populations are going to be afraid to actually do the census.
And I'm eager to learn from you and hear about the issues of concern and let you know that I'm always here eager to work with you, I, have read the annual report with great interest that the board has put out And I, follow all your committee reports, And I, so respect the level of detail, granular, detail and expertise that you have on all these issues.
I know there are so many issues tonight, so I do not really want to take up much time, but I just wanted to introduce myself I look forward to hearing what everyone says and please come talk to me if you're interested in working on issues or sharing information, And I'm here to answer any concerns and questions regarding our expansions with the cellar space, And I'll be in the back table to address any of that.
We are also recruiting heavily right now for field operations, and if anyone is interested or knows, anyone who might be interested I have a lot of people that come to me and just ask But I just want to do something to help out with the census and I.
So we'll leave that aside, and so they get nothing for handling the bags, putting them out collecting the money and sending it back to the city and state I do not think it's going to work.
The new concerns that she's hearing from some of the advocates from community members on the subcommittee Thank you representing Congresswoman, Grace Mang, is Christian Romero, who might want to personally thank for helping out a family friend with some business.
So shout out to the census, people and lastly , I just wanted to report one quick bill that I think is extremely important: Hr 3, lower prescription costs now add the congresswoman voted for this passage of HR 3.
This Saturday January 11th at 2 p.m. And everybody is invited to attend that the Councilmember also wanted me to tell you that he's looked at a bus plan redesign, and he feels that on committee is lost time to many buses and He's upset also that they're not coming to Maspeth or middle village for a meeting with the community about these loss of transportation, and if the bus plan stays the way it is right now, Very much representing senator Addabbo is Sarah's.
Our entire office wants to wish everybody a happy, a safe and prosperous new year, as always feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns about anything.
Off locations, we're collecting until Monday, February, 3rd and Thank you and now it's my pleasure to introduce the interim borough president of Queens, because she's not acting I just want to come by and say hello to certainly our board members, but of course, members of the community.
Now that the Honorable Melinda Katz is our new district attorney, very first female elected as the chief law enforcement officer of the county of Queens, and so last several months, we've made a lot of history in this borough.
Look forward to speaking and working with you second I'd like to present you with an official community board, five lapel pin[ Applause] for the record.
So do not shoot the messenger here, but I, resent it the board at the Borough board meeting last week and they went over primarily the plan that the MTA and the D- O- T, the new bus network, the redesign and the narrative they'd like us to use, and it took a tip a little while for us to get used to it.
They feel that will and bus is not really going down side streets that might not have meant for buses like J Avenue.
Is that I think the community board's recommendations are going to be very important to this process.
You know through different areas and any animal questions and concerns of each area will be spoken directly to your elected officials, they're, all going to be in on Friday And, then, from there I think, there's already 13 workshops that they've set up throughout the borough.
My office, you could you know people are shooting bus, line, concerns into me, making sure it's in front of them.
I know you stay neutral on this, but as the chair of Transportation I really think that we have to get in front of this community board 5:00 And, it's important that we meet And, you know, from a personal perspective, I made an attempt not to drive and take public transportation in and out of Manhattan disasters from Glendale.
That pushed me back in a car, so I really would like to see this work, and so the cars are off the street and we are able to take a bus or a train and what I see happening right now.
Instead of 61st, we're doing committee work again things we need to hear from every okay, so little business , Okay, there's an error on the minutes where they listed me as second vice president of the Community Council.
Please I, believe you said for the Ridgewood Street Fair , you said to 20th of April, that's actually to 19th He gives his report we'll talk about the budget and items that we discussed at the executive committee meeting because he took all the notes and my brain is burned for now.
As far as our budget goes for this year, you know we got an extra forty, two thousand five hundred dollars from the city Council and we can't use it to hire regular staff.
We might be able to get one for less, but we want something, that's going to last a good amount of time, because we have no assurance that we'll get this money.
You're just going to see construction all over the city You know a lot of money's being poured into New York.
Hopefully, you know we have not gotten crazy rains Hopefully we're going to be in good shape with these sewer projects that will have more capacity and less potential for street flooding.
So I did not see that we needed a big sewer project in Ridgewood unless there's something I did not know about, but the other three neighborhoods, where we wanted sewer projects to have more capacity, so people would would not get flooded.
And I know you spent a lot of money and Paul has been very active and many other people It ai, not working I Maspeth where you live, is a big canvas.
