The first order of business tonight is a presentation regarding composting and trash, and we have a leguminous the outreach coordinator for the Bureau of recycling and sustainability for New York City Department of Sanitation Allie.
At the end of the day, you'll need somebody like a building manager, a superintendent, a board member somebody with decision-making capabilities to sign off on it, but anyone even a resident can make their initial request we'll reach out to whatever contact information.
Rakes come spring, we'll be doing the same thing in parks all over the place, we'll be doing part cleanups same thing, removing litter, taking care of those trees and applying compost, and we also do really fun events because we're trying to make sure that people are as interested in what we're doing.
We also do compost happy hours where you'll be able to talk and chat with people about our work about other people in the field and about some of the issues you might be having with your Brown bins and if you're interested in volunteering, you're capable we've been doing major volunteer trainings, we offer them in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and even Manhattan.
People have is what are we gonna put our waste in, so you will still be able to purchase those thick plastic liners at a grocery store that are intentionally made for garbage the clear ones that you put your recycling in the black ones that you put your refuse in those will still be available for purchase Every time you buy something for a small as a bar of soap or trap, stick to an entire load of groceries.
We are in the process of reaching out to elected officials, community boards to start distributing those bags, along with this flyer, to make sure that everybody knows they're, not just getting a free bag they're getting something that they should and could use.
Even if you were organic, waste isn't ending up and in Staten Island It looks like over the next few months so that from food scraps to healthy, nutritious compost, I saw another hand who's that microphone.
Some people pay for this data, but they don't realize you could actually get it from the Census Bureau, and this data can be important if you open up a new business is something like that.
They, actually got pictures of houses and streets and again they're having people right now go out and actually check these things.
And I'm eager to learn from you and hear about the issues of concern and let you know that I'm always here eager to work with you, I, have read the annual report with great interest that the board has put out And I, follow all your committee reports , I used to work for the governor of New, York I'm, an attorney So I don't really want to take up much time, but I just wanted to introduce myself I look forward to hearing what everyone says and please come talk to me if you're interested in working on issues or sharing information, And I'm here to answer any concerns and questions regarding our expansions with the cellar space, And I'll be in the back table to address any of that.
So this time around for 2020 we're, definitely getting out there and trying to read all community boards and all community organizations to not only educate everyone about the census, it's but also its importance and how it does affect not only our communities but our city and our state as a whole, so not to take up too much time.
We are also recruiting heavily right now for field operations, and if anyone is interested or knows, anyone who might be interested I have a lot of people that come to me and just ask You know what I have a full-time job, Let them know that we are hiring in the field.
Okay, so we'll leave that aside, and so they get nothing for handling the bags, putting them out collecting the money and sending it back to the city and state I'm, not sure about that I, don't think it's gonna, work.
My, goodness, is the chairpersons report and that's me: So the several of the community board chairs in Queens County at least decided that our board members should be identified pretty much as the council members, this assembly persons.
We just asked that if you could educate your friends and family, if you don't know the number don't pick up the phone, if it's the IRS they're not going to contact us me for money that way, Social Security will only contact you by the mail, if you're not sure, and you want And if they say they're from the NYPD or law enforcement.
Although the councilmember Holden, wanted me to tell all of you that there's going to be a street renaming for Jack Horan's on 82nd Avenue and Myrtle Avenue, this Saturday January 11th at 2 p.m. and everybody is invited to attend that the councilmember also wanted me to tell you that he's looked at a bus plan redesign and he feels that on committee is lost time to many buses.
And he's upset also that they're not coming to Maspeth or middle village for a meeting with the community about these loss of transportation, and if the bus plan stays the way it is right now, Very much representing senator addabbo is Sarah's biltman Everyone, as my boss gets back to work up in Albany.
Our entire office wants to wish everybody a happy, a safe and prosperous new year, as always feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns about anything.
So if you want to come volunteer and help make food for the needy, or if you have anyone that you know that needs to fulfill any service hours from school or in general.
Now it's my pleasure to introduce the interim borough president of Queens, because she's not acting I just want to come by and say hello to certainly our board members but of course, members of the community.
Thank you very much happy New, Year and I look forward to speaking and working with you.
All right so don't shoot the messenger here, but I, resent it the board at the borough board meeting last week and they went over primarily the plan That, the MTA and the D-O-T, the new bus network, the redesign and the narrative they'd like us to use, and it took a tip a little while for us to get used to it.
They feel that will and bus is not really going down side streets that might not have meant for buses like J, Avenue.
You, know simple things that can be done: I understand that they don't want to stop every block, but we have buses express buses blowing by Glendale coming from Howard Beach, which, if they just add, stopped at Metropolitan and Woodhaven for the 16 like think the 17, the 18 they all come.
Is that I think the community board's recommendations are going to be very important to this process.
I know you stay neutral on this, but as the chair of Transportation I really think that we have to get in front of this community board 5:00 And, it's important that we meet And, you know, from a personal perspective, I made an attempt not to drive and take public transportation in and out of Manhattan disasters from Glendale.
That pushed me back in a car, so I really would like to see this work, and so the cars are off the street and we are able to take a bus or a train and what I see happening right.
Instead of 61st, we're doing committee work again things we need to hear from every okay, so little business , Okay, there's an error on the minutes where they listed me as second vice president of the Community Council.
As far, as our budget goes for this year, you know we got an extra forty, two thousand five hundred dollars from the city council and we can't use it to hire regular staff.
Not only do I want to focus on you, know, respect and respect for women, but also respect for the environment This gets approved, I would like to implement it in that I ran into a lot of bureaucracy.
We might be able to get one for less, but we want something, that's going to last a good amount of time, because we have no assurance that we'll get this money.
You know a lot of money's being poured into New York.
I, don't know we don't hear anything from the police, except the building owners have to file a report.
