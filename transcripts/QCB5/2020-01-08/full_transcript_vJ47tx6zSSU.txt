On the outside, well, it does not matter. Okay, have all the elected officials and their representatives signed in and picked up their mail. Also, thank you Mark. Are you ready ask him if he's ready Laura, would you make sure the offices sign in please-? Thank you he's still trying to get into the system. Edgard, that's okay! You got ta come sit with us. Come on up we'll get sick with you. We share everything here, Oh we'll get to that all right! Well, yes, she's giving me just going to put him in sequences so Mark. Are you ready all right, welcome to Community board fives, regularly scheduled Community board meeting for the month of the new year in January of 2020? Would you all please rise? The flag is in the back on the Wall Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. So the first order of business tonight is a presentation regarding composting and trash, and we have a leguminous the outreach coordinator for the Bureau of recycling and sustainability for New York City Department of Sanitation Allie. Would you take that microphone Allie? Thank you and welcome hello. Can you hear me fantastic? First of all, thank you so much for having me. This is my first time in Queens five community board meetings, so I appreciate the generous offering of time. I know your time is tight. I also appreciate that your agenda is concise and looks like we should be an hour and a half and not four. So thank you. I work for the department, sanitation, specifically in the Bureau of recycling and sustainability. First and foremost, I want to introduce my team. This is our Queens based outreach staff, that's Susan Tanya and Michelle I'm Allie, the three of them back. There work every day in Queens, specifically in Queens, to Queens five and Queen as a part of our make compost not trash outreach campaign. This means that we are going to aim for a few goals. One of them is objectively. We want people participating in the brown Bin program. We want everybody who has a brown bin to be using it to the fullest extent. We want everybody who has one- that's still sitting in their back yard, untouched to investigate a little bit and start setting it out with their neighbors, and we want to make sure everybody in this district knows that you can put meat bones. Dairy tea bags, coffee filters, so much more than I. Think most people realize is able to go in the brown bin and be turned into compost, so that is one of our goals: more material on the trucks. Another is we're engaging volunteers for the first time, because the three of them and a few of us in the office are not nearly enough to knock on the thousands of homes in this district, which is a big part of what we do. We go door- to- door canvassing and we ask people what do you think of this program? What are your challenges with it? Do you need a new bin? We can replace it? Are you worried about smell? We've got some tips and tricks to avoid that these three are absolute professionals at that and the back they're giving out leaf bags right now lawn and leaf bags. So you can set out your extra yard waste. Your leaves anything. That's not food, but still eligible to go in if you're been overflows set it out in these bags on your collection day and it'll get picked up and composted just the same. One non compost related update, we have is the bag ban? That's going into effect. We have flyers talking about how plastic bags will be banned. That will go into effect March first and there will be a five cent fee on paper bags. This is applicable to grocery stores. A lot of retail shops. You'll notice it over time. Probably you will still realize that smaller shops are still using plastic bags. It's not okay, but we're really going to ease into it and start enforcing as soon as that. March first date happens. So if you've any questions about that I'm happy to talk to you afterwards, Tonya is handing out leaf bags they're in sleeves of five. Another thing is, you may have noticed that apartment buildings with more than 10 units do not automatically get enrolled in the program. That does not mean you can not participate. It just means your building is large and has it needs one bin is not going to cut it for ten units. A building with ten units does not have the same needs as a building with 100. So we have this thing. We call an enrollment postcard. It's got the Bin right on it gives you the link for a form to fill out online. That puts you in touch with us. At the end of the day, you'll need somebody like a building manager, a superintendent, a board member somebody with decision-, making capabilities to sign off on it, but anyone even a resident can make their initial request we'll reach out to whatever contact information you give us we'll conduct a site visit, determine how many bins you need anywhere from 2 to 100 if need be, and then we'll get you added to a row and you'll be good to go composting with the rest of your district. Another thing we have is this very helpful book work. It has little diagrams of everything, that's eligible for our recycling streams, but, more importantly, on the back, it has a link to all the questions for programs that, yes, in my offers, so if you've ever wondered what to do with your electronics and have found trouble googling, it there's a link. That brings you exactly to that information same with clothing and textiles. Harmful products like paint and the very last link is a link to order all of these materials and so much more straight to your door straight to your community organization. Whatever you need, we will ship it to you for free, of course. So my big asks of you tonight are you involved in community groups. If we're not already working with you, can you introduce yourselves to us? We will be chatting up anybody with a smile. We want contacts, we want to be doing more cleanups, we want to be doing more streets, we care events where we remove litter and apply compost, teach residents how to apply compost, because it's one thing to say: put the material in the Brown Bin and it's another to show you what it looks like a few months later with what you've done, because you made the choice to separate it. So in the fall we were conducting leaf. Rakes come spring, we'll be doing the same thing in parks all over the place, we'll be doing part cleanups same thing, removing litter, taking care of those trees and applying compost, and we also do really fun events because we're trying to make sure that people are as interested in what we're doing. As we are so my night at the footlight bar, we will be doing compost trivia. It is medium difficulty if you've never heard of the ins and outs of soil science, you'll still be able to get by and I highly recommend checking it out as an entry point to figuring out what this program is all about. We also do compost happy hours where you'll be able to talk and chat with people about our work about other people in the field and about some of the issues you might be having with your Brown bins and if you're interested in volunteering but you're not quite sure, you're capable we've been doing major volunteer trainings, we offer them in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and even Manhattan. If you work in Manhattan and can't make it to some of our Queens based events that start at 6:00, so we are really trying to reach as many people as possible we're trying to teach you how to answer pretty common questions that we get. We are trying to teach you how to most effectively have a conversation at a door in those five seconds you have before somebody says: I'm sorry I have to go, make dinner and closes the door we totally understand, but that date is really helpful to us. That being said, I want to give you a chance to ask me any questions. Please keep it. Compost related, as that's my role, I'm an outreach coordinator, and if there are other DSN where I related questions I have some contacts that can put you in touch with from the Bureau of community affairs or maybe on the uniform side. Depending on your issue. Okay, would you reiterate that the bag law, then, when it was passed when it goes into effect and what it means, because I know it will be good for us? Our neighbors will not be putting their garbage on the street corners with the plastic bags. Mm-, hmm, so the first distinction I'll make is the difference between a carry out plastic bag. Single- use like you get at the grocery store and a garbage pail liner and that's a concern people have is: what are we going to put our waste in, so you will still be able to purchase those thick plastic liners at a grocery store that are intentionally made for garbage the clear ones that you put your recycling in the black ones that you put your refuse in those will still be available for purchase and then whatever stores you're currently buying them in this mainly targets supermarkets and other large retail stores that are giving you a single- use bag. Every time you buy something for a small as a bar of soap or trap, stick to an entire load of groceries. The five cent fee on paper bags. It's just a reminder to bring your own bags, so it's a small penalty, but it's a penalty. Nonetheless, that being said, it will not. Residents who are using snap or WIC to buy their groceries will not be asked to pay that fee. Those are the main keys and a major exception that I think we get a lot of questions about is takeout. If you order food directly to your door, it can still come in one of those single use bags, but you will feel it the most at grocery stores, when you will not be able to carry out 18 plastic bags. So is there a program for groceries and supermarkets to notify their customers that this is happening? Is there a program I'm not quite sure, in the sense that you're asking there's definitely a lot of outreach happening? We have a commercial team with about a dozen people who does a lot of outreach at major chains and smaller stores, as well all over the city, making sure that this message is getting out there and then it would be on the store themselves to advertise that, in fact, on the train ride today, I saw a Subway ad about it. So residents should be seeing things like that, especially in the next month, or so as we're leading up to March 1st. That should give you enough of a heads up. If not, we are also going to be giving out our orange reusable bags. We are in the process of reaching out to elected officials, community boards to start distributing those bags, along with this flyer, to make sure that everybody knows they're, not just getting a free bag they're getting something that they should and could use at. The grocery store will you'll be leaving as supply at our office. Not tonight, I do not have any on me, but that is the plan. Is that all community boards and elected officials- any of your board members? Yes, I, just want to know if that orange thing lists all the things that you could put in the year and those brown pills that I have that I never use these stickers do have good telling of meat bones dairy. Those are some of the things we get asked about the most and some of the food soiled paper products like napkins, you can absolutely put in your brown Bin keep the boxes where you've been told that the grease is not enough to put is a deterrent to put it in the paper, you can put that whole box in the Brown Bin and it will get turned into compost. I can pick them up as a community law office. In fact, the dry material that you put in there be pizza boxes or dry leaves do wonders for reducing odors. So if you are having problems with that be sure to cut your brown bin with something dry like paper, towels newspapers, things that will still break down but make it I have no garbage. I have compost and recycling I cheat a little once in a while, but especially with the plastic bags. That's the dream: it works, yeah, there's still those green bags, so you can line your brown bin with a plastic clear liner, the same you use for recycling. You can line it with a paper bag. You can line it with a biodegradable bag. You can not line it at all. If you are committed to cleaning it out right. The only thing that is not allowed is a black garbage bag. It's a little bit of a mixed signal for the sanitation workers Ritchie the microphone hello. Yes, curious! All of the compost. Where does that get sent to get composted? It's a different answer, depending on which part of the city you're in and honestly, even within sections of a community board district. So I can't give you an exact address, but we have roughly 12 regional facilities. We have one in Staten Island, one in sound millirems. We have a few in upstate, New, York, Pennsylvania Connecticut, all within I, think 200 miles of New York City is where it's going and it's going by barge and it's going by truck and it's going by rail. In fact, back in October, we opened up our Staten Island facility for the first time to the public. We plan on doing something similar in the spring. So even if you were organic, waste is not ending up and in Staten Island it's a cool opportunity to check out what the machinery looks like to how we separate the bags and get just the organic material. What it looks like over the next few months, so that from food scraps to healthy, nutritious compost, I saw another hand who's that microphone. No, my years ago, we received a composting barrel which I still have, but unfortunately it's starting to disintegrate itself. From use do they still supply them? I do not know if I know what you're referencing so I'm going to assume not, but is it like a tumbler? No, it's not a tumbler. It was just like a large garbage bag, garbage container, that we put it in and then dirt, and then it had a slide on the bottom that you took the compost down. Oh I, see now it's a special program for compost. Okay, they do not do that. We do not still give those out, but we do have plenty of literature. If you're worried about upkeep and maintenance, we probably have some tricks some time sheets on how to manage it. Thank you delays this again, as he did last year for the five cent bag. Unfortunately, my job is just outraged, so I'm not involved in those kinds of conversations, I think anything is possible in terms of timeline. I'm not sure if I had one I would happily give notice, but my guess is as good as yours. I have another question here: it's for the five cents that supermarkets are going to be charging for the bags. Where do those five cents go after? Do supermarkets keep the five cents, or does it have to get sent back to the city? That is a good question. I do not have an answer for it, but I know how to find one. If you want to give me your business card, I can email you an answer tomorrow, or even I can email higher- up and just a note on that. The last legislation I read on that the five cents goes to the supermarket. Okay does not go back to the city unless something changed to that anyone else. Thank you very much. Thank you. So much for your time we're going to hang around for questions. We've got plenty of stuff to give out new recycling stickers if your bin is looking a little grungy and information if you live in apartment building, so please follow up with us. I have business cards as well. I look forward to working with you. Thank you. The next item of business is the public forum again I. Try to reiterate no personal attacks, no foul language, no off-, the-, cuff accusations, and things like that. So the first speaker is Anthony Vucic. Okay, the other rule is no more than three minutes to each speaker. Bob Chameli him three minutes. Yes, everybody I was in a meeting last month and they were talking about the census and they told me it'd, be a good idea to speak to you guys about the census and give you some bulletins about it, because it's coming up very soon. It comes up on E once every 10 years and there's a lot of things involved with this. So I'm just going to give you some motives, because you only have three minutes. So let me just start reading some of these things. What is the census? It's a count of people in this country. It's a constitutional requirement that we count the people in this country, it's conducted by the US, Census Bureau, it's a nonpartisan government agency and 2020 census counts. The population in all 50 states and various districts of the of this country. Each home will receive an invitation to respond with a short questionnaire, online phone or mail. This would be the first time you could do it online by the way. This is something new. It will mark the first time responding as I said online. The census provides critical data, lawmakers business owners, teachers and many others use this data for their own use. When you could get this data, some people pay for this data, but they do not realize you could actually get it from the Census Bureau, and this data can be important if you open up a new business is something like that. Another important thing is and I think I. Remember: I, think we lost a seat last time because we were under counted now. He could have been under counted because we on the counted or could have been that there was a less population in our particular area, but they do draw condition congressional lines based on the population and, more importantly, you might also say it's money. You get the federal funds to pay for hospitals, sometimes by the parliaments, health care systems and, as chair of the health and Services Committee I've, seen five hospitals close in district in this district County of Queens. So you know you want federal funds when you have the population here, a lot of populations are going to be afraid to actually do the census. Some may be immigrants and what- have- you and they're frightened, maybe they're on record in. So what have you? But if they're here and they're living here, their information is going to be private. It's by law. It must be private, it must be anonymous. You will be part of the census as an aggregate so that you know you'll be part of a statistical number, but you they won't give you the info. The individual information they get from you are a prefer, is going to be the big number. That's when they, you know how you're living at a particular place at a particular time. It depends on that April 1st, that's the key number and you know there's a lot of bill, a lot of technology going on to this. They actually got pictures of houses and streets and again they're having people right now go out and actually check these things. That's my three minutes, but I just wanted to give you a bulletin, get out and tell your friends there is the census, it's very important, to get out there and encourage them to do it. You guys I, know you're going to do it, but tell you people. Thank you. Thank you. I'm here to oppose the mta's rerouting of the q18 and a q67 in Maspeth. They want to reroute it off at 65th, place on to 69th Street, to Roosevelt Avenue for the 7 train, which is not handicap accessible, no access to the Allied Mm- Wha. We have a lot of people in the co- op's on 65th place that counts on that bus, to get them to the train into their doctors and to whatever place they have to go. We need to go to that meeting. Everyone who's from the aspects and support not to have them change this lab. It is imperative that master, keep that queue, 18 and 67 running for people to get to school, to work and to handicap accessible trains. Thank you. Thank you. The next speaker is Jennifer Rajkumar good evening. I'm Jennifer Rajkumar from Woodhaven I want to stop by tonight to introduce myself to those of you. I have not yet met I'm running for a state assembly, I'm running against Michael, Miller and I wanted to especially stop by, because I know everyone on the board. If you devote this much time it's, this is really a labor of love and so I really respect all the work that you do and I'm eager to learn from you and hear about the issues of concern and let you know that I'm always here eager to work with you, I, have read the annual report with great interest that the board has put out and I follow all your committee reports and I so respect the level of detail, granular, detail and expertise that you have on all these issues. A little bit about me is that I am a professor at CUNY I used to work for the governor of New York I'm, an attorney and I'm just very eager to bring energy and strong leadership to the district. I know there are so many issues tonight, so I do not really want to take up much time, but I just wanted to introduce myself I look forward to hearing what everyone says and please come talk to me if you're interested in working on issues or sharing information and I'm going to leave my Flyers here so that if you want to get in touch, you can do that. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. The next speaker is John Ortiz I could evening everybody happy new year, I'm the owner of Sundown, Barn, Forest Avenue in catalpa and I'm here to answer any concerns and questions regarding our expansions with the cellar space I have all our gob approved plans and I'll be in the back table to address any of that. If anybody would like to approach regarding that, that's it! Thank you. The last speaker is shreya, sure, Marty I, hope I did not mess that up too badly good evening. Everyone I am Shruti Marty I work with the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of the census. The gentleman a few minutes before me has pretty much done a good chunk of my work here today. In talking about the census. We are reaching out to all five boroughs in Manhattan. As many of you may know, in 2010, the borough of Queens was severely undercounted. New York as a whole state lost two seats in Congress in the House of Representatives as a result of a low count. So this time around for 2020 we're, definitely getting out there and trying to read all community boards and all community organizations to not only educate everyone about the census, it's but also its importance and how it does affect not only our communities but our city and our state as a whole, so not to take up too much time. But we have a table back here with some more information. We are also recruiting heavily right now for field operations, and if anyone is interested or knows, anyone who might be interested I have a lot of people that come to me and just ask you know what I have a full- time job, but I just want to do something to help out with the census and I. Let them know that we are hiring in the field. It's absolutely vital that we try to get an accurate count. This time for 2020 and I hope that Community Board 5, along with the Census Bureau, can partner up to make this goal attainable. Thank you so much just for the question about where the 5 cents for the bags goes. So three of the cents goes towards a state environmental fund and the other two cents go back to the city towards buying bags and redistributing the ones that they have so the. If I get this correct, you won't require the supermarket or store buy bags, sell them to a customer for five cents and give that five cents back. So the store is losing money and it's costing them employee time and energy. So what they even participate- I'm, not totally sure about that, but from my understanding, the two cents from it are going back to buying those bags for the stores. Okay, so we'll leave that aside, and so they get nothing for handling the bags, putting them out collecting the money and sending it back to the city and state I'm, not sure about that. I do not think it's going to work. Thank you. I know. I, just I mean legislators. If you or anyone's here representing a legislature, try reading the builds you write in sign. Okay, thank you, the next item of business and we're Oh or even ahead of time. My goodness is the chairpersons report and that's me Vincent, our Curie chairperson, so the several of the Community board chairs in Queens County at least decided that our board members should be identified pretty much as the council members, this assembly persons, the Senate is the Congress persons and several of us have designed individual lapel pins, so Tonight board members. You should have all received your official Committee Board five Lapel pin now. Typically you wear them to meetings. You wear them to civic associations, you wear it when you go to Borough, Hall or City Hall, and it's a Greg ignition that you are a representative of the overall community and a fourth person. So thank you, Laura for distributing and I hope you like the design because I designed it it's okay. So tonight that was staff members president tonight Gary Joe, Daniel, Kathy, O'leary and Lauren Mulvihill, representing the borough president joined on Sereno. Is she here yet all right? So in a few minutes, Sarah Sharon Lee, the acting borough president, will be here and will introduce in the meantime, from the hunt a fourth Precinct. We have police officers, inaud Lee bearish and a bundle who's. Speaking all of you step up to the Mic please good evening, everyone Happy New Year trip to see everyone hope everyone had a safe and healthy holidays. It's over just the recap, I guess being that it's or we've won over the new year. So I could give you numbers but they're not going to make any difference we're only week. One obviously overall grant Lakshmi is what drove our crime up last year and that's a little stuff that you hear me speak about all the time. Let's speak about all the time. Mainly the telephone stands unattended. Property leaving valuables in your car are all things that could be prevented. So a lot of the crime that takes place here is all preventable. Do not leave the iPad in the car headsets in the car, the phone stamps they're still going around. We just asked that if you could educate your friends and family, if you do not know the number do not pick up the phone. If it's the IRS they're not going to contact us me for money that way, Social Security will only contact you by the mail, if you're not sure- and you want a double check- do not pull the number that they're leaving you on your voicemail go down in person and talk to them in person. They've been using. Numbers are very similar to numbers that you guys know so do not be fooled by that either and just do not bother answering them yeah and if they say they're from the NYPD or law enforcement, we will not contact you to solicit, do for any type of funds. So keep your money, no one's, going to ask you to purchase a gift card or an Apple iTunes card, and ask you to put funds on that card and then deliver it all the scam all false. So those are all things that contribute to the grant. Larson is because the amount of money and the way that the crime is being done is all full under the category of Ryan Lawson. So that's why Grand Larceny czar always driving us here in the 1 or 4, so a lot of it could be prevented is preventable. However, we do need your help if you just educate your friends, families neighbors just word of mouth that will help hopefully drive down somewhere to cry. Thank you have a happy new year and that's it we'll see you all the meters to start on backups and all the Civic meetings will be seeing. Everyone start the new year. The phone calls we had an elderly woman coming in the office this morning. She had a phone call about removing the lead paint in her multiple dwelling house, and she want to know what she should do. She tried calling back hitting the numbers, but it did not work and it took me about 20 minutes to explain to her. No one is going to call you it's a scam, so I go home, taking down all my Christmas decorations and, taking my afternoon now and I get to Social Security phone calls, so you know it's they're doing it. It's the season, so be careful all right. The next speaker is representative Nydia, Velazquez, Rep and Julio Salazar Julio, please good evening. Everyone again Julio Salazar, congresswoman, Nydia Velazquez office I'll be very quick today. Firstly, happy New Year to everyone. Hopefully we can continue to work together with the board. This 2020s, just one quick piece of announcement. I know at the last community board or in the November community board. I mentioned a piece that was on the members agenda, which was the Community Reinvestment Act, and the regulatory reforms that were there were pending. Unfortunately, several regulatory agencies and the regulators still have not come to terms as to what the plan should be to reform that the Community Reinvestment Act. However, the member will continue to pursue and push through the Subcommittee on finance, sensible reforms to the community CRA. This is of major points like I shared in November. These are, the CRA will dictate the amount of investment that comes to low to middle income neighborhoods. There are many areas within the CRA that fall within Cd7 congressional district 7, so this is of major importance to the member she's going to continue to push forward the new concerns that she's hearing from some of the advocates from community members on the subcommittee and if there's any updates as to what the final plan is and what the final reforms will be. All of course, share that with the board, either through an email through an announcement or here in hearing at the at the Community Board meeting, but other than that again happy New Year to everyone we're located over at 260 Broadway phone number is seven one, eight, six, four five one, four nine! Thank you. Thank you representing Congresswoman, Grace Mang is Christian Romero, who might want to personally thank for helping out a family friend with some business. Thank you very much. Thank You Mr. Chair Happy new year. Everyone, it's been an incredibly busy first session for the 116th Congress. Now that we're rolling back in I just wanted to let you know there were 400 bills passed in the House of Representatives 275 of those were bipartisan support, so that's good. The Appropriations Committee funded fully funded census for 2020, so shout out to the census, people and lastly, I just wanted to report one quick bill that I think is extremely important: HR 3, lower prescription costs now add the congresswoman voted for this passage of HR 3. It would lower drug prices, including insulin and other life-, saving and life staining drugs, provide dental vision and hearing benefits in Medicare. This does not exist. Right now provide ten billion to fight opioid crisis and provide ten billion for community health centers. That's it for me, Happy New, Year again and have a great night thank you representing councilmember, Bob, Holden and charlief of risk. Although the Councilmember Holden wanted me to tell all of you that there's going to be a street renaming for Jack Horan's on 82nd Avenue and Myrtle Avenue, this Saturday January 11th at 2 p.m. and everybody is invited to attend that the Councilmember also wanted me to tell you that he's looked at a bus plan redesign, and he feels that on committee is lost time to many buses and he's upset also that they're not coming to Maspeth or middle village for a meeting with the community about these loss of transportation, and if the bus plan stays the way it is right now and they do not make any changes. The councilmember will be totally against that. Thank you. Thank you. Very much representing senator Addabbo is Sarah's biltman hello, everyone happy new year.

So thank you representing Assemblymember hevesy is Kevin Wisniewski good evening. Everyone Kevin was an esky with some women have a C's office. Just a few quick announcements. Tonight first, is that we recently had three bills signed into law by Governor Cuomo. Two of them are related to ensuring that certain social workers and child care providers are trained in adverse childhood experiences, so they can identify trauma and the children they provide for, and you know and better understand them and provide comprehensive services, and the third bill creates a new mechanism that allows survivors of domestic violence to terminate leases that are held in the names of their abuser, which provides them with a chance to leave unsafe conditions without having to incur undue financial burdens. Lastly, I just want to report that we were able to collect over 50 gift packages for mothers that are either homeless or facing homelessness in our drive towards the end of 2019. So just want to thank everybody that contributed and look forward to working with everybody in 2020 Thanks. Thank you representing Assemblymember bond. Well is, let's see here Evan good evening.

You'll get one job I'd like to recognize the two of the press corps that I hear today: David Russell from The Chronicle and Benjamin Fong from the Queens ledger. Thank you for what you do for us. Walter Sanchez has a report from the last parole board meeting Walter. All right so do not shoot the messenger here, but I resent it the board at the Borough board meeting last week and they went over primarily the plan that the MTA and the D- O- T, the new bus network, the redesign and the narrative they'd like us to use, and it took a tip a little while for us to get used to it. This is like we're not changing bus routes, we're scrapping all the bus routes and starting from scratch. So yeah our district here, probably the way it looks, and they gave an idea of what the design is I'll leave. This up here probably could has more turns than most other districts, but they what they want to do is have fewer stops, so they'll be wider apart and they want to have straighter routes to Subway's. They feel that will and bus is not really going down side streets that might not have meant for buses like J Avenue. The q67 might be the answer, however. I really they're going to have some public works workshops, they're calling them take up the tabletop exercises to provide input. We're having a meeting here. We're the first meeting and that's at the greater in Youth Council on January 21st from 6 to 8 p.m. and our committee will be there, our transportation committee, but there we could make comments and look at it and see what we think, but the idea is to get to the Train the subways faster, whether it's the there's a route, there's an express bus route that goes up to the Bronx up to the Bronx Zoo. That's very is supposed to save 10 minutes from what it what it was now. So you know look at it with open eyes. We were pretty skeptical. The board chairs were a little bit skeptical, but you know it does make sense, they're putting the bike lanes and in bus lanes all over the place, and you know this seems to be a lot of traffic. So something has to be done. There are going to be fewer bus miles that just are there going to be fewer bus miles and fewer buses on the road and fewer stops, so there'll be five blocks between stops, as opposed to maybe three that you'll see now along Grand Avenue. That's all I have to say I, it was. You know it was pretty informative about an hour MT ADOT. They were put on this spot and kind of explain themselves, but they'll be at these meetings. So I encourage you to come to the meeting and talk about it and take a look at it. First before you have comments, yes, Walter they're, caging, these as workshops yes, I mean, then is this a public hearing? Where are we going with this because I looked at it from a from Glendale and Marianas, looked at it from Maspeth, and we do not have great public transportation in Glendale and the one bus that goes to the Express train is now being eliminated. The 23 the 47, which takes care of the kids going to Jackson, Heights and all along 88Th Street, that's out good thing that it's no longer going through yeah Atlas, which was a waste of time. So how much input do we have? We have things? You know simple things that can be done: I understand that they do not want to stop every block, but we have buses express buses blowing by Glendale. Coming from Howard Beach, which, if they just add, stopped at Metropolitan and Woodhaven for the 16 like think the 17, the 18 they all come down, that would be. That would really increase yeah transportation. For us, we do not have much. They talked about at length at this at the meeting they talked about, which routes make have it have a lot of ridership which lose money they have to subsidize. What we got from it is that I think the community board's recommendations are going to be very important to this process and they took us seriously. The MTA was there: they take us seriously to do T Jason, we all know Jason. He was at many meetings here from the do team just contribute. One thing: you asked about kind of scale like what is the actual kind of timeline of this. They came out at the end of December with a this plan, this draft plan, but before that they had also given an evaluation, and you can find all these documents online, an evaluation of current conditions and current statistics and how this system is running. They were asked by the MTA New York City Transit, to look at it as revenue neutral, so they are adding services like out and farther Eastern Queens, but they have to balance that by looking at other places and possibly removing services and other places I'm not being an advocate for that I'm. Just saying that's kind of one of their approaches to this is the first draft they're looking at it for two months. The timeline is on the web. They have a forum on the web that you can submit any kind of comments. Any airlines that you're talking about now they're using some of those same numbers for other lines that do not match at all so be very aware of what it is scrapped and they're reusing numbers. But you got to really talk about like specific lines with the new terminology when you're giving them feedback and for the next two months, they're going to be looking at these workshops and then they're going to come back with a final draft, which will then take some more feedback. Probably and then they'll come back with the plan itself, which will go into implementation. Roughly 2021 the idea of not going down side- street future, so narrow I was just wondering because you said that you made it seem like the main design of busses is to take riders to train stations. Yeah and that's hard. I became a certified transportation expert like us, for disabled people and a lot of disabled people or elderly people can't go up and down the stairs for trains and for them the goal is not to get from a bus to a train is just to get from a bus to the destination. You know the challenges in this district and if you look at a subway map where we're barren over here, it's a desert. The challenges, the district are very different than anywhere else, where they're in subway all over the city, so I do believe in I'm glad they're doing it first here, because I do believe that this is going to take a whole different look than any other bus. Any other areas in this in the entire city actually Joe. You wanted to say something. Thank you and yes, what John had mentioned about the timeline? There's going to be two full months of this, but what I really wanted to say at this moment this coming Friday all the elected officials from Queens are coming into Borough, Hall and Andy. Byford will be there plus all the bus engineers and it will be an all- day process and they've broken it down into sections of Queens, because, as you can imagine, buses run, you know through different areas and any animal questions and concerns of each area will be spoken directly to your elected officials, they're all going to be in on Friday and then from there I think, there's already 13 workshops that they've set up throughout the borough. My office, you could you know people are shooting bus line, concerns into me, making sure it's in front of them. It is a longer process, it is a draft and there will be they will be taking a lot of input so, but I wanted you guys to know that the electives are in and involved very early on again. I know you stay neutral on this, but as the chair of Transportation I really think that we have to get in front of this community board 5:00 and it's important that we meet and we all know when the meeting is- and you know, from a personal perspective, I made an attempt not to drive and take public transportation in and out of Manhattan disasters from Glendale. You know gave me no choice that pushed me back in a car, so I really would like to see this work, and so the cars are off the street and we are able to take a bus or a train and what I see happening right now, it's just going to make it a little more difficult and hence more cars and I know that's not the intent, but it's the reality of it. Definitely things that we need to look at and back on and I'm, not saying that we should not be doing that and I will. We are trying to line up a presentation to our committee directly from the team. Hopefully that will happen at our February meeting. We are I'm going to be present at the one in Ridgewood on the 21st I would say to everybody. Look at the MTA schedule on their website. Go to any of the meetings there is like I said a forum put in your feedback. Make it productive. I mean honestly, as Walters pointed out. One of the things that we really do need to look at is speeding buses up to make them more desirable and one of the that those points is kind of repositioning the stops which I think they very well addressed. So we need to tell them when we think they've done something right. We also need to tell them where we think they've missed an opportunity. Our cue 39 there, if you look on the current proposed map, there's nothing below Myrtle Avenue right now. A part of that is that they have not looked at Brooklyn, yet they're, just starting the preliminary on Brooklyn right now they have done Staten Island and the Bronx, but those were not as all- encompassing as Walter said this one. They actually said we're just going to wipe it clean and start fresh with the Bronx and Staten Island. It was really kind of just tweaking and looking at a few significant lines. So this is a different approach to it. I think they're going to take that same kind of approach and move it to Brooklyn and do the same thing there. We might see a little bit of improvement below this ion assay that the queue 58 and what they're looking at doing is a wonderful thing, because they're actually going to break it into two lines, one that gets you super fast over to Flushing and in central parts of Queens, with very minimal stops and then another one that follows more or less the old local route and diverges a little bit at the end. But it's still also a little bit more expedited and better for us. Both routes go along Grand Avenue. You know we could take this as the golden opportunity to get the right set up the community boy at five and not miss that shredder. So, even though we might be looking at less buses, we're going to get more bus, are there more bustling? Can we get any more bus links? This is honestly. This is an MTA and yct plan. This it does give recommendations, but it does not necessarily call for any specific action by the city. The city then, will have to follow on that plan from the city is already starting to be put in place and that's the bus forward, which has its own publication, and you can find that on the D- O- T website. Okay, thank you. Yes, they did all this research and they did not come to a conclusion. Is what you're saying no? They did the research they. So it's more proposal and now they're looking for feedback on their first iteration. So this is not a proposal. It's not a clock ticking on this I'm just curious. How come they would reroute the q18 on 69Th Street to and San Roosevelt? Would it's not handicap accessible instead of 61st rated 65th place, which is a big enough Street I'm all for not going down the side streets, but you got elevators there for the handicapped. You got escalators there for the handicapped, so I do not understand where they're coming from with that part. Okay, so we have to advise them right now, we're doing committee work again things we need to hear from every okay, so little business and we did not take care of the minutes. I needs one have anything to say on the minutes. Okay, there's an error on the minutes where they listed me as second vice president of the Community Council. I am second vice president of the civilian observation patrol Jacob, and not the Community Council, which is a different organization. That's corrected, Fred seconded all in favor, okay, liquor, wine and beer license application. Renewals new liquor license Panini in doing business as Joe dollars.

Nine thirteen Wyckoff Avenue notified as corporate change, whereby Maria Mejia will replace Fabien Castillo as principal corporate, and those of you who are may be questioning. What's going on in six eight three eight Forest Avenue, the building alteration application for the cellar occupancy has been filed and approved. There are multiple licenses at that location. We've asked the building department to look into it further to see how it fits zoning wise and construction wise, because it appeared to us that the secondary means of egress out of the cellar for restaurant area was exiting through another business establishment. On the first floor, which is permitted if it's designated as an area of Refuge, but that particular facility only has one means of egress, so there would be two separate exiting requirements coming out of one place, so we've asked them to look into that and that's that any questions or comments. Okay, it's that time of year. There's the street fairs that we know that are happening. April 20th is the Myrtle Avenue Ridgewood festival sponsored by the Ridgewood Local Development Corporation September 3rd is the Fresh Pond Street festival sponsored by the federally owned. The July 19th is the Myrtle Avenue festival spots upon going Dale Kiwanis, the September 13th is the Myrtle Avenue festival sponsored by mob bitten, Myrtle, Avenue, Business, Improvement, District and June 28th is the Grand Avenue festival sponsored by the mass spec Chamber and lion mess with lions and Kiwanis Clubs? Okay, yes, microphone! Please I believe you said for the Ridgewood Street Fair, you said to 20th of April, that's actually to 19th I'm. Sorry, that's correct: okay, 19th, okay, Mr. Jordano! When he gives his report we'll talk about the budget and items that we discussed at the executive committee meeting because he took all the notes and my brain is burned for now. So with that, if there's nothing more Mr. Jordano, please I'm. Sorry, yeah, Thank, You, Donald, okay, so yeah I'm hobbling a little bit. I messed up my foot a while ago and had a x- ray came up. Negative I had an MRI and it's showing some damage so I'm wearing a full cam boot for the next three weeks, I'm three weeks in so maybe you go a lot slower when you're in this thing, so you have to kind of try to stay off your feet and for most of you, as you may realize, easier said than done so I'm, hopefully I'm healing, okay, so happy New Year to all of you. I wish you good health through you and your loved ones, and all year and a little bit of prosperity, Plus and hopefully we can all work together again to keep these neighborhoods good and make them even better. As far as our budget goes for this year, you know we got an extra forty, two thousand five hundred dollars from the city Council and we can't use it to hire regular staff and we can't use it to give staff increases. So I proposed the program last year, which is being passed around and I call I'm, calling it the respect program. It was approved by the board last year, I'm very concerned with too much lack of respect for people, especially women in society, and how we hear of all these cases of abuse and I think we have a significant problem in our own precinct. With regard to the number of calls that police officers have to respond to related to the potential for mastic violence. So as I write here, a read recent news story- maybe it's not that recent anymore, that the USA being the tenth most violent country on earth for women? Not only do I want to focus on you know, respect and respect for women, but also respect for the environment and I, see too much of an influence in media with regard to promoting bad behavior and there's things I do not even see so if this gets approved, I would like to implement it in that I ran into a lot of bureaucracy. Last year you know previously, we had used board money for a graffiti removal program and it was very successful, but a damper was put on that as far as the bureaucracy of it goes. They're telling me they want us to hire a private contractor which would be exceedingly expensive. So when we did that Graffiti removal program, we had 30,000 removals in 14 years, so we were doing 2,000 paint over a year now. I want to do something else. The place that the bureaucracy is not I, think going to be as much of a problem because they wanted you to hire a consultant. Is that now they'll allow you to hire a temporary worker which we can do through Goodwill Industries? So a woman has been volunteering at the office for over a year, I would like to hire. Her name is Linda Al, Bello and she's bilingual, which will be an asset to us, because Cathy speaks some Spanish, but the Linda speaks fluent Spanish I think she's in Spanish. As far as her heritage go goes, so that would help with people come in any office. But all we also we're getting a word out. So if this gets approved, I would like some help in putting together what we will say to try to increase, respect and vary in many different areas and I put it forth to you. So, like I said this was approved last year. The budget is for twenty five thousand one hundred and twenty five dollars. The worker does not get$ 25 an hour. They get more like sixteen, but they will they'll get their FICA matched. You know their social security and their Medicare payments matched. You know, they'd still take seven point. Six five percent, since Ronald Reagan was president and the fund is going down the drain and Workman's comp Scott to be paid for by goodwill, disability, insurance and I. Think unemployment as well and they'll get some sort of an administrative fee. The other things we're talking about spending money. On of that forty two thousand five hundred is a new photocopier, slash printer I budgeted six thousand dollars for that. We might be able to get one for less, but we want something: that's going to last a good amount of time, because we have no assurance that we'll get this money. Next year this has been, you know, a year- by- year situation and an office security system which we are told, is budgeted for five thousand dollars with video at three locations than you would like. So the point is a lot of community boys are having difficulty figuring out how to spend the money without just buying more things that they really do not need. So we bought a big huge television set for the office, which is well to me. It is okay and new computers. So now we're talking about a printer, but there's only so much equipment you can buy so I do not see how you can do that without doing something programmatically- and this is my idea so the rest of the budget we tweak, but we can't put in the budget mods right now. They won't accept them. So as soon as we know, when we can put the budget mods in did everybody get a cop, no well yeah and we'll produce it for you, as second did Ted all in favor, and we will send it out to you as soon as we know the approval on that and that particular line and when we hone in better on the door security door security system will be a camera looking at the front door, because you know, if you visit the office and I know of all of you become to the office, you can't see the front door from in the office and the other day. Laura was there by herself. She had to lock herself in you know, and I had to call it as when I got there and Gary's always there at night. So in today's world you got to be safe. So that's what we're doing with that. So be a camera on the door. An electric light two monitors said because it was less costly to get the individual like you having your apartment, monitor than to connect the computer to this system. So we'll have two of those and then it you could see was there speak to them and then let them in okay, alrighty so we'll and we'll send that to everyone anything else, Mr. Gene. Thank you. First of all, so, as I said to you know, we've got a lotta. We had a lot of work done in the streets this year. As far as resurfacing goes, we have a lot of sewer work that we've gotten done and more sewer work, common 96 inch, sewer coming in to into middle village, beginning by Juniper Park and going under the railroad tracks. I do not have a timetable for that yet, but some more fun things that are supposed to happen this year is the running track project and the Turf field. Reconstruction at Juniper is supposed to begin fairly early this year, there's supposed to be a new entrance at Forest. Park builds beginning the Union Turnpike and Myrtle Avenue, and going into the park from there we're hoping to see renovations begin at star playground in Ridgewood this year. Rosemary's playground, renovations have are pretty much done right, Mr., Fiedler, so a lot of work. You're just going to see construction all over the city and you know a lot of money's being poured into New York. A lot of falling money's be important to New, York and I. Think that can be an OK thing and I think that can be a real problem, but the economy here is doing quite well and that's why we're able to you know see a lot of these improvements so right now we have another big sewer project in Kalymnos Avenue, going up 70th Street for the Li II. So that's only the beginning of that project, but they're doing Micro tunneling in that project and that's an enormous sewer project as well. So hopefully you know we have not gotten crazy rains and you know a lot of rain in a short period of time, but hopefully we're going to be in good shape with these sewer projects that will have more capacity and less potential for street flooding. Any questions yeah how even more important as house flooding is right because a lot of people's basements. That's why we pushed in Middle Village, because the low point is by Penelope Avenue and 74Th Street. There and people some people when it rained crazy. You know four and a half inches of rain in 45 minutes or three inches of rain in 30 minutes how to foot and a half of water in their basement yeah. The reason why Vinny is a stickler for the microphone is because that's how the tape will pick up best. Okay, some people were complaining that the asphalt that they put over after they do the construction of the sewers I. Had it's a very poor job and I they coming back and doing your finishing work on street sir. That's what I taught not going to stay like that yeah I mean some of the streets are done and most of those are south of Juna small street south of juniper Valley Road, but 74Th Street, penelope Avenue. Those are the two main ones, yeah they're, in bad shape. If you're driving up and L up the Avenue, if you have not done it already, I would not suggest more than five miles per hour. Once you get west to 74Th Street we had, one person makes the asphalt is drainpipe. You know the outside. Faucet can't use it, but I told to call you some problems Gideon to do that thing. Yes, they're supposed to resurface those roadways curb to curb Brian test, okay, yeah, any update on any plans for Glendale. With regard to sewer I know you mentioned it a couple of minutes ago, I believe they're in design. If I remember correctly, the project is SE 877 and that project is primarily 77th Avenue from 81St Street to 88th Street, so I think there in the beginning of design Brian. So you know when we met with them at DEP, in 2007, I got a meeting at DEP at their headquarters in Queens, and what we were pushing was a project for middle village, where this project in the area where this project has taken place, a project from mass V, because Maspeth got flooded bad and a project for Glendale in mainly in eastern Glendale, but also there's concern about that area. At the be you know, the top of the Cooper Avenue underpass 76Th Street over there, by where Cleveland Brothers used to be thank God. We, you know Ridgewood was dry compared to those other neighborhoods. So I did not see that we needed a big sewer project in Ridgewood unless there's something I did not know about, but the other three neighborhoods where we wanted sewer projects to have more capacity, so people would would not get flooded. We will have gotten all three of them once we get to Glendale Geri Dre have to wait for the microphone. Gary I have a question for you and it's probably very difficult or maybe impossible for you to answer so I understand. Regarding the graffiti. You said, Mm paint overs per year. Do you have a breakdown on that? How many they were re graffiti'd? How many were how many times a certain area was painted over the sit over and over again, because I know in my neighborhood I had Mr. Kirschner sent his group in and Mr. Halden sent his people in and the minute of the day or two days later they were all graffitied again, and I was going to speak in the public for and on this, but I have to wait for the next month, because I'm still talking, we contacted the 104 Laura, a young lady in my neighborhood on Christmas morning, two o'clock in the morning decided to take her dog for a walk, and there were four guys I had nothing better to do on Christmas that night, before Christmas, whatever it was to graffiti both sides of the street extensively, they saw they told her in many different words. You know what they were going to do with her abductor was one of the words that I can use here, and she became extremely frightened and ran away when I got home at two o'clock. In the morning, I saw the police cars all over the place and I spoke to them and they said well. The owners of these buildings have to make a report. So that's one thing: I wanted to speak to the 1:04 about and I know the officers were here. I did not want to disrupt the meeting. When does this? When does this stop as jumping of the turnstiles the throwing water on police? Is it going to be urine the next time or acid? When is that this is you know we're talking about selling telling people they should have respect, I respect every race, every religion I demand it from them. If they do not want to respect me from my views and what I am then I do not respect them. If you want to go on our property and start tagging it up and we identify the tech, we've done a lot of work on this over the last 10 years that I've been living there 20 years now. It just does not stop because it's been downgraded to a dismiss demeanor, it's a victimless crime. Nobody is now there renting a citizen just walking into young 24 year old girl. Maybe not you know, rocket scientist thinking that she could be safe in walking her dog at 2:00 in the morning on Christmas. So this is a these paint. Oh was, in my opinion and I know you spent a lot of money and okay and I know you know. Paul has been very active and many other people it ai, not working I, do not know what else to say. I agree with a lot of what you said. Thank you, but it has worked in a lot of cases. Jerry we got Graffiti. This is what I could tell you know. Maspeth where you live, is a big canvas, so it's kind of difficult, because you have these enormous walls and it's desolate at night, but locations that were graffiti. Where Graffiti was on the wall, a paintable surface, you know not brick, but were on gates for decades or at least a half a decade we got it taken off. Restorations got a lot of it taken off how we'll wash it and that sort of thing and in a lot of locations they stayed clean for quite some time. So a lot of it is where it is, and you know how desolate it is and how inviting it is. So that's my question: how long have these ones that stay clean for a long time? How many years how many were just graffiti within a week again? Do you have you do not have it? No I do not have so that's a big. We were Bandidos on the street at six o'clock in the mornin painting, whatever we pleased essentially yeah, whether you liked it or not, so we were in counting, you know what I mean. We would go back out there and get it done again. Yeah! Well we're installing cameras. Now and but that's you know, we have the cameras already at all of all. My houses on my block have the Cameras hands and some of the warehouse has camera looking down the block, and these four guys were ID'd by the young lady and she got the license plate of the car which is Ontario Canada, so that might be a stolen vehicle. I do not know. We do not hear anything from the police, except the building owners have to file a report. What are they going to say? My building was tagged and then the report gets where I do not know. I do not know the answer. I'm, not big. It sounds like I'm sarcastic, but I'm not trying to be I'm very concerned about this, because this seems to be a pattern of disrespect that you were talking about. These people do not respect the private property of the building owners that are trying to make a living in their buildings, Thank, You, Garrett. The reason the property owner needs to file the report is so it's on record, and then it's recognized. It comes that we need more police or more surveillance or more work. If you just do not report it and complain about it, it's not going to be taken care of I. Tell this to my neighbors all the time you know my truck was broken into late summer. I see report thoroughly. No, the police do not-. I said I'll. Tell you what, if you do not report it? I know the police are not going to do anything so we've been through that- we're trying our best down there. It's just really difficult in this country now I've seen a big change so of you we're the same age Vinnie and it's not the same country as it was when we were young. Well we're going to make it America great again for your humor, but little things that you do not notice. Yes, Oh in many ways it is a wonderful country still absolutely but just little things so have you noticed the United States Army current uniform? Yes, I was in the ground. So you remember the brown in ten World War, two, yes, which was the greatest generation. Now the new army is now the great generation and they're wearing the same uniform and it has affected those people because they feel a kinship between the troops now and those that were the greatest generation. So that's little things and we see more and more of that every day you make me feel better now, okay, so we could talk forever, but do we have any committee reports? No one was busy during the off- season, okay, except the executive committee, and we had a little bit of report. That was mostly budget, but we also talked about you know some of the comments that were made here and in your folder. Everyone got every response to some of the comments that were made on the floor last meeting two meetings ago. So I like to put that subject to rest. Everyone knows if you read carefully: everybody understands what went on and I think Jerry's respect, Gary's respect, we have to respect each other, and if we have something to discuss- and you can't reach that person or organization, we would be most happy to be the intermediary or, as he used to say in the old movies, the interlock I could be the interlock okay, so anything else to come before us any old business. Any new business and motion to it. Yes to Fred. Did you get one testing? We did not have business cards in the past. No, you never had business, we stiii had it, but we stopped them because some of our student members were going to sites where we were looking at variances and going in with their business card and insinuating. They were there formally representing the port, so that is Alice. So that's why we've stopped years ago. Yes- and people were printing their own and one of them is seen- is in a deep in Pennsylvania in a rest home right now. That did that. Okay, just remember right all right: everybody need bags, so the girl, the lady's left, but we'll get him at the office. Okay, so see her afterwards. Thank you. I can't Oh Florida there's a card for Pat Grayson who fell broke a hip it's in rehab. If anyone would like to sign it motion, yes, Jerry Drake, yeah, okay, all in favor. Thank you.
