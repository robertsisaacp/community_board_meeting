Okay, somebody on the telephone- I just anybody on the phone right now who has not already told us who they are. Can you tell us who you are? I am Stephen Feedler Okay Marianna, zero. Yes Stephen! We have you that who is the next person? I think it might be me on both mark. For some reason, oh you made it good, that's not what you were saying before he got in Gary. Who is that? Why is your hand raised? Okay? Where are we it's 7:33? We have two minutes yeah hold on Vinny because I'm still letting people in- and I do not know who they are. So it's taking me a bit of time all right, hi, good evening, everybody I'm the architect. How are you good? What's your last name, Frank? Truly, oh t-, R-, U-, G-, L-, a-, o. I think there's four of them going to be on tonight. So the issue is only when they do not come in with their names, his ipad, okay, hi. This is there. We go. Let's see, okay, well, to stop the welcome to the regularly scheduled Mini Board. Five meeting for this month is Donald on yeah I'm here, okay, Donald's got the flag. Let's salute the flag. I pledge allegiance the first order of business tonight is a public hearing on the application, BSA number nine 599, seven, six b, Z, four: seven zero. Two seven two place block three: six lot: 7 Glendale in a matter of an application city of New, York border standards and fields by Eric, Platnick to reopen and amend the term of the previously granted variants, which expired on December, 21st 2016 for a term of 15 years. The variance permits an existing two- story, use group 17 factory for Fm Brush, with accessory storage in an r41 zoning district. If there are any Sp anyone speaking in fa in behalf of the applicant hi, my name is elise Validar from Eric Palatnik Pc. However, thank you. You even opened up with most of the things I was going to say, but on the phone or on the meeting with us tonight is the architect Frank and the owner Jeff, and I can give a little background if you want and then I would like to have Jeff tell you about the history of this operation. It's really unbelievable because they've been there for so many years and his family's been in Glendale for a million years, and he can speak about that way better than I could because they've been there for so long. So I guess you already said it's in an r41 zoning district for Fm Brush, which is an accessory storage and shipping building. You probably know it better than me: it's on 72nd place we're just looking we're looking for 15 years. Sometimes we ask for 10, but we asked for 15 because we've been a really good neighbor for a really long time. We want to stay in this community and the last application in front of the board was 15 years. So we would like to be consistent with that. So we can stay in this community as long as possible. The use group 17 factory with fifteen thousand five hundred and one square feet. It's two stories. It's been in front of the board since 1976 what else Fm brush company has been making brushes for 90 for over 90 years, the operation is from Monday through Friday 8 A.M to 4:30 P.M the bill fully wrinkled. It was reviewed by the fire department in the last variance and it's being re- reviewed by the fire department, but per the last time it was reviewed. It was fully sprinklered. Garbage is picked up once a week and there's a two to three times a day. They get small box truck deliveries. What else can I tell you and there's no outstanding violations on the property? If anyone has any questions, I would like first to have Jeff speak a little bit about his property and then be glad to answer any questions. Please describe what the businesses is and still doing. If it's the same business that we've known for 100 years, yeah, okay, Jeff, do you want to speak about your business? A little because sure I I'd be happy to, and thank you I'd like to thank the board for hearing this for hearing our petition and give you a little bit of background on this company. We're a Glendale family. My grandparents, on both sides lived in Glendale, my father and mother were both born in Glendale. My bro, both of my brothers, were born in Glendale. One who was my partner, was a graduate of saint pancras. Actually, unfortunately, he's he passed away in this, and the timing of his passing away was when our variance was expiring. So I was a little distracted as he was my brother and my partner. In any case, we began business 91 years ago in evergreen avenue in Brooklyn. We were there for approximately 12 years and then we moved up to 6925 cooper, Avenue right, Off Myrtle, and we were there for a bunch of years and in the early 70s we moved to our existing building, which we've been into for 50 years. So we're a not only an american manufacturer, we're a New York manufacturer committed to the Glendale community that we've served for 70 years, and during that time the world has changed, but most of our procedures and most of our business has not changed. We manufacture, artists and cosmetic brushes. We manufacture all small, tiny, little brushes, think of a pencil, that's the typical size of one of the brushes that we would produce. So we do not use large, pallets and big. You know, you know multi- wheel, trucks, we're basically shipping in and out with ups or with fedex, we meant in the manufacturing process. We will either manufacture the very top of the brush, which contains hair and a metal ferrule and then assemble that onto a wooden handle in some instances we also bring we purchase wooden, we purchase brush, tops and assemble them. Also in Glendale we are an essential business. We supply brushes to the Department of Defense subcontractors to law enforcement, as well as to cosmetic companies like the Sd Lord company, I'm proud to say. I have two employees presently who are in their 80s, who have been with us over 40 years so when I say we're a Glendale company, we're committed to the community and I'm third generation, but my brother's children, my nephew and my niece are fourth generation, as is my son, Michael who's 30 years old. So there is a succession plan in place to continue to produce, with your permission, the finest brushes made in America, actually, the only the only artist brushes made in America and they're made in Glendale proudly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Anyone have any questions for our applicant. Do you have any reason or plan? Oh good walter can, I can, I know Vinnie kind of explained the application, but I'd kind of like to hear it from the applicants and maybe an abbreviated form. So it's on the record, so we get it on the record no problem. This is this is a very. This was a variance and we're looking to extend the variance every so often this had a 15-year variance, we're looking to extend it another 15 years. The board asked you to come back and re- review if it still fits within the neighborhood, so we're looking to extend that term another 15 years and what is the variance for it's to allow? This is an nr for one district, which is a residential district. So it's a non-, conforming use, yeah. Okay, that's good! Is there any? Is there any walter anyway that this could be grandfathered in as a permanent so that they do not have to keep coming back and spending their money and time and energy? I do not. I do not think I think it would not set a good precedent. They've been good neighbors. A lot of you know the city planning and bill and BSA feel that when you have to come back you're going to be good, neighbors they've been great neighbors. We do not have one complaint from them, so you know it's really just a kind of you know. We just you know like to see them every 15 years, they're, good people, and that's it right. If you could do us a favor, though they do not generally let us have 15 years and they just assume we're bad neighbors. If you could put into your report that we've been good neighbors and we can get a little extra time, it would be much appreciated. Yes, okay, we would would you we'll, probably have a zoom committee meeting and you make that ask there and and I'll answer somebody to vote. Thank you so much we're very reasonable and you guys are great we'd love you there for another 90 years. Thank you yeah. I wish there was more manufacturing in Glendale. I missed a lot of the nitty mills and a lot of the you know one of my favorite restaurants. Obviously I love to eat so, but we're Glendale's etched in our fabric and I'm proud to be in Glendale. Well, thanks for being here, it's a great honor for us in the community to have the only manufacture of these autistic brushes in the country. You know so, in light of what we have excuse me growing, a few blocks away we're developing Hollywood East with the movie studios and production studios. So it's great to have a good landmark in Glendale and we thank you very much go ahead. Fred, yeah! I was a little surprised to see this come as a variance every 15 years. We that was typical for gas stations and uses like that. This seemed to me to be something that would be permanent. So I would ask the committee to consider that it's not the ones we and I recall, typically seeing like gas station or something that uses fuel or as a higher level of manufacturing than this appears to be. I also was wondering if you can get the paint brushes right at the location or where it is. Where are they sold? Well, how you doing Jeff I'm well! Thank you. You know. Typically, we sell through art stores and we sell. We do not sell directly online, but we have customers that sell online. But you know if you, if you look at fmbrush.com website, you're, welcome to see the types of brushes that we produce you know proudly. So I can't make any offers to you at this point in time. That would be inappropriate, but we supply the New York City School Public school system with artist brushes. We supply hospitals and volunteer groups with brushes. So we take a our civic responsibility seriously and you know that's the Glendale way. So if are you a tenant or an owner, I'm the I'm, the owner, Mr Curry. As I said originally my partner, my brother fred, which I grew up with which I grew up. I wondered I have to admit I did. I did look you up a little bit and I think you're a little bit younger than my brother fred, but he was the same pancreas guy and he married a Glendale girl and unfortunately they're both in Heaven now, but well, unfortunately, they're both in Heaven but yeah. That's who we are yeah, so any vinny Ken has his hand up go ahead again. Yeah I just wanted Jeff. I just want to commend you and fm for your 90 years or 70 years in Glendale, and I also think that the board should consider a more permanent arrangement with Fm Brush because of the length of time, and only and being the only brush manufacturer in the United States and being in Glendale. That's something that board the board can actually build on and say hey where the this is where the brushes are made in our town. Only it's an idea anyway, and if you look at the box, if you look, if you look on the website made in made in NYC, you will see that Fm Brush company is listed on there right. Thank you anything else on the matter just case a point, and I do not want to put on any parade the challenge with making it permanent is that if you happen to sell one day and somebody opens up a car repair shop there or something that's not as friendly to the neighbors, you know it would carry over into that. So there are so many other things. I mean we're going to think happy to ask for 15 years and we're not giving you a hard time because you're great people, but you know, there's no telling how some something sells and how it expands so making it permanent the city's just not going to do it. You know- and you know our sentiment- we love it. We love you and so every 15 years we want to see your face. Jeff come on. Well, it may not be my face in 15 years, but it'll be probably my son's face because you know we're committed to the community. That's why we've stayed and resisted you know, resisted any out of state offers, because we're we're a family business may also. Man also just say that when you have a variance on your property, the board can write into the resolution that it's required to be the operation, as is, and you have to come back for an amendment if you change that operation, so you could recommend something like that as well. You can talk about that, but it sticks what is permitted on. It is only what is permitted by the variance, and that can be there can be conditions on that variance and that your board can suggest and then, if something changes, then that person will have to go back and seek an amendment from the board. Okay. So we're going to turn this over to Walter and his committee and Vladimir Putin Ken has his hand up again. Vinnie, I'm sorry, are you lowered again, you're, muted again, oh okay, now I was just going to say yeah. Well, I figured we'll get to see your son in 15 years. Then, right god willing we're going to turn into the committee. Walter may call you to discuss what the committee is going to recommend and then he'll present it to the board anything else. We need to discuss on this matter. If not, we thank you for your participation and with that we'll close the this portion of the public hearing and the next item on of business is the public hearing on BSA application. Three 360 49bz at 69-, 05, Ld, Avenue, block 2838, lot, 38 middle village, again Eric Platnick for an extension of a variance for term which expired, 25, 2015. wow for continued use of the gasoline service station Bp with accessory uses for a 10 year term in an r41 zoning district, and just before you make your presentation whomever it is, it actually owned by Bp or someone else who's presenting for this matter. Elise again, thank you for at least all dare from Eric Palaniuk Pc. Thank you so much for having me. Unfortunately, this is not as feel good as the last application. I wish it was, but I will say who owns it. First, I'll, let you know I'm just going to open it up to make sure okay. So, yes, this is owned not by british petroleum they're, the lessee but they're filing this application. Okay, so the first thing is: who should the real applicant be the property owner or the tenant? So in this situation, bp maintains the site. So that's why we're following on behalf of Bp and they'll, make sure that all of any recommendations or anything that the board recommends to change on the site or upgrade landscaping signage they'll be responsible for that and they will update that site. So that's my concern is that we have no real cause to the tenant. We have caused the property owner that should be applying for the application, so you're required to file. If you do a lse, the owner has to file with the lessee. So that's why we do an author owner's authorization? Okay, so you need to you need to give us the owner information. Okay, so not now in writing. Do you have the full application just wondering because it was filed with, because I can do a dropbox link too, but it has the affidavit of ownership and the affidavit of lassie we'll check that at the office. Okay, because those are but we're both filed with the application. Okay. So this application is, it did expire in 2015, but I want to tell you how it came to be and again reiterate who the owner is. The owner is Elena locust or it's not elena low, because she's filed it's Lee, Milt, Petroleum Inc and that's the owner, Affidavit and british Petroleum is the lesson and I represent british Petroleum, but the case is filed on behalf of both of them because it has to be so. Why are we listening to you and not the owner's applicant, because I have I file on behalf of both, but I file for the party that's going to maintain the site and upgrade the site. Okay Vinnie is Gary yeah. I should have put it in here who the owner was, but normally the applicant is the representative. So in other words at least correct me if I'm wrong, but almost always Eric Polatnik's office or any other firm representing the owner, is going to be the applicant on behalf of either the owner or the lessee. That's just common practice. We do have the full application in the office. Thank you. I just want to say that everyone's been notified, but I do not know if you have a lot of like pce applications in front of you, often with gyms or spas, but that too you file on behalf of the person who rents that space, because they maintain that space and need all the licenses for that space in a greater building that usually has a separate owner. So the reason I ask this is because the public does not have access to these documents unless they look them up. So that's why I ask you who you're representing and go through the whole process, please so we're asking for another 10 years. This was a pre-19. This was filed originally in 1949, it's the pre-61 variance. So it's been there for 70 years about the reason it expired in 2015 is. It was a different applicant and british Petroleum asked our office to go through all of their BSA sites. Look up every single one! I've filed a lot of Bp sites recently and find all the ones that are expiring or have been expired and make sure that they're now legal. So this was in that, like list of 10 cases that we found were about to expire or had been expired, and we were not the previous applicant, so we had not notified. It was, I think, a getty before so it was. It was not british petroleum operated. So now it's british petroleum operated and it's part of a larger project to make sure that all Bps are operating legally. So it is five years expired, but we did pay fees for it being late and we're now looking for another 10 years and we're trying to comply now, british, but yeah again, you're re- enforcing my position here that the application should be for the property owner for the variants to use this property for the purpose you're applying not for the tenant, so Getty was a tenant. Bp is attendant, so this application should be for in favor or for the property owner. Not the tenant. The property owner is rel is responsible for it. You have to do an owner's affidavit and an affidavit of lacie and they're, both responsible for the property, but we represent british petroleum making sure that all their sites are legal and compliant, which we, you know again talking for the people out on the street that are listening, you're, not representing the property owner, so you're asking for this matter on behalf of the tenant, who has no legal liability for the property, even though they, even though it could be a net, you know triple net lease. The application should be on behalf of the owner of the property. That is my point. So what I'm saying to you yeah? I think you should withdraw this application and refile it on behalf of the property owner. That's a little confusing to me because this is. They are part of the application. They you have to do an owner's affidavit. They have to be a part of the application, so I'm filing on behalf of both of them, but Bp is going to update the site, but in a legal matter, if we go against, if the city goes against the property owner for its usage, they're responsible to track down all of the tenants and therefore it should be against the property, the property owner on a variance should be asking for the variance not the tenant. So I think you should withdraw this and reapply on behalf of the property owner. Okay, I this is standardly how they do it, so everybody who operates the site is has to be in compliance, and this is this- is community board five we're a city agency, we're liable for the safety and security and legality of the city of New York and out our residents, and I'm not a lawyer. I never was never wanted to be. My aunt was a great lawyer, but I think the application should be made on behalf of the property owner, not the tenant. I just I understand what you're saying, but it is on behalf of both of them so they're. Both. That's not what you applied. I'm saying that I represent british Petroleum, but you have to notify the owner and they have to be part of the application as an owner's authorization. It's filed with the application in order to come before you because they are responsible, I'm one, I'm one person. I disagree board members, it's open for discussion Vinny! I honestly this is John. There is no reason that you should be putting up such a fight. This should get sent to the committee just like the other one, because everything that I'm understanding about this process this is being filed correctly. The committee should be determining that because I feel like you're doing a little bit of committee work right now. Okay, thank you John! I agree. Thank you. So will Vinnie Fred has his hand up go ahead? Fred, the previous application we just discussed, said Fm Brush company on it, which would be the tenant and Jeff Wood was the owner of the building and we we proceeded and we discussed it. Okay. Let's turn this over to committee for further review, but it's my personal opinion that when we issue a variance and fred making, it is not fred was afraid of God. The Mig family owns the property. So that's a difference. Fred. My personal opinion is the property owner should be applying for the variants, not the tenant, but we'll turn this over to committee, we'll take it up in committee. Thank you. Walter will contact you and talk about it further go ahead. Vinnie. Would it be correct that the tenant and the property owner have both their names on this application? They do that's what she said and that's what it is stand it that way. But if the legal responsibility you know you go back in history, I got a piece of land. I'm going to authorize someone to use that piece of land. You authorize the property owner. The property owner could do whatever they want with that piece of land. They can rent it to a salami and a pizza parlor, whatever fits in their variants that they're asking for, but the liability is the property owner. So I'm just as I get older, I get more curious and look into these things all right, so we'll pass it on to committee. We have some rather odd businesses coming in there. That can cause problems. I agree well, this application, I just want to say, is filed on behalf of both okay, so the walter will get in touch with you and carry this matter further. Thank you. Okay, no problem. Thank you. Next order of business is the public forum because we're online and this stupidity that we're dealing with we have received some statements that we'll read. Is it laura or Gary, going to read any statements in the Public forum, Vinnie I'll, read a statement from cures from who carries from cures. Thank you. Okay. So we've received a statement from Mary Harrison Laval who's, the chairperson of Civics united for railroad, environmental solutions, and she writes, I hope in you- and yours are well tonight. I am respectfully asking Community board 5 members to share this information with your civic organizations and consider passing three board resolutions. First, please ask the New York State Department of environmental conservation to deny a permit to Omni recycling, which wants to open a new waste by rail facility in Brentwood Long island. What I'm about to share with you is not good. Omni recycling proposed transfer station would ship 2,300 tons a day of construction and demolition debris, Residue and municipal solid waste from Brentwood long island into CB5. Orb wants to put 1000 rail cars into constant circulation to serve this facility. Orb will not store rail cars at their site. Rail cars will leave their facilities twice a day. Orbs application means that about 250, more full and empty cars of waste will be hauled. Staged switched classified and interchanged in CB5 neighborhoods each week, because the New York State Department of environmental conservation permits waste transfer stations on a site-, by- site basis. Dec does not consider freight rail capacity issues or the cumulative impacts of its permitting on CB5, including adverse impacts resulting from the operations and facility limitations of the New York and Atlantic Railway New York and Atlantic Railway recently told CB5 local businesses and residents that they have to store unsightly graffiti rail cars up on the bridge at Myrtle, Avenue and fresh pond road, because NYA has nowhere else to put them. So how is there room for 250, more rail cars? A week district manager, Gary, Jordano and Chairman Vinnie Arcuri have received information, including an online link to the permit application. Second, please pass a resolution and ask New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Hastie to get assembly bill a 3269 pass, then, if Orb's permit does get a does get approved at least Orb will be required to contain construction and demolition. Debris. Residue under solid covers open rail cars of c and D residue and mid particulates and stinking leachate. These cars must be covered and DEC has refused to pass regulations to cover them. The way trucks already have to cover so DEC is considering orbs permit application in a regulatory vacuum that leaves covering rail cars of c and d residue up to the applicant Orbs application says they will abide by railroad terrorists, but the only talent for C d residue is the csx tariff for pervious orange netting. Many of you filled out postcards asking for passage of A3269, which is still sponsored by Assemblyman Brian Bondwell and co- sponsored by Assemblywoman, Kathy, Nolan, Assemblyman, Mike, Miller and a score of other assembly members. Our Senator Joe Adabo got the Senate version of the bill passed again this year our congresswoman Grace Mang got legislation passed in the House of Representatives. Now the New York State Assembly must act to protect the health of communities. Third, please pass a resolution asking lirr to use money. The New York state Legislature already gave them to cost efficiently repower and re- balance switchers to tier four emission standards for the New York and Atlantic Railway. To use the way things stand today, the 1000 rail cars orb proposes to put into circulation will be hauled around by New, York and Atlantic. Railways antiquated high polluting locomotives, Vito Maranzano started advocating to stop this locomotive pollution when he was president of the Glendale property owners. His campaign continued through the work of this board, including giving 100 of my neighbors and me a public hearing. Then a coalition of civics came together as cures and CB5 elected officials got funding to clean the community. Heir Assemblyman have a seat, has sponsored bills that put 21 million dollars in the long island railroad's hands to repower the New York and Atlantic Railways Fleet to tier four emission standards, and she cites controllers contract Dr 36644. All Lirr has to do now is issue a cost- efficient RFP that retrofits old Mp15 locomotives with tier four power and pollution controls, as other railroads already have done. Tier four repowering of old locomotives is a practical, cost- efficient way to reduce air pollution from this source by at least 95. At a time when Covid-19 has shown us how vital wholesome air is, Larr needs to use the people's money to protect community health. Thank you very much for taking the time to consider this request. Mary Paris President of cures, we'll turn that over to the combination of environmental and public Tran, Transportation Services Committee to report back to us on this matter, vinnie, if I could butt in go ahead, the important part of this, in my opinion for tonight, even without the committee taking it up, is to oppose the first item, which is the proposed transfer station in Brentwood, Long island, railing, a thousand rail cars into constant circulation and there's and she's, citing 250, more full and empty cards of waste being hauled staged switched classified and interchanged in CB5 neighborhoods each week. The reason I say that is, I think that there is a deadline of October, the 31st, to comment with regard to the matter. The other two issues are not as imperative. Okay, so is there anyone wishes to discuss this matter? No walter Sanchez. Before we make a walk, a resolution. I think it's standard that we send it to committee. I mean this is an emergency. That was my point even the first one. Gary I mean all due respect. I do not know how that affects Community board- five, maybe it does. Maybe it means stuff, but we do not know, and the committee's got to go over that I understand there's a deadline, but I think it should all be sent to committee okay. So the issue here is that all these new, all these rail cars that would be coming in here have nowhere else to go. They all are going to be coming into Glendale, because that's the only freight rail yard on this end of long island now they're all coming in here. Nothing goes into about in or out of the five counties, Brooklyn Queens nassau Suffolk, without coming through Glendale. It's the only way the rail works. That's the question, so there's so many ramifications that we can't you know, vote on. We just brought up to us. I do not think it's right to vote on something like that. You might think it's very important. Maybe I do but the committee's got to look at it. We can't vote on it tonight. I do not think it's proper anyone else missed Chairman Richie Uber. Can I by us limiting how many trains and such can go through. There could increase the amount of trucks going through our city, which are a lot less efficient and more and possibly more polluting. You know so long as we get some higher tier rail weight cars here in Glendale, just something for the committee to think about. No, that was the justification that they proposed to reduce truck traffic. Do everything by rail. But again I agree with the Walter. I think it's committee work unless anybody wants to propose a motion at this point in time hold on hold on the one thing I would say is: if you guys can, please use your raised hand function because it's going to get tough to manage other than that Peg. You do not raise your real hand, raise your electron again. Okay, I just raised it, but Ken is first. I just had a question. I missed the date. What is the date that we they want to do this? Is there a deadline? Comments are due by October 23rd. Oh we're very close. We should get committee meetings in before that and now committee meetings anytime, you want yeah and now Peggy had her hand up. Okay does not matter if we have a committee meeting, we if we want the board to make the resolution we're not going to have another meeting before the deadline and the fact that all these rail cars will be coming through Glendale, there's no other place for them to go. Every piece of freight that goes by rail from the tip of long island to the bottom of Brooklyn goes through Ridgewood and we or Glendale we do not need 250 more cars going through, especially ones that are not covered properly and casting off all kinds of crap and building debris and solid waste. I think at least that part of the request should be considered. Okay, so that's the point I made if anybody wants to make a pro a proposal, John Meyer. Next, I would like to just recommend that we put pick this up because of the deadline. I agree with Peggy. It can't go to committee and come back. It's too late. We've already missed our chance. I think this particular piece should move to new business at the end, and we can talk about it. We can table it. We can do whatever, but it we should address it if we're going to address it, does not do us any service to make it committee work, that's going to happen at the end of the month and then come back in November. Okay, so John remind me under new business that there's there may be a resolution proposed. Thank you. Okay, anything else, nothing else under the public forum. If not we'll go to the chairperson's report, that's the convincing mercury! I have to track down all my paperwork, which is very confusing when I'm doing it electronically. So give me a moment to get my brain working okay. So, under the Jefferson report we got liquor wine, the beer license, applications, no new liquor licenses, liquor, License, Renewals, Krolajewski, Jaudio of Ridgewood Inc 6621, fresh bond, Road O'reilly's daughter, is doing business as yearman's pub 70268 street new wine and beer Licenses Mary Restaurant Corp, doing business as Estrella Del, Mar, 552, Seneca Avenue. No wine and beer license renewals. Other notifications, El Montenero, Bakery, Restaurant, Inc, 5521, myrtle, Avenue Ridgewood is applying to New York State Liquor Authority for class change of their current restaurant wine. License to an on- premise: liquor wine, Beer and Cytolyzer Burmeo Food Corporation doing business as El Manaba restaurant 341, saint nicholas Avenue Ridgewood, is applying to restore their method of operation having after having their method of operation restricted by the New York State Liquor authority due to Covid-19 violation. That means they got shut down during Covid-19 for operating building demolition, construction notices, Glendale, seven, eight one 1562 street garage demolition, nothing in Massbit, nothing in middle village, Ridgewood, 5519, metropolitan Avenue, Interior demolition. That's the end of that. May I make a comment on the beer and wine go ahead. Karutha Koluski Chadwell is changed its name to Okressa, I'm sorry Krolowski of Ridgewood Inc yeah, but the restaurant is no longer called they've taken away. The knight and their name on the building is oppressor. So you're saying that doing business is what okressa, how do you, okay, resa O- p? Okay, is in king, okay. Laura will look that up and follow up. Thank you. Thank you all right. So the next item of business under Chairperson's report is the capital budget priorities. Oh hold on Vinny Ken go ahead again ken with the one notification, the second one, Biermann Food Corp. Now they want us to approve their liquor license being they were closed down because of a Covid-19 violation. What was the violation? German's pub? Are you talking about? No other under other notifications. Number two bermail yeah Laura has her hand up. Maybe she has an answer yeah. We did get a letter from the attorney with regard to that or their processing agent, and he said that they were applying to restore their original method of operation. That's on file with office. The establishment was in violation of Covid-19 rules and the New York State Liquor Authority closed the business and allowed them to reopen after paying a fine and restricting the hours in music. There are no additional changes being sought at this time, just to restore to the original hours and allowing music. So that was as much as we got out of it. I think that they had people inside the facility and they were found not only being a violation for having patrons inside, but so what they wanted if they had facilities that paid 150,000 dollars to the city in fines, okay, go ahead, Ken, okay, all right! So we'll go back to the capital budget priorities. The executive committee sent out our recommendations, the board members reviewed them and came back with their recommendations, so executive committee. Do we have any comments and recommendations on the capital budget priorities yeah? This is Walter Sanchez, I'd like to recognize Walter. You got to speak up I'd like to make a resolution that we follow the board's actual vote, not a vote. It's a recommendation, our board's recommendations, as they came back from the board members and we that's the the resolution that we make so Walter recommends that we accept the priority listing of the full board as returned in the survey results. Peggy seconded okay, any question comments all in favor any objections. Abstentions. Thank you. I like to thank the board members for their attention to what we recommended the executive committee recommended. There really was no big difference in the top ten and that's what the borough President reviews and there was really no difference in the top 20. Actually, so I thank you all. Okay Vinnie. This is Kevin's right. I do not know when you want to do this, but should not we take the attendance for the record. Well, yes, we'll get that. Okay! Thank you. You're welcome the expense budget priorities did I did what am I doing? I got confused now, so that's the budget expense budget. There were some comments. We have to vote on the expense budget. Am I getting confused or not capital? We did expense budget any recommendations or on that propose that we accept the expense budget, as presented by the executive committee to the membership unchanged. Thank you seconded I seconded in favor hi. Any opposed extensions, no okay lost track of where I am I'm sorry, oh god what happens when I'm sitting home okay trying to go through paper?

Okay, so on the capital budget priorities as we as we're recommended by the Entire Board Gary, please scroll around Vinnie. Yes, is this kathy? How do we know how the board voted? Will we get a copy? I thought you did we did, but I did not get a finalized one. I got one where I just wrote: no laura yeah. I do not think we sent out the finalized version of the executive committee members, but we did not get it out to the board members I stand corrected.

So what else do I have here? I have no question on the budgets. Can I ask a question who's that this is silk, so go right ahead. Please yeah as a new member to the board out of curiosity, how many of this project will be funded based upon the last year or previous year's record Vinnie. Do you want me to answer that? I did not hear the question. I'm sorry go right ahead, okay, so success based on last year and other prior years, how many of these projects will be funded and my response to you is some of them are already funded or partially funded and I'll give you some examples. Our number one priority for the sewer system to rebuild the sewer system and portions of community board five. We were able to get more than 20 million dollars of funding for a large sewer project in Nassmith Calamus Avenue in 69Th street, that's completed in the last few years and a large sewer project in the penelope, Avenue, 74Th, Street area middle village. We're looking to get funding for sewer improvements in Glendale, specifically along 77th avenue, mainly east of 76Th Street. The project for Wyckoff Avenue is funded, but we keep it up there, because it's probably a 35 million project, at least, and that's our number two. The Grant Street Bridge project is city funded they're, going to need additional funding. That's our number three, but a lot of these projects are very expensive projects. Other projects are not funded yet and typically speaking in a given year, if you have five of your projects of the 30, some odd that are funded, you're doing pretty well. Some of these projects have been on the list for a long time, and especially with these difficult budget situation issues. Now it's going to be hard to get them funded cody. Thank you very much, gary okay. So we have expense budget. Yes, on the expense budget. As distributed motion to accept hello. Anyone I make a motion to accept second dude. I second in favor aye, any abstentions, nays hi, all right, hi again, I'm just I'm surprised. This is not a roll call vote. Okay, John! You keep reminding me and I'm sorry because it is stupid online stuff. So on the expense budget Gary. Will you call the roll yeah all the board? Members received a copy of that and were asked for their comments, and we only had one board member who wanted priorities changed and I do not think you would want me to read those priorities. No go ahead. Do you want me to? No? Because the majority is in favor of what we produce? Yeah? Okay, all right, so in favor of the expense budget priorities that all of you received a copy of Mr Atakari? Yes, Sir! Are you in favor? Yes, okay, Tony, Benanti favor?

I was just going to say that we just voted to confirm what we already voted on by turning in the the survey. Oh no, mike whatever you do on paper, does not count. The official record of a community board meeting is the audio tape and in current technology now is the audio tape plus the video. So thank you. I got it. Okay, all right all right! Okay, if nothing else I'll proceed with the comments from the elected officials, we have a a written statement from Scott Stringer, the controller who's going to read that laura. If you want to read it: okay, Vinnie before you go further the minutes of the prior meeting of September, the 9th, I thought I did that, I'm sorry. We have to make a motion to accept the minutes, as proposed richie accepted all in favor aye aye thought. I checked that off, but okay, so now statement from the state New York, City, Comptroller. Okay, you want me to read it. Please: okay, control. They sent us a press release today and they asked us to read the top portion of it. Controller stringer proposes free tuition at all, CUNY community colleges and overall of New York City's Workforce development strategy. So when we're bankrupt, we should give out free stuff. Okay, go ahead: Controller outlines comprehensive plan that will leverage CUNY to upskill, New, York, City's workforce and compete in the global economy. Stringer's Workforce development plan includes tuition- free community college, a universal paid internship program for CUNY students, more career and technical education and early college high schools, an expansion of certified apprenticeships subsidized wage and bridge programs and more stringer in quotes. The pandemic has upended our economy and displaced thousands of workers. If we do not act right now to revolutionize how we support new yorkers and get everyone on the ladder of opportunity, we risk leaving thousands of new yorkers behind and deepening the inequality gap. Okay, more free stuff. Next we have a statement from the borough. President Joe. Are you there? Okay, Joe? Is he here I am here. I am here, hello. Everyone thank you chair. Thank you! Gary, oh Paul Kirzner is waving at somebody and I'm sure it's not me because I have not gone yet. Do you want to take Paul? First, no, okay, sorry Paul. The borough, President Sharon Lee sends her regards as do why two quick items reminding everyone to get out and vote. If you have not done a ballot, early voting starts on the 24th. If your polling place is in a newly designated red zone on the 22nd, we will hear if that is going to be moved, and else. No, please note that if you were doing early voting, your early voting polling place is not necessarily and probably not your regular polling place so make sure you know where you're going. Secondly, veterans day event from the borough, President Borough Hall will be virtual this year and it will be on November 10th, and when I have a flyer and information I will send to Gary Laura and Vinnie to send out to everybody and good to see you- and I wish you all well and responses to that. You may see a whole bunch of veterans at the Glendale memorial anyway. Okay, you know what great that's great, we'll, let you know. Okay, thank you Paul. What did you have nothing Marianne, Sir Vicenzio? How do we find out where our early polling site is? I do not have the website address in front of me. I will get it to you tomorrow, but if you just put vote NYC, I believe you will find it the website. I just do not have the address in front of me. I should have forgive me and once you get in you put your address and it will tell you where your early polling is in your regular polling early polling. You should have got something in the mail, but there is a website. I will send it tomorrow to Gary and he will send it out to you folks, thanks Tim Sorry kenny.

Just vote no early voting, at least it is my early voting which is borough Hall building interesting enough. So just make sure you check before you head out so you're in the right place. Peggy O'gain, I was just going to say I got a notice and that my early voting place is rentar Plaza, but I'm confused. Do we go up on the roof or do we try to get in on the ground level you park? You go in the parking lot. There's a garbage can and you throw your ballot in. Some of us are going into your regular ball on Election Day, Walter Sanchez for some of us in Mass Beth, the elks lodge the the elks lodge the italian italian american building there in Queens boulevard, but check before you go check to make sure check and make sure you have to do it in English. Without a time yeah, okay, poor Paul, he has his hand up. Can someone call on Paul Kurzner? I thought I did oh well yeah he's. I'm mute, Paul, you're, unmuted, okay. He loves to talk to himself but he's Paul. Okay, one of the things that we ended up louder. One of the things that we ended up with at the Executive Board meeting last month was that the process of getting capital budget items approved and funded was going to require, as it always has required people to take some responsibility for the capital projects that have to go. Excuse me, Paul. Are we doing general discussion right now, because I was trying to recognize that other people that were present? Do you want to have a discussion later? If you, whenever you want to this, is part of the capital budget? Why do not you do it under old business? Please! Okay, fine! Thank you! Okay!

First, okay, can we read officer Barrish report? Okay, so officer Barrish gave us the crime, stats and crime in crime stats for the 28 day period. Murder is down, one rape was down three robbery up: six felony assault up, 4, burglary, up 15 grand larceny up 14 and Grand Larceny of Auto up 10., very good. Thank you. Welcome captain hole to the 104Th Precinct. Oh wait, there's more vinny! He has a few paragraphs here. We welcome captain Hall to the 104Th Precinct. As the new commanding officer, Captain Hall comes to us from his previous assignment as commanding officer of the 100Th precinct. During this time in the 100 precinct, he has dealt with similar issues that we face here in the 104Th. Captain Hall expresses his excitement to begin working together with the community. We have seen an uptick in crime such as burglaries and grand Larceny. Burglaries are a mix between residential and commercial. Some measures of security you can take to help prevent these crimes are using roll down gates. If you have them having security cameras and making sure they are working, ensuring all points of entry are locked securely using lights to brighten up the location. Do not leave any cash or valuables out in the open or in the register many times the individuals are trying to move cash from the register. Felony assaults are majority related to domestic violence and are closed out to an arrest by patrol officers, domestic violence, officers or detectives. We continue to urge everyone to not leave valuables in your vehicles, along with not leaving keys or key fobs in the vehicle, as this provides an opportunity for your vehicle to be taken. This past week, officers made an arrest for graffiti officers were able to catch this individual in the act of making Graffiti in the vicinity of Palmetto Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue, while conducting a business inspection of a nightlife establishment on white Golf. Avenue officers issued numerous issues, as well as removing an illegal firearm from the establishment. If anyone has questions or concerns, please feel free to write or call that was from officer Michael Barish. Thank you and Captain. Hall was shocked, to say the least, that the 104Th precinct is in the top 20 of the 72 precincts in New York City in index crimes, most of which are grand lost in the grand lost in the auto, because most of our stupid people leave their keys and credit cards in their cars and they're broken into and every credit card theft is a major crime. Okay, Gary Giordano, District Manager Rio report. Excuse me before Gary goes, I'm sorry, Gary. I have that earl that voting booth for you. Folks, it's find my poll site DOT vote, DOT NYC! I will put it in the chat. Sorry Gary. Okay, share that app for everyone. Call you right back hello! I'm sorry did I interrupt someone? Okay, I'll, be I'll, be brief, because it's getting pretty late yeah, the sanitation department has already you might have seen them out. There started having their crew members practice for the potential for winter snow, they're out, snow plowing on Sunday, yes, yeah well or simulated plowin and, as I think, a lot of you know, we have neighborhoods adjacent to us or pretty close to us that are in the Covid-19 red area, because their numbers have risen substantially as far as the number of or the percentage of people infected by the covavirus and we are in the yellow area. Coming from the east up to forest avenue in Ridgewood, we were behaving for quite some time, but I think certain portions of the city are getting a little bit too antsy. I think, if I'm not mistaken, there was a raid on an establishment. That's right outside of board five on 69th street. I think it's elite palace at our northern border, so please wear a mask when you're near anyone keep washing your hands and keep socially distant. New York City did a great job at this. For months and months and months I was looking at newspaper articles going back to April when there were like 700 and some odd deaths a day in New, York City and in a month, or so that was down to still tragic 50 deaths a day. So we came a long way. We do not want to go back the other way, so let's behave ourselves and try to eradicate this until we get a vaccine. Thank you. Do some committee reports, transportation, John, hello? We do not have a lot to talk about on the transportation committee, a couple of updates, they're still working on the painting of the elevated line. They are getting up to they're prepping and getting ready to paint up to the fresh pond road station. A couple of our long time, capital asks were on our capital budget request and thank you folks for voting them up towards the top like White Cough, Avenue, Roadway surfacing is still ongoing in our community. Most of the milling has been done. Most of the paving has been done, but there is a long lag between the painting, so I've seen roads that are now paved for about four weeks with no markings which is not great, really like to see that improve with the city. We did our usual round of traffic, pedestrian safety requests they're still coming into the board. Our next meeting, speaking of the meeting times, I believe, is going to be. When did we decide? I do not see it in the home. Let me check the 27th 27 John, okay, so it'll be likely by Webex on the 27th. So if you have an issue you would like to get in front of us, please get it into the board office before then, so it can be put on the agenda. Okay, anything else. No I'll wait for new business. All right. Any other committees need to report. If hello, where'd, Vinnie Go did he drop out. I do not see him here. Yeah, it looks like Vinnie dropped all right out next on the agenda, Vinnie comes back Gary. Are there any other committees? No other committees gary? What's next, I do not think there are any other committees, so then we go to old business and John. You want to speak to the issue of the potential for all those additional rail cars coming into the Glendale yard. Well, I already know that there are certain groups, unfortunately working with outmoded permits from the state and that's where these permits are and that's where we need to get our words into and if the deadline is the 23rd of October, it's not enough time to get to the committee and back to us as a as a whole board. So I'd like to put forward a motion that we write a letter that is strongly against this permitted process permit being issued to this agency because of the undue burden that it will put on our communities. Anybody else willing to. Second that I mean, I think, the I'll second it a second to John. The verbiage is in the letter from cures that I think we could really use all right. So, what's your motion John? The motion is to write a letter to the state DEC saying that we are not in support of this permit all right in the cures letter on the question. Any discussion laura has her hand up Laura. I just want to say: Vinnie is on the phone he's trying to get back into the meeting. He wanted me to let you know. Okay he'll pick it up right from here, and he should be back in a second he's. Coming back in he's connecting to audio all right, vinnie we're on to a motion was made to send a letter and seconded on the cures issue. Okay, I'm back a letter. A motion was made by John Meyer seconded by Wolf Clinton on the cures issue to send a letter, and I just asked for any discussion on it, so you could take it over. Could you repeat that please I just got back online. I'm sorry, I put forward a motion vinnie. That was that, because we do not have enough time to send it to the committee and come back to the full board to get our letter of recommendation against this permit, which permit it's the permit for another c and d site out on the island, okay, gotcha right and in that, I would recommend that we use the verbiage. That cures has provided us to write a letter to the state DEC saying that it unduly impacts the communities outside of just that area, and we do not recommend it and it was seconded by Walter, and we were just about to go to any kind of discussion or question okay. So the reason for it is there's not enough time for the committee to meet before the deadline. Okay, thank you. Michael Porcelli has his hand up. So does anybody think that all this debris is going to disappear? If we do not allow it to move by train, it has to go somewhere, it either goes by train or by truck would we rather have trucks? No, that's not true Michael, that if you do not, if you do not have a facility to do that work, it has to go through the facilities that are existing. So it's what you're doing by increasing a facility, adding a facilities you're adding capacity so you're, actually creating more ability. It's, but it's a demand issue that you're also creating yes, sir. The point is that there are only three ways to transport: solid waste from long island, it's by truck, train or barge, and if they're, not if the facility is not located on the waterfront that blocks out the barge capacity and as Michael said, the only other choice is truck on the expressway or trains on a railroad. It's a tough situation, we're in because anything that comes and goes on long island, which is Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk has to come through Glendale. The big thing we should be advocating for is sealed containers, that's our project and we are, and that one has more time and we have been doing that for the last two years. Cures has been very actively doing that for the last two years. Right now, the question on the table is: do we create another facility to handle yet more of this or not, and we are recommending that until they clean it up until they get better locomotives that are not tier zero that we do not add that capacity in that manner? Okay, so the question becomes from the legal standpoint and we have several lawyers on the board. Do we have standing in Suffolk, County or within the state to determine whether there should be another facility established in Suffolk County? The state DEC is asking for public comment. All cures has asked us to do is support the issue of not just permitting outright another rail facility, and that can it's not a matter of whether we shut it down. Dec is going to do what DEC does we're just putting in public comment, we're adding commentary and we're adding voices to the mix if they do not hear from anybody that there's issues with open container cars if they do not hear from people that there's issues that this waste by rail is impacting other communities other than the immediate site, they're never going to acknowledge it or hear it. We have to get that voice out there. That's all. This is simply putting in public comment. It's they're seeking public comment from the state or from the county state. Okay, I'm going to there's a bunch of hands raised, I'm going to ask again use the raise hand function on Zoom. I will keep. I will keep muting people who do not have their hands up, because otherwise the conversation's not going to be audible to anybody. Thank you. Ken has his hand up first yeah. Well I mean this basically is going to be. We would be backing and supporting Suffolk County Right John. No, this is comment. This is adding public comment to the process. This is not about pro Suffolk county or anti- suffolk county, a facility permitting process that we're adding public comment to okay. Do we know if Suffolk wants it? That's not the issue. It's do. We want it because it's going to have an undue impact on us. It will yes, it'll have a major impact on us. I think, if, like Mike said, I mean if they wind up using trucks. Well, are they going to park 100 trucks in Glendale? I doubt it so if they wind up going that way which I'd rather they do not and do not do any of that, but hey, maybe the trucks will go someplace else, it's not in my backyard, but I definitely am against them. Bringing more trains of waste through Glendale and Ridgewood Eric's hand is up Eric, you, muted, yeah. I just want a clarification on the issues or what are the potential issues this proposes. So from what I understand, it's a facility in long island, that's creating what is it 150, additional cars that are going through Glendale or Ridgewood and correct me if I'm wrong, but these are older, older trains that pollute and there's an issue with a lack of coverings. What waste I heard waste? What type of waste are we talking about? I just want to confirm so it's clear on what, where what the problems are here, the potential issues that he's coming through the neighborhood is the issue. I know traffic is one of the issues. There's 150 train cars as far as the pollution and the type of waste they're carrying. Can we just get a clarification on what are the issues with this partic particular development for our neighborhood? It's 250 train cars that are additional that we know from the way the permit is written, the engines that are pulling these are rather old engines. A lot of them are tier zero engines, which means they have no pollution regulation. These are long- standing issues within the community and within this organization that have been bringing these issues to the community board the traffic. We are the nexus for East West, Rail, Movement, North, South, Rail movement for the whole of long island. We are the nexus. The trains come through middle village, Glendale, massbith and Ridgewood. All four of our major communities on our board are impacted by this, like I said, the facility on Otto Road and the West yards between the Admiral Avenue area and the fresh pond traffic cordon are the nexus of all rail kind of moving east and west, and these cars would have to come down onto that be stored, they're already being stored. The type of waste from what we understand Gary can correct me. If I'm wrong is construction and demolition debris and these cars are not sealed, they are open. They have a very fine netting on top, which means that they absorb all the rain water they if they're dry, because they are not just like chunks of a house. I mean they're literally put through grinders to get as much as possible in these cars, so they create a lot of dust as they're moving through communities. That dust is, then, you know turned into a liquid goo that drips out of them. You can look into some of the wonderful lawsuits that have happened with Christ the king in the past because of some of these cars just sitting in our community there's a lot of issues, so I think I've just covered a few of them. Michael Porcelli has his hand up okay, nothing. We do is going to stop this debris from being created. This transfer facility does not create the debris it processes it. Then it has to ship it somewhere. It's going through this community board, one way or the other, either by train or trucks on the l.I.e they're, both in this board you're not going to stop construction on long island. What we can do is stress that we want the cause to be sealed. Like Vinnie said, we want the cars to be sealed, you can't stop the cars from moving through or the trucks are moving through. Just try and work on getting them sealed. I am trying to I'm going to talk to the chair here. The chair. The motion is to send public comment. We are not shutting down a facility personally, we are not saying whether the facility can or can not exist. We're saying why we do not think it should be permitted in the way it's being permitted because of its undue impacts, that being uncovered cars, etc. These are the ways you get that acrosss. We could just stay silent and nobody will know anything. Kathy Massey has her hand up. You're, muted Kathy go Ahead, Kathy, okay, I think everyone's missing the point with cures. It's been an organization that we've supported their efforts, for is it 10 years now, John and probably more than that John all right and they've been very active up until recently I mean I think they even had a meet. They still have meetings five times a year and I do not think they're asking for much they're asking for a support on an issue which we all believe in, and I think we should just move on with this and give them a letter. It's not about Suffolk County, it's not about Queens. It's about supporting cures agenda. Okay, so why do not we restate the proposal that was we made John? Could we ask Gary to read the original proposal? Yeah sure. Can you hear me? Yes, Cures is recommending that we ask the New York State Department of environmental conservation DEC to deny a permit to Omni recycling, which wants to open a new waste by rail facility in Brentwood, Long, Island, Omni recycling proposed transfer station would ship 2,300 tons a day of construction and demolition debris, Residue and municipal solid waste, not only sea and date from Brentwood long island into the CB5 area. Omni recycling wants to put 1,000 rail cars into constant circulation to serve this facility. Orb will not store rail cars at their site. Rail cars will leave their facilities twice a day. The application means that about 250, more full and empty cars of waste will be all staged, switched, classified and interchanged in CB5 neighborhoods each week, because the New York State Department of environmental conservation permits waste transfer stations on a site-, by- side basis. Dec does not consider freight rail capacity issues or the cumulative impacts of its permitting on the CB5 area, including adverse impacts resulting from the operations and facility limitations of the New York and Atlantic Railway New York and Atlantic Railway recently told CB5 local businesses and residents that they have to store unsightly graffiti cars on the bridge at Myrtle, Avenue and fresh pond road, because NYA has nowhere else to put those cars. So how is there room for 250 more rail cars a week? Okay, so we're not protesting what they're shipping we're proposing to protest the amount of rail transportation coming in and out of our area. So forget you know. In the past we talked about uncovered c and d trains. We talked about solid waste trains and now we're talking about just the idea of 250 or to 1,000 rail cars being shipped due to this facility, and if you understand how the rail system works, they try to put together a train of 100 cars and that they can't ship more than two a day in each direction. If they're running passenger service on the same line so from Suffolk to Queens, there is just one line that handles passenger and freight. Currently, the freight is moved all night long. So the question is: what are we proposing? We do not want any more trains on the line or we do not want solid waste and c and D on the line. That's my question. John, I would say what we're actually trying to make the DEC aware of is that the permitting is not just about the site in question being the square footage a lot in a block for waste transfer, the DEC needs to acknowledge that the permitting process has impacts far beyond that site, depending on whether it is truck or train. We can talk specifically about issues as to the failure of our current train infrastructure and honestly Vinnie for trains running in the wider world, which these are usually going further out to landfills in Ohio or down to Virginia. Those trains are running in the lengths of miles at this point and you can't assemble a mile train in Queens. You really can't do that with any ease, or so it's not about it's about questioning how the business is being operated and its impacts on our community. It is not saying we are against trains. It's not saying we're against shipping by rail. It's wanting it done right and wanting all of the impacts to be considered for this particular permit process. Walter has his hand up yeah John. I understand your point and the reason I can't vote for this is just really what you're saying I'd. I would rather have it transported in by train than have trucks on the road, and I do not know what their entire plan is, which is really why I wanted the committee to look at it with without the ability to have that. I can't really vote for it. However, I think the critical issue here is that- and I would vote for all these cars have to be sealed and that's the major issue on this, but I'd rather have them on rail than on the than on the roads, to be honest with you, but they all have to be sealed and I'll support that 100 and I'll say right now that the only reason we have sealed containers is because of the energy of cures and getting waste management early on to commit to sealed containers for our municipal, solid waste. Every bit of construction and demolition debris coming through this community is not in sealed containers. They have been advocating for this for years. It has not been able to get past the Senate and the assembly in the state level, so we're trying we're trying on all different levels- and this is just one of those causes that we can put in words. It's not that we're asking all of you to get up tomorrow and go out to Suffolk County and sit at a board meeting we're asking to just write a letter of support for the cure stance that this is not the beneficial way to consider this permit, may I say something: hang on there's a bunch of hands right: rich Huber has his hand up. Yes, I just did a quick Google search and I included the link in the chat basically from the Iowa DOT. That gives some degree of comparison and it shows 260,216 rail cars is equal to well over a thousand tractor trailers, so I mean that that's an amazing amount of additional strain on our highway system and again to part of our community through the long island expressway and a lot more inefficient in terms of fuel and such so I at this point in time. I can't see the way we're stating it now to be in favor of this. Thank you very much for your time. Thanks Richard Kathy, Massey Kathy, I think you muted John Meyer we're talking about the request to deny the permit. Is that correct? Yes, okay and we have, I think we have to consider the fact that DEC can not do a site by site permitting without looking at the whole picture and the impacts to where it goes. Is that correct they currently the process? Is that that's what they're doing and we are trying to make them aware that it is more than that? Okay, all right, I just wanted to be clear on it, patrick trunchesi. You know, I agree with everyone saying that if this does go through which we absolutely have no control over there's going to be a tremendous amount of traffic coming through our area. So just keep that in mind. My other question is my question really is: who owns the rail lines that we're specifically talking about and who are the operators the if I may yeah, the long island railroad, which is owned theoretically by the MTA, owns the rail line? The franchise is basically for freight is the New York and Atlantic Railroad passenger service is still under the long island, railroad, so New, York and Atlantic is in the business of selling services. We are unique in the fact that nothing, absolutely zero could come into Brooklyn Queens Nassau Suffolk county by rail unless it comes into the Fremont fresh pond yards in Glendale. So that's it. They, the trains from long island, come to Glendale. They go up the New York, connecting railroad. They go up to Selkirk and go acrosss the river and come down the other side and go out to California or go away Virginia. You know the other way they go down to through Brooklyn through the Bay Ridge line, and they go to the ferries in at the 69th street in Brooklyn and they go acrosss the river to Jersey and they go south from. There is no other way of getting anything in and out of long island except by rail or truck Eric yeah. So I just Wanna, maybe reframe this, because it seems as a lot of consensus that one the rail is necessary to transport such materials and two that the pollution that the engines will be putting out on this particular proposal and the uncovered rail cars would be an issue with the level of traffic. This proposal will bring for our communities, so perhaps a way to go about this, and maybe this is what John was proposing and may I think this is actually what John is proposing, that we put out a statement saying the impact that if this proposal proceeds as stated not at all right, if we put out a statement to the to the state- and it says- hey, the issue we have with this proposal- is that the rail engines will pollute our neighborhood and the uncovered rail. Cars will also have a negative environmental impact on our neighborhood and that we think the proposal that could influence the state to force this company to amend its proposals to be to carry out a new proposal in a more environmentally conscious way to our communities. That is what covered rail cars and with updated engines that are more eco- friendly, and I think that's the real crux of it here: it's not about rail or no rail. I think it's really about methods of transport. The method of using the rail- and I think what we really want to advocate for is that if the methods are not changed to a way, that's eco- friendly with covered cars, we could have a major negative environmental impact on our communities from this proposal. So, just to reiterate, I think it's important that we do put out a statement, but the statement is specifically- and I think this is what John is saying- that the policy should be amended, and this could influence the state to push for this. If we do put out this statement, or at least make them aware that this is an issue, that the policy should be amended so that this company, while they're transporting these cars, need to do so in a way where the rail cars are covered and that the engines are Eco- friendly instead of the highly polluted current engines that they will probably be using okay, I would not argue with any of that sounds good John yeah, I'd still like to say something well, you're going to raise your hand, damn it raise your hand, okay, stop Peggy! When it says Ray's hand, if you click on it, your hand is raised, hang on a Sec there you go now your hand is up. All right. Can I just cut in Hang on Peggy, just for a second paul is on an ipad. Paul can't figure out how to hit the hand raise thing all right, we'll talk to him physically John. I think the main point here with what we are proposing is like a first step to reiterate to everyone in the state that they can't make a decision in isolation that what they think of what they're thinking of doing is going to affect us. I remember I was I was a founding member of cures- I'm not active anymore, but I remember that they had universities, do studies of the rail system and stopped at the borderline of the city as if the outside of Nassau and Suffolk had no effect on us. What we want the state to realize is they have to consider their effect of one the decision that they make on all the other things that are going to be affected by that decision. Am I right? Yes, okay, so let's hear from chimeli next, no hang on hang on. Let Paul Kirzner speak his hand. No he's been. He can't find the button benny. Okay, so push his button to let him speak. I can't Jesus. I have now unmuted myself, oh my god, okay Kirsten, where are you? There were three things that we have to include in this proposal. If I could see him, he could have been on here, but go ahead, Paul all right. There are three things we have to do and they has to be a carrot and stick Approach. One John is on the right track, you've got to say no, and you say no for three reasons and when you- and if you do all three things we'll change our mind, one is the covering of the rail cars for the demo, two upgrade the Mp15S or put in Gensen engines, and the third thing is to reactivate the Montauk flyover over Borden Avenue, so that it goes directly into the the New York collecting line, connecting line over hellgate bridge that montauk flyover was put in by the long island railroad at the turn of the last century, because they knew then the amount of service freight. At one time freight was bigger than passenger service on the long island railroad and they waited they got it so that it did not have to come to Glendale or to Ridgewood. Is they built this flyover, because what it did it took? The farm produce at that time was farm produce from Nassau and Suffolk County and it went uninhibited from out there through the main line over the montauk line, and then it went over the Montoya Flyover on Borden Avenue in Long island city, and then it went over that flyover took it over Borden Avenue and over the can. I ask you to address the motion on the table and not add like six years worth Nope Paul. What he's correct? We have to address what we're discussing now. So, let's hold that for a moment and we'll get back to you on the new business Bob Chamele Chameleon. Do you hear me if you speak? Do you hear me if you speak? Okay, I just wanted to know. If you hear me all I'm saying, is we have a deadline? Why do not we request an extension of the deadline? Why do we have to yield to that deadline? To make our comments? Okay, so I'll give you an answer, because it's not us it's the entire state. That's asked to comment on this project proposal so as Paul intimated and other people had spoken, John's recommendation should include reasons why we're against this because of the polluting engines and the uncovered cars, and I would recommend that John and Gary get together and put the words together. That say, we are opposed to this extension of waste transfer shipment on the rail system for the following reasons and let them write it and let's authorize them to do it. Anyone yeah. I agree with that that comment you made, I think, but I still think that we could write in our letter that they should give us enough time to comment on these things, whether we're speaking or for ourselves or for the other people. I do not know how we got. I told I told you before we have. I know we have we're really not. We do not have enough time. Maybe they do not have enough time either, but we really do not have a complaint in this permit for Suffolk County Walter Sanchez, please yeah, I mean I just as the executive committee. I wish the executive committee could see it before it goes out and it's not a lack of trust. It's just that. There are certain points that I think enough people on this made so that it's not about the location. It's about those two other things. So I'd like the executive committee to see it and review it before it goes out. Okay, I would just like for the minutes to reflect that this is just a letter of comment to a process. That's happening at the state level and the magnitude of commentary on this has just been amazing. I get it, but I do not get it at the same time. Okay, Kathy Massey, I'm going to say that I agree with letting Gary and John do the letter and also agree with Walter that the Executive board should take a look at it before it goes out, and I think that we should move this subject along now. Okay, so Kathy's proposal will take that John and Gary should work together to propose something for the executive committee to approve to send in response to this proposal. Can I have a vote on this Mr G? If you call a roll I'd appreciate it, we need a second okay. I will second Kathy's requested to the executive. Thank you. How I explain every everything or uncovered car is not like. Yes, do not say. Okay! Thank you is that a yes, I think he said yes, yeah, okay, Mr R Kerry, yes, Tony Benanti Tony. I think she dropped out. She has an early morning. She gets up at four in the morning. Yeah there you go Eric Bakkerwicz, yes, Bob Chamelli, yes, Walter Clayton, yes, Crowley, yes, Dimitro, Fitkowski or Steve Fiedler Walt is eating, so Steve Feedler, Steve's, muted, he's I've unmuted him. I think you're going back and forth with him. I do not think so he's on a phone- oh my god, all right soup around. Yes, thank you, doctor hold on Gary Hold on Gary Steve Feed lives there. Now all right people wait to hear your name. Please Fred Haller, yes, fred, Harfali, yes, rich huber, Xena! She remembered her she's. Not there is yeah all right, king of Curzina. Are you there Marianne, Latanzio or John Meyer or Patricia Maltesos or Edgar Mantel, four Kathy Massey Poor, Eileen, Maloney, four Peggy O'caine Michael O'cain, Lee, Rottenberg, Poor, Walter, Sanchez, Poor, Dennis, steffen or daddy sumski, or dino tapa or Barbara Toscano or Patrick Trinchesi, I'm going to help steam, and you have to explain why I'm an employee of the MTA? Thank you thanks, patrick no problem, Marianna, zero, four good everybody! Okay! Thank you! Everyone! We had one item of a new business. Paul Kersner had something he wanted to discuss: Paul yeah at the the latter part of last month's executive board meeting. We had a little discussion about shepherding these capital budgets through the city bureaucracy, and I think there was a consensus that at least on some of these items, members of the board should volunteer to heighten working with Gary to be responsible for moving these things, along with the bureaucracy of the city of New York, and to do that, I would suggest maybe take this actual capital budget sheet, that we have and maybe put another column in either on the one side or the other, to allow a person to sign of their interest to help shepherd this through, so that it all does not come down on Gary's shoulders. I got the sense that Gary was for the idea. Yes, no gary! Well, I do not see that I said it at the executive committee meeting that a lot of these projects are certainly going to need advocacy, civic advocacy business advocacy they they're going to need somebody to adopt them. Yes, okay, so that's why I think what we should do and not now, but if Gary would send out just another box on each one of these things, email them and those of you who are so inclined write your name next to each of these items that you would like to help shepherd through Gary is going to help you with the process, but it's going to be your responsibility to help them get it through the process, because the amount of projects that we get through right now is directly related to the time and effort that Gary can put into it, and so he can carry. He can do a lot more, a lot more if he gets help on each of these projects. So Gary is that a good suggestion to ask everybody to put their name in front of one of these things? What the budget survey if they are so willing. We could certainly use the help. Okay, so can you send that just a sheet with a little box where people can put their initials in yeah, that's Laura's department or she can figure out a way. You know everyone here is a volunteer. Everyone here is a was appointed because of their activities in the community and their relationships, and everything should be left up to them voluntarily to ask them to commit to more and then once you ask someone to commit to something, then you're going to monitor them and Adolf did that very strongly, and we do not do that here in our community, then we are not going to get any more done, that we get done now. Good, that's unfortunate as long as it's done democratically, with a small d and not a big d. Thank you. Is there anything else to come before the committee tonight? The board tonight, if not I'll, entertain a motion hold on Ken yeah, Month, Kathy stamsky brought up concerns about all faith cemetery, and I remember right. You mentioned something about sending any kind of email, information or anything to you was I correct. We did that we sent them a message. It was something specific I believe, and I think that what they were in contact with the complaint and it was resolved because I never heard anything more. Oh all right when I get a chance I'll go over and see because my family grave is an area where it's really bad by the time and there's a nice hill up there that I would have loved to selected, but my family decided otherwise. Thank you. Who's on ipad, 8., hello. You have your hand up ipad, 8., you're, muted. That's me Kathy Sumski can that was me who had the problem with all faith scent cemetery? Okay, I regret to inform you that the south side has nothing done. My husband went through there with a truck and he had to turn around and come back. The stones are still toppled down. The weeds are uncontrollable. It's just a mess I reached out to Bob Holden because once again there are fences down and the last time their fence went down a truck tried to go through what they were going to do. If they were grave, robbing or stealing you know, stained glass. You have no idea, send me something sending something descriptive, so I could go and visit with them all right. Well, I do not know if they're still there, because what I thought that there's a lawsuit against them forget about forget about legal garbage, we're community people if we have a problem with one of our community partners, would deal with them directly. Okay, I do not know what you want from me. You want me to just tell you that it's in disrepair and that where what where, when and how okay for about the last 20 years and okay, we're talking about today, forget 20 years. Well, that's how long it's been going when, where and how? Okay, that's how long it it's been in disarray. Just to let you know: hey, listen, Vinnie! We know that there's been stealing of the perpetual care money from that cemetery. Well, please you're, making a legal acquisition it's on the agency's police filed something please we do not do that on the committee board. We do not make legal accusations. This is a. This is a cemetery that has loved ones in it. That's it's being disrespected if you have a complaint- and you knew me about it for many months Vinnie, and so I it's not like this is the first time you've heard me complain about, but you're telling me that I should file a complaint you're telling me. I should file a complaint against the local delicatessen for selling cigarettes. I'm not telling you to do that, I'm already taking care of it. I take care of a lot of things. All my okay just send me the information. Please thank you anything else, anything else to come before us motion to Adjourn. Who is that I can't hear you motion to adjourn all in favor aye. Is that a board member good night take care? You.
