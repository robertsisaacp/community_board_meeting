Two, seven two place block three : six lot: 7 Glendale in a matter of an application city of New, York border standards and fields by Eric, Platnick to reopen and amend the term of the previously granted variants, which expired on December, 21st 2016 for a term of 15 years.
We want to stay in this community and the last application in front of the board was 15 years.
We're a New York manufacturer committed to the Glendale community that we've served for 70 years, and during that time the world has changed, but most of our procedures and most of our business has not changed.
A. Lot of you know the city planning and bill and BSA feel that when you have to come back you're going to be good, neighbors they've been great.
And I think you're a little bit younger than my brother fred, but he was the same pancreas guy and he married a Glendale girl and unfortunately they're both in Heaven now , I, just want to commend you and fm for your 90 years or 70 years in Glendale, and I also think that the board should consider a more permanent arrangement with Fm Brush because of the length of time, and only and being the only brush manufacturer in the United States and being in Glendale.
A point, and I do not want to put on any parade the challenge with making it permanent Is that if you happen to sell one day and somebody opens up a car repair shop there or something that's not as friendly to the neighbors, you know it would carry over into that.
And we're not giving you a hard time because you're great people, but You know, there's no telling how some something sells and how it expands so making it permanent The city's, just not going to do it.
I just want to say that everyone's been notified, but I do not know if you have a lot of like pce applications in front of you, often with gyms or spas, but that too you file on behalf of the person who rents that space, because they maintain that space and need all the licenses for that space in a greater building.
You have to do an owner's affidavit and an affidavit of lacie and they're, both responsible for the property, but we represent british petroleum making sure that all their sites are legal and compliant, which we, you know again talking for the people out on the street that are listening , you're, not representing the property owner, so you're asking for this matter on behalf of the tenant, who has no legal liability for the property, even though they, even though it could be a net, you know triple net lease.
This is standardly how they do it, so everybody who operates the site is has to be in compliance, and this is this- Is community board, five We're, a city agency, we're liable for the safety and security and legality of the city of New York and out our residents, and I'm.
Please ask the New York State Department of environmental conservation to deny a permit to Omni recycling, which wants to open a new waste by rail facility in Brentwood, Long island.
Staged switched classified and interchanged in CB5 neighborhoods each week, because the New York State Department of environmental conservation permits waste transfer stations on a site, by- site, basis.
Freight rail capacity issues or the cumulative impacts of its permitting on CB5, including adverse impacts resulting from the operations and facility limitations of the New York and Atlantic Railway New York and Atlantic Railway recently told CB5 local businesses and residents that they have to store unsightly graffiti rail cars up on the bridge at Myrtle, Avenue and fresh pond road, because Nya has nowhere else to put them.
So Dec is considering orbs permit application in a regulatory vacuum that leaves covering rail cars of c and d Residue up to the applicant Orbs application Our Senator Joe Adabo got the Senate version of the bill passed again this year, Now the New York State Assembly must act to protect the health of communities.
If I could butt in go ahead, the important part of this, in my opinion, for tonight, even without the committee taking it up, is to oppose the first item, which is the proposed transfer station in Brentwood, Long island, railing, a thousand rail cars into constant circulation and there's And she's, citing 250, more full and empty cards of waste being hauled staged switched classified and interchanged in CB5 neighborhoods, each week.
It means stuff, but we do not know, and the committee's got to go over That I understand, there's a deadline, but I think it should all be sent to committee So. The issue here is that all these new, all these rail cars that would be coming in here have nowhere else to go.
You know so long as we get some higher tier rail weight cars here in Glendale, just something for the committee to think about.
Unless anybody wants to propose a motion at this point in time hold on hold on the one thing: I would say: is: if you guys can, please use your raised hand function because it's going to get tough to manage other than that Peg. Okay, I just raised it, but Ken is first.
If we have a committee meeting, we if we want the board to make the resolution we're not going to have another meeting before the deadline and the fact that all these rail cars will be coming through Glendale, there's no other place for them to go.
Liquor wine, Beer and Cytolyzer Burmeo Food Corporation doing business as El Manaba restaurant 341, saint nicholas Avenue Ridgewood, is applying to restore their method of operation having after having their method of operation restricted by the New York State Liquor authority due to Covid-19 violation.
The establishment was in violation of Covid-19 rules and the New York State Liquor Authority closed the business and allowed them to reopen after paying a fine and restricting the hours in music.
I think that they had people inside the facility and they were found not only being a violation for having patrons inside, but so what they wanted if they had facilities that paid 150 000 dollars to the city in fines, okay, go ahead, So, we'll go back to the capital budget.
We have any comments and recommendations on the capital budget priorities I'd like to make a resolution that we follow the board's actual vote, not a vote.
The the resolution that we make I like to thank the board members for their attention to what we recommended the executive committee recommended.

You want to read it: The minutes of the prior meeting of September So, now statement from the state New York, City, Comptroller.
One of the things that we ended up with at the Executive Board meeting last month was that the process of getting capital budget items approved and funded was going to require, as it always has required people to take some responsibility for the capital projects that have to go.
The, City Council, continues to operate remotely with the summer months over our virtual hearings and stated meetings are beginning to pick up STEAM as we continue doing the work that impacts the lives of the 8.6 million new yorkers.
A couple of our long time, capital asks were on our capital budget request and thank you folks for voting them up towards the top like White Cough, Avenue, Roadway surfacing is still ongoing in our community.
You want to speak to the issue of the potential for all those additional rail cars coming into the Glendale yard.
That was that, because we do not have enough time to send it to the committee and come back to the full board to get our letter of recommendation against this permit, which permit it's the permit for another c and d site out on the island, okay, gotcha right and in that, I would recommend that we use the verbiage.
That cures has provided us to write a letter to the state Dec saying that it unduly impacts the communities outside of just that area, and we do not recommend it and it was seconded by Walter, and we were just about to go to any kind of discussion or question The reason for it is there's not enough time for the committee to meet before the deadline.
Dec is going to do what Dec does we're just putting in public comment, we're adding commentary and we're adding voices to the mix if they do not hear from anybody that there's issues with open container cars if they do not hear from people that there's issues that this waste by rail is impacting other communities other than the immediate site, they're, never going to acknowledge it or hear it.
More trains of waste through Glendale and Ridgewood Eric's hand is up Eric, you, muted, So from what I understand, it's a facility in long island, that's creating what is it 150, additional cars that are going through Glendale or Ridgewood and correct me if I'm wrong, but these are older, older trains that pollute and there's an issue with a lack of coverings.
Four of our major communities on our board are impacted by this, like I said, the facility on Otto Road and the West yards between the Admiral Avenue area and the fresh pond.
It's, going through this community board, one way or the other, either by train or trucks on the l.
Yes, Cures is recommending that we ask the New York State Department of environmental conservation Dec to deny a permit to Omni recycling, which wants to open a new waste by rail facility in Brentwood, Long, Island, Omni recycling proposed transfer station would ship 2, 300 tons a day of construction and demolition, debris, Residue and municipal solid waste, not only sea and date from Brentwood long island into the CB5 area.
Application means that about 250, more full and empty cars of waste will be all staged, switched, classified and interchanged in CB5 neighborhoods, each week, because the New York State Department of environmental conservation permits waste transfer stations on a site, by- side, basis.
Freight, rail capacity issues or the cumulative impacts of its permitting on the CB5 area, including adverse impacts resulting from the operations and facility limitations of the New York and Atlantic Railway New York and Atlantic Railway recently told CB5 local businesses and residents that they have to store unsightly graffiti cars on the bridge at Myrtle, Avenue and fresh pond road, because Nya has nowhere else to put those cars.
I would rather have it transported in by train than have trucks on the road, and I do not know what their entire plan is, which is really why I wanted the committee to look at it with without the ability to have that.
Cars will also have a negative environmental impact on our neighborhood and that we think the proposal that could influence the state to force this company to amend its proposals to be to carry out a new proposal in a more environmentally conscious way to our communities.
I. Think what we really want to advocate for is that if the methods are not changed to a way, that's eco- friendly with covered cars, we could have a major negative environmental impact on our communities.
One time freight was bigger than passenger service on the long island railroad and they waited they got it so that it did not have to come to Glendale or to Ridgewood.
That's asked to comment on this project proposal so as Paul intimated and other people had spoken, John's recommendation should include reasons why we're against this because of the polluting engines and the uncovered cars, and I would recommend that John and Gary get together and put the words together.
But I still think that we could write in our letter that they should give us enough time to comment on these things, whether we're speaking or for ourselves or for the other people.
They do not have enough time either, but we really do not have a complaint in this permit for Suffolk County Walter Sanchez, I mean I, just as the executive committee.
Okay, Kathy, Massey, I'm, going to say that I agree with letting Gary and John do the letter and also agree with Walter that the Executive board should take a look at it before it goes.
Think there was a consensus that at least on some of these items, members of the board should volunteer to heighten working with Gary to be responsible for moving these things, along with the bureaucracy of the city of New York, and to do that.
Well, I do not see that I said it at the executive committee meeting that a lot of these projects are certainly going to need advocacy, civic advocacy business advocacy.
