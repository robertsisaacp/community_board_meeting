The next order of business is the public forum Do. We have that sign-in sheet for the public forum No more than three minutes, no foul language, no personal attacks, Richie So, the first person to speak tonight on the public forum This is the last time that you're gonna hear about this, but it's a very important issue, I'm sure by now everyone's aware how hard that cures has been advocating for the containerization of waste coming from a long island to many years, the bill supporting their efforts was finally moved out of committee in the Senate for a floor vote However in the assembly.
But I am here because I wanted to say farewell as I promised a few months ago when I first came before you to introduce myself to some of you or to say hello again to some of you promised that I'd be back in March, but since I have the mic in front of me, I'd like to remind you of two things and things that you already know, but I want to make sure that they're at the forefront, because there's a lot going on right now in our borough number one We have a special election coming up, despite all the uncertainties that are happening right now, it is still on and it's still scheduled for March 24 We will elect our next borough president into office and that's March.
Early voting begins this Saturday thanks for that check and then March 24 is the actual special election and as we know, we don't vote you just don't matter What are we gonna do and then, a few weeks later in June we've got a statewide primary where we will again elect our borough.
I firmly believe that the future of New York is Queens, but our future is counting on being counted and that we matter and that we're visible, and so it is just critically important, fortunately had nothing to do with the Covid-19 19 or any other things that are before us right now This is the first time that it will be online and the way that they're strategizing the census count.
Everyone needs to be counted, it's censusgov, but we actually urge you to come to Queens VP org, and so those are the two things that I wanted to put before you front and center On your mind, in addition to all the great things on the agenda, but thank you for your indulgence for allowing me to just say hello and farewell, as I promised, not necessarily I plan to move out of the way as students We elect our borough president and they are sworn into office because they certainly won't have a lot of time before their June primary.
The borough board just voted a few weeks ago on the Queen's budget priorities for fiscal year 2021, and we submitted it to the mayor and the City Council, but there are three areas in particular and I.
We were writing to all community boards around New, York City, and actually you guys were the first to say yes and to invite us to this meeting So. The idea what's parka bill is portable is trying to create a peer-to-peer community based mobile application for drivers in the cities like New York City, so two drivers can exchange free street parking spot between each other, so how it works is as soon as the driver finds a parking spot in the street.
We are talking about not meter, just the free parking spot as soon as the driver finds the parking in the street He parks in the application detects its location and ask the driver to share his departure time in the future, and his parking spot was a departure time in the future would be shown as available spot in the future to all other drivers who are coming to this neighborhood in search of parking It's very easy and the drivers can chat with each other, communicate with each other, and they can request pre request parking spots in the areas they're going in the future beforehand.
More We also address the same issue: the Department of Transportation of the New York City, and we just some general answers and in one of the conversations over the phone, the representative of the D-O-T told us that they are not interested at the moment because they consider themselves as a revenue bringing organization revenue bringing branch They concern They are concerned only about metered parking, not free street parking, but we're confident that in the nearest future, we'll also find some common points of touch and try to communicate our idea to them The reason we're here today is just to know to first of all we're just getting our first users early adopters of the application around New, York City, and also to find out what are the best ways to interact with the community boards.
I recently moved my place of business San Cong to 6575 traffic avenue But during my time there there's been like five or six incidents of illegal dumping, of just piles of wood and possibly sometimes furniture, bed, bedding and I assume all that dumping is because the place looks like a and abandoned lot because of all the garbage and the vehicles that don't move there are kind of contributing to it as well, because I believe there are a couple instances of abandoned vehicles.
Yes, so you support the gentleman's request and you could articulate that to the Sanitation Services Committee, it's not as bad as it was, but there are still people who've come to do everything That's, illegal, immoral or fattening on traffic area, , we did to share those with enforcement So it's something to also recommend that you would be open to them and they'll come in like at midnight when everyone's asleep and then just dump a pile of wood and just dry off You could do the requesting committee We may ask you for discs that we could share a problem If the foster care and preventive agency I'm.
Thank, you all again for coming like to introduce his staff, pressing Cathy, O'leary Laura Mulvihill, just a granted - Gary Giordano, representing the borough president, is Jonah I'm sure you'll wait a little bit while I introduce police officers Barrish and Perez, and Sanada and Sergeant rain premium right good evening, we're up by one case: robberies we're up by 4 felony assaults up by 12, burglaries up like We , do have a robbery condition going on mainly in Ridgewood water in the area.
Some people You know they're going to switch our phones if we have to if we get to that point to our personal cell phones, which that will work too, but we need to be there in the offices to answer not only answer calls but to meet with constituents But there is talk about this virus spreading to the point where we'll have to shut down, and even community boards might have to shut down.
If you have a cold, don't go out, and if you feel that you know it's a non-essential meeting don't go, and some people feel that sporting events should be canceled because I was at the garden the other night for the Ranger game they lost You know it came into my mind that there's a decent large gathering, 15,000 people or more does cause concern that this will spread the virus even much faster The City Council is talking about a lot of things, we're taking it very seriously, and we have to show leadership here and certainly my office will answer any questions, but we're trying to desperately get more testing kits and get more testing sites.
But to me I felt this is not a place to live, This, look more like a minimum security jail and that's the feeling and I'm concerned just the mentality of building this kind of facility to house 200 men and they're going to be they're protected inside that facility, with a heavy security force But what about outside and the community?
I've asked a priest in to address a lot of the commercial overnights in the area, the illegal parking that we see on a regular basis, and then he also mentioned something that we need a procedure with parochial schools, especially because the public schools have a safety procedure in place, the parochial schools, as we witness they really don't, and if central command, that's the people that actually send out the cars from the precinct or from the in the neighborhood here when they hear a school is involved and there's a safety concern you're suspicious man outside of school.
Rikers is a part of Queens, so we directly said: Are they coming from Rikers and they're using it as a halfway house single most important thing: we've had to deal with as a community board in the past five years.
They we investigate and we inform communities like yours and providers, so we're conducting enhanced surveillance, we're not stooping our phones or actually looking at different cases, we're also implementing federal monitoring requirements which happen to change ever so often or educating the public, we're providing guidance to health care providers, and we have good news and we're going to teach you how to protect yourself and others from covert 19 stay informed, New, York, nycgov, slash health and CBC gov.

We have a second I like to second that There's no question: you want to read from the bottom up, so The other vote is 16 in favor of the proposed four-day street festival on freshman road 11 against no intentions, none now go The report.
It was a presentation from the folks at New, York, City Transit that are doing the bus redesign On, the 31st, which we are going to have a moment to speak to the Wyckoff Avenue project, but we are going to start to formulate our response back to them because we would like to get them our comments by April when they're hoping to collect people's comments.
