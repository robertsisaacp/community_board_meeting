Like the welcome you all to the regular schedule committee board five meeting here at Christ, the King high school cafeteria for those of you at home and that of watching the live streaming.
Thank you, as you recall, board members, the at the last meeting we had a table in motion which takes president precedence, so First order of business tonight is the table in motion on the report of the executive committee regarding the Fresh Pond road festival.
This is the last time that you're gonna hear about this, but it's a very important issue, I'm sure by now everyone's aware, how hard that cures has been advocating for the containerization of waste coming from a long island to many years, the bill supporting their efforts was finally moved out of committee in the Senate for a floor.
We want to do an all-day service and provide a spot for the neighborhood that functions as Park Cafe part bar and part restaurant.
We want to open at 7:00 in the morning and offer sort of quick casual counter service by day and a little more intimate setting by night, we're inspired by French, cafe and Italian bakery, which are little tapas bars in Venice, that provide a casual atmospheric environment for the enjoyment of eating and drinking, and we have a lot of experience in food and beverage.
I'd like to temporarily suspend the public forum to introduce our borough president Sharon Lee, good evening.
But I am here because I wanted to say farewell as I promised a few months ago, when I first came before you to introduce myself to some of you or to say hello again to some of you promised that I'd be back in March But since I have the mic in front of me, I'd like to remind you of two things and things that you already know, but I want to make sure that they're at the forefront, because there's a lot going on right now in our borough number one.
I firmly believe that the future of New York is Queens, but our future is counting on being counted and that we matter and that we're visible, and so it is just critically important, fortunately had nothing to do with the Covid-19 19 or any other things that are before us right, now.
You can be wearing your PJs, whatever you do, you can do it from the privacy of your home or wherever you are, and then, after a few weeks, they're gonna track us as to whether we are filling out the census and As soon, as I can online to prevent somebody knocking on my door and disrupting my day or evening, but all jokes aside, as you know.
Everyone needs to be counted, it's census.gov, but we actually urge you to come to Queens, VP org, and so those are the two things that I wanted to put before you front and center.
We elect our borough president and they are sworn into office because they certainly won't have a lot of time before their June primary.
The borough board just voted a few weeks ago on the Queen's budget priorities for fiscal year 2021, and we submitted it to the mayor and the City Council.
You know: I wouldn't put my bets on that, but we'll see how the count turns out this year, but we have only nine acute care hospitals in the borough of Queens and we are the least vetted meaning we are under.
We have the least number of beds per 1000 residents here in Queens than in any other borough, and we are overburdened already by the closures of I, believe it was like four hospitals just in the last decade, Schools, seniors hospitals and many other areas, but So I leave you with that, because all the more reason that we are counted all the more reason that were visible in the count that were visible in every single election.
We were writing to all community boards around New, York City, and actually you guys were the first to say yes and to invite us to this meeting.
The idea what's parka bill is portable, is trying to create a peer-to-peer community based mobile application for drivers in the cities like New York City.
We came to the idea of the application, not by chance we're also drivers in New York City, and we know how frustrating it is how stressful it is to find a parking spot for most of the drivers.
A year, just in search of parking and parking in this street is also one of the major causes of traffic congestion in cities like New York, every three cars in ten cars we see in our streets, they're, not just moving or going anywhere They're just cruising around in search of parking, so helping drivers to find parking spot can also help to decrease the traffic congestion in our streets.
We also address the same issue, the Department of Transportation of the New York City, and we just some general answers and in one of the conversations over the phone, the representative of the D-O-T told us that they are not interested at the moment because they consider themselves as a revenue bringing organization revenue bringing branch.
The reason we're here today is just to know to first of all introduce our idea: We're just getting our first users early adopters of the application around New, York City, and also to find out what are the best ways to interact with the community.
There's also the issue of a garbage and debris that collects under the vehicles that are parked on Woodbine and Palmetto Street between whooping and Palmetto, and you just can't clean it because you can't get into the cars And I assume all that dumping is because the place looks like a and abandoned lot because of all the garbage and the vehicles that don't move there are kind of contributing to it as well, because I believe there are a couple instances of abandoned vehicles there I want to bring up with you guys and see you can work on a solution because I was told.
And they'll come in like at midnight when everyone's asleep and then just dump a pile of wood and just dry off You could do the requesting committee We may ask you for discs that we could share a problem.
What I'm requesting is of the New York City Transportation Department, to start a an assessment of the traffic that is going on there?
It's important that all of us try to get there because she expressed a concern that she would like to put the faces with the voices and the people that she speaks to.
Additionally, I wanted to just provide a small update to the board regarding the Wyckoff Avenue reconstruction project, which we are working with.
The community board our district manager to get an update from the Department of design and construction on this project, which has been stalled for some time, so we're just working on some logistics as to when we can get all the agencies.
If we have to, if we get to that point to our personal cell phones, which that will work too, but we need to be there in the offices to answer not only answer calls but to meet with constituents.
If you like, the mayor's office said if you don't have to, if you have a cold, don't go out and if you feel that you know it's, a non-essential meeting, don't go, and some people feel that sporting events should be canceled, because I was at the garden the other night for the Ranger game they lost.
You know it came into my mind that there's a decent large, gathering, 15,000 people or more Does cause concern that this will spread the virus even much faster.
This is why I don't know what I think they said: they'll have 48 security guards in there or not only not at one time, but a force of 48 Why. Does it have to look like a jail?
That's the people that actually send out the cars from the precinct or from the in the neighborhood here when they hear a school is involved and there's a safety concern.
Rikers is a part of Queens, so we directly said: Are they coming from Rikers and, they're using it as a halfway house single most important thing: we've had to deal with as a community board in the past five years right, And I mentioned this a number of times in print that it was said that 40% of the individuals leaving jails go into the homeless, shelter system.
I think we have a few left for everyone that if anyone wants to call has been postponed so just spread the word you could still call and reserve one, but the dates for that and the breast cancer screening about is kind of TBD, so feel free to call our office for any questions or concerns are always happy to help.
How, the New York's responding, how you can protect your community and our you know: greater city and resources.
What CDC says is that if the country it has level two or higher people with pre-existing conditions, shouldn't go there and what we're doing with maternal child returning travelers is that for foreign nationals who visited China or Iran in the past 14 days may not enter Green card holders and family of American citizens and green card holders are allowed entry and New Yorkers, who return to who returned from China, Iran, Italy, South, Korea or Japan are being asked to stay at home.
For 14 days, where we told them don't go to work, don't go to school, Stay home The New York City is identifying people who may have been exposed to the virus.
It's, the final option, because New York City public schools serve as a shelter serve as a place where children can actually learn.
There is an active website that people can put their thoughts and ideas into We did lose a lot of residential service in this community board, and they need to hear that On that note, we sorry, if you just basically put in a search engine, Queen's bus, redesign, MTA your to get their website.
And there's one for the local routes, traffic safety request and discuss those Walter sent people from Maspeth above principie Park on 54th Avenue , There's, multiple requests in that area We are asking for an area wide study, because I think a lot of the committee members felt that there was no easy solution over there were other requests in the area.
