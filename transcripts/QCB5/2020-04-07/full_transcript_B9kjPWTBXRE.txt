And they will be able to the elected officials will be the same opportunity as the public. A few reports from the elected officials- okay, Donald Pasadena- would you please lead us in a salute to the flag? So today we have two cases. So, what's going on right now, this: 19 situation is it's taken, I mean it was like this in March-, but it has become more serious- point where we have instituted several measures so right now there is a white spot community transmission in New, York City, all New Yorkers, who do not work- essential services, should remain home. All non- essential gatherings of any size are banned if you feel sick, stay home and protect others by practicing and please announcement. This does not need for people to stay home. So basically it's a series of grocery stores and other services. We recommend that all New Yorkers were these coverings when, outside of their home, to help to spread help, stop the spread of a face covering can include any well secured paper or cloth like a bandana or a scarf. That covers your mouth and no healthcare issues. Health insurance can apply through your state of health. You must apply within 60 days of losing coverage. The state is also launching an online portal to connect hospitals, health care facilities with healthcare volunteers, because we are in serious need of them. Doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, physicals physician's assistants, you name, it is also expanding additional facilities. Hospital in the US government is also one of those places where this pharmacies are at a time and away. If you have any questions, I'll feel free to have a question press raise your hand and we'll turn your microphone on. If there are no questions, Thank You, Jay, we'll go on to the next item of business is the Public forum. Thank you stay safe. Thank you. I do not have anything here. Mr. Jordano turn his mic on DM& I, see their hand. We want to deal with I wanted to say was that it's very important that we maintain our meetings that we go back to public meetings, because virtual me is just too much lost that we have in public meetings and I'm, hoping that we go back to them and I wish everyone well. Thank you very much. Thank you, okay, so then the next first please, membership and I do not mean just the 2020 Census gov. Obviously, as you folks know, but people need to know determines how much federal funding representation for the next ten years. Extensions. The term for 2020 appointees, will now begin on May 31st 2020 instead of April first and last March 31st 2022. That means Community board members. These terms expire on March 31st, will continue serving for an additional 60 days and it's pursuant to the New York City Charter I gave Vinny and Gary and Laura the numbers in case. Anybody wants to look at that. To look it up. Direct initiative, BPA is party, would first direct to feed organizations throughout the borough of Queens, and it's a daily operation going to every board drop off of food, for your board is Peter Cordell a senior center, so you know, and last but not least, fuel the front lines. The borough president has completely funded with economic development and the Queen's night market to send home- cooked meals to hospitals throughout the borough to feed their workers. 250 meals per hospitals are being delivered, and that is all I want you all to be safe. She does kill one fool to be safe and well, and hopefully we will see each other soon life. Thank you. Thank you from the precinct officer. Statistically, robberies are down by two felony assaults are up by three burglaries are up by 12, and we all know why. That is because all the stores that are closed and businesses that are closed, ground law city is down. 9 Grand, Larceny, auto, is up, and part of that is because they've been stealing rims and wields. Also expensive vehicles or expensive rims and people are still leaving valuables in the cars and everybody's got their car is parked on the streets. So just be aware of this, and the precinct is available for us and that's it officer, parishes report. Thank you. The prison system releasing an abundance of inmates before some to Korban 19 these inmates being just released. Are they like with ankle, brace or any type of tracking, and where do they think some of these inmates going? Are they going to the shelters? Are they going into like a halfway house? Is there any more information on the release of the president that, because we were not given any information they're given the car fare and a list of shelters if they need to go somewhere, so we do not know that for a fact, anyone else if I could just let people know under the participants icon on the bottom, is where people can use the raise hand. It's not a separate icon. Today, it's you have to go to the participants and then there's a button to raise your hand all right who's on the phone that wants that speaking I think the Rotenberg wanted to say something hello. Why are you there, like I, did yesterday I'm sorry yeah yesterday, during the practice session, I saw the icon at the bottom participants list and it's not there for some reason now: I have mine on the right hand, under the participant list. It's good, but it's not Danielle. Did you? Okay, we'll have to work on that? Yes, I want to say if you'll just chat and get your attention, okay, so any other questions. Okay, do you want to the control statement before being let out of jail, because we because of the violence and I guess, for other reasons, Councilmember Holden said last month at the meeting that something like forty percent of those who are released from jail if I recall correctly wind up in the shelter system? Okay, right so have you looked at stringers report, but you have anything to comment, and this is essentially entitled that control. The stringer calls on city to fully assess impact of Koban 19 on new yorkers by race, ethnicity and occupation. Are we at least the first paragraph he's addressing this cement de Blasio and Commissioner barbell the health commissioner I'm writing today to add my voice to those urging the city to release demographic data that reveals the race and ethnicity of those who have been afflicted by the Colvin 19 virus in New York City, which I was heartened to learn? The administration is currently working to accomplish by all accounts. This crisis is deepening system, systemic, social and economic inequalities in New, York, City and consequences of these disparities is reinforcing a cycle of transmission mortality lost income and poor health. The disproportionately affects lower- income, people of color. Our response and relief efforts must consider impacts of these widening divisions, which is why I think it is so important for the city to fully assess the role played by races and ethnicity in this outbreak. I know the president spoke about that and he was directing his staff to see if they could figure out. Why and how deep it goes, and then he was also going to carry it international. You see if the African popular populations around the world have the same problem. Okay, we already heard the president's statement. Would you like to do the congresswoman Mang, please? Okay, so congresswoman Maine puts forth good evening, CD 5, dear community board members and Staff Congresswoman Mang and her team hope you and your families are all healthy and well. We want to remind you that while we are working remotely, we continue to be accessible to all our constituents in need of assistance. Please do not hesitate to reach out by calling our district office number and leaving a voicemail at seven one: eight three, five, eight six, three six four or sending an email to my zero six, the congressional district in New York casework at Mail.House.Gov. The congresswoman is aware of issues regarding mail delivery in the CB5 area and is working to ensure that mail delivery resumed, while keeping in mind the health and well- being of our postal workers. Finally, if you have not received our flowers about read a resource and health and well- being of our postal workers. Finally, if you have not received our flowers about rebate, resource guard or SBA loans, please email us, so we can get that out to you as soon as possible. We have stronger when we work together and help each other, and we will get through this. We look forward to seeing you again very soon. The congresswoman's staff also attached significant amount of information which could be emailed to board members with regard to the stimulus package and what kind of grants and other assistance are being provided by the federal government, which is quite expensive. Thank you. The councilman writes hello, Neighbors Community board five members and fellow elected officials. I hope that you are all staying safe and healthy and I. Thank you for your continued work and volunteerism as we navigate this unprecedented crisis together, it's important to continue protecting ourselves and our neighbors through good hygiene and social distancing, but we will get through this one day at a time. My office has been closed since March 17th, but my staff and I gladly continue to serve our constituents every day while working from home. Please do not hesitate to call seven one: eight three, six 3900 or email district 30 at Council, DOT nyc.gov my office anytime, when you need assistance first and foremost proposed legislation last week that would require New Yorkers to wear a face covering in public during this coronavirus. Emergency I believe it is time for our city to take bold steps to stop the spread of the virus, and the recommendation from mayor De Blasio to wear masks or face coverings is not enough. Countries around the world have mandated the use of masks and public mandated. The use of masks in public have been very successful at storing the spread and I think we should follow suit. I encourage all of you to wear a mask if you go outside for essential reasons, and there are many easy ways to make your own homemade masks from simple household materials. Secondly, the Cooper Avenue shelter had a violent incident on April 3rd between two residents inside. According to the 104Th precinct, the two residents had a dispute that ended in the standing of one individual and the arrests of the other I have reached out to Department of homeless services. Commissioner Steven banks to ask how the administration plans to handle this situation and I will continue to provide updates, as I receive that going back to the coronavirus. I have proposed several other pieces of legislation related to the city's response to this pandemic and how it can be more prepared to face similar crisis in the future. I have been writing letters to city agencies, urging them to prioritize resources for our first responders and corrections. Officers and I have expressed my frustration with Department of Health Commissioner, Dr. Barbra and mayor De Blasio for their response to the virus. I have also been in touch with the Postal Service about mail delivery issues and covering the shifts of sick employees, so the officers continue to can continue to function. Normally. I will do everything in my power to continue holding our government accountable, while supporting my constituents and their local needs. Thank you again for your dedication to our communities, especially during this. Seeing you again soon. Okay, Assemblyman Hevesi helps everyone as well. Our office is continuing to monitor phones and emails while working remotely, if anyone has any questions or concerns related to the state response to the Coe bid, 19 outbreak issues with unemployment, suspended services or any other matters in which we may assist. Please call us at seven one, eight, two, six three: five: nine five or email, the Assemblyman CVEs, my assembly gov our office thanks the board and staff for its leadership in this difficult time stay safe. Everyone. Thank you. We got this from his chief of staff, Victoria Leahy, and there are a lot of attachments which can be distributed to board members via email, very good. Thank you. Cb five is safe and healthy for tomorrow's meeting. I just wanted to send over the following notes on behalf of Assemblymember barnwell's office, to include with the meeting minutes. Although our offices can't be closed, we are forwarding phone calls, so you can continue to call our office number seven one, eight six, five one, three one, eight five with any questions or concerns, as we have limited staff available. If you are not able get in touch with us, please leave a message with your name and number and we will call you back. Our office is working to purchase. Ppe protective equipment mask gloves to distribute to hospital workers and first responders, if you're unsure what relief benefits you may be qualified for or how to road access those benefits. Please call our office, so we can connect you to those resources. Lastly, I've attached a few of our guides that we've been circulating with constituents to help better explain, programs and resources available for those experiencing hardship due to cold in nineteen and there's a resource list is information regarding senior meals, New York, City, Department of Education grab- and- go meal service, other food assistance, small business and employee resources application. It's a renewal, not a new application, Erasmo six, nine six one two is a renewal application: okay, Walter Sanchez, Luis Rodriguez Kelvin, Rodriguez, Charlie, Drake, Steve, Fiedler, Freddie, Michael and Oh Patricia, Millett, Essos, I, thought I saw you yes, okay, Mr. Jordano, but I do not think recently. Yes, there was especially in portions of Richmond Blundell from what we know. We very good compared to what we've seen in the past from the Ridgewood post office, who got back to us quickly and track them down. Thanks to Christian Romero congresswoman bangs office. They were very responsive. He told us he told me basically approximately you know how much staff were out at any one time without getting too specific and those foster workers had to work real hard to make up the fact that others were out sick and we're working much longer shifts. So we have not gotten any recent complaints with regard to mail delivery. Yesterday was no delivery in this portion of Glendale I. Think that you're going to have problems getting daily delivery. There's no doubt about that. Hopefully, those problems Vinny brought to my attention that some of those problems started when some of the senior citizens who do not get direct deposit were expecting their Social Security check toward the end of March, so those postal workers and a lot of these other essential workers really had their work cut out for them and I tried to thank them in some correspondence that I think I sent to you when we sent you the meeting notice, but everyone from God bless those health care workers who were working those very long shifts in those very dangerous conditions. You saw the situation at Elmhurst Hospital, with the lines virtually around the block and the demand for care and some of our hospitals just over flute, Li overflowing I think Vinny. That Wyckoff is taking more patients to help with some of the overload. If you could correct me on that, but they increase the bed count and it's certified for 285 beds. They had 280 beds now up to 333 beds, they have sufficient equipment, but the staffing is a problem. The nursing ratio, which should be one to ten a one to four, is now one to ten. So that's where the problem is, they were several that were being transferred to Manhattan to the Convention. Center excuse me and there were 38 waiting for beds in the emergency room, but by this that should be sorted out soon. The whole thing is transporting getting the beds ready. They opened up three wings that or three wings that had been previously closed on to the current state administration, so they're at 60. The beds are at 62% occupancy, so there's still room, but it seems to be a softening emergency service workers. Those who are running these ambulances for EMS and the private hospitals, God bless them. They've been under a lot of stress. The sanitation workers have done a yeoman's job, picking everything up it's the first time, I've seen them with masks on the police department, the fire department, the food service workers, the people in the grocery stores of the supermarket's, who are making sure that we have provisions and in the pharmacies so I'm thankful to all of them, and then some of the Transit Authority workers I spoke to Lucille Songhai. Today, then he with regard to the possibility of a transportation committee meeting and John and talking about either the you know, a video conference or audio conference meeting doing either the third or the fourth Tuesday of the month. So she's receptive to whatever questions might be put forth and answering those questions in writing. Essentially, any non- essential work is not being done, including you know. Our long- awaited removal of the loose tank along the M line and painting over that M line that we finally got them to start with. Some projects are ongoing that big sewer project. That's going to go it's going along 70th Street from Columbus Avenue and going south toward Grand Avenue is in full bloom. They, as far as the canal will be Avenue 74th Street area project. They are been doing concrete work and sidewalk work curbing and are getting ready to resurface. I do not know about the start of the reconstruction of the running track and the turf Sacco/ football field at Juniper. It was supposed to start a few weeks ago, but in these conditions, I do not doubt that it might be delayed quite some time longer a lesson that I think we need to learn as a country with regard to this outbreak and the scarcity of provisions as far as mass goes and ventilators goes and gowns I think we need to do a much better job of having warehouses for these items for any future problems. I hear that we could have another bout of this coronavirus type situation as we might with the flu a year from now and I. Think, as a country, we need to do a better job of producing what we consume, especially those items that are very important and I for one have been quite upset for quite some time that we make our computers and other vital intelligence material in other countries where our secrets can be stolen and I. Think we've got to bring a lot of our manufacturing, especially the intelligence manufacturing back to the United States of America. So you just fit the pattern, then, when you get to be in your 60s, you've become more conservative getting back to Wycoff hello. Let me just finish this: an mo getting back to Wycoff on Sunday April 12th, which is Easter, Sunday, Jacob and Og. 4Th Precinct will be bringing food and investors to Wycoff heights staff, to the medical and professional staff to thank them for what they've been doing and sometime next week, Tuesday or Wednesday Bob Shaw Meg of the Avenue and one of his clients will be delivering dinnertime meals to staff and leadership in appreciation of what they've been doing. Ok, community, particularly restaurants, and the pharmacies and special service place instead of remained open, and we should do all we can to support these businesses and, when I know, Patricia's on the line and she's doing good work at Touchin square and rolls on all my big colleagues and in the city so we'll get through this and hopefully be stronger people. Thank you. Manufacturing again talked about for years. It's important to manufacture things in this country from aging that we have to get everything else from somebody else. We have the capacity Mr. Chairman, yes, I've been advocate as one of the few manufacturers left in the state of New York fighting here with all of the for many years and to Gary's point with technology all of the new 5 g technologies coming out of China, and there are reports that there's a lot of spyware within the 5 g networks and everybody is just embracing it. Heartedly again, look at this particular meeting. Many people were concerned over the security concurrent technology, so 5 g is one of the things that must be looked into and the other thing must be to make it easier for manufacturers rather than if not we have education Council meeting they did not meet last month. Instead, they had a town hall meeting with Chancellor Carranza. It was well attended, it was at is five, it was so crowded. It poured out into the gymnasium. I do not have a summary of the questions that were asked. I know some were related to specialized high school. He stated that with no change is going to be made anytime soon and it was. There was charter school people in the meeting hoping to get some more space for their students, but that was not for district 24. They also are having their meeting we're having a meeting and that's all I have to get regarding CEC. Thank you. Any other committees need to report all dressed and covered with it. She looks like it's got. A food through the door runs away: zoom, stomp, Tish police's fish market, almost everybody in the neighborhood. They have reduced hours, but they are providing food. It's same thing as before. Some of them are wearing their gloves and masks, but obviously yes, the porches wear their rubber gloves when you go to the butcher store shopping locally, because when I try to go to Gaspar the butcher, the line is around the corner, and if you go to some days, you have to wait outside to get in Wow. Anybody expressed concern will not recover and come back in with now over six million nationwide out of work that when with relief, that's some of these places and some of these businesses realistic need, are not going to recover and come back. The big concern in New York City as a whole, is that we have I believe it's six hundred thousand service type businesses, restaurants, grocery stores, bars places like that they're trying to stay alive by it's like a forty five percent failure. So it's difficult to see the supposed trillion dollar or two trillion dollar package. That includes another four trillion in loans. That will be, if you reopen your business and you and you keep it open for a year. The loan is doing that making money available. Okay, you were talking about it's now, six million but I think it's up to ten million unemployed and yes, the that are trying to get through these troubling times the right now, where you can not evict tenants who can not pay, which I understand, has suddenly been struck in with this there's no Toria more pushing back the businesses are struck with which numerous tax foreclosures on buildings and businesses and I would hope that some of our elected officials some sort benefit to landlords and businesses because of the exorbitant property taxes that we're getting hammered with and I'm sure. After this entire ordeal is over, our property values are magically going to skyrocket, even though the real estate market will be decimated. Just something for everyone to consider. Thank you very much for the mention that so domestic violence is going also drug addicts and I assume the a chapters have any support. They're trying, they're struggling with their addictions concerns with people. I know that have gone to the hospital. It's uncool bit, patients really getting the services they need. Horses are taking like half an hour or more to come, so they say if someone is suffering with the heart attack just go ahead and let them die response. Obviously, patients and then friends from CB6 mark Westar has been approaching me about how the homeless would be able to get these checks. So he wanted me to bring productive sales. Taxes were due, which does not really make any sense. So I guess if you were completely able to file your sales taxes, you would have gotten a break, but people like me that would be, which is. Another approach is based on. That's why to do this outside consultant, because using the Borough Hall account one of the staff, or one of you would have had to do what Mark has been doing with the control, the microphones and everything else. So the city has proposed another alternative system. We may experiment with that for free, but I personally prefer having a consultant operate for us. So you're welcome to send you your comments, so it was. It was Walter, Clayton and Lee Rotenberg, okay, so blessed Easter and a great.
