Welcome to the regularly scheduled meeting of community board five Queens, just a reminder and no one else will be permitted to sign it to speak under the public.
A couple I added starts tonight, so we have Denise Esposito speaking to us on certain training from the New York City office of emergency management.
Every night is a different topic and we're trying to do it here in Queens, five community, board, five and also in the Bronx, but we're looking to get some signups tonight just to find out more information about the program.
The data can be used to inform funding for services like fire, stations, schools, clinics and representation that affect your community.
It's, also used by nonprofits to inform services by businesses to create jobs and even by students for school projects, understanding how the population changes helps us shape communities acrosss the country for the better.
I will thank all the participants at the next month's meeting after I have a complete total of items collected community Ward 5 is kindly extending drop- offs to their office until this Friday November, 15th I.
Waste is also an issue in New York City, because our garbage is carried out on diesel trucks and these trucks drive about seven point, eight million miles each year, which impacts air pollution in our city.
For the past, two years, I and a growing group of people have been advocating for our borough to be participating along with Manhattan and Brooklyn in a citywide effort, that's called a swab, their solid waste advisory, Boards, they're required in the Administrative Code and Queens used to have one and it fell out of favor at a certain point, when people retired and moved away.
We know that Melinda Katz is going to be leaving, and so we need everyone's support to ensure that the next borough president is on board with a swab as soon as possible.
Some of you may know that last year, I worked with Ted runs from the Myrtle Avenue bid and Bob Monahan from the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council.
Who'd like to see some money going to a local nonprofit to work on this issue of activating storefronts activating public spaces in collaboration with artists and community people to step up, raise your hand, talk to Bob Holden, make it known that that's an issue you care about And, again, I'm happy to talk with anyone about it, because it's something I still care about my life to be involved in Thanks.
We had 15 so for January, we're looking for interns and They can get hours which they flip for credits, but we're also taking high school kids, who need community service hours.
So, when you call they'll, know a lot about you already that they'll know that you're hard of hearing or you're deaf, or that you had some domestic violence issues or whatever And they'll, be able to not ask you a million questions which delays response, emergency response, so we're on that as the City Council, but certainly my committee.
If you heard, but It's, some whistleblowers came to me during the summer former teachers of Nance, with high school, telling us in my office that we have a number of individuals that they were actually teaches.
They should be ready for college and or ready for life, or both we're not seeing that most of the students that are graduating That's not fair to the taxpayers in order to the students or the parents, a couple of things which I-- and this was a pet peeve of mine as a civic member, and certainly a community board member or these cars that play this loud music in many neighborhoods and ours, included in the will of ours that we've seen them all over.
It's a good hit, and it looks like it's getting a lot of support in the City Council There's many other girls that I have going on animal rights and so forth, but and on the homeless, shelter, I challenge the DHHS proposed homeless, shelters, 7816, Cooper Was it November, 7th And Gary did a great job.
Thank that we had very good turnouts, not only at the public cv5 hearing, but also at my town, Hall meeting at 119, PS 119 and certainly with the demonstration So I want to thank the community for coming out in force and telling the mayor that we're serious about this and Smaller shelters are fine.
It is called Do Department of Information Technology, so they're in the process of converting us at the Community board, and anyone who is a faction ATO of weapons, try to renew your license or get a new one online, because you're not allowed to do it by paper.
Most people nowadays are working on their smartphones and do not have all the technology that is required for that If you're interested in volunteering contact our office, we have some really amazing budget delegates and a lot of really interesting, ideas.
The first one we're having another Java with Joe on Saturday November 23rd from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 at the Avenue diner at 90,106, should make Avenue in Woodhaven It's a good time for people who are normally working 9:00 to 5:00 to come.
I know a lot of with the order and you could actually narrow down to when you want to deliver to when you're going to be home.
Meeting on December 5th at 7 o'clock, 94, Hale Street at the church I will send out some more information to the community board into the Parks Committee, especially to make sure that's good.
I want to read you what my testimony was: So on the 7th of November, which was Thursday The, mayor's Office of Contracts, had a hearing with regard to the proposed contract for 7816 Cooper Avenue, for it to be a homeless, shelter, residence and on the dais for the mayor's Office of Contracts was one man and one woman I think the woman actually worked for the mayor's office of contract.
The man who was there I, believe actually worked for the Human Resources administration or the Department of Social Services or for the department of homeless services, so he's actually chairing the meeting, not a nonpartisan person from the mayor's Office of contracts, but somebody actually from the agency that is looking to contract with West had to operate.
The first person I see is the man who was chairing the meeting It's, the only person I saw at homeless services until I saw the lady who was going to mind me when I was looking at the contract, and this is the same guy who was chairing the meeting Seemed like a real good guy, but on the opposite side of life, from where our opinion with regard to this matter.
This, is in the matter of a proposed contract between the Department of homeless services, the city in New, York and West had to develop and operate a standalone transitional residents for homeless, single adults of 7816 Cooper Avenue in Glendale Queens New York.
Amendment was enacted late in 2018 the size of the proposed homeless, shelter residents for 200 men is much too large in the community of one and two family homes, the amount of the contract, 61 million eight hundred and eight thousand dollars for five and a half years.
I probably talked about in virtually every month, they're going to finally install the rest of the sewer line in 74th Street between Pleasant View, Street and Juniper, Boulevard, South, I,, think the contractor and the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of design and construction have been working, out, cost estimates or what they're willing to pay for the rest of that project, some of which was not in the original contract, and they want to be done by the end of the year.
The first item we spoke about was the most recent enrollment numbers and capacity numbers at the public schools within the Community board.
It's, currently operating at 1775 students, we're Maspeth high school, has a capacity of 905 students and currently has almost 1200 students , we're hoping at our next meeting in early next year that the members from CEC are there, as well as someone from the superintendent's office that can speak to the data.
Members Carmen had sent an article regarding the homeless students in the New York City public school system.
One of the main issues raised at this meeting related to the original reservoir The fact that the New York City, Parks, Department and Recreation intends to spend 5.3 million dollars to stabilize the East and Gate House at the Ridgewood reservoir.
It was agreed by committee members that the community we tried to meet again soon at the Seabee office to further discuss whether recommendations should be made to the New York City Parks, Department and Recreation, stating at the 5.3 million earmarked by the Parks Department for stabilization of the East Gate house at the Ridgid reservoir should be used for other purposes.
The committee discussed that to our knowledge and that of New York City H2O representative in attendance, the Eastern Gate House Building Gate House 27, has a 1,000 square foot footprint committee members unanimously voted in favor of a recommendation to request that Department of Parks and Recreation put the design stabilization of Gate House 27 on hold and work with the community, CB 5 and C B for the community and elected officials to consider using the 5.3 million earmarked for the building stabilization for the following recommendation.
Do, not know a couple, a couple hundred thousand dollars of the design to stabilize the building and use this money to do the causeway between 1& 2, which would show the community that right away.
We would also like to see the money that would be left over because New York, City H2O is basically cleared the basin 1& 2.
You want to do that please, but from here the Transportation Services Committee met in board five office on Tuesday October 22nd.
We, discussed first transport transit services issues right now, we're looking at the work that does not seem to be getting done on the M train structure, the repainting, which was started this summer and was supposed to be through to the end of Fresh Pond Station.
We have our next meeting the 19th of November at 7:30 in the board office like Wyckoff Avenue.
