Every night is a different topic and we're trying to do it here in Queens, five community board, five and also in the Bronx, but we're looking to get some signups tonight just to find out more information about the program.
I will thank all the participants at the next month's meeting after I have a complete total of items collected community Ward 5 is kindly extending drop-offs to their office until this Friday November 15th I Think, all community members who have generalist generously contributed to our drive While.
I brought flowers to show you how much I appreciate your kindness and your service Thank, you, the second speaker under the public forum, Danielle Rivera good evening and I'm here this evening, to advocate for City Council bill, one four one, six, which prioritizes environmental, health and public health by addressing the needs of lessen the amount of single-use plastic waste produced by New York City, single-use plastics, our products that are made to be used once so things like plastic cups, straws utensils and the overconsumption of these products.
In a citywide effort, that's called a swab, their solid waste advisory boards, they're required in the Administrative Code and Queens used to have one and it fell out of favor at a certain point when people retired and moved away and he's been a big supporter of our work to bring this board back into a formal, recognized status by our borough, president We know that Melinda Katz is going to be leaving, and so we need everyone's support to ensure that the next borough president is on board with a swab as soon as possible.
We did a really exciting event at the Ridgewood Bank that, like over 70 to 100 people attended, it was really inspiring and then the grant ended and it's been hard to keep that effort going In a period of asking our council people for discretionary funding, Who'd like to see some money going to a local nonprofit to work on this issue of activating storefronts activating public spaces in collaboration with artists and community people to step up, raise your hand, talk to Bob Holden, make it known that that's an issue you care about and again I'm happy to talk with anyone about it, because it's something I still care about my life to be involved in Thanks Thank.
You very much that'll close the public forum session of board five The next item of business is the chairpersons report and that's me, so I'd like to introduce some people at a present tonight, Gary Giordano and district manager, Kathy O'leary office, associate Jonah Sereno from the borough president.
It improves completion at Community College's by providing funding to helping to help institutions, develop programs to boost degree, completion through academic and financial advising and then the second is the FAFSA translation Act, which would require that FAFSA be translated into multiple languages, Greetings from the Congress women and thank you have a great night, Julio Salazar, congresswoman, Nydia Velazquez office, One of the pieces that I want to share with you guys today is upcoming on the members agenda.
That's how we communicate what about domestic violence victims who are under attack , So, there's so many people that need text to 9 1 and for this city not to have it is ridiculous, especially when, like I said, you heard it first June of next year.
So when you call they'll, know a lot about you already that they'll know that you're hard of hearing or you're deaf, or that you had some domestic violence issues or whatever and they'll, be able to not ask you a million questions which delays response, emergency response, so we're on that as the City Council, but certainly my committee, it's a top priority because I I've spoken to 9-1-1 many times during by the way member and it's not only a mess with high school.
That gravelord is now kind of in every almost every school to a degree, depending on the situation, and I saw it first firsthand as a professor at CUNY, and we saw students that years ago that weren't prepared- Notifying them of the situation and I went to the Queens da and now I've gone to the feds, because I think this needs actually bigger a bigger investigation because we're not only cheating but we're, cheating, the taxpayers and again when these students, when students go on to graduate from, and it's not every student When many students graduate from the public school system, they should be ready for college and or ready for life, or both we're not seeing that most of the students that are graduating A couple of things which I-- and this was a pet peeve of mine as a civic member and certainly a community board member or these cars that play this loud music in many neighborhoods and ours, included in the will of ours that we've seen them all over We finally got a gate, installed, parks farm and did a good job on that It's a dangerous situation not only for the driver of the vehicles.
They can't hear somebody, maybe shouting you know you almost you're going to hit them or a cyclist It is a situation that is kind of dangerous So we put in legislation along with uphold the law and council member of the loan I put in legislation to double the fines and it looks like it's getting a lot of support in the City Council There's many other girls that I have going on animal rights and so forth, but and on the homeless, shelter, I challenge the DHHS proposed homeless, shelters, 7816, Cooper and Gary did a great job.
So I want to thank the community for coming out in force and telling the mayor that we're serious about this fund and I pledge to actually make some more smaller, faith-based, shelters and I'll put my money where my mouth is and fund them.
I'm gonna leave some Flyers on the table right Meeting on December 5th at 7 o'clock, 94 Hale Street at the church I will send out some more information to the community board into the parks committee, especially to make sure that's good for people's calendars on Without them.
Was: The mayor's office of contracts had a hearing with regard to the proposed contract for 7816 Cooper Avenue, for it to be a homeless, shelter, residence and on the dais for the mayor's office of contracts was one man and one woman I think the woman actually worked for the mayor's office of contract services, but not in any very high capacity.
Sixteen Cooper, Avenue and Glendale Queens They want shelters that are much larger than most communities can cope with at a single site and, as I think Demetriou pointed out in the recommendation last month.
It would be fairly reasonable work not to cause any kind of disturbance in the community and that's been fine, but now they want to do regular Even larger sewer installed in juniper Boulevard south going into 71st Street Lutheran Avenue, going under the railroad a 96 inch in diameter sewer and going right down or up the block of Our Lady of Hope school that dead-end block and go into the highway Thank.
It's not really that affordable for young families, so schools like PS, 88, PS, 81 and 68 are suffering from student enrollment, so teachers are excess and the funding is not the same as other schools in cb5 Grover Cleveland has a capacity of 2,000 105 students It's currently operating at 1775 students , we're Maspeth high school, has a capacity of 905 students and currently has almost 1200 students we're hoping at our next meeting in early next year that the members from CEC are there, as well as someone from the superintendent's office.
It was agreed by committee members that the community we tried to meet again soon at the Seabee office to further discuss whether recommendations should be made to the New York City Parks, Department and Recreation, stating at the 5.3 million earmarked by the parks department for stabilization of the East Gate house at the Ridgid reservoir should be used for other purposes.
I think that it is much better to show the community How is spending on money, so we can get use out of the causeway rather than have a building 5.3 million that we're not even going to do anything to for another 10 years, because if it's 5.3 to stabilize it, what is it going to be to actually put a floor in it?
You know when we go out go out in public, where it's expected there's some kind of societal norms that are expected of us and as a member of this board, we sign up for this and we are served on his board, even though we're volunteers at the pleasure of the borough president and so I wanted to speak about that under the old business and I heard, even though the video didn't show it, but the audio showed the Chairman security asking Carmen, Santana, - The whole purpose of being on this board, especially to be civil to each other.
