Welcome to the regularly scheduled meeting of community board five Queens, just a reminder and no one else will be permitted to sign it to speak under the public.
I added starts tonight, so we have Denise Esposito speaking to us on certain training from the New York City office of emergency management.
Every night is a different topic and we're trying to do it here in Queens, five community, board, five and also in the Bronx, but we're looking to get some signups tonight just to find out more information about the program.
The data can be used to inform funding for services like fire, stations, schools, clinics and representation that affect your community.
It's- also used by nonprofits to inform services by businesses to create jobs and even by students for school projects, understanding how the population changes helps us shape.
I will thank all the participants at the next month's meeting after I have a complete total of items collected community Ward 5 is kindly extending drop-offs to their office until this Friday November, 15th I.
Thank you for your time, service, generosity and kindness that everyone on the board and the community has shown me.
And I'm here this evening to advocate for City Council bill, one four, one: six, which prioritizes environmental, health and public health by addressing the needs of lessen the amount of single-use plastic waste produced by New, York City, single-use plastics, our products that are made to be used once so things like plastic, cups, straws utensils and the overconsumption of these products.
Plastic waste is also an issue in New York City, because our garbage is carried out on diesel trucks and these trucks drive about seven point, eight million miles each year, which impacts air pollution.
So for the past, two years, I and a growing group of people have been advocating for our borough to be participating along with Manhattan and Brooklyn in a citywide effort, that's called a swab, their solid waste advisory, Boards, they're required in the Administrative Code and Queens used to have one and it fell out of favor at a certain point, when people retired and moved away.
We know that Melinda Katz is going to be leaving, and so we need everyone's support to ensure that the next borough president is on board with a swab as soon as possible.
Some of you may know that last year, I worked with Ted runs from the Myrtle Avenue bid and Bob Monahan from the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, on a project that was funded.
Who'd like to see some money going to a local nonprofit to work on this issue of activating storefronts activating public spaces in collaboration with artists and community people to step up, raise your hand, talk to Bob Holden, make it known that that's an issue you care about And, again, I'm happy to talk with anyone about it, because it's something I still care about my life to be involved in Thanks.
So, there's so many people that need text to 9 1 and for this city not to have it is ridiculous, especially when, like I said, You heard it first June of next year.
When you call they'll know a lot about you already that they'll know that you're hard of hearing or you're deaf, or that you had some domestic violence issues or whatever And they'll, be able to not ask you a million questions which delays response, emergency response, so we're on that as the City Council, but certainly my committee.
When many students graduate from the public school system, they should be ready for college and or ready for life, or both we're not seeing that most of the students that are graduating A couple of things which I- and this was a pet peeve of mine as a civic member and certainly a community board member or these cars that play this loud music in many neighborhoods and ours, included in the will of ours.
It's a good hit and it looks like it's getting a lot of support in the City Council There's many other girls that I have going on animal rights and so forth, but and on the homeless, shelter, I challenge the DHHS proposed homeless, shelters, 7816 Cooper, they haven't.
Thank that we had very good turnouts, not only at the public cv5 hearing, but also at my town hall meeting at 119, PS 119 and certainly with the demonstration So I want to thank the community for coming out in force and telling the mayor that we're serious about this And We're very happy to take smaller shelters, I've established one already in Ridgewood and alpha-I fund.
Most people nowadays are working on their smartphones and don't have all the technology that is required for that If you're interested in volunteering contact our office, we have some really amazing budget delegates and a lot of really interesting, ideas.
They know that the only game in town to me being provided clean, water, clean, well gas, in this case electric If anybody has any issues with not great going forward or any kind of utility service being provided to them, please let me know Statistics I'll, give you one nationally for every hundred thousand people.
I, will send out some more information to the community board into the parks committee, especially to make sure that's good for people's calendars on Without them.
I think the woman actually worked for the mayor's office of contract services, but not in any very high capacity.
This, is in the matter of a proposed contract between the Department of homeless services, the city in New, York and West had to develop and operate a standalone transitional residents for homeless, single adults of 7816 Cooper Avenue in Glendale Queens New York.
Amendment was enacted late in 2018 the size of the proposed homeless, shelter residents for 200 men is much too large in the community of one and two family homes, the amount of the contract, 61 million eight hundred and eight thousand dollars for five and a half years.
The first item we spoke about was the most recent enrollment numbers and capacity numbers at the public schools within the community board.
It's, currently operating at 1775 students, we're Maspeth high school, has a capacity of 905 students and currently has almost 1200 students , we're hoping at our next meeting in early next year that the members from CEC are there, as well as someone from the superintendent's office that can speak to the data.
Members Carmen had sent an article regarding the homeless students in the New York City public school system.
So on October 16th that we had a Park Service community meeting recommendation use of capital budget funding for the Ridgewood reservoir in Highland Park This project is reportedly in final stage of design.
It was agreed by committee members that the community we tried to meet again soon at the Seabee office to further discuss whether recommendations should be made to the New York City Parks, Department and Recreation, stating at the 5.3 million earmarked by the parks department for stabilization of the East Gate house at the Ridgid reservoir should be used for other purposes.
The committee discussed that to our knowledge and that of New York City h2o representative in attendance, the eastern gate, house, building gate house 27, has a 1,000 square foot footprint committee members unanimously voted in favor of a recommendation to request that Department of Parks and Recreation put the design stabilization of gate house 27 on hold and work with the community, CB 5 and C B for the community and elected officials to consider using the 5.3 million earmarked for the building stabilization for the following recommendation.
Is we would like them to hold the designs that they spent money on somewhere around A couple hundred thousand dollars of the design to stabilize the building and use this money to do the causeway between 1 & 2, which would show the community We got something out of the money rather than stabilize a building for 5.3 million and we're not going to do nothing for it in another 10 years.
We, discussed first transport transit services, issues right now, we're looking at the work that doesn't seem to be getting done on the M train structure, the repainting, which was started this summer and was supposed to be through to the end of Fresh Pond Station.
You know when we go out, go out in public, where it's expected there's some kind of societal norms that are expected of us and as a member of this board, we sign up for this and we are served on his board, even though we're volunteers at the pleasure of the borough president and so I wanted to speak about that under the old business.
