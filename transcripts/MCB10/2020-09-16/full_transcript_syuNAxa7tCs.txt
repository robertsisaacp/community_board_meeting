Good evening, good evening, this is the captioner. How are you well? Thank you thank you for putting me on and I hope you have a good meeting thanks a lot. Thank you good evening. Everyone. This is Deborah Yates Chair education in the libraries we're just going to give people a few more minutes to join before we start the meeting, hey, marquise, hey! How are you thanks? I know you're doing double duty. I appreciate it. Well, he kind of ended a little early, but we have to get into group work for some reason. So, okay, then I'll make sure. Okay we're just waiting for a couple more people, hi Mari, I'm Milan, hello, hey! How are you I'm good thanks, we're just going to give people a couple more minutes? Yes, indeed, okay, c hello, hi hello, who's, this hi. This is neiman Lowell from Assemblymember Inez, Dickens, Office, hi Nina. How are you this is debbie yates. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much. Michigan. Are we going to be starting in the moment? Hi jamila, how you doing Hi Donna, Hi Crystal, trying to see if Tamara's going to call in and Josh? Maybe two more minutes and then we'll get started. Yes, Crystal. Thank you. This okay, we're going to get started good evening. My name is Debra Yates and I'm chair of the education, youth and libraries committee thanks so much for joining us this evening. I just want to start by doing a recap of the event that we had this past Saturday. We did a very successful bookbag giveaway. We had 250 book bags that we gave away that were full of school supplies. We also had multiple partners. We had street corner resources who showed up and they also had gave us about 50 or 60 book bags. Small book bags for younger students, silicon Harlem gave us laptops and thermometers. Harlem park to Park also gave us some book bags to give away, and so it was really a great day. The weather was perfect. The community came out. I really want to thank all the members who really put some muscle into that day. A crystal and and Stephanie held down the registration desk Stephanie's, not here tonight and Josh and marquise and Stanley Gleaton all were muscle people lifting and toting. It was just really a great day also. We do still have we cut off the book bag giveaway after we saw people some people getting back in line, and so we do have 120 book bags that were donated that remain. We still have maybe 100 or so thermometers as well. So the decision that the committee needs to think about and, of course that decision does not necessarily need to be made this evening. Do you want to have another book bag giveaway and when would that be? Would that be this board year, or would we save it for the fall of next year and feel free? If you want to chime in about that? And secondly, we did have two laptops that were donated by silicone Harlem and I do not know if you guys saw the video but the chair, cicely Harris and I came into the board office on Friday and we did a facebook live that and Shatik. I was there to film it. We did. A facebook live raffle of the two laptops, but I'm here to tell you neither person was eligible to win, so we still have those two laptops, so we need to do another raffle, and so there were 20 people who registered for the raffle. So we probably should just take those 18 names and raffle it off to those 18 people. What I'm going to do, though, before we do, that, is that I'm going to send out an email to those 18 people re, stressing the quali the qualifications for winning the laptop so that they, even though, when Juanita sent out the link to our district, one of the women one of the winners lived in Queens and the other person lived in lower Manhattan and they were like oops. So you know we still have those two laptops, so that was really a great event. I would really like to hear from some of the people that were there Saturday about your thoughts, do not speak at once. Hey! I just want to continue to commend you Debra. I thought it was an excellent event. I think it was obviously well needed in our community, and I think it also gave our community a boost. You know anytime you're, doing something positive gives the community a boost to come out and see each other, and just you know I just love seeing when the board comes together, like that you did a wonderful job. I think we definitely should give out the laptops. If you have 18 more names, definitely should you know try that you know raffle again, yes, and as far as giving out the book bags, I think you had sent out an email saying, should we, you know, reserve some for next next time it could be even next school year. I do not know being that school is going to be starting in about. I do not know six days unless we do. You know something after school has started. I do not know if we do it again that soon or if we wait until you know, I wait a little like in the middle of the school year or something like that. I do not know. Okay, all right. Anybody else. Thanks Mario appreciate that crystal what about christmastime? Can you guys keep crystal? Is it my? No? So it's not my internet. I know my internet can be a little shady, sometimes no yeah. It is difficult to hear her. It's a lot of breaking you're breaking up. Sorry, so those are the questions that Mary Mari mentioned. Those are the questions. I would just really like to say that Harlem was a buzz on Saturday. While we did, I think, an event that was really great Senator Brian Benjamin did an awesome even as well. I was not able to go over there after our event, because I had a conflict but from all accounts and from the videos and the photos I've seen he did an absolutely excellent event, giving out much needed items that are not normally given out like pampers. So I think that Saturday was a good day for the Harlem community as a whole and so we'll work it out as far as the book bags they won't spoil. I will say, though, that the 120 or so book bags that we have remaining do not have school supplies in them. So I need to work to and if anybody knows anybody to get some supplies donated to go inside of those 120 bags, because the bag, the 250 bags that we gave away on Saturday, were full of school supplies, including calculators and pens and pencils and highlighters and notebooks, and that kind of thing. So I hope that it's a bag that will be useful to the people who were there to collect them on Saturday. Can I just in terms of whether or not to give them out this school year that it might still make sense being that school a lot of schools are doing blended learning, so a lot of young people are not necessarily starting in person when you would need a book bag right now they might be starting closer to October November. So in this case, for this year it might make sense to do another. One and people might actually need those book bags or supplies later on in the fall. Because of the blended learning models I mean there definitely is an argument to be made. We could do something around like maybe the how November or something late October November, but I would just say that I'm okay either way, except that, if we're going to give the book back out, I think that we should not give it out if we do not have no school supplies to put inside them, and so I think that's for me, that's the determining factor we can get somebody to donate school supplies. That'll go inside those bags. I do not want to just give students empty book bags. I mean we could I mean again it depends on what the committee decides. Hi Milan. What did you think? I would like to welcome Milan reed. She is a new member to our committee. She came on the board in the spring and we all had an opportunity to meet her on Saturday since everything's been done via zoom. You know we have not met the board members in person and so she came out and she was very helpful. So welcome and I'd like to hear your thoughts yeah, I loved it. Hi everyone excited to be on the board. I thought it was a great event. We had a great turnout. People wanted more than one bag. I think the bags were filled with great supplies for children. I think having the thermometers was also great in temperature readers. So, overall it was a great community event and was my first one, and so I was excited to be there and support you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody else before we move on okay. Well, then we're going to move on we're going to sort of like I'm going to. I spoke to yes Deborah. I have to have you hi. How are you I'm not sorry committed? Thank you. I was thinking, maybe a homeless shelter with children. If we have one in our neighborhood that we could probably see about donating the bags there, because that might be some place where they're needed not necessarily with supplies, but it just may be needed for the children that are there, because we have a lot of children in our community in our district that live in homeless, shelters that are attending our school. So that was just the thought that I had and about the and the lab talks. I think if you had 18 people, they did not qualify any of them. We might want to open it up to a little bit wider range of people, and you know just specify what the qualifications are, so that they're really clear and they do not just apply knowing that they're not eligible. That was just the thought that I had thanks: Deborah. Okay, oh fine! Thank you Donna! Just to clarify we had about 20 people who registered of the 20. We did the raffle and we chose two names. Those two people are the people who have are disqualified. I do not know about the other 18, I'm going to send out an email to those 18 people giving them what it. What you need to you know what are the qualifications to win the laptops and see who on that list, still qualifies and wait for them to get back to me before we have the next raffle. Oh, and so that's right, that's what I that's! What I'm going to do? That sounds fair. That sounds reasonable. Thank you. I just misunderstood. Okay, no, that's! Okay! That's okay! I clarified, but I do want to stress, though, that when the when Juanita sent the link out, she was very clear about what the qualifications were. She was very clear about what the qualifications were. So maybe people did not read. It just saw a free, laptop and said I do not know what it was, but I'm going to I'm going to send that email out and see what we get back hi. I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work on this event. I do believe that we should go ahead and do another raffle with the other 18 names. So let me know when you want to meet up at the office, so we can do that again. But, okay, I did sister Aisha and she said that you were such to work with that. She's like this is one of the main reasons why she loves community board 10. So much and she loves you so I saw her on Sunday morning and she just could not stop seeing your praises. So thank you. For this event, it was really powerful and I think I saw a couple people in the community later on that day and they wanted us to partner, so we might have some future part coming up, so that would be awesome and we did have great partners. You know, as I mentioned, silicone Harlem Holland, Parker, Park, Street, Corner, Resources, Jay's, Emblem, Health came out and just wanted to say that the connection I got with Emblem Health was from Charles Johnson and they are ready to partner with us, with whatever we want to do, they will bring tables tend to whatever we need, so that was really a great connection. We're going to move. If there's, if there's no other comments on that topic, we're going to move on to a back to school, update, I'm going to ask Marquis Harrison, who is a member of our committee and is also first vice, chair of the board, to give us a update on back to school thanks marquis. So I can only you know. I spoke with Deborah just giving you brief insight, not necessarily like in Dolby all right, because I do not speak for the DOE, but an employee of the DOE, and then I worked for the uft. So just you know, I've explained to deborah that currently in district five, at least and for my knowledge of district five and just acrosss the city, you know we have run into some hiccups in regards to opening. Schools are scheduled to really start outreach starting tomorrow, so 21st is Monday where schools would actually begin blended learning, which is that some students would be coming in. You know having a rotation of schedule, but really the outreach is supposed to be at least one hour over the next three days to students to acclimate them to the virtual process, because everyone will have some remote learning, no matter what, whether they're going into a build. You know going into a building or not district, five, quite a number of students or schools. I think we might be at least more than a third of parents who have opted for total remote. I do not think we're quite at a half for just this district. Some schools in the district are maybe approaching that, but most of the schools is probably at a third for district five, where they'll be remote completely. So what you have is, though, teachers who there are a good amount of teachers in district five that qualify for being totally remote, which caused a staffing problem for some of the schools in the district. In regards to, if you have three- fourths of your students who have opted to come into the building at least two to three days a week and you have half of your staff out the building, there are contractual confinements that prevent teachers from like being in the class all day and because teachers are also no matter who the teacher is are going to be working with both remote students and students inside the building. Some principals are having real staffing issues, and so the principals Union did make that very clear to the city this week that they needed that we are really short ins to have in school instruction about ten thousand teachers, because, right as of now 16,000 teachers were approved for totally remote and it's going up by the day, because there was also no date. Basically, teachers are filing, as of today, still to be totally remote based upon medical accommodations right. So teachers are hunting for letters and they're. Getting these letters right if they are, do not want to put their health and their family at risk and there's many reasons why they do not want to do that. And so. And what has happened is that you had teachers go into schools and they saw the conditions. There were a lot of teachers who were willing to work despite them having a medical condition that would allow them to be remote, but when they went into these schools, seeing the lack of PPE, perhaps or sometimes, though, just the ventilation problems. Some teachers have gone ahead and filed and that's why you've also had an influx of teachers filing to be completely remote right. So what that does is cause a major staffing problem, because if a school principals had to assess with the DOE, how many students can be in a school in a given day, so, for instance, I'll give I'll use my own school, for instance, was we decided that 200 students could be in the building on it on a given day, so that really allowed us to bring in a grade per day. However, that was with the assumption at that time that 20 teachers had filed for accommodations that have been approved, we're now up to 40, something that takes away completely, that even if we thought 200 students, you have to have the manpower for that right. So if you have now 40 something teachers, so you have way less teachers again, because you have to spread them out where there's nine to ten students in a class and they're not moving. So you have to be able to rotate teachers in for all these things, while also giving them their appropriate breaks. Right because some of these teachers will still be going into a room to do online instruction for the students who are completely remote. So it just creates a major staffing issue that right now we're still short. The DOE has committed to additional said that they will find 2,000 additional teachers. I do not know where, but they will find 2,000 teachers by Monday, but that is not. That is far short of the 10,000 that the principal's union has asked for. So the principal's union did make a public statement yesterday saying that they just do not see how this is going to work, because a lot of principals are overly stressed with how they're going to actually staff these buildings and what you're going to have in a lot of schools is that when there's, when your children only in some schools but in district 5, I would expect honestly in district 5 that you're going to have a lot of students coming reporting to school and going straight to their laptops. Because of the confusion, there's not going to be much. You know there might be some extra support in these in the schools, but there's going to be a lot in the high school level, absolutely expect students to be totally on laptops if they're in the building, but for elementary there might be a little bit more flexibility because you can have you know you can have some teacher, do certain things with them and do like additional learning. But a lot of the learning will be completely on the computer, which begs the question: is that why did not New York City Department of Education, perhaps just prepare for totally remote learning to help the teachers actually prepare for that level of instruction, because there's still a lot of problems with just even providing that proper instruction remotely? So you know get ready for Monday and, I would say, look out, but I think what needs to be is that in this community board should be. I would encourage is that we need to have our air to the ground to see what's really happening in schools. How do parents feel like do they feel that their students are getting instruction or appropriate instruction? Because there really is questions as to the professional development and, what's being offered to support teachers and students remotely textbook resources, all types of things you know they cut teachers choice was also cut right, so this allowed teachers choices 250 that teachers received to go ahead and buy equipment and things outside of their in their money of their budget of the school to help support. Given that a lot of teachers are working remote, they want to actually buy a lot more to help them with their instruction. Well I mean they will still do that most likely, but with teachers choice being cut, which is a city funded thing in the city budget. That money is not there, so they can no longer count on that reimbursement. So you know that people are going to be extra tight and then with the lack of textbook resources in some schools or electronic textbook resources. These are all questions that we really have to or have to have our ear out to see what are our schools missing and need in need of, because I think that it will allow us as a board to kind of formulate- and you know, endeavor. We were talking about just writing a lot like. We want to be real advocates for our students and our and our parents and our community and us and our teachers. You know what I'm saying, and so what do we really need, but I think we won't really know until Monday and you know next week. I would encourage everyone to kind of like put their air out to just see what is going on in the schools thanks a lot for that marquis and yes, Marquis and I had been working on a letter of support for the school system and then school was pushed back, and so we are still looking at it and seeing how we can make sure that it reflects what we think the community needs, and I just want to add that I did reach out to superintendents to try to get their feedback. And my question is was is what is it that they see as the major challenges of reopening school? So hopefully I will get some feedback in the near. I mean I know they're busy, so you know they're, I'm sure they're running around juggling trying to do all kinds of things: no money, no teachers, it's got to be a zoo, and so I do not. I do not envy any of of people working in education, but I also believe that I also agree with Marquis about let's keep our ear to the ground regarding this school year. If we know parents that have kids, let's be an abbey, let's be an advocate for them and and listen to them and let's bring it back to the board and see what we can do to help and it does anybody have any questions from marquise. Yes, this is marty montz as a mom of three girls who are going to public school here in New, York City. Every time I get on one of these calls- and I hear the updates it seems like it's just- the schools are not really prepared in so many respects. I've heard parents say that I mean other parents say that the on school learning or the online learning is it has its challenges because, as we know, the broadband situations, you know, I think you know what was mentioned even earlier today by Ms Gill on the call regarding so many of our students being in homeless facilities. You know there's a lot of challenges around this and concern, and I really had hoped that closer to the date that school is supposed to be reopening that there would be some things that would be smoothed out and figured out. I'm thinking marquise that they're going to be pulling teachers from the reserve that you know that they have these. You know reserved teachers. There was an article recently about the rubber rooms. You know that I've never understood those rubber rooms, but you know they claim that there's going to be teachers that are you know that they may be on reserve. So I also am wondering where they're going to pull teachers from and for your school specifically, if 200 students can be in the building, and then you figured out the ratio for the rest of staff and teachers then, and then, if that's not compatible with having enough teachers in the classrooms, I'm really wondering how that ratio works out or how that you know equation works out because yeah we still have to be able to provide quality education to the students, and so you know I saw that most parents are saying that they would. Rather, according to a recent article, there was something that said that they would rather have. There was more parents who want to do the online learning more so than in class learning, and I can understand that after hearing call after call where it just sounds like the ventilation issues and all the other aspects may not be as safe, but I guess I'm throwing back to you. Do you think that the teachers will come from a reserve and are they going to? And I keep saying you know with the teachers once they prepared once they've? You know prepared the classrooms or the schools for the students. Would they not allow the parents to also know what the changes have been? You know be, you know advised and aware of policies and procedures. You know like, as far as temperatures taking every day how they want their children to you know be protected throughout the day and so forth. Would they not do a walk through before school, for parents either virtually or in person? You know those are all the questions I ask myself, so I can answer some of those questions for the parents. I mean schools should be updating them on policies, but those will be through virtual meetings, doubtful walkthroughs, no, because they want to limit the contact of people in the buildings and then and things like that. Also people entering build all school buildings should have their temperature checked and or have to fill out. It's voluntary, though I understand, or they have to have a survey completed from the department of education that they have to show proof of, and that you know a questionnaire. Excuse me not a survey questionnaire about their. You know where they're coming from whether they've been so on and so forth. I there are a lot of questions that are that are still unanswered. This, the apps, the atr we call it absent teacher reserve pool, has generally shrunk. There's also been an influx of retirements over the last some over this summer, and then you have again people. These are just teachers who are not fully placed at a school building who are also applying for accommodation, so the amount of teachers who are here that they have available right now to spread out and of that of that 2000 they were talking about. Where again principals would need ten thousand they're saying it's about a hundred or two hundred. You know it's not like massive, so they're talking about also pulling in substitutes, but all that means is again an atr it should an apps teacher reserve can be put at any school and what that means is it's just a body in front of a room right, because it could be a gym teacher. It could be a math teacher covering anything at the end of the day for high school students, especially two we're going to have major problems is that high school programming is individualized right, based upon what students have and what they've qualified for so because we're limiting contact in rooms, you can't necessarily program 10 students and high school students. They do not necessarily have all the same classes. Excuse me Marquise Dan! Thank you Dan, oh, so, when these high school students are programmed they're going to be programmed just for a room, and that's it really right so they'll be programmed. Let's say these ten. Ninth- these ninth graders, ten ninth graders into this room, you're going to socially distance you're, going to pull out your laptop because this ninth grader here might be in global. This one here might be us history. This one here might be taking earth science, so you can't necessarily bring in teachers to teach all those different subjects because you may not even have well. You know you may have all your history teachers who have accommodations so they're, going to be doing that history automatically online. So there's a huge programming part that, let's just say, like I'm, a teacher who's supposed to be teaching and supposed to be reaching out to students. I have no class rosters. I have no idea what I'm even I have not been given a program of what I'm teaching yet, and it's not that I norm in normal circumstances. If it's a regular school year, we would follow what we call grievances. We're not doing that. Necessarily because I know the principal just does not even have the logistical means to actually put it together right now, she's literally trying to figure everything out by the minute and tonight they're having parent meetings acrosss the city with schools where principals are telling the parents what it's supposed to look like when they're really just trying to piece it together at the moment. Yeah. I hear you because, like I've been on those calls- and it sounds like they're kind of like trying to feel through- it seems like there are certain levels that know more information but they're not disseminating it yet, probably because they're trying to figure out how this is going to go and then also as a parent. You know you like to develop relationships with your with your child's teacher at least know the teacher and know what the curriculum is going to be throughout the year, so that you can help guide them through it throughout the year, so they can be successful as possible. So I'm yeah. I, as I hear listen to you and I read these articles and I sit on the other calls. I tend to come up with a lot more questions, so I think I submitted some. Some of my you know concerns as a parent and for the for the for the letter that you guys are creating, and I think that you know continuing, like you said to have our ear out in the community to the ground to hear what our parents are saying. Is there a way that we can send like an e- blast survey to our parents and maybe pull you know, poll them in some kind of way and see you know out of what uft is thinking and so forth? What our on our district needs as we develop our district needs statement. What our district needs are, I think, that's part of the process. Just hearing from you know. Parents can we do that that I think that question would be for Deborah, but just to I will say, though, teachers are still expected to provide. You know course outlines and things of that nature. That part can still happen. That's just going to be virtually more or less it's just a matter of like sometimes that this, if they're, if you're, if your child has opted into both in school and remote instruction, it could be very hard because if you have a totally remote teacher, that teacher is not the teacher who's going to be servicing that student in the building when they're there, but we are we're going to still hold teachers to high standards and our students to high standards as much as possible. So we're going to have you know they should be still providing you with a scope and sequence of what is going to be going on and so on and so forth. I'm doing that same thing for any class that I teach, but mostly you know, operating in a virtual world. You know, and so that's what should be expected, but not that it should not happen. I have a question. I just wonder if we are aware of any places that are helping parents, so we hear a lot in terms of like donations and supplies. It tends to be towards the older youth like high school Middle School, but I so I have one in about to go to kindergarten and one in a therapeutic pre- k and a lot of the talk that I'm having with parents is just you know, for these little kids, it's not it's not calculators and pencils. It's paint supplies it's play-, doh, it's construction paper. It's all the things that the Department of education supplies when your kid goes to school, but now we're expected to have all of those sort of resources and they're consumable. So it's not like a calculator. You buy one calculator and you're done, but they're things that every week and every month parents are going to have to continue to purchase and folks, just do not. You know, given the pandemic and even without the pandemic simply do not have the resources to buy. You know, boxes of feathers and buttons and all the things that you would do in a kindergarten class that they're expecting families to have at home. For these virtual sessions is there any where that we know that is helping parents with these sort of things, and is that something that the board could look into or be a part of I? So I just know that I know the spring. There was more resources for that, like schools for kent, like the lower grades like kindergarten, pre- k, I know that some teachers did many schools, especially five. They basically the supplies that they had in school. They gave out to the students. I have not heard any plan, as of yet from the department of education about disseminating those type of materials to like pre- k 3-K. I have no clue about that and I think that's something that maybe the board we can. You know, look into further, and I certainly will ask about that. If there was money you know, there's also we're going into a year, that's different with so many budget cuts. So I do not know if the DOE is doing that. There is also always money set aside for students in temporary housing in schools. That will have a little bit more resources for those students that where they could actually take and get certain things like that, but I'm not sure about overall if they were doing that for just in general for those students overall, you know I have not heard of anything either. I know that they're supposed to be having these bridges spaces, which they still have not seen anything definitive about where those going to be for kids, from k through eighth grade places where they can be on the days where they're not physically inside a classroom, supposedly Cbo's, but when they send out the notices, they're still saying here's the link to sign up there's been no list, that's been sent out as to where these places are or where what parents can do to sign up for these spaces and what exactly it's going to entail. Is it just like a daycare kind of thing where your kids come and sit, or whether or there's going to be someone there? That's going to help with instruction. So, there's still a lot of questions to Marquis's point about this school year that are totally completely and unanswered and as with everything else, you know our communities are going to be the it's going to be the community, that's going to suffer the most yeah. You know, and I know that you know marquise works in district schools. I do not want to put Dan Clark on the spot, but Dan do you have anything to say about our charter school system in Harlem? I guess not, so I guess he has nothing to say. Does anyone have any questions from our keys or any comments before Debbie? I'm? So sorry, I'm just I'm in the great city of Camden and that's what the noise is about. As far as I know, the charge with the ones that I'm connected to, I kind of feel feeling their way as well. There's some a lot of the same issues that I heard my case talk about other or the ones that they'll have, and I think the ratio- wise, there's more virtual learning for some reason, at least in the school that I'm familiar with in Harlem, then from what I hear again at the district schools and public schools did someone else, have a comment: Donna question: Okay Donna Keith: have they figured out who's going to be taking the temperature, because I know they may have said something about nurses? But I know that that's not even a conversation anymore so who in the school are they going to be expecting to take these temperatures of these people that are walking into the building? Is it the guards in the front? So that's a great question. There's been a lot of back and forth with collective bargaining units about these things, so when a guest comes into the building- or you know even for staff, it's going to be the school safety agents that are actually there to take temperatures that that's not necessarily the same for students. If the for students, the does actually say that the temperature check is supposed to be random, some schools are making decisions to do it completely for everyone based upon manpower, so they'll have used school aides and others to kind of, and more maybe, administrative administrators to be on site to kind of take their temperatures. But right now we're being told school safety agents are going to be the enforcer as they are. The ones who are you know in charge of letting people into the school building and maintaining it so school safety agents will be doing it. That's interesting, they're recording it so, but my what I'm again, what I was telling you is that it's slightly optional too, for the temperature check is that you can do this the questionnaire and show proof of the questionnaire via like your phone, that they have on the I guess the DOE site. I have not seen the question here, but I know that they have a questionnaire where you can come in and show you complete the questionnaire or you can get your temperature check and they will record that so they do not have to have their temperature checked. If a teacher felt like I do not want my temperature check, then they would have to show that they filled out the questionnaire for that day. I've also seen some of these, that is, I've, also seen some of these employment businesses. You know that have been retrofitted for profit, 19 safety regulations. They have automated on temperature check like some kind of like computerized device. That's like above the head. So when you walk into the door it like automatically can scan. If you're such a certain distance, you can see what your temperature is and then you can just you know, go in so that's a concept that can be utilized as well, that I do not know if they're considering that or not at all, but I also think that they need to have adequate medical staff on you know on the premises. There just seems to be a lot of you know. Like you said, a checklist. There seems to be a lot of things, to check, to develop a checklist and check off to make sure that we are fully prepared for students to, and teachers and all you know, staff and administration to be re- entered into the school. So I'm I have my fingers, I'm hoping that you know our school system can get it together, because I think parents are, you, know, eager for their children to have quality education, and I think that our teachers, you know really want to continue to you, know, deliver results and to Jamilah Clark's question. You know. I know that, as my mother was a teacher, she would often go in her own pocket, and I know teachers do that today they go into their own pockets and purchase their own school supplies because they just can't wait on. You know the regulations and all of that to catch up with what they want to do for their students as far as learning capacities and so and learning plans. So I do not know I'm hoping that we can find out what our needs are too, specifically even for district 5, because we know that our district had needs before this and where we can, as a board, fill in the gaps. I'd like to see that come to fruition, thanks Mary Marie Marquis. I personally am very worried that our schools were already. You know not 100 in our neighborhoods before this we're always asking for services and things white boards laptops whatever and now it just seems as if we're behind the eight ball, that everything is reactionary but we're running the ketchup based on I mean what marquise delivered is not the first time. I heard that and then Dan echoed it and I'm not confident at all. I mean you listen to the chancellor and everything sounds rosy. You know we're doing this, we're doing that. We're doing this and clearly, when you talk to people on the ground, it's like listening to the generals, give a speech and then talking to the soldiers that are on the front lines fighting the war, it's a different story, totally about where they are and how they are prepared, and it just it just worries me that our kids are now they're already a half a year behind having been sent home in March and now will they now be a whole year and a half behind, and we all know that some of our kids will never catch up. This could be the end for some of them. They could find other things to get involved in to keep them busy, because this is not working and it's not organized, and you know, there's always the pull of something else going on that's more exciting. So we're going to we're going to make sure that this state that we continue to talk about this, and I look to all of you to let us know as community members and parents what's going on with the parents in our community Janella. Did you have something to say just to add on to what you were saying? I guess from a different perspective, though, like one of I agree, I worry about all those things, but I also worry that, because our communities, in terms of just social economic status, we're on the bottom of the totem pole, that a lot of parents do not have the option to actually make the choice as to whether or not they want to do remote or in person like they're, sending their kids into a situation that they do not feel is safe or comfortable because they have to work outside of the home right. So those of us that have the option to work at home for a period of time until at least until January or until this is figured out or have flexible jobs. We can then say: okay, I think it's safe. I want my child to go, or I do not, and I want them to do remote, but a lot of our parents can't even do the remote only option because they can't be home with their children to do remote only so they're relying on the blended learning days, and then these other centers, which to me, like you, said, we've had issues with our school buildings and infrastructure pre- covered so now, when they're talking about the only way that the people in the buildings are safe is that they have proper ventilation, but we've never had proper ventilation in these schools. You know, we've never had a lot of the things that they're saying are required. Now, with this pandemic, you know, is not in these buildings and so that for the safety and health of our children in our communities. That worries me too, along with them falling behind academically. Absolutely and the fact that a lot of our schools are, you know, used a lot of our buildings. Have so many schools in them is another problem as well as we all know that yeah those centers are out there but they're. You know we have a million students in our in the school system and they're talking about starting out with 10,000 spaces, and so we also know that a lot of these kids will be left home alone, which is going to mean that there's going to be some accidents. Some things are going to happen. You know, because if a kid is eight or nine and there's one smaller, that parent is going to say, listen, you stay home, you do not open the door, you do not touch nothing. There's a sandwich in the refrigerator and I'll, be home at five and kids. Do not listen or they're going to be home alone, which means they're, not learning, and some kids do thrive in this. In this you know in this type of learning, but I've heard from a lot of parents who have said that their kids do not learn well like this, and so it's definitely a challenge. It's definitely a challenge, and so we're just really going to have to stay. On top of that, thank you guys so much for all of that. The next thing on the agenda is district needs Josh, who I hoped would be on the call by now, but he said that he was working. Late is going to be working on the district, going to sort of be organizing district needs for the board, but also we know that he's also a member of the education committee. I did send an email out to the committee, the education committee asking for people who would be interested in sort of helping him out or being the representatives from Education Committee, and I did hear from from Mari from Stephanie and from Tamara, which thank you all so much for volunteering to do this, and so we're going to have to make sure that we bring in people like marquis and whatever information that I get back from Cec, 3 and cc5 and from the superintendents, and we need to talk to people in our district as well to make sure that whatever needs statement that we put forth actually reflects of what those needs are and to your question earlier mari about whether or not we could send out some kind of questionnaire. I think you know we do not, of course, have everyone's email address, and so I think that the really the only way we could do it is via the e- blast that we send out and hope that people who will pass it on to people that they know should see it and also maybe to post it to our social media outlets so that they could be responses that way as well. I know the I believe the district needs to do the end of October, I think yeah. So we are also on a short schedule, but Josh seems to be on top of things and he's going to he hopes, sending out emails and holding meetings, and hopefully that's going to get done in a great time frame. Moving on, I did want to sort of talk about our board year and what that's going to look like, I think, a lot of it is going to be led by Covid-19 and what's going on in our schools, because I do think that we need to put all of our energy towards supporting parents and students this school year, and I think that it should not be limited to the day that we meet that our committee meets. I think that we should, if something comes up, we should send it out and send it to send an email out to the committee, and I know that if Shatik or Juanita hears anything or if anybody reaches out to them, I know that they will pass that on to us and we will follow up. I just want to ask if anyone on the call that has not spoken has any input at this time. Yes, hello, yes, identify yourself. Yes, I'm Nina, nobody, I'm the community liaison for Assembly member Inez Dickens. I have hi. How are you thank you again for making sales available and allowing me to be on the call? There's been a lot of great information shared and I definitely wanted to add in the tidbit. I am also a mother of two. I have a fourth grader and an eighth grader, and I definitely echo a lot of the concerns that were spoken here tonight. Most importantly, the comment about the kids possibly falling behind that became a big issue with my son, who was when Kobe hit in the school shut down was rounding at the end of his seventh grade year and his challenge was being able to keep up with five different classes of the rigorous schedule for each class once it started going fully remote and the support, unfortunately, being that everything happened so quickly, just was not there when he started to fall behind and he got very frustrated and I'm also, as you know, with the assembly member, I was working fully remotely from home at that time, so I'm just trying to balance working from home as well as trying to help him now that our office has reopened partially for employees. Only I'm working fully from the office now where he and his sister will be doing school completely. Remote, so I am very concerned about his rigorous 8th grade works load that he's going to get in the start of school and how the school system is planning to be able to help the kids that do start to fall behind, because other parents of his friends have echoed the same concern to me, because their kids also started to fall behind at the end of the you know the last school year. So if anyone has any information as to what they may have heard as to what does plan is with helping any students that are struggling with trying to keep up with a high level, you know schedule, as you said, when parents are not there and have to be at work all day and I'm fortunate enough to have someone that will be there with my children. But she is my mom, so she's an older lady. So the school work for her is like. Okay, wait till your mom gets home or wait till your dad gets home, and you know he tries to email his teacher. So you have to wait for emails to come back because the teacher is not physically sitting there with him. So I'm very concerned about that and any information as to how you know d.o.e plans to really handle that curve would be greatly appreciated to me. Have they said anything to you about having providing extra help for your students for your for your for your children? Well, they did, but most of it was something of course, that's open to everybody, which is mostly again through email, and you know, speak to your guidance counselor. But as it was, you know, said a few minutes ago. There are a lot of kids that are going to start to try to keep up with these classes. So these resources and these teachers are already stretched so they're going to have to try to keep up with the number of students that may start to fall behind and are sending them emails. And I do not understand this, or can you explain that and they have to respond? You know, because there now they have a class of 29:30 students remotely sending them emails back and forth. But I do not understand this. I do not understand that and it just sounds overwhelming. So, as I heard someone say earlier, and I definitely would shaking my head as I do not envy anybody's school system right now, because this sounds like it's going to be a great daunting task and, as I said as a mom, I'm just looking for any resource, I can to be able to give my son that level of comfort that he you know if he does start to struggle a little bit, that there are resources out there that he can lean on to try to help him in the election that I'm not there because being at work. You can't answer every phone call well mom. What about this and mom? Do you know about this? So you know I'm not completely 100 available to him. I try to do, of course, as a mom, the best that I can, but I'm looking for any resources I can maybe tutors. I do not know if I heard really too much about that. It's going to be tutors available for the kids that may start to struggle and grades. Take a little bit of a dip once school starts and how many tutors per school per district. So that's just the information that I'm seeking to, as I said, have that extra level of support you know as a working mom. Thank you so much for that. We definitely wait a minute. Thank you so much for that Nina and we definitely will try to follow up before you speak. Mello Crystal's their hand up for a minute and then we'll go to you. Okay crystal. What did you have to say? Okay, I know people are hurting so great information, but it's very hard to hear her crystal. Can you put that information? I did hear that you said there were like 35 branches open that you do have resources, but you were kind of breaking up. Can you put that information in the chat, so everybody can see it? Okay, thank you. Can you put just put that information in the chat? Okay, thanks so much thanks, Jamila! I was actually going to refer to crystal for this, but I was going to say that I know in some of my other programs: we've been helping, parents find resources and a lot of the tutoring resources we were able to find were through the New York public library, virtual tutoring, and I know we can't hear crystal so. I do not know if she has any information about that, but I can share. I think what we've found. I have to go back to my resource coordinator, but the person was doing a lot of research about virtual sort of academic supports, and one of the things that came up on the list was virtual tutoring through New York, public library, sure maybe we can put. If you send that information to me, I can put together a list based on what you have and what crystal has and then maybe we can send it into the board office in the board. He blasts that out to the community and put it on our social media thanks for that, jamella yeah. So much I appreciate it. Thank you, yeah sure. Anyone else before we move on going once going twice gone and so any announcements hearing none does anyone else have anything they'd like to add. If not, we can adjourn, I think we have our marching papers. I think what we're mostly going to be concerned about this year is our students and our parents in our community to make sure that if we find that there's something that they need, we can try to find those resources for them and we can get that information out well. If nobody else has anything else to add, I'm going to adjourn this meeting at 7:38 and thank all of you for joining us tonight and please feel free to contact us via the board office or and then we'll definitely get back to you good night. Thank you very much for hosting this meeting and everybody please have a safe day and have a good evening. Likewise, yes, we're going to get that information over to you as soon as we I put it together. Okay, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I think, what's up[ _ _] kid, no problem good night.
