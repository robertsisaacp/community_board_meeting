We did have two laptops that were donated by silicone Harlem , do not know if you guys saw the video, but the chair, cicely, Harris and I came into the board office on Friday So we need to do another raffle, and so there were 20 people who registered for the raffle.
Is that I'm going to send out an email to those 18 people re, stressing the quali the qualifications for winning the laptop so that they, even though, when Juanita sent out the link to our district, one of the women one of the winners lived in Queens and the other person lived in lower Manhattan and they were like oops.
So I need to work to, and if anybody knows anybody to get some supplies donated to go inside of those 120 bags, because the bag, the 250 bags that we gave away on Saturday, were full of school supplies, including calculators and pens and pencils and highlighters and notebooks, and that kind of thing.
Maybe the how November or something late, October November, but I would just say that I'm, okay, either way, Except that, if we're going to give the book back, out, I think that we should not give it out if we do not have no school supplies to put inside them, and so I.
I, do not know about the other 18, I'm going to send out an email to those 18 people giving them So. Maybe people did not read.
Some principals are having real staffing, issues, and so the principals Union did make that very clear to the city this week that they needed that we are really short ins to have in school instruction about ten thousand teachers, because, right.
There were a lot of teachers who were willing to work despite them having a medical condition that would allow them to be remote, but when they went into these schools, seeing the lack of PPE, perhaps or sometimes, though, just the ventilation, problems.
Right, because some of these teachers will still be going into a room to do online instruction for the students who are completely remote.
But there's going to be a lot in the high school level, absolutely expect students to be totally on laptops if they're in the building, but for elementary there might be a little bit more flexibility.
A lot of the learning will be completely on the computer, which begs the question: is that why did not New York City Department of Education, perhaps just prepare for totally remote learning to help the teachers actually prepare for that level of instruction, because there's still a lot of problems with just even providing that proper instruction, remotely?
You know that people are going to be extra tight and then, with the lack of textbook resources in some schools or electronic textbook.
And, yes, Marquis and I had been working on a letter of support for the school system and then school was pushed back, And, so we are still looking at it and seeing how we can make sure that it reflects what we think the community needs, and I just want to add that I did reach out to superintendents to try to get their feedback.
I'm thinking marquise that they're going to be pulling teachers from the reserve that you know that they have these.
If 200 students can be in the building, and then you figured out the ratio for the rest of staff and teachers then, And then, if that's not compatible with having enough teachers in the classrooms, I'm, really wondering how that ratio works out or how that you know equation works out because yeah we still have to be able to provide quality education to the students, and There was more parents who want to do the online learning more so than in class.
It could be a math teacher covering anything at the end of the day for high school students, especially two we're going to have major problems.
There's more virtual learning for some reason, at least in the school that I'm familiar with in Harlem, then from what I hear again at the district schools and public schools Have, they figured out who's going to be taking the temperature, because I know they may have said something about nurses?
But I know that that's not even a conversation anymore so who in the school are they going to be expecting to take these temperatures of these people that are walking into the building?
You know, even for staff, it's going to be the school safety agents that are actually there to take temperatures that that's not necessarily the same for students.
There seems to be a lot of things, to check, to develop a checklist and check off to make sure that we are fully prepared for students, to, and teachers and all you know, staff and administration to be re- entered into the school.
Though, like one of I agree, I worry about all those things, but I also worry that, because our communities, in terms of just social economic status, we're on the bottom of the totem pole, that a lot of parents do not have the option to actually make the choice as to whether or not they want to do remote or in person like they're, sending their kids into a situation that they do not feel is safe or comfortable because they have to work outside of the home.
Covid-19 And. What's going on in our schools, because I do think that we need to put all of our energy towards supporting parents and students this school, year, And I think that it should not be limited to the day that we meet that our committee meets.
If anyone has any information as to what they may have heard as to what does plan is with helping any students that are struggling with trying to keep up with a high level, you know schedule, as you said, when parents are not there and have to be at work all day , so she's an older, lady.
These resources and these teachers are already stretched, so they're going to have to try to keep up with the number of students that may start to fall behind and are sending them emails.
Think what we're mostly going to be concerned about this year is our students and our parents in our community to make sure that if we find that there's something that they need, we can try to find those resources for them and we can get that information out.
