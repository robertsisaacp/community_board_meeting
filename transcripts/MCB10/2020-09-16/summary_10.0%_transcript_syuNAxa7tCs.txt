We did have two laptops that were donated by silicone, harlem And, I, don't know if you guys saw the video, but the chair, cicely, harris and I came into the board office on friday We need to do another raffle, and so there were 20 people who registered for the raffle.
I will say, though, that the 120 or so book bags that we have remaining do not have school supplies in them, so I need to work to, and if anybody knows anybody to get some supplies donated to go inside of those 120 bags, because the bag, the 250 bags that we gave away on saturday, were full of school supplies, including calculators and pens and pencils and highlighters and notebooks, and that kind of thing.
A lot of schools are doing blended, learning, so A lot of young people aren't necessarily starting in person when you would need a book bag Now they might be starting closer to October november.
We could do something around like maybe the how november or something late, October november, but I would just say that I'm, okay, either way, except that if we're gonna, give the book back, out, I think that we should not give it out if we don't have no school supplies to put inside them, and so I.
I, don't know about the other 18, I'm going to send out an email to those 18 people giving them So. Maybe people didn't read, it just saw a free, laptop and said: I, don't know what it was, but I'm gonna, I just wanted to.
And I think I saw a couple people in the community later on that day, You know, as I mentioned, silicone, harlem holland, parker, park, street corner resources, jay's, emblem health came out and just wanted to say that the connection I got with emblem.
You know having a rotation of schedule, but really the outreach is supposed to be at least one hour over the next three days to students to acclimate them to the virtual process, because everyone will have some remote learning, no matter what, whether they're going into a build.
Some principals are having real staffing, issues, and so the principals union did make that very clear to the city this week that they needed that we are really short ins to have in school instruction about ten thousand teachers, because, right as of now, 16 000 teachers were approved for totally remote and it's going up by the day, because there was also no date.
But there's going to be a lot in the high school level, absolutely expect students to be totally on laptops if they're in the building, but for elementary there might be a little bit more flexibility.
I, had been working on a letter of support for the school system and then school was pushed back, And, so we are still looking at it and seeing how we can make sure that it reflects what we think the community needs, and I just want to add that I did reach out to superintendents to try to get their feedback.
And then, if that's not compatible with having enough teachers in the classrooms, I'm, really wondering how that ratio works out or how that you know equation works out because yeah we still have to be able to provide quality education to the students, and There was more parents who want to do the online learning more so than in class.
So when these high school students are programmed they're going to be programmed just for a room, and that's it really right So you can't necessarily bring in teachers to teach all those different subjects because you may not even have well.
Our district needs are, I think If they're, if you're, if your child has opted into both in school and remote instruction, it could be very hard because if you have a totally remote teacher, that teacher is not the teacher who's going to be servicing.
But I know that that's not even a conversation anymore, so who in the school are they going to be expecting to take these temperatures of these people that are walking into the building?
You know even for staff, it's going to be the school safety agents that are actually there to take temperatures that that's not necessarily the same for students.
There seems to be a lot of things, to check, to develop a checklist and check off to make sure that we are fully prepared for students to and teachers and all you know, staff and administration to be re-entered into the school.
Though, like one of I agree, I worry about all those things, but I also worry that, because our communities, in terms of just social, economic status, we're on the bottom of the totem pole, that a lot of parents don't have the option to actually make the choice as to whether or not they want to do remote or in person like they're, sending their kids into a situation that they don't feel is safe or comfortable because they have to work outside of the home.
If anyone has any information as to what they may have heard as to what does plan is with helping any students that are struggling with trying to keep up with a high level, you know schedule, as you said, when parents are not there and have to be at work all day, So the school work for her is like.
Don't envy anybody's school system right now, because this sounds like it's going to be a great daunting task, and, as I said, as a mom, I'm, just looking for any resource, I can to be able to give my son that level of comfort that he you know if he does start to struggle a little bit , that there are resources out there that he can lean on to try to help him in the election that I'm not there because being at work.
Think what we're mostly going to be concerned about this year is our students and our parents in our community to make sure that if we find that there's something that they need, we can try to find those resources for them and we can get that information out.
