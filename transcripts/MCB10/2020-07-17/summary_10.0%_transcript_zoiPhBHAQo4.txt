So first before we get into specifics, I, just wanted to give you sort of an overview on what happened on the land use side of things during this pandemic, which is essentially nothing and that's because we had so many other crises, citywide that had to be dealt with respect to the economy, stopping businesses from operating.
There were a lot of DOB people roaming, the field, making sure that those essential projects were following social distancing rules that were giving out hand sanitizer or pro were following proper protocol, and if they didn't, they were facing fines upwards of ten thousand dollars in violations on may 13th.
They have a specific portal called new york city engaged upon which residents and the community at large will be able to go on and find out what the development projects are that are going to be discussed for the pending meeting and find when there will be ways to instruct those who are interested on how to access public meetings remotely.
Two great pieces of legislation have come out in our favor, so that allows us to remain very hopeful about the future, the future of new york and the future of harlem I'd, now like to open the discussion up to just talk number one from the agency, perspective.
Tell us a little bit about what your experience has been like, both as a professional and as a planner in this covered time, and some of the things that your agency has been able to assemble and put together for new yorkers in harlem nights, community board 10 in particular, so bianda before you, begin.
And I just want to make sure that for those residents or others or community leaders that can communicate, and You've already communicated that to your residents, that this process of the Covid-19 rent relief program, which he's established through state legislation, actually started today and the applications are open.
So I will say that our agency has been working diligently, just as your community has been working diligently to really shift as quickly as possible, in addition to managing our own lives, whether we have family members who have been directly impacted during this time, period, So again, I want to commend all of you for making it through and being vigilant and also confirming that the community gets as many resources and assistance as possible.
You know again that left a lot of unknowns, not only for the projects that we were trying to advance throughout the borough of Manhattan, which is what my team works on, but also just in terms of our sustainability, as well as an agency.
I know that in my own, affordable housing portfolio and malcolm may speak to this a little later when he comes into the discussion, can you talk to us?
This is the first time I got this through hcci This is the first time I've participated, but- You guys were talking about helping people out with regards to rent rental, rears and so forth, and so on, I was on another call, the governor rolled out a new program today, right And, it's up there literally the application started.
Think that a lot of times what will happen if we don't have some kind of a situation available for people, because I don't know.
Don't know if that's just because today's the first day, And I, think that a lot of people will be discouraged from wanting to follow through when they run into situations like that.
I, will say this that you know we have a board member, that you know that actually runs the office of the new york state, division of housing and community renewal at 125th street in the state.
You know any kind of government support that we can get or be assisted, with, and that's very important in a low to moderate income community like harlem ourselves, talking about housing and just for those who don't know housing, Is real estate and real estate in new york city is our life.
Well, not landlords are bad actors and we have to embrace and appreciate the work of landlords, particularly in our community, as they manage as they provide affordable housing and they build new housing for the residents.
Knowing that our community was the need of social support, educational services, online seminars, food, pantry, retail space and other small businesses.
So, particularly during the martin luther king, weekend, and I, was asked to give an address about hcci's history as well as the social injustices that are happening and that community likes like it and compare the success of hcci as and the success of the city of new york in housing development and in the beloved community of harlem that we all you know, are endeared to.
But how far a city has come and how that has been achieved over time and that has been achieved through a diff, a host of different strategies, many of which go back to the honorable david dinkins, who started the community policing program in new york city and which was, you know, expanded doing subsequent mayoral administrations.
Leaders that lisa mentioned, understood that, in order to turn and revitalize the harlem community that it had to be a deep well of partnership along the private industries, nonprofits faith, communities, city, agencies- And, you know even the law enforcement community, so hcci has been meeting with the NYPD, the sanitation, department, the district attorney's office and HPD and other agencies on a monthly basis for close to 35 years, and that strategy has helped us connect with those agencies and also connect our residents who live in our buildings with those agencies.
The community improvement group meeting, is to make sure that our tenants, our residents, have a voice directly to the responsible parties in the city agencies, particularly the police department, because the quality of life of residents in our buildings are so important that we want to make sure we are the bridge.
What I wanted to share with you about seattle and my mission to seattle is that people in the west coast and every urban center are dealing with the pressures of the need for affordable housing for low, very low and moderate income.
Because, you know, I, think our first obligation as hcci as holland, congregation for community improvement and as any not-for-profit organization, is to care for the people that you're responsible for Our core business Happens to be real estate, because that happened to be the issue at hand when we were created.
So when events like this happen, you know it really underscores our responsibility as community members and workers to make sure that we give all of the care and concern and attention to all the matters that are important to the success in survival and even the thriving of our community and what I believe the partnership, as of hcci, has been with.
Now possess over a responsibility over 120 buildings in the harlem community, and we've also expanded outside of our traditional borders of harlem, into washington heights, as well as the Bronx and even in new jersey and in atlanta georgia, because the need for the model of building, affordable housing and providing social services to boot is a model worthy of replication.
You know who's in the leadership at the time whether the organization is this or that it's really about how the service is being provided to the people in the most need.
I want to describe what the impact of the interruption of the real estate, programming and affordable housing was on agency cci, because the first thing we needed to do is to assess make an assessment on what the Covid-19 economy and the covert shutdown would mean for us and as any organization, particularly not-for-profits, you know, there's no net bankroll.
When the Covid-19 hit the united states, in particular new york city, we assessed that a almost 3 million dollars from our annual budget was wiped out on March 30th, when it was announced that we were all restricted to do anything, because we knew that the city agencies weren't going to be able to close deals, and we knew that it would be very difficult to operate under those circumstances.
One of the things I was proud to be a partner in is the greater holland chamber of commerce who convened a weekly meeting of what could be described as all the stakeholders that possibly could participate to make sure that harlem itself had a had a group of people that were looking after the needs of the folks in the home, because we knew that the lower Manhattan had their own strengths in terms of organization.
I believe that's going to have long-term impact on hcci organizations like it, the real estate industry and other services for the community.
You know there are other projects that have been impacted like there's, a cluster of buildings, 75 units, west 139th street right in central harlem right in your district.
There was investors that were out from outside of the community, but that building is practically finished, hcci, assisted by bringing its experience in developing low-income housing tax credits.
You know the city as well as the community board, when they approve projects that will have a not only a residential housing impact, put an economic impact on for workers in our community.
We have preserved at hcci over a thousand units of affordable housing, and some of those preservation projects are in buildings that were in our portfolio from long ago, and we've created innovative ways to include partners that are partly developers from our community and through trying not to bring take any other money from HPD on those projects.
I, think that new york is resilient and you know we have some very smart people in leadership and politic.
So barbara nelson had a question about like specific to hcci and the lack of response of NYPD in some of the hcci buildings that are unfortunately have drug sales and are dealing with other issues and wanted to know?
But I know you'll, be coming back to the community board, because vyond and I are already in conversation about how to bring more information to the community, around low income, tax, credits, financing and educating our community about the technicalities around real estate, development and land use and things we need to know.
You know we have been working with Manhattan legal services and we can talk with dhcr So I think, with malcolm saying that barbara and with your support and with everyone on board, now speak to sicily.
