We have some rich information to provide for you and we have some robust speakers who will be providing us with information this evening tonight we're actually in a good place, because we have two special related announcements that have come out of both the state and the mayor's office within the 24-hour period that are applicable to the discussion this evening, So first before we get into specifics, I just wanted to give you sort of an overview on what happened on the land use side of things during this pandemic, which is essentially nothing and that's because we had so many other crises, citywide that had to be dealt with respect to the economy, stopping businesses from operating From.
I was calling because it looked like we're interested in potentially purchasing a home in pomona You know everything shut down with the exception of the essential workforce, so that meant anybody involved in affordable housing Anybody who was working solo in a environment where they wouldn't come in contact with a lot of people.
They have a specific portal called new york city engaged upon which residents and the community at large will be able to go on and find out what the development projects are that are going to be discussed for the pending meeting and find when there will be ways to instruct those who are interested on how to access public meetings remotely so we're moving slowly by slowly we're moving forward as a city and opening back up So. What does that say for a city as dense as new york that has a pipeline of development projects that will accommodate nine million people?
This has been tremendous relief for our residents here in harlem, but it's put a tremendous burden on our landlords because they are still responsible for their mortgages, and you know if it's one thing, if a a resident one resident doesn't pay the rent So again, we have to think broadly as practitioners about how this pandemic is not just affecting the renter, but also the landlord There was a one-shot deal program where the city allocated 41 million 41 thousand dollars per household for people who had some sort of crisis.
There are many in, for example, our office of emergency management that make sure, throughout the cold months people received heat So again there were essential workers, as well as many of our colleagues who normally do not participate in any activity related to food distribution that really rallied to make sure that many people did not go hungry during the winter months So, as lisa also mentioned, we had a shutdown of the city's uniform land use review process, so that comes into play with our division, that advances, housing, development or mixed use, housing projects from the beginning stages from its planning and pre-development stages onto euler certification, and then we work closely with our new construction team underwriting team to confirm that the projects move forward through closing, we also work with our legal team, and many of us had to really shift and understand how our projects that were in queue to be certified that were in queue to be closed.
You know again that left a lot of unknowns, not only for the projects that we were trying to advance throughout the borough of Manhattan, which is what my team works on, but also just in terms of our sustainability, as well as an agency Here we are july, 16th We have projects that are just beginning and that have been presented to us they're in their infancy stages, for example right before the shutdown development teams proposed certain projects in varied community boards, and then you have to go through at a preliminary approval process.
Thank you for that report, so just see if a committee member has any like a question, I will add just wanting to make sure that people are aware of the mayor's office, The fact sheet that they produced the latest update was June 22nd the mayor's office fact sheet to protect tenants, But. You know the mayor's office has created a fact sheet in terms of how tenants can be protected, and so again you know we have a large agency about 2 500 employees and there are so many different divisions at hpd a lot of times.
We got seniors and others who may not be able to navigate through Okay, just put it in there, because that's exactly was the problem that I ran into because I'm trying to help my neighbor and I was trying to afford that service to So in our conversations over these past few months, as we try to figure out what problem to solve and the best way to solve it here in harlem we've, all always known housing to be a one-sided look at housing from a one-sided perspective, the programs, the subsidies, you know any kind of government support that we can get or be assisted with, and that's very important in a low to moderate income community like harlem ourselves, talking about housing and just for those who don't know housing is real estate and real estate in new york city is our life.
Well, not landlords are bad actors and we have to embrace and appreciate the work of landlords, particularly in our community, as they manage as they provide affordable housing and they build new housing for the residents here and so I asked malcolm to join the call today, not only because he's brilliant and has a lot of knowledge that he likes to share with the harlem community.
But I wanted to him to speak in his role as a leader of one of the most prolific organizations that we have here in harlem and probably across the country, a face, a faith-based non-profit organization that specializes in housing that was founded by visionary faith leaders, namely wyatt walker and other visionaries, who not only wanted to bring quality, decent, affordable housing to our neighborhood Knowing that our community was the need of social support, educational services, online seminars, food pantry, retail space and other small businesses.
Having been created in 1986 by those faith leaders that lisa mentioned understood that in order to turn and revitalize the harlem community, that it had to be a deep well of partnership along the private industries, nonprofits faith communities, city, agencies-- and you know even the law enforcement community, so hcci has been meeting with the NYPD, the sanitation department, the district attorney's office and hpd and other agencies on a monthly basis for close to 35 years, and that strategy has helped us connect with those agencies and also connect our residents who live in our buildings with those agencies The purpose of that meeting we call it The community improvement group meeting- is to make sure that our tenants, our residents, have a voice directly to the responsible parties in the city agencies, particularly the police department, because the quality of life of residents in our buildings are so important that we want to make sure we are the bridge between You know.
In this time, The Covid-19 virus had already presented itself to the city of seattle, and seattle was a hub for trans trans-pacific travel What I wanted to share with you about seattle and my mission to seattle is that people in the west coast and every urban center are dealing with the pressures of the need for affordable housing for low, very low and moderate income People in seattle, there's a district that they compare themselves to harlem, where there used to be the majority of african-americans , there's no more african-americans living in that district, and this church and a few others are the only remnants left of that african-american community and that The struggle that we sometimes take for granted here is a struggle for people all over the country and I'll talk about some of the other places that were moving the mission too, so to speak.
In, the early days of the pandemic You know because of the intensity of the crisis, because you know I think our first obligation as hcci as holland, congregation for community improvement and as any not-for-profit organization, is to care for the people that you're responsible for Our core business happens to be real estate, because that happened to be the issue at hand when we were created, but our responsibility is far greater than our core business obligation.
You know some of the partnerships that we were able to continue doing to Covid-19 I want to describe what the impact of the interruption of the real estate programming and affordable housing was on agency cci, because the first thing we needed to do is to assess make an assessment on what the Covid-19 economy and the covert shutdown would mean for us and as any organization, particularly not-for-profits.
So, our budget is a zero budget and we have a responsibility of accounting for that every year in and year out, and we have to file our our tax returns in our 990s, all of which are public record When the Covid-19 hit the united states, in particular new york city, we assessed that a almost 3 million dollars from our annual budget was wiped out on march 30th, when it was announced that we were all restricted to do anything, because we knew that the city agencies weren't going to be able to close deals, and we knew that it would be very difficult to operate under those circumstances and, like other organizations Remotely hcci is considered a essential business.
They still are working from home, but I thought it was my responsibility to continue to come out because, as the president and ceo of hcci, you know there's certain processes we just could not do remotely and we needed to show an example to our community.
Some of the listeners today were part of that group which communicated to the community and the leadership that you know the needs of the community We were able to work with out al tayla and anez dickens and gail brewer and carl hasties from the the speaker of the assembly as well as brian benjamin, and the first thing we want to do is make sure we were keeping the lines of communication open to our residents, because we knew that if hcci and organizations and businesses are hurting, the residents are hurting a thousand times greater Then once we found out, people were being laid off and 2 million 10 million 20 million americans were laid off that the governor did step in and make sure that the courts would not even accept any evictions during their period time.
So we connected people to services So. One of the things that I was asked to describe is how the covert impact, as well as the unfortunate murders of the innocent or otherwise unarmed folks in our community, how all of that has been impactful on our ability to operate and provide services As I mentioned you know about three million dollars was wiped away from our budget and all of that money would have been part of the real estate operations When real estate operations stalled at the city of new york in the state that also filtered down to our organization and one of the one of the deals that I'm really saddened about is we were transferring hcc I was transferring a co-op building to long-term residents in the holland community.
I hear today on a call with our elected officials that the budget gap from new york state is currently 16 billion So. We can't even you know, get a balanced budget for new york state and we have a shortfall, 16 billion dollars , I believe that's going to have long-term impact on hcci organizations like it, the real estate industry and other services for the community.
You know the city as well as the community board when they approve projects that will have a not only a residential housing impact, put an economic impact on for workers in our community Many who are starting out and in the first careers, and this could be the boost they need to push them from low income to moderate income and perhaps even beyond In the last four years, at least since my tenure, we have preserved at hcci over a thousand units of affordable housing, and some of those preservation projects are in buildings that were in our portfolio from long ago, and we've created innovative ways to include partners that are partly developers from our community and through trying not to bring take any other money from hpd on those projects.
We are all aware, the larger some of the larger development teams don't have to worry about lending institutions or investors pulling out of their projects as much as the smaller organizations or the faith-based institutions such as hcci, and so again, a lot of us really fight really hard in many ways and in many platforms to really advocate equitable housing in communities of color, So I think the unfortunate part about all these police brutality, events and deaths that are still going on You know internally.
