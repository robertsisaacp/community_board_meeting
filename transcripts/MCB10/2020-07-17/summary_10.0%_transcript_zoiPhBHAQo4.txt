There were a lot of DOB people roaming, the field, making sure that those essential projects were following social distancing rules that were giving out, hand, sanitizer or Pro were following proper protocol, and if they did not, they were facing fines upwards of ten thousand dollars in violations on May 13th.
As we have our advocacy discussions on housing, we have to infuse sort of the backdrop of what happens in the in the overall landscape as it pertains to construction as it pertains to planning, as it pertains to any kind of policy initiatives that come into play that affect the work that we do.
They have a specific portal called New, York, City engaged upon which residents and the community at large will be able to go on and find out what the development projects are that are going to be discussed for the pending meeting and find when there will be ways to instruct those who are interested on how to access public meetings remotely.
Parts of the Bronx have enjoyed low density for a long time for a long, time, and perhaps there'll be some rezonings in certain key areas and they've already started in Jamaica and some parts of the Bronx to up zone just to make the city a little bit more equitable in terms of density and accommodation, particularly around this Covid-19 virus, with respect to housing, which is another key topic, but very interrelated and again as land use.
We were fortunate that New York state suspended eviction proceedings and pending eviction orders until August 20th under the tenant state of Harbor Act, and this is to allow until people can start getting back on their footing economically to distances start opening.
What happens if a non- profit like hcci, which we'll hear from tonight if 10 residents lose their jobs and that's 10 times whatever the rent was that the landlord is losing.
Two great pieces of legislation have come out in our favor, so that allows us to remain very hopeful about the future, the future of New York and the future of Harlem, and I'd now like to open the discussion up to just talk.
Tell us a little bit about what your experience has been like, both as a professional and as a planner in this covered time, and some of the things that your agency has been able to assemble and put together for new yorkers in Harlem Nights Community, Board 10 in particular, so bianda before you, begin, can I just go back to something that Lisa just mentioned, and the important and value of what Senator Brian Benjamin emailed to us.
Today, and I just want to make sure that for those residents or others or community leaders that can communicate, and I'm sure, Malcolm you've already communicated that to your residents, that this process of the Covid-19 rent relief program, which he's established through state legislation, actually started today and the applications are open.
I know that beyond always, we always talk about AMI, so You know Lisa before we went to beyond you know, just to say that's a tremendous program that we're hoping you know can also fight against what our housing committee and Land Use Committee has been dealing with, and that's the issue of displacement and the fact that at some point or another, this rent moratorium will expire and therefore there will be people who are still subject to civil court.
I will say that our agency has been working diligently, just as your community has been working diligently to really shift as quickly as possible, in addition to managing our own lives, whether we have family members who have been directly impacted during this time, period, as I have, as many of you have, unfortunately, or we also know of many of our friends and relatives who lost their jobs and were unable to pay rent.
You know again that left a lot of unknowns, not only for the projects that we were trying to advance throughout the borough of Manhattan, which is what my team works on, but also just in terms of our sustainability, as well as an agency.
I know that in my own, affordable housing portfolio and Malcolm may speak to this a little later when he comes into the discussion.
This is the first time I got this through hcci This is the first time I've participated, but- And, you guys were talking about helping people out with regards to rent rental, rears and so forth, and so on, and I do not know because I came on a little late.
Think that a lot of times what will happen if we do not have some kind of a situation available for people, because I do not know.
If there's a phone number to call, it's not one readily available for you to ask questions or anything, and I do not know if that's just because today's the first day, And I, think that a lot of people will be discouraged from wanting to follow through when they run into situations like that.
I, will say this that you know we have a board member, that you know that actually runs the office of the New York State division of housing and community renewal at 125Th Street in the state office.
You, know any kind of government support that we can get or be assisted, with, and that's very important in a low to moderate income community like Harlem ourselves, talking about housing and just for those who do not know housing, Is real estate and real estate in New. York City is our life.
Well, not landlords are bad actors and we have to embrace and appreciate the work of landlords, particularly in our community, as they manage as they provide affordable housing and they build new housing for the residents.
Knowing that our community was the need of social support, educational services, online seminars, food, pantry, retail space and other small businesses.
So, particularly during the Martin Luther King, Weekend, and I, was asked to give an address about hcci's history as well as the social injustices that are happening and that community likes like it and compare the success of hcci as and the success of the city of New York in housing, development and in the beloved community of Harlem that we all you know, are endeared to.
That Lisa mentioned understood that, in order to turn and revitalize the Harlem community that it had to be a deep well of partnership along the private industries, Nonprofits Faith communities, city, agencies- And, you know even the law enforcement community, so hcci has been meeting with the NYPD, the sanitation department.
The community improvement group meeting- is to make sure that our tenants, our residents, have a voice directly to the responsible parties in the city agencies, particularly the police department, because the quality of life of residents in our buildings are so important that we want to make sure we are the bridge between.
What I wanted to share with you about Seattle and my mission to Seattle is that people in the West Coast and every urban center are dealing with the pressures of the need for affordable housing for low, very low and moderate income.
Is I've, seen the galvanization of community people residents, in particular, community leaders, political and elected officials, and common folks that work in and about this neighborhood come together in a way that you can only have seen it based on a crisis sort of reminding me of superstorm Sandy in a way, but much more intense, and I said.
You know, I think our first obligation as hcci as Holland congregation for community improvement and as any not- for- profit organization, is to care for the people that you're responsible for Our core business Happens to be real estate, because that happened to be the issue at hand when we were created, but our responsibility is far greater than our core business.
So when events like this happen, you know it really underscores our responsibility as community members and workers to make sure that we give all of the care and concern and attention to all the matters that are important to the success in survival and even the thriving of our community and what I believe.
We now possess over a responsibility over 120 buildings in the Harlem community, and we've also expanded outside of our traditional borders of Harlem into Washington Heights, as well as the Bronx and even in New Jersey and in Atlanta Georgia, because the need for the model of building, affordable housing and providing social services to boot is a model worthy of replication.
You know who's in the leadership at the time whether the organization is this or that it's really about how the service is being provided to the people in the most need.
I want to describe what the impact of the interruption of the real estate, programming and affordable housing was on agency Cci, because the first thing we needed to do is to assess make an assessment on what the Covid-19 economy and the Covid-19 shutdown would mean for us and As any organization, particularly not, for-.
When the Covid-19 hit the United States in particular, New York City, we assessed that a almost 3 million dollars from our annual budget was wiped out on March 30th, when it was announced that we were all restricted to do anything, because we knew that the city agencies were not going to be able to close deals, and we knew that it would be very difficult to operate under those circumstances.
One of the things I was proud to be a partner in is the greater Holland Chamber of Commerce, who convened a weekly meeting of what could be described as all the stakeholders that possibly could participate to make sure that Harlem itself had a had a group of people that were looking after the needs of the folks in the home, because we knew that the lower Manhattan had their own strengths in terms of organization.
We were able to work with out Al Tayla and Anez Dickens and Gail Brewer and Carl Hasties from the the speaker of the assembly as well as Brian Benjamin, and the first thing we want to do is make sure we were keeping the lines of communication open to our residents, because we knew that if hcci and organizations and businesses are hurting, the residents are hurting a thousand times greater.
You know real estate pipeline, as well as the New York State Budget.
I believe that's going to have long- term impact on hcci organizations like it, the real estate industry and other services for the community.
You know there are other projects that have been impacted like there's, a cluster of buildings, 75, units, West, 139Th, Street, right in central Harlem, right in your district.
There was investors that were out from outside of the community, but that building is practically finished, hcci, assisted by bringing its experience in developing low- income, housing tax credits.
You know the city as well as the community board, when they approve projects that will have a not only a residential housing impact, put an economic impact on for workers in our community.
We have preserved at hcci over a thousand units of affordable housing, and some of those preservation projects are in buildings that were in our portfolio from long ago, and we've created innovative ways to include partners that are partly developers from our community and through trying not to bring take any other money from HPD on those projects.
The last five years, we've invested through capital acquisitions of about 81 million dollars in the community, and I have to tell you that 81 million is not coming to hcci it's going into the buildings It's really part of production of the housing and the services for the community.
I, think that New York is resilient and you know we have some very smart people in leadership and politic.
I think, specific question was around not the buildings dedicated to one population, but the populations that are mixed throughout our buildings, and that is the case and some of those people have special classifications that I can't really identify them because they're protected class, but if they're acting out, then we go back to the referring agency And, that's usually a city of New York and try to get them a placement that is higher level than you, know, independent, living.
