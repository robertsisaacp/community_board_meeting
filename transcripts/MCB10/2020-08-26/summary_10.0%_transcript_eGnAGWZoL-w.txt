You know he made De Blasio made this big stand about having all of these 100,000 seats for students on the days that they're not exactly in the classroom, There's this survey online bridges asking sort of try to fill out.
We should wait to talk about this when people come on, but just keep that question in the back of your head and know that it's going to come from me, okay, fair enough, because I'm confused doing this all day, long, it's insane It's, insane!
We are blessed as a community board as a whole that we do have someone on the Executive, Board and Marquis, who is acutely aware of what is going on the ground as far as the teachers are concerned, and mari moss is here, even though she's She has some ideas about how the committee should sort of move forward in this time.
I see you as well, so we're going to give people about two more minutes, and then I think that we should just start the conversation, because we do have a few things that we want to talk.
I want to talk about school, opening up And I'm, going to put the link in the chat so that people can register for that that zoom meeting, because that should be very informative to students, because things are changing very quickly.
Charles Powell mentioned this before two that you know, a lot of people have not been able to pay their rent, so housing is going to be continuously being issued, then having school, outside.
I think it's also going to be of concern for many, like Tamara just mentioned in the email safety measures, because you do not know who's in the park around the kids.
So we have six schools in Harlem, Ps185, Ps149, Ps242, Ps76, Ps241 and Ps180, And I live also in Harlem on 115Th street- And, you know, I've, been going at this in terms of the council work that I've been I've been involved with the cec, since my daughter was in the first grade.
Just you know, sort of play off of you know specific thing , we're just talking about the air quality issue and specific safety measures that we should have already been able to at least identify when schools closed down- And you know when the school year ended, and we knew for sure that we were not.
You know we were going to have to plan for this coming fall, but none of that happened, and When the mayor comes out like two weeks ago and starts talking about upgrades to air quality, it is nonsense like it is 100 fabrication, propaganda, And, I know this, because the facilities people are talking about how what they're, seeing on the ground, what they're actually doing is essentially making sure that these buildings, you know we have buildings that range from in age, from 100 years old to you, know, 60:70 years old, None of them are in Manhattan.
But, but you know we take, I, think the thing that I know the most about, which was a promise that the mayor made for the end of his term right was that an air conditioner was going to be in every classroom space before he left office, something that now is course on hold and won't happen.
I remember when my daughter was in kindergarten and we were in this old building And, you know I think we were trying to raise money to like just go out and go to Costco and buy the air, conditioners, and You know And then just hire someone to go in and do the work, right.
I told you to think about those spaces that the mayor promised with those free spaces that the mayor promised would be available to parents or for their kids on the days that they're not in the classroom right the 100,000 spots for for child care for for the blended learning families that you know, I know that Manhattan bro, president, did some.
Oh, good and, and so people have been looking for those spaces, but I, honestly kind of feel like the thing that is happening right.
Is the question, because if there's a parent that says you know what I'm not sending my kid back to school, And we're going to hire somebody to come, in.
I think the principal did a great job in informing everyone, and I'm, just going to say that, because, like I said, I've, been to so many meetings , I think she did a great job in terms of informing the parents and the school community on the process, and I have a little one.
What is Cec 5 planning, if anything, to sort of ensure that when the students go back that they're going to go back into a space , that's safe and also that they have the you know, technical things that they need broadband laptop tablet.
I mean this is public knowledge, but the last two days all I've been working on is strike plans right, The mayor does not like stop, there, we've been doing walkthroughs a lot of the schools in district.
This week, I'm you know: I've, been surveying teachers, Acrosss district five and in my school for the drugs Academy And we're just trying to see what teachers need, because we're actually preparing them to think more.
Think that maybe you know we might want to think about a board letter and not and express an outrage, but maybe in expressing like we do not believe schools can open until right.
These things, are, and I have a checklist and things that we can perhaps put in that letter to say here's what we believe needs to be in place for our schools and our students to be safe, because at the end of the day, every teacher I've spoken to no, everyone is tired of being home right.
We, went without a contract for five years and never went on strike , we're talking about something like this and because our lives depend on it, and so we might be, you know, walking the picket line and if we walk the picket line, the one thing you can also do is that walk with us, because we're going to need everyone there, because it's about the safety and health of our kids Maybe.
Earlier today, when we started, you know, with this issue of like our street cleanliness and just doing things more together as a as a community.
I. Think that we can ask members of the committee to call the mayor's office and call the our City Council representatives and the senators and people who are out here asking for our votes, that you know say they care about the community, which I believe that they do, And so we should reach out to them and see, and let them know of our concerns that our concerns mirror the concerns of the uft and of Cec Korean of Cec 5, because they came from one voice about the issues that are going on in the schools in the classroom and that voice.
Thanks for having this meeting committee, So I do not know if anyone had a chance to look at the last borough board meeting, which was Thursday, but we did have, I think super superintendent rosales was there Marissa rosales , It got to a point where people were asking questions and they were like.
So I had some other things on my agenda, but there are only a couple of people from my committee I'm going to sort of leave those to the sign to try to plan something separate just for the community, but I believe that this was a great productive conversation and Tamara.
