You know she went to the pep to try to convince you, know de Blasio or the chancellor to to pay attention to this and Well we're still waiting for people to join You know he made de Blasio made this big stand about having all of these 100 000 seats for students on the days that they're not exactly in the classroom We should wait to talk about this when people come on, but just keep that question in the back of your head and know that it's gonna come from me: okay, fair enough, because I'm confused doing this all day, long Yes, so it's 6, 32 people usually join in between 6 30 6 40, 6, 45, Hopefully I get more of my committee members on He lives across the street.
Think they're gonna be a lot of young kids left at home alone, This fall as the DOE tries to figure out what this blended school year is going to look like, and those are all my personal opinions.
Charles powell mentioned this before two that you know a lot of people haven't been able to pay their rent, so housing is going to be continuously being issued, then having school outside I.
Our school leaders are working hard, Current coordinators are working hard, the the custodians and the facilities guys they're working hard, but you know the air quality issue, we're just talking about the air quality issue and specific safety measures that we should have already been able to at least identify when schools closed down, and you know when the school year ended, We were going to have to plan for this coming fall, but none of that happened, and so, when the mayor comes out like two weeks ago and starts talking about upgrades to air quality, it is nonsense like it is 100 fabrication, propaganda and I know this, because the facilities people are talking about how what they're, seeing on the ground.
But you know we take I, think the thing that I know the most about, which was a promise that the mayor made for the end of his term right was that an air conditioner was going to be in every classroom space before he left office.
The 100 000 spots for for child care for for the blended learning families that you know, I know that Manhattan bro president did some Oh good and, and so people have been looking for those spaces and you know, put together press conferences and just like go all out to try and get people to know that certain things aren't happening, We do not have testing mandatory testing in place or rapid testing and therefore accurate tracing right that we don't have that So, there's that and even before that, if you think about the simple like sort of the specifics on the percentage of positivity cases of Covid-19, yes, we're low So if we're acting like one big school system, one of the things that's tricky is that there are neighborhoods there, where the positivity rate is above five percent and there are neighborhoods where the positivity rate is So those two things are really important and just in the sort of basics and then there's the issue of not having a medical staff on site right , We, don't have PPE, you know.
I. Haven't heard of that, though, of course, we've got multiple members in our parent leader groups that have kids at 180 So I shudder to think that we're you know when cec 3's letter go out goes out tomorrow, which is a five page, or you know we kind of exhaust things as we normally do, and with all the unanswered questions that we have, and you know basically just sort of you know getting to the nuts and bolts of things that you know not only You know like the safety measures have haven't been figured out.
I think the principal did a great job in informing everyone Yes, mr powell I think she did a great job in terms of informing the parents and the school community on the process So, please forgive me, but I'm, not confident at all or optimistic about the reopening of the public schools in new york city, The, mere fact that the DOE would place our children's health and safety in jeopardy for the sake of funding and which I may add, does not translate to equitable resources and quality education.
A lot of schools have sidetracked pta presidents by having the parent coordinators there and right with the parent coordinators and in the basically, then the parent coordinator is basically representation of the principle at that point, because they're hired by principals I mean I've been listening to the conversation deborah You have specific questions like from a teacher's perspective.
The uft right now is actually is really holding down the safety of both teachers and students, families and administrators, because the administrators are not going to strike, but they are very much in with us all the last two days I mean this is public knowledge, but the last two days all I've been working on is strike plans right, If, the mayor doesn't like stop.
Think that maybe you know we might want to think about a board letter and not and express an outrage, but maybe in expressing like we don't believe, schools can open until right.
Perhaps put in that letter to say here's what we believe needs to be in place for our schools and our students to be safe, because at the end of the day, every teacher I've spoken to no, everyone is tired of being home right now.
I, don't know what he thinks is gonna happen on the 10th of september, but we are not going into school buildings What I think we should probably start talking about is in terms of community You, know, community level.
We can put together something very loose for exact board tomorrow and also I think that we can ask members of the committee to call the mayor's office and call the our city, council representatives and the senators and people who are out here asking for our votes, that you know say they care about the community which I believe that they do, and so we should reach out to them and see, and let them know of our concerns that our concerns mirror the concerns of the uft and of cec korean of cec 5, because they came from one voice about the issues that are going on in the schools in the classroom and that voice Now we're looking at situations where, of course, kids young kids are gonna, be left home alone, which is a whole nother conversation If there's nowhere for that kid to be it at a big after school program or school program or something, then the parent who the majority of parents don't have extra money, They count on their kids being in school to get that breakfast to get that much and that's another issue on the days that these 100 000 spaces that have not materialized, that the government that the mayor is talking about what happens with food who's going to deliver the food to these places, who's going to pick the food up from these schools.
