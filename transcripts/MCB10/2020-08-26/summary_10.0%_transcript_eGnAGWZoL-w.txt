You know he made de Blasio made this big stand about having all of these 100 000 seats for students on the days that they're not exactly in the classroom, There's this survey online bridges asking sort of try to fill out the need- And I guess we should wait to talk about this when people come on, but just keep that question in the back of your head and know that it's gonna come from me, okay, fair enough, because I'm confused doing this all day, long Yes, so it's 6, 32 people usually join in between 6 30 6 40, 6, 45.
We are blessed as a community board as a whole that we do have someone on the executive board and marquis who is acutely aware of what is going on the ground as far as the teachers are concerned, and mari moss is here, even though she's She has some ideas about how the committee should sort of move forward in this time.
I see you as well, so we're going to give people about two more minutes, and then I think that we should just start the conversation, because we do have a few things that we want to talk.
I want to talk about school opening up And I'm gonna put the link in the chat so that people can register for that that zoom meeting, because that should be very informative to students, because things are changing very quickly.
Charles powell mentioned this before two that you know a lot of people haven't been able to pay their rent, so housing is going to be continuously being issued, then having school, outside.
I think it's also going to be of concern for many, like tamara just mentioned in the email safety measures, because you don't know who's in the park around the kids.
So we have six schools in harlem ps185, ps149, ps242, ps76, ps241 and ps180, And I live also in harlem on 115th street- You know, I've, been going at this in terms of the council work that I've been I've been involved with the cec, since my daughter was in the first grade.
We're just talking about the air quality issue and specific safety measures that we should have already been able to at least identify when schools closed down- And you know when the school year ended, and we knew for sure that we were not.
You know we were going to have to plan for this coming fall, but none of that happened, and When the mayor comes out like two weeks ago and starts talking about upgrades to air quality, it is nonsense like it is 100 fabrication, propaganda, And, I know this, because the facilities people are talking about how what they're, seeing on the ground, what they're actually doing is essentially making sure that these buildings, you know we have buildings that range from in age, from like you, know, 100 years old to you, know, 60, 70 years old, None of them are in Manhattan.
But you know we take, I, think the thing that I know the most about, which was a promise that the mayor made for the end of his term right was that an air conditioner was going to be in every classroom space before he left office, something that now is course on hold and won't happen.
Oh, good and, and so people have been looking for those spaces, but I, honestly kind of feel like the thing that is happening right.
Is the question, because if there's a parent that says you know what I'm not sending my kid back to school, And we're gonna hire somebody to come.
Covid-19 19 is going to affect people when we start going into buildings, but we they've done just this piss-poor job with remote learning, and School leaders is, you know, continue to amaze me Might be the model for how we want others to to really reopen.
What is cec 5 planning, if anything, to sort of ensure that when the students go back, that they're gonna go back into a space, that's safe and also that they have the you know, technical things that they need.
I mean this is public knowledge, but the last two days all I've been working on is strike plans right, The mayor doesn't like stop, there, we've been doing walkthroughs a lot of the schools in district five.
This week, I'm you know: I've, been surveying teachers across district five and in my school for the drugs academy and we're just trying to see what teachers need, because we're actually preparing them to think more.
I. Think that maybe you know we might want to think about a board letter and not and express an outrage, but maybe in expressing like we don't believe, schools can open until right.
These things, are, and I have a checklist and things that we can perhaps put in that letter to say here's what we believe needs to be in place for our schools and our students to be safe, because at the end of the day, every teacher I've spoken to no, everyone is tired of being home right.
You, know appropriate PPE testing and instant testing in schools so that when we have suspected cases where, how are those kids and those adults being tested immediately to so that we can actually cut, you know, trace and figure out, what's going to be in place when if they do have it and so on, and so forth, and you know at the end of the day, I I'm telling you all that I look at it as a sense of the teachers These things are not in place for the safety of children and ourselves right.
You know the child care situation, even though it let's just let's just sort of make our piece with this idea that you know September 10th is not going to be the first day of school, which I think we you know kind of just have to you know: sorry, Mr mayor, it's just not happening.
I, don't know what he thinks is gonna happen on the 10th of September, but we are not going into school buildings.
Earlier today, when we started, you know, with this issue of like our street cleanliness and just doing things more together as a as a community.
I think that we can ask members of the committee to call the mayor's office and call the our city, council representatives and the senators and people who are out here asking for our votes, that you know say they care about the community, which I believe that they do, and so we should reach out to them and see, and let them know of our concerns that our concerns mirror the concerns of the uft and of cec korean of cec 5, because they came from one voice about the issues that are going on in the schools in the classroom and that voice.
