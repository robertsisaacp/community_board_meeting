Hello: hey there, hey Donna, hi Kim, hi Deborah. How are you thanks for joining I'm good? How are you oh, you know, I'm, okay, yeah. How are you, how are you handling all the disarray in district three? Well, some days I handle it pretty. Well, I think, but other days I feel like I have you know I'm so on edge, and I am ready to snap at any minute. Today was kind of one of those days. Actually I mean you know. I think I think that the this structure is set up so badly and that you know when you have like a you, know: pyramid sort of structure of management and the people around you know are sort of basically told what to do. You know and the size of the organizations prevents the kind of organic, trusting kind of just equal, equitable distribution of authority to act quickly that you know that you know we you end up in a situation like this. I mean, I think we see it at the federal government level, we're seeing it through Cuomo and De. Blasio has turned out to be very, you know, kind of like thirsty for talking points and power and bragging rights, essentially which is kind of what I feel like we're up to right now, just like he said it again today. You know no other things in the whole country. Who[ _ _] cares excuse my language, I'm sorry, no, the moment that we are in calls for colorful language. So put it nicely, so you know so that's this is where we are so instead of you know, like this whole business of rolling out like Yay we're going to do outdoor learning as he announced yesterday, and you know, a lot of schools were already trying to plan some of this and we're being told no like in district three one of our Harlem schools is really spearheaded outdoor learning at ps185, the school in 104 yeah, the PTA there so on it, like so ready to move, and she was shut down all summer long by the superintendent by the executive superintendent. You know she went to the pep to try to convince you, know de Blasio or the chancellor to to pay attention to this, and you know maybe it took the that kind of level of push that advocacy to get them to start thinking about it, but I mean it's like really like. Why does it take? You know? Parent volunteers, just Stan stay awake until two o'clock in the morning and you know testify to get the dewey to you know just take action on a good idea, which is not even that significant of a of a thing like it's been happening all around the world. Exactly it's not it's! The end you know indoors is not healthy, exactly 1918., so you know we're not inventing the wheel here guys. We just need to like put our thinking caps on and stop being so. You know like Bravado, sort of craven and hey marquise. How are you doing he's still coming in? Oh there he is there. He goes hey marquise thanks for joining. I know you doing 99 things. I'm here you hear me. Yes, okay, it started pouring while I was outside. So I was trying to get you. I can't believe it. Yes, it poured for it for about a good, 15 or 20 minutes. It was crazy. Well we're still waiting for people to join. So you can. If you want to mute yourself I'll, shout you out when we when we, when I need you to come in okay, gotcha thanks so also kim what are you hearing about? You know he made De Blasio made this big stand about having all of these 100,000 seats for students on the days that they're not exactly in the classroom, yeah and there's this survey online bridges asking sort of try to fill out the need- which I think is ridiculous, because there's over a million students, of course there's a need. It's just ridiculous. It's another stall tactic which shows me that there's nothing being done. I think you're right yeah. What do you know about these faces? If anything- and I guess we should wait to talk about this when people come on, but just keep that question in the back of your head and know that it's going to come from me, okay, fair enough, because I'm confused doing this all day long, it's insane it's insane! Yes, so it's 6:32 people usually join in between 6:30 6 40:6 45. Here comes Charles Powell. Who is a pleasant welcome? Hopefully I get more of my committee members on but he's on the board and he's always welcomed it's good to see him no hi, Mr Powell. I know I have not. I have not seen him. He lives acrosss the street cam. How are you I'm well, thanks how you doing always good to see you likewise Deborah? How are you hi Charles, I'm doing? Well, it's great to see you okay, yeah, happy to join. This call sure thank you and how the children have a you have just one daughter or you have more than one. I have one, I'm one! Oh you just had one. I thought there was more than one you should have more children, you're an educator so and a parent and an advocate, so you should have at least five children. I tried five kids. Five would be a lot, but I have I have a husband he's, a large child. Well, I thought you had more. Maybe I was just confusing you. I always in all of our encounters. Something said you had more than one god. It's all good, it's just me and, and you can actually see harper my daughter in the background there she's cooking dinner tonight- that's nice, very nice yeah. We need to see her. I have not seen her in a while. You know we were out on Tuesday mornings. We do the cleanup Harlem with the with the a phillip Randolph Square group. We were so we were out this morning. We've been out a couple of tuesdays now: cleaning up, Samuel mark's the triangle right front of my building, because you know at the trumbo funeral home, building and and dealing with Gregory Badgett and some of the the members from the Randolph Triangle. So can you help us with in your cleanups and I'll even contribute to what's happening, acrosss the street in front of the Graham Court 216Th Street side? You see what's going on right? Yes, absolutely it's just the folks who are living there deborah! You may not be aware. I do not know if you've had a chance to see it. I know Sicily has commented on it, but we have like whole families living out there now really yeah. Well, I know that you know in the cleanup this morning there was there was. There was only one other woman that was in the triangle when gregory was sweeping up and she ended up helping him and then they left some stuff in an area because she said that it was where some people were sleeping, but she did not mention a family, so I they know cam. They know when you're coming so they I noticed so now, you're helping me, because I noticed yesterday the day was much lighter. So I know this is not the subject ever of our conversation yeah or this evening. No, but Charles, it's fine, because you know anything. That's going on in the community is something that should be raised in any committee meeting. So it's fine, especially as we wait for people to join. I think it's it's a good topic to bring up. So please no apologies. You know I'd also just echo that I agree with you with you Deborah and that in the sort of the absence like there's a there's, a vacuum, that's being created right now right because the Parks Department does not have its seasonal staffers to come and clean up. And this not you know the homeless people sleeping there. Not notwithstanding that, but in terms of the actual you know the Tuesday Cleanup day, the Parks Department is not. Is it doing as much and garbage receptacles have been moved off the streets because the sanitation department has budget cuts, and so there's this kind of intersectional community weakness that's been exposed by all of all of this. You know these conditions and I actually think that schools, our middle school kids and our high school kids, you know- I mean in reality we're going to need to kind of we're not going to be able to buy our way out of this, like we're, not you know what I mean: we're not going to just be able to put somebody out there and assume that it's going to happen. I think we actually have to you know convince people to swallow pride and put on rubber gloves and get out there with brooms and just do it and maybe, as a result, we'll all be better people in the process, including our kids. Thanks for that and Charles, how are you doing? I am blessed and highly favored. Thank you. No I'm actually doing pretty well just telling someone today, I feel really blessed that in my family an extended family. You know we have not had any of these circumstances that I've had to deal with as a deacon many people in our community. Many people from our church, you know, have succumbed so we actually went over and joined with the folks at Mount. Nebo and as you know, they lost a significant number of members so Saturday before last we went over and our deacons went over and prayed with. You know with pastor Greene and his crew, you know his congregation and it was really important. So our community has suffered so fcbc and you know, and my family has been- we've been very fortunate, so we're feeling blessed. So thank you for asking dav that's good to hear, because I had heard about the losses at Mount me. Nebo yeah, I mean you know you're talking like, and you know, 20 plus persons. You know yeah, I mean you know and that's like a lot. You know- and you know- and you know that side, so you know we certainly have to come together as a community. As you pointed out, everything is relevant. You know, so thanks for asking sure you know we are. We are one village, one community, so we are, everything should be discussed all the time it is around 6:40. I know that there are a couple of other people that are going to join a couple of people who were going to join or unable to join because of the change in date, and that's fine, and so the whole point of this today is sort of to have a conversation around. I had invited Pamela Stewart from Cec-5 as well, I'm not sure she'll be going. She would have been on the call last Tuesday, but we do have Kim Watkins. Who can give us some perspective from the cec and also Marquis? I did have a rep that was going to come in from the uft who is not available tonight. She was available last week, and so you know we do. We are blessed as a community board as a whole that we do have someone on the Executive, Board and Marquis, who is acutely aware of what is going on the ground as far as the teachers are concerned, and mari moss is here even though she's busy- and I appreciate it- and she has some ideas about how the committee should sort of move forward in this time. Some things that we should do and hey tamara, how are you I see you as well, so we're going to give people about two more minutes, and then I think that we should just start the conversation, because we do have a few things that we want to talk about. I want to talk about school opening up and in that vein face is having a meeting on Thursday and I'm going to put the link in the chat so that people can register for that that zoom meeting, because that should be very informative to students, because things are changing very quickly. There was a you know. De Blasio was on the news today talking about meeting outside you know. Initially they were against it and now they're talking about it's. Okay and the principals have to present a plan by Friday, which is kind of a little. You know fast and there's just there's just a lot going on. You know I do not de Blasio talked about there being spaces for kid. He was going to provide a hundred thousand spaces free for kids on days that they were not actually in the classroom. There has not been a lot of conversation around. There is a survey out asking parents if they need it. I was talking about Kim to Kim about this little earlier. I think that the survey is unnecessary. This school system has over a million students and so you're talking about providing 100,000 seats. I think that, of course, there is a need. I know that there's been some rfps out. I know a couple of not profits that have answered the RFP, which is a little scary, because this is something that's very recent and school is opening up in two weeks. So there's a lot there's a lot going on. There's a lot of unanswered questions I feel for the parents, I feel, for the teachers. I think that the community is suffering around housing which Charles Powell just talked about and schools. I think I think they're going to be a lot of young kids left at home alone. This fall as the DOE tries to figure out what this blended school year is going to look like, and those are all my personal opinions. I just want to say that Deborah yates, those are my personal opinions based on things. I've read and seen. It frightens me, I'm afraid for our students, because our students are always behind before Covid-19 in March, and I fear that you know they will be a year or two behind once things once the death settles. We still do not know if everybody has laptops or broadband, but think about it. Just makes me very sad. Just makes me very sad yeah, I I'm afraid for our community. I really am what were you saying mari? No, I was just going to concur with what you're saying and also point out that, prior to the Covid-19, we had this issue of homelessness in our schools, where parents were going around during the day while their children were in school. Looking for places to live now I mean you know. Charles Powell mentioned this before two that you know a lot of people have not been able to pay their rent, so housing is going to be continuously being issued then having school outside. I think it's also going to be of concern for many, like Tamara just mentioned in the email safety measures, because you do not know who's in the park around the kids. How are they going to account for children? They do not want them to run off and go. You know, I just know what it is to be a teacher. I've been in the classroom, my mother was a teacher. You know I've been a teacher's assistant, you know, so I know what it's like to keep control of a classroom than to have to deal with it outside. I just wonder what kind of precautionary measures they're going to have in order to ensure that they have students, attention and their safety in mind and that they do not stray off. You know wherever they're going to be so they have to think about all those things and let me just say right- and that was one of my concerns that really placed an email, because the fact is, we have a uptick in shootings, and so we really have to look at where we're placing our children in these outdoor spaces right from the streets to the parks. We have to be very mindful of that. You know, and that's one of my major concerns in addition to what you know Mari's saying about them running off, or you know it's so much elements to the outdoor space. So you know these are things that need to be considered and parents, teachers. Everyone have to be involved in this plan and it can not be rushed and it's just like it feels like it's just being rushed everything's, not really thought through right, and we can't send our kids back to this type of environment if everything is not properly set in place and proper protocols set in place. All the unions are an uproar over this, and I mean we really have to work towards together to get this done properly right. I completely agree and I wonder why the DOB did not partner with DOH prior to you know the month of August, for example, to figure out what are the healthy precautions that need to take place in classrooms, because if you can set up healthy precautions for these restaurants to you know operate outside, I just do not see why they could not have retrofitted the classrooms properly for the kids to be able to go into classroom. So I just I do not understand that aspect. Kim. Can you comment on some of that? Please sure I, the things I'm going to say will be you know, I'm sure confirmed. Can you introduce yourself? Yes, of course, of course, hello. Everyone I'm Kim Watkins, I'm president of Cec 3 and the schools in Cec 3 that overlap with community Board 10 are from 110th to 122., so we have six schools in Harlem, Ps185, Ps149, Ps242, Ps76, Ps241 and Ps180, and- and I live also in Harlem on 115Th street- and you know, I've been going at this in terms of the council work that I've been I've been involved with the cec, since my daughter was in the first grade. So I'm in my third term four years now as president and you know we- we knew that there were a lot of sort of policy process, oriented challenges with dealing with this gigantic bureaucracy and like pretty much everything else, the you know, the pandemic has laid bare the fissures that exist. In that you know, the plans that are being developed are being developed in a largely in a vacuum with you know: high pressed consultants that only began in you know in the last couple of months and what we're hearing come out of the mouth of the Chancellor and the mayor is not translating to what's happening on the ground. I mean principals are working really hard. In fact, the principals are the heroes in all of this. Our school leaders are working hard. Current coordinators are working hard, the the custodians and the facilities guys they're working hard, but you know the air quality issue. Just you know, sort of play off of you know specific thing, we're just talking about the air quality issue and specific safety measures that we should have already been able to at least identify when schools closed down, and you know when the school year ended, and we knew for sure that we were not. You know we were going to have to plan for this coming fall, but none of that happened, and so, when the mayor comes out like two weeks ago and starts talking about upgrades to air quality, it is nonsense like it is 100 fabrication propaganda, and I know this because the facilities people are talking about how what they're, seeing on the ground, what they're actually doing is essentially making sure that these buildings, you know we have buildings that range from in age, from 100 years old to you know, 60:70 years old and then there's a few newer buildings there. None of them are in Manhattan. I think you know, with the exception of a couple, we all have a lot of old buildings and what they have in their buildings in terms of air quality. Are you know, registers like fans that bring some air in, but very little and a little of air out? Often those pieces of equipment are not functioning properly, and so what they're doing is they're making sure that whatever a school building has it's working? That's the upgrade. That's it right, and you know so other regular purifiers, no ventilators like nothing like that. No and we would require, I mean the other thing. The other thing with our government is, you know this came out of someone else's mouth and I'll just say it that the price gouging like these vendors are just raping us in terms of prices and so and we're paying whatever we need to pay right like we're. Just we're just cutting the check, cutting and check swiping the credit card, the dewey credit card for everything and anything in order to get all this done, which I completely understand why? But, but you know we take, I think the thing that I know the most about, which was a promise that the mayor made for the end of his term right was that an air conditioner was going to be in every classroom space before he left office, something that now is course on hold and won't happen. But the you know there's a. I remember when my daughter was in kindergarten and we were in this old building and you know I think we were trying to raise money to like just go out and go to Costco and buy the air conditioners, and you know and then just hire someone to go in and do the work right. But you can't do that because it's a union and when the then there's like some sort of special vendor that you have to use to buy the equipment and it's all over price. Like one, you know window unit, Air conditioners, ten thousand dollars. You know when, obviously that's not what it costs, so it's so buying. You know like upgrades to ventilation, is a huge capital expense and the dua does not have any money. Although what are your opinion? What are your parents saying about students going back into the classroom? And what have you heard? I'm going to ask you this question. I told you to think about those spaces that the mayor promised with those free spaces that the mayor promised would be available to parents or for their kids on the days that they're not in the classroom right the 100,000 spots for for child care for for the blended learning families that you know have you know, sort of partial week sort of schedules. Well, I will say right. I will. I know that there are a lot of sort of. There are a lot of elements, a lot of groups looking for those individual spaces like the physical spaces themselves right. I know that Manhattan bro, president, did some. You know analysis of this. I think yeah, other elected officials were kind of looking for spaces that might be possible. Oh good and, and so people have been looking for those spaces, but I honestly kind of feel like the thing that is happening right now. More has to do with the like cold hard reality of whether or not any in- person activity will take place at all. You know because we've exposed by you know and we've had to like basically rip and pull and claw and beg and shame- and you know, put together press conferences and just like go all out to try and get people to know that certain things are not happening. We do not have testing mandatory testing in place or rapid testing and therefore accurate tracing right that we do not have that yet. So, there's that and even before that, if you think about the simple like sort of the specifics on the percentage of positivity cases of Covid-19, yes we're low. Yes, we're, you know better than everywhere anywhere else in the country or whatever you know. The sort of thing is to say, but the problem with it is the sort of you know disparate percentages in different parts of the city. So, if we're acting like one big school system, one of the things that's tricky is that there are neighborhoods there, where the positivity rate is above five percent and there are neighborhoods where the positivity rate is zero. And one of the things that you know is a little bit. Tricky is to figure out how do we you know? Do we move forward with the sort of average, like mathematical average, or are we trying to figure out how to move forward? You know in terms of individual neighborhoods, so those two things are really important and just in the sort of basics and then there's the issue of not having a medical staff on site right. We do not have PPE. You know. One month's worth of protective gear is basically the policy right now like what does that even mean? How would we plan for a school year with one month's worth of supplies? So so? What back to your question Deborah? Is that I think kind of lost in the conversation and I'll admit that we do not know anything about this. The cec has not been involved in the conversations about child care facilities, opening up no, not at all. Having said that, I what I think what I suspect is the case is that there is so much energy spent right now on what you know. The sort of political arena is looking like in terms of the union opposition. In terms of the you know, I mean it's it principles in district 1:13, 15 2:6. You know a couple of principles in district three have started to just to bubble to the surface in opposition of the plan, so a lot of principles are in opposition of the plan. Cec Iii. We have a letter, that's going out tomorrow. You know we do not believe we should plan to open in person on September 10th. We do not. We just do not think we're ready and- and so you know so much energy is on- that we really just have lost kind of that. Other issue is spinning out there it's on it's on the sidebar, but it has not. It has not been back to the reality yet because, unfortunately, I think we're just going to end up starting remote yeah questions. Charles Paul put a question in the chat, which is a question I'm curious about as well about the private educational pods that parents are putting together. Are you aware of in how are they coming about? Do they need to be licensed is the question, because if there's a parent that says you know what I'm not sending my kid back to school and I have some like- minded parents, and now we have five six or seven or eight kids and we're going to hire somebody to come in. You know: do you know of any of those parts that are happening in district? Three kim? I do not have knowledge of like specific organizational plans, but I'm certain that they are probably happening. I mean in facebook groups and you know emails. I mean I think I see it on Harlem for kids. I see them too yeah. I see yeah exactly I mean what I think is what I hope you know. I mean we're all of us here in this zoom right, we're proponents of public education. We want public schools to figure out a pathway forward, and the reckoning with all of this is you know, is like the pods are kind of like almost like a cancer. You know, like they'll, develop a blood supply if they get to be, if they're, successful and sort of like the Charter school movement, which you know I mean as a as a as an idea and as independent kind of like pushback on the giant bureaucracy. The concept of opening a school in order to you know be innovative and you know test the kind of beer. You know. Big government theory makes total sense to me just like, with these pods they're, like a reaction to the sort of undercurrent of what's happening in public education, but but as a you know, if it develops a blood supply, meaning it starts raising money and like Silicon Valley, and you know we like sort of start having. You know, startup companies that pull these pods together and do different. You know sort of collaborative things and that becomes a lobbying system and therefore more tax dollars are going to be allocated to that and therefore more money is going to be pulled away from public schools. So I think we have to really keep our eye on it and push to be open- minded. But yet you know make sure we're ready to go to battle thanks for that, I'm just going to add. Pamela Stewart has just said that she can't stay in the meeting. Pamela Stewart is the president of Cc3, and so I'm just to ask her to chime in and to thank her for coming in, because I know you know the schedule, changes and everything. I really appreciate it if you could just chime in on what's going on with Cec 5. hi Pam. Thank you so much for coming on. I really appreciate it you're very welcome, but if you can just can I just pause for a few moments, because I have to log in to let them know that I'm here, because it's seven o'clock and I like to shoot for sure all right. Thank you because I thought this year. Okay, so just give me a few moments. Okay, all right! Thank you! Yes, okay! So again, pam! No, I just wanted to ask him about Ps. 180, specifically, is that one of the schools that you were talking about that wants to that wants to send that is sending a letter saying that they're not ready for September 10.. No, I do not know that 180 has come out with a specific, a specific opposition letter. No 199 did, I think, Ps sorry, Ms 54 did, and I I'm hearing of a couple of others, but I have not. I have not heard of that, though, of course we've got multiple members in our parent leader groups that have kids at 180. So I shudder to think that we're you know when Cec 3's letter go out goes out tomorrow, which is a five page, or you know we kind of exhaust things as we normally do, and with all the unanswered questions that we have, and you know basically just sort of you know getting to the nuts and bolts of things that you know not only is in you know, is this. You know, like the safety measures have have not been figured out, yet we do not have some trust in whether or not you know Covid-19 is going to affect people when we start going into buildings, but we they've done just this piss- poor job with remote learning, and you know it's happening if it worked well in some places, works terribly in other places we talked earlier about, you know devices and connectivity. I mean you know why. All of that has not been at the at the forefront of the of the conversations with with school leaders is, you know, continue to amaze me but yeah, because I have three girls and two different schools. So that's all right. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for that question. Thanks for that question, I have some information about 180, so text me or email me, because I understand that they have a very progressive, a very responsive and a very, I think they might ironically marry 180 might be the model for how we want others to to really reopen. So give me, you know, give send me a text, you know you and I will connect on that because there's some good news coming out of 180. well Mr pop. Can you share that with me? Then too? That would be awesome with you know. No. I just so happened in a conversation I was having with someone yesterday and they used 180 as a model cool. I love it. That's what we should do right. We figure out what it works and then move it forward. Maybe you can share it with all of us, but right now I'm going to call no you're right. I'm Stewart I'm going to pull him Pam Stewart. Who only has a minute pam. Thank you so much you can. You can now speak Pamela you're on. Can you hear me now? Okay, I'm so sorry, I'm trying to juggle both meetings at the same time sure no problem but and just to say quickly, because I've attended so many meetings regarding the reopenings of schools and one of them is a meeting at believe it or not, Kim at 180.. I think the principal did a great job in informing everyone, and I'm just going to say that, because, like I said, I've been to so many meetings, so yes Mr Powell. I think she did a great job in terms of informing the parents and the school community on the process, and I have a little one in the background he's playing. So please forgive me, but I'm not confident at all or optimistic about the reopening of the public schools in New York City. The mere fact that the DOE would place our children's health and safety in jeopardy for the sake of funding. Is it's not okay, right and which I may add, does not translate to equitable resources and quality education in district five. It demonstrates further concerns are already vocalized by Uft Csa, medical experts, parents, students and teachers. I'm quite sure that everyone here tonight read articles in the news about schools and universities acrosss the nation that return to remote learning due to a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases among the student population. You know so I it bothers me to know that the chancellor will actually ignore those signs and for the sake of funding which he did admit at the path. If we do not reopen our schools, then we're going to lose funding. So what is more important to us? Is it the money or is it our child's health? Is it their safety and to Kim's point you know PPE? Is that that's not enough? You know it's not enough to know that you're going to get PPE for 30 days. We both know that just getting bare necessities for the cec does not happen in 30 days, right, there's a huge process. So what happens if the schools can not get the supplies on time? What does that translate to right? How? What would I look like and in terms of communication, it really bothers me that they are not transparent. On August 12 May of the box de Blasio said that 74 more than 700,000 students were enrolled by their parents for the blended learning plan, 26 of the students will be taking part in remote, only Digital learning the chancellor's rendition of this fax was significantly elevated at the checkmate right. He indicated that I think it was 82 or 86 kim. You could correct me of the parents actually used their fingers and he pointed his fingers to select blended learning for their children. Therefore, we are preparing those students really well. The real fact is the survey that he's referring to was created to capture the number of students that are taking part in 100 remote learning, not blended learning now, and the students and students that did not take the designs out for remote learning were automatically enrolled in blended learning. So now we have in district five, we have undocumented parents, english language, learners, students with special needs, students in shelters and transitional housing and they're, always the last the last in terms of thinking about their needs and services, they're, always a last door right. So therefore, they're not getting the communication. Every meeting that I attend, the parents are still asking the same dawn questions you know and it behooves you really and it's acrosss the district. So we can't say it's just to survive right. It's acrosss the district, so that says volumes right there that the parents are not have if the. If any of you went to the pet everyone. Basically questions yeah, basically questions absolutely so if they're still asking the basic questions and they're still telling you and more people are coming out and telling you that they're concerned they do not want to send your child in for blended learning, but then you're telling us that you have this large amount of students that are enrolled. You know that those facts are skewed and they're, not correct and you're, using that to prove your point. But basically what you're saying is the parents are stupid and they do not understand the process. You understand what I'm saying, and it's really bothering me because I feel like if, like I told a chancellor at the pet he's playing russian roulette without children's and I'm not happy, I'm not, I'm not convinced and the parents are not convinced at all. Yeah and school is supposed to open in two weeks, and it seems as if we're still back in March with decisions that need to be made exactly and they're putting additional pressure on the principles right, they're telling they're giving them things at the last minute right. So now you want the principal to go and go to each principal in each district. So if there's a sibling in another school, the prince's principles are now supposed to collaborate at the last minute I mean: is that fair? They do not even have time enough time. They already have deadlines. So why are you putting added pressure on them? Is that are you doing that? Because the union is speaking out, you know, but at the end of the day we need to come together. Everyone on facebook, everyone in on this zoo. We need to come together and we need to say enough is enough: our children come first safety come first, but what is the seat? What is Cec 5 planning if anything, to sort of ensure that when the students go back that they're going to go back into a space, that's safe and also that they have the you know, technical things that they need broadband laptop tablet. Are you guys, working with the DOE to ensure that these things are in place? So what we do Kim in district five? Is you know we're very deborah? That's definitely! Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! That's! Okay! That's! Okay! That's okay! One of the things that we're doing to surprise you we're very vocal, so we have a great relationship with the superintendent, any problems that come acrosss. My desk, I immediately. If it's in a meeting, I'm texting her. If it's, if it's, if I can call her, I call her. We try to I'm trying to get into the schools and be a part of that. Like him mentioned, we, the cecs, are not a part of those walkthroughs right and we already had to fight to actually get the slts to be a part of the walk- throughs, but some of the slts still are not a part of the walkthroughs. So that's a problem in itself, and this has been vocalized to the DOE and it's still an issue, so we do the best that we can and we vocalize it, and we make a point of informing the DOE that it's still an issue, and these are our needs in our district. All right, oh and thank you. I got to go to the officials right, so Gabriel has worried that our students are go on. I'm sorry, no Gabriel has been very supportive in helping us out in terms of needs for our district very helpful. I can't say the same for everyone else. I'm a little disappointed because I did reach out to each and every one of them, so I'm still reaching out to them for help. I'm not surprised, but can I ask you why the slt is not showing up for these walkthroughs. Some of the lcts have not been a part of the walkthrough. No, if they're still complaining to me, they get paid, they get paid for those positions. Why are they not doing the walkthroughs they? Well, so they hear the president of the or the PTA president who's on the slt is supposed to be a mandatory member of safety committees, but they've skirted they've kind of done a workaround for this process to create a different, a different committee. There I figured what they call them response. I do not know some sort of team like some different, some different name. I had this whole conversation at our meeting last Tuesday about this, because in my you know, on Cec3's opinion we agree with Pamela. It is in you know, utterly ridiculous to not have a parent who you know it only has to be. One person does not have to be the whole team, but someone who can then be the communication conduit to the rest of the community of parents, because at this point we do not. I mean what are we supposed to do? Just trust everything you say. No. You know right now. Objection right now, you know right now, I'd like to bring in Marquis Harrison into this conversation. He is a member of our executive board. He is first vice versa, but he's also an active member he's a teacher here in Harlem, but he's and he's also an active member of the uft. So Mark Marquis, hey, hi, everyone I'm outside so forgive me, but I think you're referring to the build and response team, the brt so yeah the brts do not necessarily include the PTA present. They can and a lot of schools have sidetracked PTA presidents by having the parent coordinators there and right with the parent coordinators. Rep are supposed to represent that interest of the parents, but it's not always yeah, it's basically, not always that way and in the basically, then, the parent coordinator is basically representation of the principle at that point, because they're hired by principals, I mean I've been listening to the conversation Deborah. If you have specific questions like from a teacher's perspective right now, the teachers I say like this- the uft right now is actually is really holding down the safety of both teachers and students, families and administrators, because the administrators are not going to strike, but they are very much in with us. There is very serious talk right now of the teachers going on strike and all the last two days I mean this is public knowledge, but the last two days all I've been working on is strike plans right so like that means that we are very seriously moving forward. If the mayor does not like stop, there, we've been doing walkthroughs a lot of the schools in district. Five do not even have half the things on the uft checklist, which I can send you a link for. We have our own checklist that we compiled with the CDC and from the CDC and all the other experts that we were consulting with and most of the schools are still not meeting those mandates in district five, as well as I'm hearing in other districts, all acrosss, the Bronx schools just do not have the PPE the supplies, the glass and all these things. Custodians do not know where these things are coming from, and so we do not know how it's going to be possible, at least for September 10th opening, and these dates do not seem realistic. The uft has been very consistent in saying like we're. Not we want to be in schools, we want schools open, but maybe that start date has to be much further back for planning. You know just to get where we're at the Uf. The DOE really had has not planned at all. You know, and it kind of it's very disheartening in my perspective, to hear the mayor- and I tend to like the chancellor, but it's been very disheartening- to hear their overconfidence in how they're projecting the preparation, when we just do not see that in the buildings and when we are going into the buildings I mean from every level I talk to superintendents, principals and and teachers. No one sees what the chancellor and the mayor are projecting that the schools have and from you know, one thing I shared with Deborah earlier is that this week, which is critical to opening schools on September 10th, if we were to have schools really open, so many principals, acrosss, the city and superintendents, are on vacation right. They were approved for a vacation well before so there's actually in many schools, there's actually zero planning going through. You know you can't get many of the superintendents and so like. This is the reality of what's going on and like no one's talking about that, a lot of people are on vacation this week and you can not even reach them. I've tried to contact several principals, but I'm being respectful that they are on vacation and they can not hear back. You know I do not want to interrupt their vacation, but that really leads you to ask the question. Well, where are schools and planning for reopening? Well because they are the implementers of what the DOE Central is saying that they have, and so I mean we're in a really bad situation. I think in regards to like being prepared for opening and this week, I'm you know: I've been surveying teachers, Acrosss district five and in my school for the drugs Academy and we're just trying to see what teachers need, because we're actually preparing them to think more. What do we need to be effective as educators or remote instruction, and really? How can we help our students that way, because it does not seem realistic, that schools could be opening and actually prepared to open for this, with all the safety precautions in place for September, 10th or 8th or the 8th or whatever you're going to say? No on that checklist that you have before. Thank you thanks for that. No problem, yeah. I'm listening on that checklist who have you all thought about, or I know you guys have thought about it, because, obviously you have a checklist which I do not think anybody. Obviously this administration is about, but as far as taking temperatures and like who would be designated to take temperatures or daily check- ins with the students when they come into schools or come into class, I should say yeah. So one thing that the U of T, we do not know we're saying that we did. We think it might be school aides and administrators for taking temperatures. But one thing the uft is also demanded and is on. Our checklist is that every student teacher administrator custodian school cook, anyone entering a school building should have to have been tested, at least within 10 days of opening, and then periodically. We need to have instant testing available for school buildings right where that people could be so that would that would actually require at least about 700,000 people getting tested, let's say between next Monday and the first day of school, pretty much, and we do not know if the students prepared for that type of you know that type of getting the results back and all those things, because we were saying that everyone needs to be tested within 10 days of the opening of school and, honestly, you know, there's even been division about that 10-day notice of like is 10 days, not enough. You're, like is that two. Is that cutting it? Because you know that ten days before you could test negative and then certainly within five days prior to contract, the virus or so on and so forth. So, but that's our current mandate, because we thought that was more realistic for testing in regards to everyone who would be entering a school building school AIDS, that's every profession that would be entering the school building and students, of course, and the city has not even said anything about that in regards to students. Being tested for, I have not heard anything in regards to you know that that's one of our checklists, that, in order for everyone to go into school, that we have students also being tested and everything of that nature yeah. Thank you thanks for that, and I just I just want to say thank you to Kim and Pam and marquise, but also I want to know what can we do and Charles has put this question in the chat as well. What can we do? As the you know, we all seem to know what the issues are. The problems are we clear? The school district is clearly is not prepared to open up on Supreme. What is it that we can do? What are some action items that we can take as a community board to help out Cec's, three and five, as well as you marquis and moving forward, because we are here, we have the chair of Community Board 10. Here we have the first vice chair and the second vice chair, who are here in support of this very important issue of back to school, and we are ready to work and get the work done. So this is marquis speaking. I mean one thing I think or two a couple things I think we do first, is that the U of T had a joint press conference with, like many civic organizations, including the Naacp, Dr Dukes, and so many others were on that call where they expressed to the city, their outrage in their preparation and their in their planning right, and I think that maybe you know we might want to think about a board letter and not and express an outrage, but maybe in expressing like we do not believe schools can open until right. These things are, and I have a checklist and things that we can perhaps put in that letter to say here's what we believe needs to be in place for our schools and our students to be safe, because at the end of the day, every teacher I've spoken to no everyone is tired of being home right now. Everyone wants to be out, but they do not want to be out if they think that their health is at risk and that's where people are scared right. You have teachers who are very scared because that they might contract something even if their health is good, but because so, and so their mother lives with them and so on and so forth or their. You know this and that any other, and so that's one of the main things. The other thing is, I think, calling the mayor's office or calling your city council person is important to say. We need to make sure that these things are in place. You know appropriate PPE testing and instant testing in schools so that when we have suspected cases where, how are those kids and those adults being tested immediately to so that we can actually cut, you know, trace and figure out, what's going to be in place when if they do have it and so on and so forth, and you know at the end of the day, I I'm telling you all that I look at it as a sense of the teachers are ready to, and I say this because I know the administrators feel the same way. We're actually on the same page. Csa is very much in favor with us on the teachers uft. However, the uft is willing, as going to sacrifice and willing to sacrifice our paychecks and everything else in violation of the possible detail law. If these things are not in place for the safety of children and ourselves right, you know- and so you know we are this- I never thought we went with. We went without a contract for five years and never went on strike, we're talking about something like this and because our lives depend on it, and so we might be, you know, walking the picket line and if we walk the picket line, the one thing you can also do is that walk with us, because we're going to need everyone there, because it's about the safety and health of our kids so we'll need everyone there to make sure that we are doing this together. If we have to do that. Okay, thanks for that, and you were going to say something wow I mean I would just want to echo everything. Marquise just said I mean absolutely the things that came to mind as you asked that question in addition to everything he just said, which I did not come up with, but I'm going to I'm going to jump on that bandwagon is to think about. Maybe the issue with the child care. You know the child care situation, even though it let's just let's just sort of make our piece with this idea that you know September 10th is not going to be the first day of school, which I think we you know kind of just have to you know sorry Mr Mayor, it's just not happening it. You know, there's just no way. This[ _ _] is not happening. I do not know what he thinks is going to happen on the 10th of September, but we are not going into school buildings. So what I think we should probably start talking about is in terms of community. You know community level, activism is our, you know. Is it what to do what we can do to help families that need support, and I think part of that is, you know potentially trying to help with broadband and Wi- fi working with you know any private companies and or elected officials that can help us bolster. You know the what we know to be the case I mean, even though the do we got people you know got ipads in the hands of everyone that needed them in the spring. We have a whole new, you know they say they're, getting them back and they're going to recycle them or whatever, but we know there's going to be a big, you know kind of gap there right. We have lots of kids entering kindergarten, lots of kids transitioning to new schools, I'm sure many of them have been broken and dropped, and you know so. We know we're going to need more devices. We know that we do not have Wi- fi for everyone and and then you know, I honestly kind of feel like this goes back to the beginning of our conversation earlier today when we started, you know, with this issue of like our street cleanliness and just doing things more together as a as a community. Maybe there is a you know like a broader kind of conversation that community board 10 can be having in Harlem about how we can all band together to you know to see the intersection of all of these issues for what they are and to kind of reimagine. The way that we support one another. I do not know what that comes in the form of in terms of like writing a letter or calling for you know the heads of our churches and our businesses- and you know to you, know, to get the schools together to really invoke the crisis for what it is. On the you know, the community level I mean it is a crisis of economic proportions, the crisis of education, it's a crisis of jobs and housing, but the thing that's going to pull us to pull us out of it is ourselves. You know we're not going to get help from anyone. It seems right. I agree. I agree, Pam Stewart, I'm not sure if you're still on the call, but if you could chime in, I know you had another call, I think, is her cec meeting tonight. It might be her council meeting, I do not actually know. No, I do not think it's a Tuesday. Is it? Well? I see our you know. Ours was not normally Tuesday, but we moved it because it was. We did not want to be on top of the pep last Wednesday, so we moved ours to Tuesday last week and I got lucky that you ended up having zoom problems during our Tuesday Cec meeting, because I was going to be doing a double- sided thing in there yeah. I know I remember and I hated it okay, so I think that we we have our we as a education committee on Community Board 10. I think we have our marching papers. I think that a board letter is a great idea. I'm going to look for marquis to send those specifics that the uft is asking. I will send a checklist over to you. Do not worry I'll, send it tonight I'll, put together a draft and then I'll send it to you marquise to edit and we'll try to get something. Let's try to get some something very loose together for the Exec board tomorrow or night. We can put together something very loose for exact board tomorrow and also, I think that we can ask members of the committee to call the mayor's office and call the our City Council representatives and the senators and people who are out here asking for our votes, that you know say they care about the community, which I believe that they do, and so we should reach out to them and see, and let them know of our concerns that our concerns mirror the concerns of the uft and of Cec Korean of Cec 5, because they came from one voice about the issues that are going on in the schools in the classroom and that voice. Is that they're not ready that the DOE is not done enough to ensure that things can come in safely for these students to be on the days that they're not physically in the classroom? So now we're looking at situations where, of course, kids young kids are going to be left home alone, which is a whole nother conversation. Because you talk about the economy restarting, so parents then have to go to work and if they go to work- and I know that teachers are not babysitters- I get that. But if there's nowhere for that kid to be it at a big after school program or school program or something, then the parent who the majority of parents do not have extra money. They count on their kids being in school to get that breakfast to get that much and that's another issue on the days that these 100,000 spaces that have not materialized, that the government that the mayor is talking about what happens with food who's going to deliver the food to these places, who's going to pick the food up from these schools. You know and deliver them to all of these small not- for- profits and these churches and these Rec centers who's going to be delivering all these breakfasts and lunches to make sure that these kids get this food in these spaces. So there's just so many unanswered questions around the reopening and it just. It pains me that it is in such disarray, and I literally think about this. About how our kids are just going to be so far behind, because we as adults and I'm saying all of us, the DOE, we can not get our crap together to ensure that our kids can get a halfway decent education. So we're going to work on this letter, we're going to call the mayor we're going to I'm glad to hear that gail Brewer is chiming in you know we're going to let her know as well that you know what we're doing I'm going to let our chair, Cecily, Harris, who's, supportive of everything that we do as well as other committees chime in now, since she has so generously given up her time to be on this call. Hi Chair, Harris, hello, everyone Deborah thanks for having this meeting committee, thanks for being here and Kim good to see you. So I do not know if anyone had a chance to look at the last borough board meeting, which was Thursday, but we did have, I think super superintendent rosales was there Marissa rosales, yeah whole presentation, all of the chairs and everyone that was watching the meeting. I'm extremely concerned about what was going on and really the lack of answers and it, and it was in many ways I do not want to say embarrassing, but it was. It got to a point where people were asking questions and they were like. Oh we'll get back to you, we're not quite sure bumbling at answers. It was really not a great presentation, and so it was very clear and gail ex expressed Madame Bro President expressed so vehemently that she was very displeased and very worried about what was going on and the lack of preparation. So she promised another meeting. It was unfortunate because the community was really getting engaged. There were a lot of questions being asked, but for I believe, Superintendent had some somewhere else to go and could not answer those questions. So a bunch of those questions were put into you know for her to get back to us and figure out. You know what, if there's anything can be done. So there was a plan to have another meeting, so I followed up with Athena and they're working on having another meeting a longer meeting. That just focuses on being able to answer some of those questions for the community, so hopefully that'll be coming up within the next week and I'll, let Deborah know, and I've also asked to be involved in the planning and so marquis and cam definitely will try to cultivate something so that it can be a more pointed and intentional meeting if they're able to get superintendent more rosales on the on another meeting. So I'll do that great. In the meantime, I did put the link for the face meeting on Thursday people should register for that and because every meeting and I've been I've been on a lot of those zoom calls too and to Pam's point. You know: parents, Pamela Stewart's, point parents are still asking easy questions because they're not getting answers that make sense to them and that's the problem. We're like going around in circles chasing our tails two weeks out from school reopening- and it's quite frightening to me quite frightening to me. So thank you. Sicily is there anything that you wanted to add Charles, so I wanted to just first of all compliment Mary for making sure that we connected the homeless situation with what's happening within our schools and Kim for reminding us, as you did Madam chair. You know that we're talking about food scarcity, we're talking about a tremendous need for some of our children to take advantage of boot, op opportunities and sometimes school is not the best option, but it certainly is a food option. So, thanks for connecting all of the dots, I did see that my vice chair of Housing, Donna Gill, has had her hand raised. So I'm going to ask Donald to weigh in, but I think you've done a sorry really in this meeting really laying out all of the you know the connections and as I put into the chat, we have an executive committee meeting. I am a second vice chair, an additional degree of housing and I think we're ready to take action with some recommended steps and we know that action, Marquis and Deborah and Kim and others will and sicily will have to be evolving, meaning whatever we decide tomorrow. Night might be just the first salvo and some continuous and intentional weigh- in on what's happening with our children, our future. So thanks ever for, but I want to defer to you know my dear friend Donna, I'm sorry Donna, that's, okay, that's fine! I had. I totally agree with everything that everyone has said and I do believe. Yes, we do need to send a letter out, but I wanted to ask Marquis what has he or the uft heard about the nurses that the mayor touted that he would have a nurse in each school because I'm not hearing anything about that and I do not know if they've actually that has actually materialized. So that was my question. Really we've lost mark we've lost marquis, okay, so I think also he has to step off cam bright. No, I'm just saying I think in our letter we should also address that issue, because that is okay, a health issue, and it's not for you, know the school, the aid, that's in the kitchen to take the temperatures of these children or to as well yeah as well as so as well as social workers. Exactly so that's my point and I think in all that thank you issues as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that. Deborah I'll also shoot over to you the some of the nursing updates that we put together at Cec3. You know we've been working on this issue for a long time. District 3 is, it has not had the worst situation relative to some of the other districts in the city in terms of vacancies, but but the supervisor of nurses from district 3 and the lower part of district 5 has become a colleague of mine, a really dear friend. In fact. Actually- and she- you know she retired, but she's- still sort of consulting on this issue, and the number that the mayor is getting in terms of the vacancies and how he's planning to fill them is also a lie. It's not for 350 or whatever. The number is, and he thinks he's going to be able to hire in the next couple of weeks. It's closer to 700, because there are all these nurses that are retiring and or needing medical, accommodations and and what they're doing right now is they're recruiting nurses from around the country, because they can not find nurses to hire here in in the area. So they're we're. What we're doing is we're paying for relocation. Expenses, we're paying for hotel stays, we're paying for we're, paying per diem food and then sort of top dollar for nurses. Simply because when we have bundled bungled, the the nursing professional kind of relationship to our school system in such a bad way over the last 10 years that that do we just can't hire people. It's awful. It's like three to five grand per week per nurse. You know so, but they can't they can't get it done in in two weeks. They just they do not all like. If you look at, I do not think so, either yeah there's too many variables that are unanswered. I do not think that I do not think that they can be done in two weeks either I'm going to leave it right there. I think that was a lot. Thank you Kim! So much. Thank you. Pam I know. Marquis is gone, he's going to send me some information and we I'm going to work when I get the email from Marquis, I'm going to work on a very loose draft that I can get back to him that we can present at exec. For tomorrow I mean, as Charles mentioned it's going to be something that's a working document, something that you know will start us off. Tamara said that her union has a letter to the governor, Kim's Cec-3 has a letter, and so I think that if we inundate these politicians with these letters from all these different organizations- and they know that we're serious and that we're awake and that we're watching and that we see and that we vote hopefully we can get some some positive responses that will keep our kids as well as our teachers safe, because everybody needs to be safe, which in turn keeps their families safe, because when they leave, they go home and they take whatever it is they've gotten. So I'm going to I'm going to leave it right there. If nobody else has anything else to say, I'm going to end the meeting you're on me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So I had some other things on my agenda, but there are only a couple of people from my committee and I'm going to I'm going to sort of leave those to the sign to try to plan something separate just for the community, but I believe that this was a great productive conversation and Tamara. I will get you that information over to you I'll get that information over to you that you asked for. Oh thanks kim no problem. Yeah messy Jim has put her email address and her phone number in the chat, and I can get over to you. Pam's I'll, send you Pam's email address, and so with that, if nobody else has anything to offer, I mean else to say I'm going to wish you a good night and a blessed evening, good night, everybody. Thank you good night. Thank you.
