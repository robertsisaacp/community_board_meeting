One is from the frederick douglass boulevard alliance about open streets, So I'm, gonna, move along in the agenda for a new applicant sla applicant for neighborhood brulee coffee shop You know we ask for you to submit a form to submit the sla application to us while trying to not be a burden on small businesses in our district at this time, but actually trying to figure out ways to move this process along We have submitted a an opinion form for committee members to vote whether they would like to see a business come before us and the vote Everyone in committee, community board 10 frederick douglas boulevard at 140th street just opened primarily for business.
Thank you, madam chair, for that update for frederick douglass boulevard alliance about open street 112 to 120th I have requested for open data to do a training for the community in terms of data and what data is available to help us try to understand, what's happening in our communities and to be able to use that data when creating resolutions for problems, so they are going to give us one of their short trainings.
This is open data for all new yorkers The director of open data at doit, So I, won't go into that much detail, but I think one of the best ways to sort of give people information is to walk through these things live My plan is to just go through the open data portal and touch on a few key topics: That's searching the open data website, creating maps creating visualizations and then just letting you know some of the intricate details that can be sort of tricky when navigating the website things like the different domains, you can see and then pointing out different resources that are available to you.
There are some things in restaurant inspection results that may be a little squeamish for some of us, but I think it's good information to know to make informed decisions There are a number of things that you can see, and it may not be that intuitive, but to start so scrolling down here on the screen So, if you're new to open data, you can click on this link right here and just get a quick overview of what data is.
That stuff will make a lot more sense, so for right now, what we're going to do and there's a number of ways to move forward to get to the data you're looking for you can go into this tab you can go to this tab up here with regards to data now the reason that I'm going to go here to this data tab is because there's more information that I want to show you we have this filtered here for new data sets, so you can see some of the data that's been published most recently Currently.
So you can search for the data set that you're looking for by category So, if you, if you know that you want a map, maybe you're, looking for a specific community board district or a council district or if you're, looking for some sort of a filter, whatever you're looking for you can find it here, more than likely you're going to be looking for a data set or you're going to be looking for a map, We have what we call data collections, So a lot of times.
So here you know, I guess the big world issue right now is the coronavirus and cobit 19 that's going on, so you could click there and you could find any city data that you're looking for around covid19 information around the department of buildings and electrical permits, things around motor vehicle collisions Also.
So, that's going to take you some time, but I'm going to show you exactly how to filter that, how to make the data set a lot smaller and make it a lot easier to navigate we're going to click on view data, and this brings us to the actual data set This data, when you're, navigating it most of what you're gonna be looking for, is in this upper right hand corner on this utility bar over here and by default When you click on this, you actually get the drop down of all of the different columns in the data One of the things that I always like to do is make the data set a smaller, subset We are going to take this second column here, which is create a date gonna hover over it and click it, and now we're gonna go into our search clause so to make it a little bit smaller to deal with I'm going to say.
For instance, let's bring up community board If we scroll further down within the data set, we can bring up the compute community board and I'm just going to type in 10 Manhattan and again so we went from 23.3 million records down to about Now we have all of the service requests in place from july 1st, on in community board 10 in Manhattan, and then just for the sake of this training I'm just going to do one more filter So the complaint type is where you see like the different things that people are calling in for noise fireworks different things, The search clause is because I knew that I could find 10 Manhattan.
But sometimes, if you don't know the exact wording of something or if it's sort of like this noise space, hyphen space vehicle you're not going to find it So again, we went from 23 million records to 73 to about 1600 and now we're down to 501 service requests This is just some quick basic filtering on how you can navigate a data set, choose the appropriate search that you're looking for to find the things that you're looking for.
So taking us back to the earlier home page to create an account in the upper right hand, corner You can save the map that you have in place and always be able to come back to it, and then I mentioned earlier for the developers and data scientists and people who like to do a little bit more advanced usages of data.
It's very simple, probably take about a minute of your time, and that way you can create an account for the open data portal I'm just hitting forward again going back to the data sets I'm back to the data sets that we are looking at So again, we were in the data tab and then we clicked on the most popular data sets, give my wi-fi, and then we were looking at the 311 data set So right here, the first drop down that you'll see is for creating a visualization So. It brings you to this screen that can be a little bit intimidating at first, but it's really not that bad So you have within the three on one data set.
So, to start along the top of the page over here, you have your different options for the visualization You want to create bar charts, column, charts, pie, charts So this allows us to map the data that we're looking at and then we're going to work, we're going to apply a filter similar to how we did in the data set to get to where we're going So for those of you who may have used the open data portal in the past, you'll notice that this visualization tool is a little bit different than before So you could just map all the data that we mentioned before, but again you're looking at 23.3 million records, so we're just going to recreate some of the similar filters that we did earlier.
I can email it to friends and they can see the same map that I put together so just sort of pretty powerful tools that you can use to help visualize and display data I'm going to remove this filter on community board 10 It looks like the majority of the requests that came in for illegal fireworks were in Manhattan also over here, I guess in Queens over here in Brooklyn, but I guess, city wide The majority of the complaints came in Manhattan and I.
But going back to the home page Additionally there are like I mentioned videos from other resources, so we highlight certain things that give different perspectives on how to use the portal, how to filter how to map some interesting stories that people put together around the data We navigated the data tab earlier and that's where you can find the different data sets that you were looking for Looking for in the about tab.
Wrapping up a little bit We were in the learn tab: how to how to find that different information to contact us So you can find those over here and if you have any questions, you can always send us a note, so you can type in your name, your email, your organization, if you're affiliated with anyone and then anything that you're looking for so, if you're looking to request a data set, you found an error If, you want to request another training, I mean you have stacy's contact information , We have about eight or nine people monitoring the inquiries that come in.
