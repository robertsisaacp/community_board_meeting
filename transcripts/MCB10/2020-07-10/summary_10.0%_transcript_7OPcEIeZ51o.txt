We ask for you to submit a form to submit the sla application to us while trying to not be a burden on small businesses in our district at this time, but actually trying to figure out ways to move this process along We have submitted a an opinion form for committee members to vote whether they would like to see a business come before us and the vote.
You was close by teachers will come in people going to work that from the neighborhood on the bus seems like there's a whole different.
You know thing going on where people like you, know, People, who are getting up at seven a.m, is now like the 9 a.m, like the new 7 a.m. You know so like the purpose and destination is not there, but you know, generally speaking the hours I opened, it has been a little rise and some clientele people.
I, think that may be a concern, and especially no community-based organizations to interface in case there's any altercations So I believe that open data stacy garner is on the call at the moment.
Try to understand, what's happening in our communities and to be able to use that data when creating resolutions for problems.
Basically, just the one-stop shop portal for all city data in from the city, agencies and albert, is going to show you exactly where you can find it, how you can use it to solve civic problems, just kind of the basics of navigating it filtering it down, exporting it all the beginner steps so that you can start poking around on your own You should be seeing a web browser with the open data portal.
It working now?, And I'm, the director of open data at doit, So I, won't go into that much detail, but I think one of the best ways to sort of give people information is to walk through these things.
My plan is to just go through the open data portal and touch on a few key topics: That's searching the open data, website, creating maps, creating visualizations and then just letting you know some of the intricate details that can be sort of tricky when navigating the website things like the different domains So I know that I'll do this training I'll run through all of these things, but I want you to be able to go back and access this information for future reference to share it with folks and things of that sort.
Is our opening site We, try to tag our data with as many keywords as possible so that you can find the information that you're looking for.
So, if you're new to open data, you can click on this link right here and just get a quick overview of what data is Then we also have sort of a step-by-step road map for how you can filter in a data set and find other key information that I mentioned these additional resources.
They, want to access city data to create those sorts of applications, and that's usually done through.
I'm gonna come touch on this project gallery a little bit later, because I think after I show you all of the interesting ways that you can filter and map data.
That stuff will make a lot more sense, so for right, now, what we're going to do and there's a number of ways to move forward to get to the data you're looking for you can go into this tab, And you can type in whatever you're looking for or you can go to this tab up here with regards to data now, The reason that I'm going to go here to this data tab is because there's more information that I want to show you.
If you ever have the time we have about 2 800 data sets on the open data portal from about 80, different city agencies and offices.
If you know that you want a map, maybe you're, looking for a specific community board district or a council district or if you're, looking for some sort of a filter, whatever you're looking for you can find it here, more than likely you're going to be looking for a data set or you're going to be.
So, a lot of times, city agencies make data available and there are a number of data sets that are all in relation to one thing.
So here you know, I, guess the big world issue Right now is the coronavirus and cobit 19 that's going on, so you could click there and you could find any city data that you're looking for around Covid-19 information around the department of buildings and electrical permits, things around motor vehicle, collisions.
If we scroll further down within the data set, we can bring up the compute community board, And I'm, just going to type in 10 Manhattan and again so we went from 23.3 million records down to about Now we have all of the service requests in place from July 1st, on in community board 10 in Manhattan, and then just for the sake of this training, I'm, just going to do one more filter.
So the complaint type is where you see like the different things that people are calling in for noise fireworks.
If you don't know the exact wording of something or if it's sort of like this noise, space, hyphen space vehicle You're not going to find it So again, we went from 23 million records to 73 to about 1600 and now we're down to 501 service requests.
You can save the map that you have in place and always be able to come back to it, and then I mentioned earlier for the developers and data scientists and people who like to do a little bit more advanced usages of data.
You want to create bar charts, column, charts, pie, charts, I mean you know, charts galore, but what we're going to do for right now is this one over here that sort of looks like a globe.
For those of you who may have used the open data portal in the past, you'll notice that this visualization tool is a little bit different than before.
Commenting like these are all features that are available on the open data site that you have access to, but going back to the home, page.
Additionally, there are like I, mentioned videos from other resources, so we highlight certain things that give different perspectives on how to use the portal, how to filter how to map some interesting stories that people put together around the data.
Last year we talked about our strategy for the next decade for open data the year before that we talked about data at work, So, some interesting information where you can just sort of see how, when you're walking down the street, there's so much data that you're seeing so when you're.
There are data points that you're, seeing that you're, probably going to find in a data set from the open data portal.
And I can open it up for more questions- But this is our project gallery, and this is just a few examples of different ways that people took the data that they found on the open data portal and they made use of it.
You know communities in williamsburg about zoning maps, about renting apartments in new york city people have taken all sorts of information from the portal and created really interesting projects around them, and I.
We can make sure it's on the open data portal, so we're collaborating with all the agencies all the time on stuff, like this.
