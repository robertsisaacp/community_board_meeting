We ask for you to submit a form to submit the SLA application to us while trying to not be a burden on small businesses in our district at this time, but actually trying to figure out ways to move this process along We have submitted a an opinion form for committee members to vote whether they would like to see a business come before us and the vote.
This time, I'm going to open the floor for committee members and board members to ask questions.
It was part of the Clientele School acrosss, you was close by teachers will come in people going to work that from the neighborhood on the bus seems like there's a whole different.
Try to understand, what's happening in our communities and to be able to use that data when creating resolutions for problems, so they are going to give us one of their short trainings.
You can use it to solve civic problems, just kind of the basics of navigating it filtering it down, exporting it all the beginner steps so that you can start poking around on your own You should be seeing a web browser with the open data portal.
My plan is to just go through the open data portal and touch on a few key topics: That's searching the open data, website, creating maps, creating visualizations and then just letting you know some of the intricate details that can be sort of tricky when navigating the website things like the different domains So I know that I'll do this training I'll run through all of these things, but I want you to be able to go back and access this information for future reference to share it with folks and things of that sort.
If, like the speed is not working or if we're not downloading something as fast as you may have normally seen, , now, I'm on the homepage for the open data, site.
Is our opening site We, try to tag our data with as many keywords as possible so that you can find the information that you're looking for.
So, if you're new to open data, you can click on this link right here and just get a quick overview of what data is, and then we also have sort of a step- by- step road map for how you can filter in a data set and find other key information that I mentioned these additional resources.
We maintain the information on it, but they provide that technology behind it What we also provided is resources that come from other organizations that are also big on open, data, So from beta NYC NYC city map from github.
They want to access city data to create those sorts of applications, and that's usually done through.
I'm going to come touch on this project gallery a little bit later, because I think after I show you all of the interesting ways that you can filter and map.
That stuff will make a lot more sense, so for right, now, what we're going to do and there's a number of ways to move forward to get to the data you're looking for you can go into this tab, And you can type in whatever you're looking for or you can go to this tab up here with regards to data now, The reason that I'm going to go here to this data tab is because there's more information that I want to show you.
If you ever have the time we have about 2,800 data, sets on the open data portal from about 80, different city agencies and offices.
If you know that you want a map, maybe you're, looking for a specific community board district or a council district or if you're, looking for some sort of a filter, whatever you're looking for you, can find it here, more than likely you're going to be looking for a data set or you're going to be looking for a map,.
So, a lot of times, city agencies make data available, and there are a number of data sets that are all in relation to one thing.
So here you know, I, guess the big world issue Right now is the coronavirus and cobit 19 that's going on, so you could click there and you could find any city data that you're looking for around Covid-19 information around the Department of buildings and electrical permits, things around motor vehicle, collisions.
Any questions at this point before I move forward and look into another data set great Most popular data set I'd say on the portal is probably- It's already highlighted here- 311 service, requests.
And I'm going to click in this little bar right here, and it prompts me with a calendar, And I'm, just going to say for the sake of this training after July 1st If you look at the total down here at the bottom of the screen, we went from 23.3 million records to 72,861 records.
If we scroll further down within the data set, we can bring up the Compute, Community, Board and I'm just going to type in 10 Manhattan and again so we went from 23.3 million records down to about Now we have all of the service requests in place from July 1st, on in community board.
So the complaint type is where you see like the different things that people are calling in for noise.
You can save the map that you have in place and always be able to come back to it, and then I mentioned earlier for the developers and data scientists and people who like to do a little bit more advanced usages of data.
You want to create bar charts, column, charts, pie, charts, I mean you know, charts galore, but what we're going to do for right now is this one over here that sort of looks like a globe.
So this allows us to map the data that we're looking at Then we're going to work, we're going to apply a filter similar to how we did in the data set to get to where we're going.
For those of you who may have used the open data portal in the past, you'll notice that this visualization tool is a little bit different than before.
You can also add another fly out value, so we're looking at noise, but we can also just put emphasis on maybe like the agency that it was routed to We see that this was a noise complaint, we'll zoom in a little bit more, and it was routed to the department of environmental protection.
If, you forget any of the information that I mentioned, creating a map creating a chart, commenting like these are all features that are available on the open data site that you have access to, but going back to the home, page.
Additionally, there are like I, mentioned videos from other resources, so we highlight certain things that give different perspectives on how to use the portal, how to filter how to map some interesting stories that people put together around the data.
There are data points that you're, seeing that you're, probably going to find in a data set from the open data portal.
But this is our project gallery, and this is just a few examples of different ways that people took the data that they found on the open data portal and they made use of it.
You know: communities in Williamsburg about zoning maps about renting apartments in New, York City people have taken all sorts of information from the portal and created really interesting projects around them, and I.
I know that was a lot of information to digest in one shot again any questions that I can , while I'm here, I can answer in terms of using the Portal just anything generally about open data in New, York City.
First, at first hearing those questions, I do not think all of that information exists as a city data set.
I. Do not think a lot of that information exists in full, but we could probably find parts of it from data from the housing authority, The housing development right so So that's in terms of housing.
We can make sure it's on the open data portal, so we're collaborating with all the agencies all the time on stuff, like this.
