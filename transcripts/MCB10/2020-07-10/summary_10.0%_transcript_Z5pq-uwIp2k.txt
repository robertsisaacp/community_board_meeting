You know if somebody told me last year this time that we would all be stuck in our houses for six months and that people would be on the streets on about police brutality, I'd be like you're, crazy, great I'm, so happy about the second part, and it's just been really interesting.
There We've been we've been kind of with networking with them for the last few months, especially kind of trying to get people out of harm's way with Kobe we've been doing, and it's like Cuomo is You know, because I've been sort of forever been trying to move our brand from actual innocence to presumption of innocence, which is by the way the first question.
This discourse should exemplify a strong community and get engagement around any possible themes and social justice concepts, and then we want to bring the abstract to the concrete in the form of a permanent exhibit, which may mean an interim exhibit before we get to an permanent exhibit, and we also would like to respect how that exhibit will meld with the countryside intent of Central Park.
We want to keep it in context, and this meeting this evening is to engage people in thinking together how to work through the message to be conveyed by the exhibit and how can voice is and opinions be reconciled, because there will be pros and cons so as a focus of a guiding question during tonight's panel discussion.
And I, just want to echo kind of all the sentiments that Rebecca just laid out about the incredible importance of this effort and of the effort to concretize and build a monument to the types of things that we see happening in our criminal legal system day in and day out and in the incredible miscarriage of justice and the incredible tragedy.
The first thing that comes to mind to me is that you know the criminal legal system that we have right now is one that thing has always failed to give credence to that notion of a presumption of innocence, particularly thinking about people with black and brown skin and, in fact, I think.
What happened to the exonerated vibe and what's happening with respect to criminal legal system and thinking about race, is that it helps people understand and confront the fact that we live in a country that was go on.
We see happening even those people who are who are arrested and convicted and sense for things that they actually may have done, where we have a system that punish that people bar guevara for far too long confuses vengeance with justice, confuses retribution and anger and rage with the need to actually help people move forward and advance in their lives, And. You know where we're on the zoom culprit, because we're in the midst of a global pandemic.
Because of all these other things that we have failed to invest in our communities: health, education, employment, housing, all the types of things that we know that people need in order to avoid any interaction with the criminal ecosystem, but also to live, productive, happy and healthy, lives.
Do you repair the harms you've done when you have a system that run roughshod over so many people's rights, so in Google's lies It's really destroyed communities and families without any public safety benefit, how they might define those words for anyone, and so for me, there's an incredibly important conversation and I'm really just too old to be a part of it and grateful that folks have undertaken.
The kinds of monuments that we want to build like this one and sort of next to that is sort of an opportunity, I think at this very monument or exhibit to kind of reimagine a criminal justice system, and what that might look like, On sort of a lot of these themes, right sort of all of the kind of unaddressed, social ills that we don't want to kind of deal with in our society that end up being kind of thrown into a criminal justice system.
I think that what we're trying to do is not only shrink the footprint of law, enforcement of police and prosecutors in people's lives, eliminate the need for prisons and jails, and you know, stop putting people in cages as though they're animals trying to figure out like what are the needs that people have or to ensure that they're gonna build amid the type of lives that we all drive for describe.
There never be any type of violence that harm would never come to anybody at all, and How. Do we kind of drill down into the psyche of individuals and work with them to deal with the trauma that they've been dealing with, which is often really the root cause of the types of interactions that most readily give rise to a lot of outrage from the public and others as someone who's been traumatized in their life, and that trauma has been carried on and passed on generation to the point where their response to some stimulus is fight-or-flight, miss Allah, so reckoning and dealing with the individual trauma that people who fell over the course of their lifetimes, so I think you know part of it to me- When I, think about a criminal legal, system, I think about system.
It's much easier for us to lock someone away for decades on end, then, to try and intervene at some point early on in their life, invest in their community, invest in the types of things that we know that they might need it's much easier to say.
Think one of the key points was really sort of the idea of communities also driving the kind of society that they want to live in, and you know, as somebody who does criminal justice policy.
Doing right now seems to be working, so The story of the village revealed itself around the time that the African burial ground was revealed in lower Manhattan and it seemed like suddenly, the story of the early African presence in New York was being revealed all over the city and so through a lot of research work that was inspired by the historical documentation and reveal by Roy rosensweig and see Blackmar, who wrote the book the park and the people within that book.
There is a section on the story of Seneca village and at that time they were using all kinds of repositories throughout the city, including the New York Historical Society, and at that time I was an education curator and a colleague of mine, Grady, Turner and I, and other members of the Historical Society Decided that it would be very useful for people to you tell the learn about Seneca village through an exhibition, and so as we hope that story.
That was on display at the New York Historical, Society long story short and moving forward after many years of working with community to sort of guide us as to how we might establish and develop more of a relationship with the New York City Parks, Department, Parks and Recreation, as well as the Central Park Conservancy, that we might be able to approach them to offer up research design and an effort.
We were trying to make sure that we were hitting the right levels where the community would have lived if that were at all possible, and so through a lot of mapping through a lot of geophysics, we were able to determine that we had identified locations that were likely to produce artifacts of the village, and so we had faced a few more obstacles, Both, the fumer requirements by the powers that be the city powers-that-be, but eventually as partners, because we brought them in along the way to keep them aware of what was going on and by bringing in members of the greater community.
And, there's still a lot of work to do in terms of sort of telling stories about the people that lived in Seneca, Village, because, prior to our exploration and our continued research.
If you could just do the same thing in your group, which would be exhibit design and then we're going to have a fourth group for the Seneca village, One of the important things for us is a piece that speaks to the changes within our community and how we can make African American people as humane as possible, because you know part of these issues that relate to justice.
They have a museum, African, American Museum regarding that period of time, but they show within this park, setting a number of statues and they show a number of dialogues between people who were representing in this particular climate of fighting for civil rights, and it was very interesting when you see it You see like first It's also in to take away something in the learning experience behind it that talks to how we move forward as a community.
It goes through the gamut and you can humanize the family members that are in this type of situation, because as black people I do feel that we are a dehumanized group and it helps people to think that different types of things can happen to us and be done to us, because that's who we are- We are more than that and the exhibit should express itself in a way that says these people and this community are more than that.
You know people might walk around and see something about their rights or whatever it is going forward that they can walk away with and think about and move forward.
And how do we prevent these things from happening and explain that you know that's something that we're gonna work on once we get the basics in place And We talked about how important it is, have a support system in place for anyone listening car serrated, Because not all had not all of the exonerated five had the family support and unity to help them through this trauma, because it was a traumatic experience And I think we agree with all of these things outline around what the design should look like, but at Imola also had some concerns around what would be the timeline?
So I think that if we have something like that, I want to really know about the permanency of it and the way that we can show that the community is actually what I Donna you're on mute Donna if you're still there.
I. Don't know what that means, because, as the so called gatekeepers of the park, they have ideas about what is to be What will remain in the park and I would caution that, whatever we end up doing with this particular with the exhibition that we want to have when thinking about Interactive's and things of that sort, we have to really think about the elements.
So you know how do you address all of those needs and be fair, but I do think that it is time for black folk to be able to have serious, say.
