This discourse should exemplify a strong community and get engagement around any possible themes and social justice concepts, and then we want to bring the abstract to the concrete in the form of a permanent exhibit, which may mean an interim exhibit before we get to an permanent exhibit, and we also would like to respect how that exhibit will meld with the countryside intent of Central Park We want to keep it in context, and this meeting this evening is to engage people in thinking together how to work through the message to be conveyed by the exhibit and how can voice is and opinions be reconciled, because there will be pros and cons so as a focus of a guiding question during tonight's panel discussion So. That's our focus question to help us in reaching some sort of conclusions or consensus about things so looking at an exhibit in Central, Park I'm, going to be a public art exhibit and any art exhibit is a place.
For those people who have would like to see the panel discussion So, you know as I was thinking about this and sort of the protests that are right now, calling for police accountability and criminal justice reform, and it's really sweeping the nation.
Police are allowed to lie during interrogations right now, creating just feelings of complete hopelessness and inevitability for people that are being interrogated so we're working together on trying to ban that as a practice by law here in New, York and and I just want to echo kind of all the sentiments that Rebecca just laid out about the incredible importance of this effort and of the effort to concretize and build a monument to the types of things that we see happening in our criminal legal system day in and day out and in the incredible miscarriage of justice and the incredible tragedy.
The first thing that comes to mind to me is that you know the criminal legal system that we have right now is one that thing has always failed to give credence to that notion of a presumption of innocence, particularly thinking about people with black and brown skin and Reality is that we have a criminal legal system that presumes that attaches is a production of guilt to your race in to your skin color, a presumption of dangerousness, a presumption of criminality Some, harsh control in some way and I'd say you know almost all of it really is part and parcel the way in which our criminal legal system came to be built in this nation All the laws and all the rules and regulations that were put in place to enforce enslavement, determining whether or not you can learn to read we could gather with without you could have children to become get married If you could eat in a particular place when that system fell, they devolved into Jim Crow all the laws that were dealt with when we think about segregation, although that kind of architecture was all enforced and all upheld and propagated by the criminal legal system.
The first kind of police officers and modern-day policing evolved from people who were deputized to try and catch people who were trying to escape and in to freedom along racial lines, and so the entire criminal legal system is really wrapped up and rooted in this effort to control and marginalize people colored with black and brown people and that ideology, even though you know many of us of course, rejected it's still so intimately woven into the fabric of our country It's such a part of the way in which people view the world today I'm a particularly law enforcement views the world today and views the people who were they are interacting with on a day to day basis that think that presumption of innocence innocent that notion that there is a production of innocence on this Solberg is often overcome by those ideologies that really have helped to build.
Where we have a system that punish that people bar guevara for far too long confuses vengeance with justice, confuses retribution and anger and rage with the need to actually help people move forward and advance in their lives, and you know where we're on the zoom culprit, because we're in the midst of a global pandemic, It's important to recognize that it's also reflected by the incredible distortion impacted that pandemic black and brown communities.
Think one of the key points was really sort of the idea of communities also driving the kind of society that they want to live in, and you know, as somebody who does criminal justice policy work.
It's just a wonderful theme, I think too, of kind of bringing the community in to determine the kind of reimagine criminal justice system and world that they want to live in, and you know, I know that you were just an incredible leader on the Seneca village project and really sort of navigated It started with the unveiling or the reveal of the Seneca village project and the that started at the New York Historical Society The story of the village revealed itself around the time that the African burial ground was revealed in lower Manhattan and it seemed like suddenly the story of the early African presence in New York was being revealed all over the city and so through a lot of research work that was inspired by the historical documentation and reveal by Roy rosensweig and see Blackmar, who wrote the book the park and the people within that book.
The community was very perplexed and dumps gobsmacked because they thought they knew everything about New, York, City, history and you know people were angered because they didn't know the story of Seneca village The exhibition went up and it gained a lot of notice and people wanted to hear more and be a part of it So the idea of creating more opportunities for education came up and there was an effort to bring the community on board to sort of see what would be of interest to them and advisory board was a staff Was that included people from academia, as well as churches and from the local communities to sort of guide us in what could possibly be a way forward to help people to learn more about the community?
We were able to do several test pits to see if we could indeed find factual remains of the village and of the community prior to the actual digging, though it took steps to do that, we had to do ground-penetrating radar We had to do soil coring to find out if we could hit on the original soil and the original landscapes, because when they created the park, they brought in a lot of landfill to build up the park So, we were trying to make sure that we were hitting the right levels where the community would have lived if that were at all possible, and so through a lot of mapping through a lot of geophysics, we were able to determine that we had identified locations that were likely to produce artifacts of the village, and so we had faced a few more obstacles, both the fumer requirements by the powers that be the city powers-that-be, but eventually as partners, because we brought them in along the way to keep them aware of what was going on and by bringing in members of the greater community.
I. Think, whatever was the exhibit we finally come up with, should also be offering solutions and offering a sense of hope and always a sense of unity will ultimately create victory and little unity will suppress and defeat evil things that are being perpetuated on innocent people that me and others that I would want to engage other creative people so that whatever we come up with, that it is dynamic, very engaging and speaks to not only the empty What must happen so that that's the creative challenge that myself and whatever team I pulled together along with community board.
One of the important things for us is a piece that speaks to the changes within our community and how we can make African American people as humane as possible, because you know part of these issues that relate to justice.
They have a museum, African American Museum regarding that period of time, but they show within this park, setting a number of statues and they show a number of dialogues between people who were representing in this particular climate of fighting for civil rights, and it was very interesting when you see it and you see like first That talks to how we move forward as a community How, we move forward to make sure that this doesn't happen again, how we educate our people going forward as well.
They have this thing called the door of no return, and then they have a door of return So. It goes through the gamut and you can humanize the family members that are in this type of situation, because as black people I do feel that we are a dehumanized group and it helps people to think that different types of things can happen to us and be done to us because that's who we are, we are more than that and the exhibit should express itself in a way that says these people and this community are more than that.
After so that was the first Second message was that up: There is absence of african-american education in the curriculum and the life experience of black people has been one of criminal justice and prosecution that has consistently in different forms, whether its economic, educational and then the last one which we didn't get to, because that 43 second talk came and kicked everyone out, I think we were about to pay forward and something needs to be done to help the community or some kind of emotion that evokes those four witness from which this atrocity happened to feel hope and expect that there is a way forward and something will be done, and so that's what we have for the beginning of the message to be conveyed.
That black and brown builders be a part of that project, absent the regulate the requirements of the city in the state's MWBE enterprises going way above and beyond that, and that was again reiterated by prince woods, joined us previously on all of our committee meetings and then finally, mr Patterson recommended that we look at Frederick, Law Olmstead said who built the part of the park to talk about the fact that the New York City went from having a thriving community that was contributed into the economic outlook of the city and they built Central Park They decided to build a park over this village and displace all of these people, and that was in 1850 seven, and here we are we're still talking about the same type of behaviour.
