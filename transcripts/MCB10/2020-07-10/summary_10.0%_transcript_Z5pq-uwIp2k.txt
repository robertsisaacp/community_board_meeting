I was, if somebody told me last year this time that we would all be stuck in our houses for six months and that people would be on the streets on about police brutality, I'd be like you're, crazy, great I'm, so happy about the second part, and it's just been really interesting.
You know That's not going to be around like what we want doing in that way and then work with these advocates.
There We've been we've been kind of with networking with them for the last few months, especially kind of trying to get people out of harm's way with Kobe we've been doing, and it's like Cuomo is You know, because I've been sort of forever been trying to move our brand from actual innocence to presumption of innocence, which is by the way the first question I'm going to turn to you around tonight.
This discourse should exemplify a strong community and get engagement around any possible themes and social justice concepts, and then we want to bring the abstract to the concrete in the form of a permanent exhibit, which may mean an interim exhibit before we get to an permanent exhibit, and we also would like to respect how that exhibit will meld with the countryside intent of Central Park.
That's our focus question to help us in reaching some sort of conclusions or consensus about things so looking at an exhibit in Central, Park I'm, going to be a public art exhibit and any art exhibit is a place.
You know a very broken criminal justice, system, I think in this moment it's especially important to consider how the treatment of black and Latin X Americans, how they're treated on the on our streets and how that often sort of that police violence translates also into wrongful convictions.
Police are allowed to lie during interrogations, right, now, creating just feelings of complete hopelessness and inevitability for people that are being interrogated so we're working together on trying to ban that as a practice by law here in New, York and So I.
And I, just want to echo kind of all the sentiments that Rebecca just laid out about the incredible importance of this effort and of the effort to concretize and build a monument to the types of things that we see happening in our criminal legal system day in and day out and in the incredible miscarriage of justice and the incredible tragedy.
The first thing that comes to mind to me is that you know the criminal legal system that we have right now is one that thing has always failed to give credence to that notion of a presumption of innocence, particularly thinking about people with black and brown skin and, in fact, I think.
What happened to the exonerated vibe and what's happening with respect to criminal legal system and thinking about race, is that it helps people understand and confront the fact that we live in a country that was go on.
We see happening even those people who are who are arrested and convicted and sense for things that they actually may have done, where we have a system that punish that people bar guevara for far too long confuses vengeance with justice, confuses retribution and anger and rage with the need to actually help people move forward and advance in their lives, All. Those are forces that have really helped to shape the nation that we live in today and as part of its reflecting reflected by all the outrage and anger you see in the streets, and you know where we're on the zoom culprit, because we're in the midst of a global pandemic.
Because of all these other things that we have failed to invest in our communities: health, education, employment, housing, all the types of things that we know that people need in order to avoid any interaction with the criminal ecosystem, but also to live, productive, happy and healthy, lives.
One and sort of next to that is sort of an opportunity, I think at this very monument or exhibit to kind of reimagine a criminal justice system, and what that might look like- On sort of a lot of these themes- right sort of all of the kind of unaddressed, social ills that we do not want to kind of deal with in our society that end up being kind of thrown into a criminal justice system.
I think that what we're trying to do is not only shrink the footprint of law, enforcement of police and prosecutors in people's lives, eliminate the need for prisons and jails, and you know, stop putting people in cages as though they're animals trying to figure out like what are the needs that people have or to ensure that they're going to build amid the type of lives that we all drive for Describe.
It's much easier for us to lock someone away for decades on end, then, to try and intervene at some point early on in their life, invest in their community, invest in the types of things that we know that they might need it's much easier to say.
Think one of the key points was really sort of the idea of communities also driving the kind of society that they want to live in, and you know, as somebody who does criminal justice policy.
Know, ensnare entire communities, It's just a wonderful theme, I, think too, of kind of bringing the community in to determine the kind of reimagine criminal justice system and world that they want to live.
So The story of the village revealed itself around the time that the African burial ground was revealed in lower Manhattan and it seemed like suddenly the story of the early African presence in New York was being revealed all over the city and so through a lot of research work that was inspired by the historical documentation and reveal by Roy Rosensweig and see Blackmar, who wrote the book the park and the people within that book.
There is a section on the story of Seneca village and at that time they were using all kinds of repositories throughout the city, including the New York Historical Society, and at that time I was an education curator and a colleague of mine, Grady, Turner and I, and other members of the Historical Society Decided that it would be very useful for people to you tell the learn about Seneca village through an exhibition, and so as we hope that story.
That was on display at the New York Historical, Society long story short and moving forward after many years of working with community to sort of guide us as to how we might establish and develop more of a relationship with the New York City Parks, Department, Parks and Recreation, as well as the Central Park Conservancy, that we might be able to approach them to offer up research design and an effort.
We were trying to make sure that we were hitting the right levels where the community would have lived if that were at all possible, and so through a lot of mapping through a lot of geophysics, we were able to determine that we had identified locations that were likely to produce artifacts of the village, and so we had faced a few more obstacles, Both, The fumer requirements by the powers that be the city powers- that- be, but eventually as partners, because we brought them in along the way to keep them aware of what was going on and by bringing in members of the greater community.
And, there's still a lot of work to do in terms of sort of telling stories about the people that lived in Seneca, Village, because, prior to our exploration and our continued research.
It's going to be a wonderful moment for our city Right now, and we're going to go ahead into the breakout group so that we can put our heads together and come up with some of some ideas around the message to be conveyed, the medium of art that might be used, the exhibit design, Then we have another group for just to take a look at the Seneca village project and what that entail.
If you could just do the same thing in your group, which would be exhibit design and then we're going to have a fourth group for the Seneca village, One of the important things for us is a piece that speaks to the changes within our community and how we can make African American people as humane as possible, because you know part of these issues that relate to justice.
And when we looked at these types of exhibits and see what we can get out of, because one of the things we do want is for people to walk away with a lasting impression, a lasting experience of whatever it is, whatever the final product is, and an example of that lasting expert expression to me is a street for Should I, say out a street out exhibit in Birmingham, Alabama and That.
It goes through the gamut and you can humanize the family members that are in this type of situation, because as black people I do feel that we are a dehumanized group and it helps people to think that different types of things can happen to us and be done to us, because that's who we are- We are more than that and the exhibit should express itself in a way that says these people and this community are more than that.
You, know through example, because I think that's one of the things that speaks to the reality of what Dr. Angela Davis said when she said we, as a people, have historical amnesia You know it's like the education of the Negro biology, Woodson.
There is absence of african- american education in the curriculum and the life experience of black people has been one of criminal justice and prosecution that has consistently in different forms.
Educational, and how do we prevent these things from happening and explain that you know that's something that we're going to work on once we get the basics in place and Mr. Gilbert was adamant along with Youssef sister.
We talked about how important it is, have a support system in place for anyone listening car serrated, because not all had not all of the exonerated five had the family support and unity to help them through this trauma, because it was a traumatic experience And I think we agree with all of these things outline around what the design should look like, but at Imola also had some concerns around what would be the timeline?
So I think that if we have something like that, I want to really know about the permanency of it and the way that we can show that the community is actually what I Donna you're on mute Donna if you're still there.
Here, Harlem for the purposes of just all this stuff, So next door is ever going to have another meeting next Thursday, okay, great back to back Diverse group together, and why that's so important to speak to what a scent I'm, not looking at your last thing so far me for using your first name.
