Have you know six, seven, eight people in a two- bedroom apartment, social distancing, is very difficult when you have a small footprint and more people, and so that is something that working with the mayor's office.
I do not know how much you deal with Stacey Lynch in the mayor's office, but she's been doing a really good job of helping to make sure that Harlem has the right access in the mayor's office to work that issue, so In that conversation, trying to do two things, one increase the amount of spacing to be those who are Cove and impacted in NYCHA, and also making sure that folks, who are asymptomatic, get into hotels.
Is there anything that your office, or is there collaboration with all the other ele elected officials, about the how many people in our community are getting the work catching it in comparison to the other to the other communities, and many proportion is a real disproportionate number in our communities, and this like?
I got some recent information saying that we 30-something folks in Central, Harlem I, do not know how to value a We're not getting official data from the state of the city.
Think black and brown folks tend to be essential workers at a wave, higher clip and then to anyone else, so we're out more to particularly look at Nitra, where there's a lot of concern about the spread public housing where you have where it's hard to socially distance right.
So I just really wanted to be attentive to your time and that particular message relating to housing that you know the work that is happening up in the Senate and the assembly.
What we have been working on in this in the and the state, I'm- Probably part of a working group, house, The work group that has been focusing on this is trying to come up with some rules of the road for when we get to that point, and so it's get to the point where evictions are then permitted, and some of the things we were looking at is trying to define what a Copa 19 hardship Once income previous income present income, how they've been impacted, you know, medical, bills, etc.
One of the things that many of us are concerned about is that this somehow can become a period where you know if you're an owner of an HDFC unit or what have you can get caught up in tax lien issues and We do not want that to happen, and so we want to make sure that any moratoriums include thoughts around tax, foreclosure, sale of tax liens and all that to protect homeownership, which is which does not get as much attention as rent rental units do, but is not a very important part of the Harlem story.
If anything, New, York State has been historically bailing out the rest of the country and given the crisis as impact in New, York City, particularly so harshly I, do not think it's unreasonable to ask for the federal government to be there to assist with any with emergency rental assistance for those who have been impacted by this crisis, and so I just wanted to kind of lay that out there I'm happy to answer any questions or receive any thoughts or inputs that we should consider.
And, then I'd like to hear from either Donald and Kenny as to what you guys have been experiencing, especially you Donald from West Harlem group assistance organization, in terms of the struggles of when tenants are not painting rent there?
That domino as to what happens with you, know, landlords, were trying to maintain these affordable housing projects on race, ATS and budgets, and they're really wholly dependent.
You know that rental income for their operating expenses and to pay their bills that have not stopped coming We run the risk of causing having a lot of unintended consequences in our community.
The people were getting help with those who have been directly impacted, and you know thinking about issues making sure that we look at property taxes, and if there are developments that have a lot of impacted tenants, we should try to smooth out some of their expenses, at least as it relates to Especially.
We put out a survey about a month ago, because one of our projects on Randolph houses was experienced in a lot of Co19 related issue as it relates to the virus and people passing away, and we wanted to look to see if it was.
A week and a half ago we had like 45 legislators, sided calling on the mayor and the police commissioner to take the NYPD out of social distancing and use the Cure violence and faith- Based groups in the community, who are already doing a lot of that working and have trust in the community.
You know we're going to work something out with them when they get back to business when they open back up , Three was senior citizen, yes We sent out a survey also, but our survey just really went out towards the end of last month, so we have not received a lot of data back yet, but basically we asked the same questions.
So I know that we've been having greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce and greater Harlem housing development have been having conversations with the with HPD on those section, 8 vouchers- We also have been talking about with you, know, with representatives from the federal government that conversation with a former HPD Commissioner Shaun Donovan who's, now working back in the city, and he says that in Kerr's, 2.1 shelter, solution, grants, you know for our residents, so I would hope.
But you know we look forward to getting to a point where we can work with the tenants.
One one- on- one and like I, said: If there are resources you know, I've, been on a lot of zoom calls with various officials looking and hoping that there's going to be some support from the federal government residents and as soon as that, happens, you know, I would love to be the connect to my residence.
You know a congressional delegation hard to try to get bring that money home in form of some kind of koban, 19 rental voucher, to sort of help, people who have been impacted so that so that people can pay their rent and on all their other bills, that they have.
I think that, listening to the news and a lot of things are coming from Washington DC as to how the city, not necessarily in your city but throughout the United States, they will be help from Washington DC, so I assume that the congressman it's but yes, office.
What I answer a better answer than the one I just gave Charles, but it's something that I think is important Adequate air conditioning- And. This is this is this: Is you know we're going to have a lot of activity on the street, so I want to make sure that we have a adequate air but then also adequate screen exposure for people, which includes open streets, more of the streets of town, hello, Yo I, can speak to some of the open, streets.
Housing, I also do senior issues and food insecurities one of the things that we have coming up next week on the 28th in the evening at 6, o'clock, we're doing a legal clinic, a housing legal clinic with legal services, organizations that includes Legal, Aid, Society, Take group, justice, legal services, New, York and mobilization for justice, and we will be giving information and even one- on- one questions from tenants and we're going to do breakout rooms on zoom' for tenants who are Nyjah, rent, regulated, Mitchell, Lama and HUD.
The bill passed the house where they're trying to work with the bill in the Senate, and there has been money for like rental arrears, to support the landlords, because the whole dynamic which everyone's been discussing is, if tenants, do not pay, how do the landlords, whether they're, small or large, manage their own finances and paying their mortgage and their taxes so part of the cares.
So, that's a positive thing, which means they should be able to put some of those funds towards to commercial rents, which is important for landlords who have commercial, tenants.
Think that, because of the way that we are because we are in Central Harlem, mostly renters, But HDFC's with you know, I'm, not saying that it's not for not to give money to landlords.
So I'm wondering what's going to happen to these tenants, even though I mean myself being a landlord However, I think that our community is made up of more people that are tenants, renters more so than homeowners.
So I'm, going to chanel Washington, who has a question as a hand raised I, would first I would like to speak to Michelle There's a bill going through the house, that's speaking to this, that and the other, but there's no specification as to the number The name of this bill so that we can be able to say when we are advocating, or we are going into the community, that we have something specific, that we can say that people need to support and need to call and bang on the phones to their representatives to support.
If we're going to provide exemptions for people to come in our communities and develop right, because we want to see better, you know buildings or communities or whatever, then that means that someone has to pay the bills, and this coronavirus is going to be a heck of a bill which is probably why they owe now back to parking side parking.
I'm, a novice I, the real estate industry, but I'm just wondering what specific legislation place to protect: Not, for- profits with these large, affordable housing profiles portfolios in our community from succumbing to unscrupulous landlords, a landlord takeover post, Kovac, 19 quarantine- And this is as rents, become due at the end of the quarantine period, which are accumulative and people will struggle to try to pay and may not be able to and could cause financial hardship for these not properly.
So I want to say that we have to acknowledge the basics of this all right that when she, when we speak of allocating funding or allocating monies from the federal level or state level that we're talking about allocating monies that was raised from tax pain, so we need to look at who's actually paying taxes.
We need to take a position as this committee I'm talking to the committee members in terms of where we are going to take a position for our community and understanding that some of us may be developers or some people Some are real estate professionals and all of that, but we have to deal with the facts of our district and that the chairman has already stated that we're carrying a predominantly rent to district.
If we're going to advocate around this congressional bill, what we need to do is make sure that there are protections in terms of language that ensures that the money is applied to arrears for to people who are paying rent.
Know, pay the rent if they get behind and when we support that 1:1, 100%, And I think their community board should be talking to HPD to see what HPD is going to do because they're looking at taking CDBG funds to do rental assistance and sort of help out on that end.
I appreciate all the stop gaps that have been mentioned to try to protect the not, for- profits and for affordable housing is what I'm saying, but I just want to say that these are unprecedented times long term, and you know we need to really look down the road to see what the implications are and what the impact can.
Yes, I've been raising this almost every day, whatever meeting I'm going, because the mayor has formed a task force on task force on race and A lot of money, is, though, is allotted for that task force and the first lady chirlane McCray will be heading up the task force, but we heard about it two weeks ago, And I have not really been able to track any information as to what is happening with it, because if there's a task force on race, very specifically, community 410 and many other Harlem community members should be at the table because there's a race issue- And, it's all over the news that what's happening with the black and brown people.
You know the have read It's a struggle for a lot of people to they are paying more than half their income already And, of course, people try to pay rent because they do not think nobody wants to be homeless, particularly right, now, and even though they're sure that no victims will happen they're still concerned about when that order is lifted and what's going to happen at that point, if you do not pay the rent as a unity, Community Board community leaders, we really have to work hard to get a handle on rent the rate of rent as it is without coded or not read.
You know, HPD can be any number of characters, Enver senior team, and if they could actually get all of the different elements of housing in the same room that is developers, landlords tenants, there might be an opportunity for us to understand all of our different needs and they've been doing these forums in other districts.
You know committee meeting you know next week and that girl sister Nels point we're going to have all of our representative Shana Nina Michelle But please this will make sure that our district office gets that information and is then for able to share it to the entire board.
I do not think our perspective represented and also can you know the community wants to be a part of that conversation.
