We want to make sure that is that is in the conversation as well We don't want to support the states and we don't want to bail them out and all these other things , it's important to note that New York State provides every year 30 plus billion dollars more than New York State gets back If anything, New York State has been historically bailing out the rest of the country and given the crisis as impact in New, York City, particularly so harshly I, don't think it's unreasonable to ask for the federal government to be there to assist with any with emergency rental assistance for those who have been impacted by this crisis, and so I just wanted to kind of lay that out there I'm happy to answer any questions or receive any thoughts or inputs that we should consider.
That domino as to what happens with you know, landlords were trying to maintain these affordable housing projects on race, ATS and budgets, and they're really wholly dependent on You know that rental income for their operating expenses and to pay their bills that haven't stopped coming We run the risk of causing having a lot of unintended consequences in our community If and if we create a situation, that's untenable for them, then they will end up being taken over by vulture landlords and the like, and so that's an important part of the conversation which is Why is one of the big reasons why we believe that was important to define copan 1900?
The people were getting help with those who have been directly impacted, and you know thinking about issues like you know, making sure that we look at property taxes, and if there are developments that have a lot of impacted tenants, we should try to smooth out some of their expenses at least as it relates to especially they have to give to the city in terms of property, taxes, utilities and others so that they can sort of maintain and manage I see them on the phone higher from our community and they We've got to make sure that there's a balance here and that we protect the renter and the responsible landlord at the same time What do senator just reported on Everybody, especially you Stanley good, to see you brother and senator for coming on and everything that you do for the community so for West , Harlem We put out a survey about a month ago, because one of our projects on Randolph houses was experienced in a lot of co19 related issue, as it relates to the virus and people passing away, and we wanted to look to see if it was What is sick.
Most of these, my properties are affordable and like I said, if there are resources, you know I've been on a lot of zoom calls with various officials looking and hoping that there's gonna be some support from the federal government residents and as soon as that happens, you know, I would love to be the connect to my residence.
I know the governor's finding are You, know a congressional delegation hard to try to get bring that money home in form of some kind of koban, 19 rental voucher, to sort of help, people who have been impacted so that so that people can pay their rent and on all their other bills that they have, and so that's a part of what we've been pushing for as well.
What I answer a better answer than the one I just gave Charles, but it's something that I think is important, and we- you know we're going to have a lot of activity on the street, so I want to make sure that we have a adequate air but then also adequate screen exposure for people, which includes open streets, more of the streets of town, hello, yo I can speak to some of the open streets.
Housing I also do senior issues and food insecurities one of the things that we have coming up next week on the 28th in the evening at 6 o'clock, we're doing a legal clinic, a housing legal clinic with legal services, organizations that includes Legal, Aid, Society, take group justice, legal services, New York and mobilization for justice, and we will be giving information and even one-on-one questions from tenants and we're going to do breakout rooms on zoom' for tenants who are Nyjah, rent, regulated, mitchell-lama and HUD If you can I'll send some information to strategic an send the information on to your contacts, it's gonna, be a very important conversation.
The bill passed the house where they're trying to work with the bill in the Senate, and there has been money for like rental arrears, to support the landlords, because the whole dynamic which everyone's been discussing is, if tenants, don't pay How do the landlords, whether they're, small or large, manage their own finances and paying their mortgage and their taxes.
So part of the cares, act and Sorry whereby landlords would get the support for back rental arrears, so that should not So, for example, and there's also more money, like almost ten billion being put aside for more PPP, which is important for the small businesses and I just want to report out that more small businesses in the district have been receiving funding.
There was a technical problem Wardell earlier on that we saw with the actual link, but if you go ad and the participant ID, which is on the agenda, that's how a lot of people were able to join So I'm, going to chanel Washington, who has a question as a hand raised I, would first I would like to speak to Michelle just said that we have to keep our advocacy yet in order for us to keep our advocacy up right.
If we're going to provide exemptions for people to come in our communities and develop right, because we want to see better, you know buildings or communities or whatever.
If I do not mind sending it out to people on an individual level, so that everybody has you like to update it legislative report, so I can do that for their office, Thank, You, Michelle So we've got to really push this with the HDFC's and with the affordable housing situations That's going on as well keeping in mind really and the homelessness issue and all of those issues, but quite frankly, we'll all be in a very poor situation.
Yes I wanted to ask a question of the elected officials, and this is kind of along the same lines: I'm, a novice I, the real estate industry, but I'm just wondering what specific legislation place to protect not-for-profits with these large, affordable housing profiles portfolios in our community from succumbing to unscrupulous landlords, a landlord takeover post, Kovac, 19 quarantine, and this is as rents, become due at the end of the quarantine period, which are accumulative and people will struggle to try to pay and may not be able to and could cause financial hardship for these not properly I do see that we have representative from Brian Benjamin's office who joined as Brian left , We started this meeting talking about NYCHA and certainly even senator Benjamin indicated.
These people are not so we're not getting any money from them, but we are voting to allocate the funding to them So. We need to take a position as this committee I'm talking to the committee members in terms of where we are going to take a position for our community and understanding that some of us may be developers or some people may be landowners.
We are calling for canceled, rent or lower the rent or something and people may be upset that we love them and we need to decide as this for this Committee on housing in the middle of a historically black district What position, are we going to take as a community board after hearing from these elected officials and these community organizations?
I think we should get a report from the elected officials first, so we can see what's on the table, so we're not reinventing wheels and wasting time, and at that point then we can decide if we need to create something else, and it's not a matter of us supporting what's already in the pipeline What I have been working on is a forum, a housing forum, legal with Gregory baguette we've been working on a forum, it's going to be on June 16, really I have been working on this forum and certainly information to Donna that you can share with you and the executive committee moving forward, and so I was wondering if the PPP loan or the PPP grant, is it In other words: do they get the money by justifying operating expenses?
So I, wouldn't you know, I, wouldn't expect Congress to actually create a program that paid tenants because there's no actual guarantee that the money would go where it's supposed to go and that could lead to problems What we need to do is make sure that there are protections in terms of language that ensures that the money is applied to arrears for to people who are paying rent That's, where I think our focus should be particularly with the congressional bill and as well as with the Kavanaugh bill in the Senate Raphael There was a comment made by Karen earlier in our conversation regard to having slumlords coming into the community.
There's also a one-shot deal that we go after potatoes to get subsidies from Kappa charities and other organizations like that to do a one-shot deal, there's also the executive order that the governor put out for forum security deposits that tenants can use their security deposits in order to you know, pay the rent if they get behind and when we support that 1:1, 100% and I think their community board should be talking to HPD to see what HPD is going to do because they're looking at taking CDBG funds to do rental assistance and sort of help out.
To the point, the point that Gregory was talking about You know the agencies itself have plans in order to try to you know, because they don't want these, though there's a no income, billions of fail and they got a lot of you know Investment in them, so I think there's a avenue that you'll need to look at and Charles I appreciate all the stop gaps that have been mentioned to try to protect the not-for-profits and for affordable housing.
and I Think I'm, one I'm, not sure You know the have read It's a struggle for a lot of people to they are paying more than half their income already and, of course, people try to pay rent because they don't think nobody wants to be homeless, particularly right now, and even though they're sure that no victims will happen they're still concerned about when that order is lifted.
