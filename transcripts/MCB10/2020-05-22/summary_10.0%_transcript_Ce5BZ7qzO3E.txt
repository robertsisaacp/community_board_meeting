I. Don't know how much you deal with Stacey Lynch in the mayor's office, but she's been doing a really good job of helping to make sure that Harlem has the right access in the mayor's office to work that issue, so In that conversation, trying to do two things, one increase the amount of spacing to be those who are Cove and impacted in NYCHA, and also making sure that folks, who are asymptomatic, get into hotels.
Think black and brown folks tend to be essential workers at a wave, higher clip and then to anyone else, so we're out more to particularly look at Nitra, where there's a lot of concern about the spread public housing where you have where it's hard to socially distance right.
So I just really wanted to be attentive to your time and that particular message relating to housing that you know the work that is happening up in the Senate and the assembly, and so why?
Don't think it's unreasonable to ask for the federal government to be there to assist with any with emergency rental assistance for those who have been impacted by this crisis, and so I just wanted to kind of lay that out there I'm happy to answer any questions or receive any thoughts or inputs that we should consider.
You know that rental income for their operating expenses and to pay their bills that haven't stopped coming And I, think there's we run the risk of causing having a lot of unintended consequences in our community.
The people were getting help with those who have been directly impacted, and you know thinking about issues like you, know, making sure that we look at property taxes, and if there are developments that have a lot of impacted tenants, we should try to smooth out some of their expenses at least as it relates to Especially they have to give to the city in terms of property, taxes, utilities and others so that they can sort of, maintain and manage, I see them on the phone higher from our community and they We've got to make sure that there's a balance here and that we protect the renter and the responsible landlord at the same time What do senator just reported on Everybody, especially you Stanley, good, to see you brother and senator for coming on and everything that you do for the community so for West, Harlem.
We put out a survey about a month ago, because one of our projects on Randolph houses was experienced in a lot of co19 related issue, as it relates to the virus and people passing away, and we wanted to look to see if it was.
Few electeds mentioned that cure violence will be one of the directions to go in terms of social distancing within nature, and you know certain communities is that the direction that they're going and is that?
If, that's going to happen, not want that to happen, but - things that they're working with the various of pure violence groups on a on a Memorandum of Understanding, okay, We only have one site: So I, don't know if that's a conversation to expand street-corner resources or how that work.
A week and a half ago we had like 45 legislators, sided calling on the mayor and the police commissioner to take the NYPD out of social distancing and use the Cure violence and faith-based groups in the community, who are already doing a lot of that working and have trust in the community.
You know we're gonna work, something out with them when they get back to business, When they open back up, Three was senior citizen, yes We sent out a survey also, but our survey just really went out towards the end of last month, so we haven't received a lot of data back yet, but basically we asked the same questions.
We also have been talking about with you, know, with representatives from the federal government that conversation with a former HPD Commissioner Shaun Donovan who's, now working back in the city, and he says that in Kerr's, 2.1, shelter, solution, grants, you know for our residents, so I would hope.
You should assure aware of the decommissioned prison on one hundred and tenth This year, God willing, right now, all of our small business resources in terms of working with small businesses, are now remote through WebEx and zoom, and that's how we're getting out the information about the available resources that the small business community can tap in to do right, now, The, one that is actually in operation, is the stuff coming through the SBA or the feds from the PPP to also the disaster loan, a program, those that right now are the only two things that are available through small business, assistance.
So, but you know we look forward to getting to a point where we can work with the tenants one one-on-one And, like I said: If there are resources, you know, I've, been on a lot of zoom calls with various officials looking and hoping that there's gonna be some support from the federal government residents and as soon as that, happens , you know, I would love to be the connect to my residence.
You know a congressional delegation hard to try to get bring that money home in form of some kind of koban, 19 rental voucher, to sort of help, people who have been impacted so that so that people can pay their rent and on all their other bills, that they have, and so that's a part of what we've been pushing for as well.
Can, you just chime in on what the congressman has been working on You know also for the relief that we need for landlords who many of them are those small business owners as well, especially not-for-profits, Michelle.
I think that, listening to the news and a lot of things are coming from Washington DC as to how the city, not necessarily in your city but throughout the United States, they will be help from Washington DC, so I assume that the congressman it's but yes, office.
What I answer a better answer than the one I just gave Charles, but it's something that I think is important and we This is this: Is you know we're going to have a lot of activity on the street, so I want to make sure that we have a adequate air but then also adequate screen exposure for people, which includes open streets, more of the streets of town, hello, yo, I , can speak to some of the open, streets.
Housing, I also do senior issues and food insecurities one of the things that we have coming up next week on the 28th in the evening at 6, o'clock, we're doing a legal clinic, a housing legal clinic with legal services, organizations that includes Legal, Aid, Society, Take group, justice, legal services, New, York and mobilization for justice, and we will be giving information and even one-on-one questions from tenants and we're going to do breakout rooms on zoom' for tenants who are Nyjah, rent, regulated, mitchell-lama and HUD.
The bill passed the house where they're trying to work with the bill in the Senate, and there has been money for like rental arrears, to support the landlords, because the whole dynamic which everyone's been discussing is.
Would first I would like to speak to Michelle The name of this bill, so that we can be able to say when we are advocating, or we are going into the community, that we have something specific, that we can say that people need to support and need to call and bang on the phones to their representatives to support.
If we're going to provide exemptions for people to come in our communities and develop right, because we want to see better, you know buildings or communities or whatever, then that means that someone has to pay the bills, and this coronavirus is going to be a heck of a bill which is probably why they owe now back to parking side parking.
It's not enough being said about landlords, and so I really just wanted to thank Michelle for coming on and really talking about this act and talking about the fact that how this could be an issue, as we all know, for the landlords.
I'm, a novice I, the real estate industry, but I'm just wondering what specific legislation place to protect not-for-profits with these large, affordable housing profiles portfolios in our community from succumbing to unscrupulous landlords, a landlord takeover post, Kovac, 19 quarantine, and this is as rents, become due at the end of the quarantine period, which are accumulative and people will struggle to try to pay and may not be able to and could cause financial hardship for these not properly.
So I want to say that we have to acknowledge the basics of this, all right that when she, when we speak of allocating funding or allocating monies from the federal level or state level that we're talking about allocating monies that was raised from tax pain, so we need to look at who's actually paying taxes.
We need to take a position as this committee I'm talking to the committee members in terms of where we are going to take a position for our community and understanding that some of us may be developers or some people We presenting a resolution or coming up with a resolution that we're then going to pipeline to through these elected officials, saying hey?
If we're going to advocate around this congressional bill, what we need to do is make sure that there are protections in terms of language that ensures that the money is applied to arrears for to people who are paying rent.
These two people that are represented in this job I really make an effort to maintain affordability in our district And we're working with HPD right now and get section 8 vouchers and by July 1 they'll get some new vouchers.
There's also a one-shot deal that we go after potatoes to get subsidies from Kappa charities and other organizations like that to do a one-shot, deal, there's also the executive order that the governor put out for forum security deposits that tenants can use their security deposits in order to you, know, pay the rent if they get behind and when we support that 1:1, 100%, And I think their community board should be talking to HPD to see what HPD is going to do because they're looking at taking CDBG funds to do rental assistance and sort of help out on that end, to the point.
, You know the have read It's a struggle for a lot of people to they are paying more than half their income.
Already And, of course, people try to pay rent because they don't think nobody wants to be homeless, particularly right, now, and even though they're sure that no victims will happen they're still concerned about when that order is lifted.
I heard what you were saying about echo Deb, you know, but please this will make sure that our district office gets that information and is then for able to share it to the entire board.
I, don't think our perspective represented and also can you know the community wants to be a part of that conversation?
