We, have one complaint from the a nursing home,: that's on frederick douglass, between 117th and 118th, the wyatt t, walker, nursing center, and they were complaining that they were not gonna, find the street closure They didn't have access for the emergency vehicles and accessories to pick up the seniors and the at the director of their program reached out to me.
So, then I reached out to D.O.T, as well as the mayor's office, who then contacted frederick douglass, boulevard, association or alliance, and then john lynch got in contact with me, and he assured us that they would keep it open at on 117th and 118th, and then D.O.T sent me an email They also confirmed that the street won't be blocked.
So, a lot of folks, I heard from a couple of people that they were trying to get access to rides down.
And they're, not even open like it may be two days out the week And they got this big black platform taking up two spaces, and you hardly ever see anybody populating this restaurant.
Okay did anyone else have anything to say about the open streets, one at 151st 155th area and then also frederick douglass.
I'll first tell the community to make sure that they're available to come the transportation committee Does anyone have anything else about open, streets?
You know, I guess, a little bit more pleasant to see than the yellow caution tape, because it makes you feel like something else has happened there instead of just open, streets.
I've visited the open streets on frederick douglass and what I noticed from down like the difference between the ones that we have here than the ones are downtown, because the restaurants are more spread.
There's like spots on the block where there's just open space and then nothing's happening But I, didn't see a lot of traffic.
I know that people are not able to social distance as much because they have opened the entire bus.
She just wanted to know that question for the open streets, program.
And, there's like two or three people on their phone just sitting in the boxed area and the restaurant or the cafe or the deli, whatever it is.
You know, it's better- to keep these things on the main avenue for more space, especially people.
Where are the people gonna go Probably should go in public safety, but the thefts of packages that are being left by ups and the postal service up in this neighborhood, like literally you see guys with black garbage bags in the trees in the park emptying people's boxes.
It is a real issue and I think several people, I know, have things stolen throughout, especially if we don't have doorman.
Some of the people in the neighborhood I know like from the tumblr, have talked about how, since they built this new condominium on seventh ave, adam clayton powell, 150th street, that the water that runs is so rusty.
