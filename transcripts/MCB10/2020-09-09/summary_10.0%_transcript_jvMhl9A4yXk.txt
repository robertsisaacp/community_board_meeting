We, have one complaint from the a nursing home, that's on frederick Douglass, between 117Th and 118th, the Wyatt T Walker Nursing Center, and they were complaining that they were not going to find the street closure They did not have access for the emergency vehicles and accessories to pick up the seniors and the at the director of their program reached out to me.
So there was not a lot of time for people to prepare even coming home from a Friday at work.
So, a lot of folks, I heard from a couple of people that they were trying to get access to rides down.
Some people just wanted more notice in for the from the community, so it was a And I think, as we were, trying to work with FDBA we're trying to tell them that it needs to be more common.
Okay did anyone else have anything to say about the open streets, one at 151St, 155Th, Area and then also frederick Douglass.
You know, I, guess a little bit more pleasant to see than the yellow caution tape because it makes you feel like something else has happened there instead of just open streets.
I said the cars are just running through the tape just going down there and finding parking, and so I feel like I.
I've visited the open streets on Frederick Douglass and what I noticed from down, like the difference between the ones that we have here than the ones are downtown, because the restaurants are more spread.
There's like spots on the block where there's just open space and then nothing's happening And, then there's just sporadic blocks, but I did not see a lot of traffic.
You have to pay again to I know that people are not able to social distance as much because they have opened the entire bus.
She just wanted to know that question for the open streets, program.
And, there's like two or three people on their phone just sitting in the boxed area and the restaurant or the cafe or the deli, whatever it is.
Prime parking real estate up here, but it moves a little too much into the street, and so I was wondering it's better to keep these things on the main avenue for more space, especially people.
Probably should go in public safety, but the thefts of packages that are being left by ups and the postal service up in this neighborhood, like literally you see guys with black garbage bags in the trees in the park emptying people's boxes.
They got some kind of arrangement with the postal people, because it's like so regular that you see these guys up in the back of the park here with garbage bags.
It is a real issue and I think several people, I know, have things stolen throughout, especially if we do not have doorman.
Some of the people in the neighborhood I know like from the tumblr, have talked about how, since they built this new condominium on seventh Ave Adam, Clayton, Powell 150Th Street, that the water that runs is so rusty, I'm, just saying water that runs in the toilet.
