Good evening sicily, hi bob video I'm fine hold on. Let me turn on the camera. I just wanted to say thank you so much shot. She came and met me and it was just a great experience. I'm sorry, it was last minute, but I wanted to say thank you. Oh you're welcome. Okay, I'm glad it worked out. It worked out. Yes, good, okay! Good! Do we have an agenda for this meeting because I didn't see one in my email. I think we only have one person I don't know if juanita was able to get it out. Okay, oh that we had rebel was kind of okay. Well, that was our only I don't know. Shati guanida did I don't know who turned the media. I sent you the email. Last week's san revo was not be able to come tonight. They said that they would be oh later this month. So I didn't know if you wanted to have them present at executive committee or public safety or general board. I don't know, but they weren't. They said they weren't able to make the point. You can't do okay, great okay. So thanks for we could do public safety. I think that is probably. If they can't come, then we would want them to do it at exec committee, because we do want to hear because there's some issues I didn't know you. Okay, I'm sorry shatika want to say thank you as well. I didn't know you won the line. Oh yeah, I'm here you're, welcome, I'm just having issues with this zoom thing. I just send an email to technical support because it's only allowing me to run the program through the browser and when I run it through the browser, I have limited capabilities. So I don't know what happened. I might have to get a new download or something so hopefully they'll be able to fix it tomorrow. Yeah, but you're welcome, miss askins, you know my head. Is I'm all over the place? That's okay. Listen kobe got people, you know we just really in the midst of this and we're only starting to feel the realities of it and you know we just staying safe. So a lot is on everyone's mind. So I completely understand yep yeah. I guess we could talk about the open street system. Maybe that's what I was gonna, that's what I was gonna talk about, see them on friday and then went back again and then I was able to on a couple of people. But I don't need some complaints. Is that correct, chatique yeah? We have one complaint from the a nursing home, that's on frederick douglass, between 117th and 118th, the wyatt t walker nursing center, and they were complaining that they were not gonna, find the street closure and they didn't have access for the emergency vehicles and accessories to pick up the seniors and the at the director of their program reached out to me. So then I reached out to D.O.T, as well as the mayor's office, who then contacted frederick douglass, boulevard, association or alliance, and then john lynch got in contact with me and he assured us that they would keep it open at on 117th and 118th, and then D.O.T sent me an email and they also confirmed that the street won't be blocked nfl with the with the nursing home and and they were happy with that announcement and the nurse. The nurse at homework go ahead. What did you say? Shati? I said that the nursing home was satisfied with the response, because it was like same day. They got the confirmation that they wouldn't be blocked. You know for the ambulance and the accessorize okay, I didn't start since we don't have much to talk about. I want to talk about the open street. It's 6 36 p.m. We want to call the meeting to order, so I don't know if anyone's had a chance to go down there. I recommend that all the community board members go. Look at it so that when we talk at a committee we can have a good consensus of what kind of feels I got to, and I was able to several folks on the street about how they were feeling about what was the notice so some of the businesses if you walked down. I don't know again. If you went there's some that are participating in some that are not them are the frederick douglass boulevard alliance, so some of the businesses that were not alliance were not participating, so we didn't know if they didn't get noticed. There was maybe a little bit of issue with the notice that was given to those businesses that were not exactly affiliated with the alliance, which is something that we asked was it going to be kind of equal for all of the businesses to participate, so they it may have been, but the communication so day one they weren't ready to. So there were some businesses that don't set up, and that means to go out into the street. So that was one of the concerns people walking around trying to find the m10 bus we said, would be a concern before so signs weren't very clear. First of all, they didn't go up until like maybe two days before, so there wasn't a lot of time for people to prepare even coming home from a friday at work. Five o'clock, there's no buses well on a friday, there's no more buses, so they're on Manhattan avenue. So people were confused about that. There was that concern and then the concern about the assessor rides. So a lot of folks, I heard from a couple of people that they were trying to get access to rides down frederick douglas boulevard and, of course they don't work, they're not and they were trying to meet their accessories. So they have corners because the cross streets are open. You can't catch it in the middle of the block. So there's no picture so people were concerned about that. The cars there are cars still parked there. So, even though you're supposed to be car free, there's, car and rightfully so, people want to move their cars, so they have to barrier and then move it back and people are in the street. You don't know if a car is coming in you're in your car to be there, but then a car comes it's even gotten so that some cars are starting are just par because they're looking for a parking space, they see something and they just park. There's not a lot of signage. So I had talked to one of the alliance members about signage and getting the notice out and it seemed like. Oh, it was 50 from the people. I spoke to guys some people really loved it. This is great. Some people just wanted more notice in for the from the community, so it was a it's a it's a divide and I think, as we were, trying to work with fdba we're trying to tell them that it needs to be more common. Let us help you get the word out, prepare people, so I think we will were shocked at it happening so soon and that there was so when I had tossed his board members. I think I was down there with he said. Maybe we can craft a letter to fd just addressing the concerns, just letting people that you know. While we do support them, we want to make sure that the community is able to support as well community supports by anonym. By talking to them being, you know, opened and considerate of their needs. So did anybody down there have anything to say about it? Yeah, sicily, the one we had up here on the coons and 152nd was well populated. Each time no one complained. The children seemed to like it. I was out right out in front of the church, was the primary area, so it went well up here. My question was going to be: will it continue, or was it just those three saturdays that it was open, so I believe we're trying to get it to continue the organizations that hello? Sorry. So I believe that we're trying to see if we can extend it, but the organization is committed just to those three saturdays. So shatty did you hear anything different in the call. I know derek perkinson he's also on brian benjamin's calls. I don't know if he heard anything different about the extension of the play streets. No, I wasn't. I wasn't on that call, so I don't have any I can find out tomorrow, though. Okay, actually, you are absolutely correct in the three extra dates. Yes, okay, so right now do you know derek if there's any talk about extending it into september October or just honestly, we're trying to do that around the weather, we're trying to see how long the weather holds up when the weather starts getting a little cooler. I think that's when we want to. You know bring it to an end. They still need something to do, especially with schools, not opening to the 21st and we're just gonna have a repeat of what we saw in the summer of things just stay like it is so yeah we're looking at to do it longer. That's not that's not set in stone yet. Okay, thank you, barbara. That was a good question. Did anybody have any comments about the restaurant open streets? Did anyone go to the frederick douglass alliance open streets? Well, I can only speak about this area up here, trying to stay close to home and practice. So we have an open, a restaurant. I don't really know the name of it, but they take up two parking spaces. It's a fish, seafood place and they're, not even open like it may be two days out the week and they got this big black platform taking up two spaces, and you hardly ever see anybody populating this restaurant. So the concern was: did anybody before they? You know if it was just about putting out the application? I guess there was no research on how well or if the business was actually doing business or making money, because it was not populated. It's between brad hurst and frederick douglass boulevard on 151st street, and it's very really open. Okay, is that the city island, no yep, I think that's it yep. That might be the name of it: okay, yeah! It was open, sometimes and not open, so yeah, because I went up there to see it and then it was closed. But I heard it was open the other the day before so yeah it is sporadic, so that is kind of hard to guess, but yeah, but as far as you can see, it's closed more than it's open. No, it's closed more than it's open. Okay guy! You got you! Okay! Thank you! Barbara yeah! I'm sorry, there's one more restaurant in this area, north of 145th, that has that application. As captain louie, they seem to be doing very well. A lot of people do the takeout and delivery, which I don't realize. It's too expensive just spoke to the window, but it's doing well and the community likes it. It's good to have something of that statute in our neighborhood and I didn't see any problem with that one either. Okay, that's good to hear I yeah. I was excited that they opened because there's one I think coaster like columbia area. So I'm glad to see that one open here. Okay did anyone else have anything to say about the open streets, one at 151st 155th area and then also frederick douglass. Okay, I see we have mina white on representing assemblyman al taylor's office. Mina. Did you have anything hi? No, I just came to listen. Are you all still having the conversation regarding rebel bikes? No, I believe they're going to come to public safety, shawty you're, going to check and see if they can come to public safety yeah. I ask them to come to either one I'm going to see which one they can come to I'll confirm tomorrow with them. Okay, so mina, once we hear from them I'll first tell the community to make sure that they're available to come the transportation committee and then we'll make sure mina that you hear the updated time. They'll come and speak. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, awesome. Okay, does anyone have anything else about open streets? That's what we were talking about anything else. I do recommend that that we just go out and see if you can, the fdba open streets just to see the setup. So when we do, if we do decide as a committee to write a letter to them that we can all kind of be informed about what we see the barriers if you'll see, if you have any questions about the barriers, the barriers are not the traditional NYPD barriers, so there's just the orange and white barrier and then there's because the barrier doesn't take up the whole space from corner to corner. There's, yellow caution, tape that is like taped from the yellow the engineered white barrier to the lamp hose to the street light. So that's the kind of barriers they have set up when I've seen it done in other neighborhoods. They have the barriers all across you know. So it was not to say that it was more official looking, but it was definitely. You know, I guess, a little bit more pleasant to see than the yellow caution tape, because it makes you feel like something else has happened there instead of just open streets. So that was one of the things we could ask them about if they could get the traditional barriers one because people are just like. I said the cars are just running through the tape just going down there and finding parking, and so I feel like I, it might be a little bit more of a different safety precaution if they had the official barriers. But I do recommend that everyone in a social distance way go and see the fdba open streets. Shutti did you have something? I've visited the open streets on frederick douglass and what I noticed from down like the difference between the ones that we have here than the ones are downtown, because the restaurants are more spread out. There's like spots on the block where there's just open space and then nothing's happening and then there's just sporadic blocks. But I didn't see a lot of traffic that I would have thought that I would have would have seen. So I don't know if that's the good thing or a bad thing, I guess for the restaurants, I guess for them more traffic would be good for them, but then I could see. On the other hand, if a lot of people fled at frederick douglass, where it could be a public safety risk I'm covered if people are not wearing masks or just people starting to hang out and take drinks and alcohol beverages into the street. So I didn't see it as abundant. Maybe you know, as the word gets around people will start turning out more because I don't think it's been advertised. It's just one day they popped up and the streets were closed. So if people have it in their minds that this is a place that they've designated specifically for us to enjoy them, maybe they may go out and you'll start to see those numbers increase. Karen you had a question. Yes, I just wanted to say that I spoke with sheena today, sheena kaufman district manager for parks, and she was saying that it was much it was. It was great this weekend that there wasn't all of the garbage and that sort of thing, and there was some outreach done to the community. So if it comes from the community, I think that's the best route to take rather than having to have enforcement and that sort of thing, but we spoke, we did outreach, as I said, and it was a little better this weekend, oh in the parks in the parks. Yes, because I was over there at 1, 43rd, just walking and there it didn't seem as crowded one, even though there were djs and everything, but it seemed like people were actually picking up their trash when they were leaving. So it wasn't as crazy as before, but yeah. I saw a difference as well and up here as well, usually well as of late. There were a lot of barbecues up near the atrium on in jackie robinson park, but this past holiday yesterday. I noticed that they had parks, department officials parked in trucks where people were not able to barbecue up there. They also put some additional signage up at the northern end near 155th street, on the grass saying that they could not barbecue. So what people chose to do was barbecue at the foot of the stairs going up to the atrium and then just take the food back and forth. So I that was an odd vision, because we already know that there's limited park police, yet they were parked right there, and so no one barbecued up there. They had events, but there was no lit fires. That's good to hear that's good to hear karen. Did you have another question? No, I didn't. I forgot to take my hand down okay. So just one last thing I had talked to jennifer sinanos, who is our D.O.T rep and we talked about the now you have to pay again to you have to start paying to get on the buses. Has anyone seen any issues with that? I know that people are not able to social distance as much because they have opened the entire bus. So some people are having some issues with that because before you would have to stay back away from the driver, but now the entire bus is able to be filled. So I knew people were having issues with that, but before I was going to talk to her about it more does anyone have any issues or have they spotted issues with now that the bus fare is back in place? I haven't seen any issues. I've seen people boarding the bus regularly and I've seen people still taking advantage and boarding the bus in the back. So I see more yeah. They were going through the back before that, but so no one has had any issues with that. Okay. Well, that's good to know she just wanted to know. Had we seen anything heard anything any complaints about social distancing, because we you know we are still trying to do that. So she just wanted to know that question for the open streets program. Are they allowing restaurants in between the avenues to clear out space on the street, for the outdoor dining or is it only supposed to be in maine avenue? Restaurants, like on eighth and seventh or between the streets, is okay too. Yes between the streets is okay. The cross streets is okay, so they're not able to shut down the street but they're able to go into the parking lot. Okay, so like b, squared one of those with a restaurant. What is that like 118th or 119th they're in the road- and I think it's diagonal yeah, also in the parking lot a couple of restaurants in in those streets up by here up by me on 148th and 150th, where I mean I don't see any activity coming out of the restaurants, but they have taken a good chunk of the parking spots and it's already narrow street. So a couple of times I pass by whether it's seven o'clock or one o'clock in the morning and there's like two or three people on their phone just sitting in the boxed area and the restaurant or the cafe or the deli whatever it is. It looks closed. Oh yeah they're supposed to close it at 11 pm all of the restaurants shut down at 11 pm, no matter what sometimes they bring their seating and stuff inside if they can, but a lot of restaurants, don't have the space to do that, so they've been leaving it kind of set up. So the business is open like it's exchanging resources, but there's no awning up top and things have there's one place on 149th. I want to say 149 that has no name on it has nothing, but I noticed that block and that street is very narrow. So it's not really a business function. So I wanted to know if and it's narrow that's my main thing is that the not only does it take up prime parking real estate up here, but it moves a little too much into the street, and so I was wondering, like you know, it's better- to keep these things on the main avenue for more space, especially people double parking. But if it's free game for everybody, then you know it is what it is yeah so you're correct as long as they have put in an application which they didn't as our big fight was there's not much to the application or requirement wise. It doesn't come through us, it's just that they put it down and they want it and then they can get it, but they're supposed to be that their area, their cafe area, is supposed to be cleaned out at 11 p.m, like nobody's supposed to be in there, no loitering. So that's one of the things. So it's not supposed to be like a gathering area. I don't know about that. So yeah after hours after 11 o'clock, it's supposed to be cleared out. Nobody sleeps up here anyway to sleep. I I'm right in front of bradhurst and every friday, saturday and sunday I feel like I'm at you, know a parade and one of my old block parties growing up. I don't mind it it's great and that and all the fire endurance and just racing all day, all night. Oh, my god. It's like a 24 7 part. Even the cops get up there and they have their flood lights on and they sit there talking to people from the speaker and I'm like you can get. I appreciate the social distancing right, but you can get closer okay. Is there anything else yeah? I I'd like to add to that tahani for a long time. This was a very barren area. Once the new buildings came up with that 197a plan that they had, then the neighborhood began to grow, but now that it's sort of full grown I'd like to say because the park was done over so beautifully. Thank you karen that we get more visitors from all over the place and they don't go home again. There's nobody chasing them out the parking test so yeah we live with it before the pandemic. You barely would ever see anybody in the park. Now it's also prime real estate for the birthday parties, the graduations, the hangouts, I'm actually nervous. What's gonna happen in the winter time once we can't do outdoor dining and people can't just be hanging out in the park all day, long yeah, it's like it's like. Where are the people gonna go it's a break for families. We have a. We have a major problem up here with it probably should go in public safety, but the thefts of packages that are being left by ups and the postal service up in this neighborhood, like literally you see guys with black garbage bags in the trees in the park emptying people's boxes. It is, I was beginning to feel like you know, maybe they got some kind of arrangement with the postal people, because it's like so regular that you see these guys up in the back of the park here with garbage bags folding up boxes where they them stole people's packages that were left unattended, but we have a. We have a new way of trying to get around. That ups has connected with some of the major businesses, at least in this area. Here for the dunbar and for my block here 150th street, we can leave our packages at a beauty salon or have them go to the beauty salon, so they're not left unattended. Okay, that works. That works. That's nice and barbara. That's also really good that you bring that because we actually- I just I just had a constituent complaint about that in harlem river houses. So that's actually a big issue that the development as a whole has been dealing with. So I'm waiting to get a response from the superintendent and the housing manager regarding you know when they're actually going to get their intercoms fixed, because when fedex and ups are delivering, they don't have access to those buildings that usps does so that is creating a major issue of theft. Thank you, mina. I mean it's a bad issue because you know a couple of times. My packages were stolen, but thankfully people replaced with my items you're laughing about it. I had my grub up stolen a few times that cracked me up. I don't know why, but the guy couldn't get in by the time I went right outside it was gone. I was like well, I hope you enjoyed it, consider it consider it a free one of those meal distributions. I can put that on my resume now: meal distribution through grubhub, terrible yeah, but I'll bring up the issue. Perhaps maybe we can set up some sort of in the interim, because we know nice can take forever, but they can do some sort of partnership with the local business where residents can pick up their packages, so that would be a good mina. That would be great for public safety, because it's happening in my building, I think everybody is experiencing. My water was stolen, my essential water, I'm like that's what I get for buying that expensive water. I should just go ahead and use this good old, tap water, but my essential was stolen. I was upset, so it's a it's an issue. It is a real issue and I think several people I know, have things stolen throughout, especially if we don't have doorman. If we're not so privileged to have dorman, then it just kind of gets left. So that would be a great initiative or something to talk about of how we can. You know stop that you got it. Okay, work on that, yes and I'll, tell charles johnson to add it to public safety agenda for next wednesday, the sixth one today all right I'll pencil it in too. Thank you. Thank you all right. Thank you. Does anyone else have anything else to do with transportation and landmarks. You got to enjoy this because once these jewelers start again, we will be having a lot of landmark stuff coming up. So we can have a short and productive meeting. Then that's a good thing. Definitely some of the people in the neighborhood I know like from the tumblr, have talked about how, since they built this new condominium on seventh ave, adam clayton powell 150th street, that the water that runs is so rusty. Like you know, I'm just saying water that runs in the toilet. You know unless you're using it you go in and you go what the hell. It's all brown. So a lot of people here have chosen to buy bottled water because we're wondering like is there something in the water? And no one told us, you know they just dug up the street and then you see they've, dug it up again and closed it back down. But no one has given us any information, so maybe the department of environmental protection can tell us what's going on because we have no idea. All we know is that you come home and it's stuck taking up fights and we don't know what's going on, it's the water looks like that and they're faucets and the faucets too, like you really got to let your water run before you begin. You know a lot of us get up on the bathroom wash your face, but let that water run a little bit first before you put that water to your face wow. We had issues like that before on lennox avenue, and I spoke with department of environmental protection and they said that the best practices let the water run, but usually when the water is brown, they said they're either testing the water or they're trying to remove rust from the pipes, because the pipes are old, but they said that the water is good and but definitely if you think, there's an issue just put in a 3-1-1 complaint and they'll get flagged and they'll come out and do a test of your tap water in your house if necessary. Thank you. I will do that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, so is there anything else all right? I want to thank you all for coming out and have a discussion on transportation and landmarks. We have a couple of things that we're gonna advance to public safety, so they have two other things to do revel and the packages. I think those are the two things we said. We would raise the public safety all right. So if there's nothing else, is there any old business, the city bikes, they seem to be doing fairly well. In this neighborhood I don't see many of them broken down. A lot of people are using them and they seem to be in just the right spots, at least in my immediate area here over at bradhurst park or mccoombs over on seventh avenue, adam clayton powell boulevard, so no one's complained and everyone seems to be riding them. That's great, that's great is anyone else having to get your city bikes? I just wanted to ask what was it? Is the situation resolved with esplanade as yet? Did you have an update on esplanade? No, I haven't heard from the attorney from the represents them. The last thing I heard he was supposed to be getting a letter from the agency such as fdny NYPD, basically stating that they use that sidewalk for emergency vehicles, and he said he will provide me with the letter. So I don't know if he got the letter or not, but because I haven't heard from him, I assume he has it and that's what jennifer and lyle are are waiting on. Is that letter what they well, they were doing their they. Would I sent them the recommendations that I had from the site visit and they said they would look at it in more detail because they've already done a visit, but they said that they were cons can take it. Take what I sent them into consideration, but they were also waiting for the letter that I guess the guy the admit the lawyer was going to draft from the agencies if he, if he was able to get source or part letter from them, I don't think he's been able to get one as of yet okay. All right. So keep us posted on that. If there's any update thanks. Okay, is that all the old business, any new business, any announcements hearing none? I will entertain a motion to adjourn I'd like to make a motion to adjourn this meeting, and thank you very much. Can I have a second please. Second, thank you has been moving properly seconded all in favor in aye opposed hearing. Now we are adjourned at 7, 07 p.m, the shortest way ever. Thank you. Everyone have a good night good night, I'm going to be.
