, give me one second, so we'll give it five more minutes and whatever I would like to thank everybody for coming to be on the arts and culture first call.
First and foremost, I'd like to thank community board 10 and a community board ken's arts and culture committee through your chairperson.
10 dougie fresh, had a very intimate conversation with stevie, wonder that was again a very special because stevie talked about his his first experience with the apollo theater at 12 years of age and to have that kind of information come out from stevie wonder to connect harlem the apollo theater community board.
Thank, you chairman for, because not only was he generous with coordinating us getting certain artists for harlem week, but he also said our sister community board is community board nine, and perhaps you should have conversations with them and through that relationship we were able to showcase two very fine artists from community board nine so that they could also be a part of what we were doing.
We are solidifying the date in november, but it will be very special and I would like to invite again the arts and culture committee to be a part of that presentation.
And, I know, has been very supportive of harlem week, and so we are just happy to have him lead us and just thankful george to you for all the work you are doing in our community to lift uplift arts and culture here in harlem, mr rivers, that we definitely would love to partner with you on the virtual festival in november.
Regarding, the harlem renaissance, as you know, it's a centennial for the harlem renaissance, which began in 1919 or really officially kicked off in 1920, so they're planning some things I feel like it would be very advantageous for the arts and culture committee to have them come on and discuss.
If there's other things that we can share through the arts and culture committee- So, if anyone's interested in hearing where they are, they we haven't got, they haven't reinstated the community advisory board yet, but they are still looking to do.
I'm thinking a community night out a call for all artists here in harlem, possibly for social distancing, maybe like a block party, something closer to the end of september, early October, due to the weather, still being kind of decent a call and show off all of the different styles of artists that we have here in harlem and actually highlight them and bring awareness.
You know things like that to first start and bring awareness to what we're trying to do within the community to generate partnerships with a lot of different entities here in harlem that want to get involved.
And, then you'll be able to bring back information to the committee, great thanks, cecily and then george.
