, give me one second, so we'll give it five more minutes and whatever I would like to thank everybody for coming to be on the arts and culture first call.
Those are all of my experiences that I'm bringing to the table thanks for joining us, hi, Deborah Okay sure my name is Deborah Gilliard Love, this group, arts and culture, I'm.
Wonder that was again a very special because stevie talked about his his first experience with the apollo theater at 12 years of age and to have that kind of information come out from stevie wonder to connect Harlem the Apollo Theater Community, Board 10 right in your catchment area, I think, is just another testament to the important role that you guys play.
All we are solidifying the date in November, but it will be very special and I would like to invite again the arts and culture committee to be a part of that presentation, to give you more visibility in terms of some of the bigger activities that we're doing.
And, I know, has been very supportive of Harlem week, and so we are just happy to have him lead us And Just thankful George to you for all the work you are doing in our community to lift uplift arts and culture here in Harlem Mr rivers that we definitely would love to partner with you on the virtual festival in November.
So I'm, going to open the floor up , I will I'm taking minutes and I'll be taking notes, but I'd just like us to have a conversation as we try to plan out our calendar for this year and early next year, just to hear directly from folks hi Jericho So I was on a few calls over the summer with Harlem one Yuen Chin Is the executive director of Harlem one stop There is a consortium of arts organizations that have been on the call with her.
Regarding the Harlem renaissance, as you know, it's a centennial for the Harlem renaissance, which began in 1919 or really officially kicked off in 1920, so they're planning some things I feel like it would be very advantageous for the arts and culture committee to have them come on and discuss.
Maybe around black history Month too right when there's something like that roots us into the actual museum, piece.
I'm thinking a community night out a call for all artists here in Harlem, possibly for social distancing, maybe like a block party, something closer to the end of September early October, due to the weather, still being kind of decent a call and show off all of the different styles of artists that we have here in Harlem and actually highlight them and bring awareness.
I think it would help to put art in Harlem back on the map, and you know just make it more accessible to the kids, who do not actually get to see.
You, know things like that to first start and bring awareness to what we're trying to do within the community to generate partnerships with a lot of different entities here in Harlem that want to get involved.
Sorry for my background, because you know: I live in the 40s, where things is crazy, so you're going to hear music It does not have to happen like no time but before June.
Like that, you know I could have a conversation with boza and see if he got any kind of leads on it, but I think it's an amazing idea.
